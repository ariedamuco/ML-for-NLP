In MA, private insurers\\nreceive capitated payments from the government for providing Medicare beneficiaries with health insurance that roughly mimics commercial health insurance for the\\n\\xc2\\xadunder-65 population. Today, almost a third of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled\\nin MA.\\nEmpirical comparisons of MA and TM face two primary challenges. First, differences in health care utilization between patients in MA and TM may partly or\\nentirely reflect differences in the patient mix, rather than a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctreatment effect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of MA\\nper se. Second, historically, data availability has been asymmetric: a\\xc2\\xad dministrative\\n\\xc2\\xadclaim-level data from TM are widely available to researchers, but detailed \\xc2\\xadclaim-level\\ndata from MA insurers have been more elusive. The primary contribution of this\\npaper lies in our analysis of new, c\\xc2\\xad laim-level data from MA insurers. Specifically,\\nwe take advantage of newly available claims data from MA plans in 2010 provided\\nby the Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI). The data consist of claims paid by three\\nMA insurers (Aetna, Humana, and UnitedHealthcare) that cover almost 40 percent\\nof MA enrollees. The key advantage of these data is that they contain \\xc2\\xadclaim-level\\ndata in MA\\xe2\\x80\\x94i.e., health care utilization and payments to providers\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is analogous to the existing and commonly used claims data for TM.\\nA simple tabulation of the MA and TM claims points to a large difference in\\npublic and private health care spending levels. We calculate that MA spending per\\n\\xc2\\xadenrollee-month in 2010 totaled $642, of which $590 was paid by MA insurers and\\nthe rest by enrollees out of pocket. In contrast, average spending per e\\xc2\\xad nrollee-month\\nin TM was $911, of which $771 was paid directly by the Medicare program to providers. Capitated payments to the MA plans roughly track the latter amount; the MA\\nplans in the HCCI data received on average $767 per \\xc2\\xadenrollee-month. In other words,\\nthe revenue of the MA plans we observe is 30 percent higher than the payments they\\nmake for their enrollees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 health care. If this applied to the entire MA population\\nin 2010 (including those outside our sample), it would imply $21 billion in annual\\n(2010) revenue for MA insurers in excess of their spending on health care claims.\\nThe bulk of our analysis compares health care spending and utilization for enrollees in MA and TM. To proxy for what an MA enrollee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s health care experience\\nwould have been like if she were (counterfactually) in TM, we construct a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomparable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d group of TM enrollees. We present results from two main approaches. First,\\nwe adjust for key observables\\xe2\\x80\\x94comparing outcomes for MA and TM enrollees\\nin the same county and with the same risk score. Medicare risk scores are based\\non a predictive model of health care spending that accounts for demographics and\\ndetailed information on prior health conditions. The county and risk score adjustment also captures the spirit in which Medicare sets reimbursement rates for MA\\ninsurers; these are the two dimensions that enter the formula by which capitation\\nrates are computed. Second, we include an additional adjustment for unobserved\\nhealth not captured by the risk score (Brown et al. 2014), which is based on mortality differences between MA and TM enrollees in the same county and with the\\nsame risk score. Without either adjustment, MA spending per e\\xc2\\xad nrollee-month is\\n30 percent lower than TM spending per \\xc2\\xadenrollee-month. Holding county and risk\\nscore fixed, the spending difference becomes 25 percent, and adjusting for mortality\\n\\n\\x0c304\\n\\nAMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS\\x08\\n\\nAPRIL 2019\\n\\ndifferences further reduces it to 9 percent. None of these approaches is a panacea for\\nconcerns about selection; however, taken together they suggest a \\xc2\\xadnontrivial \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctreatment effect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of MA on spending, albeit with some uncertainty as to the magnitude.\\nA key advantage of our detailed c\\xc2\\xad laim-level data is that they allow us to explore\\ndifferences in patterns of spending and health care use for specific populations and\\nfor different types of care. These comparisons are qualitatively similar across our\\nalternative adjustments. They indicate that spending differences are much greater in\\nurban counties (where about t\\xc2\\xad hree-quarters of MA beneficiaries enroll) than in rural\\ncounties and that lower spending in MA is present across the distribution of spending and for different types of care. Differences are smaller for inpatient care, and are\\nparticularly pronounced for care in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs).\\nLower health care spending in MA than in TM primarily reflects lower utilization\\nof services rather than lower payments for the same services. MA insurers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 average\\npayment to hospitals (per admission and per day) is within 1 to 2 percent of the\\nanalogous payment in TM. Comparing payments made to the same hospital for the\\nsame diagnosis (DRG), we find that MA payments are about 1 percent higher than\\nTM payments. Lower utilization in MA appears both for services where there are\\nconcerns about \\xc2\\xadoveruse, such as diagnostic testing and imaging, as well as for services where there are concerns about u\\xc2\\xad nderuse, such as preventive care.\\nWe present suggestive evidence for some potential mechanisms by which MA\\ninsurers may reduce utilization relative to TM. We find several patterns consistent\\nwith restrictions on use of the most expensive types of care and possible substitution\\nto less expensive alternatives. For example, we find higher spending per emergency\\ndepartment visit in MA than in TM, which is consistent with utilization constraints\\nin MA, so that the marginal patient admitted for care is in worse health. We also\\nfind that MA patients, relative to TM patients, are much less likely to be discharged\\nfrom the hospital to \\xc2\\xadpost-acute care and much more likely to be discharged home. In\\naddition, lower rates of physician visits in MA primarily reflect lower visits to specialists, with little or no difference in rates of primary care visits. Finally, i\\xc2\\xadnpatient\\nsurgery rates are similar in MA and TM while outpatient surgery rates are much\\nhigher in MA, which is suggestive of MA insurers substituting from inpatient to\\noutpatient surgery. Such evidence on potential mechanisms reinforces our interpretation that differences in average spending in MA and TM by \\xe2\\x80\\x9csimilar\\xe2\\x80\\x9d enrollees\\nlikely reflect, at least partially, an MA treatment effect. One would need a more subtle selection story, which moves beyond selection into MA on predicted spending,\\nto explain these patterns.\\nFinally, we briefly examine geographic variation in MA and TM. Geographic\\nvariation in TM spending has received a great deal of attention, often interpreted\\nas a sign of regional differences in the efficiency of health care delivery within TM\\n(e.g., Gawande 2009, Skinner 2011). However, we find roughly similar levels of\\n\\xc2\\xadheterogeneity across regions in MA and TM. Geographic variation in health care\\nspending is around 20 percent higher in MA, while geographic variation in hospital\\nprices is about 20 percent lower in MA than in TM.\\nOur findings relate to several literatures. The most directly related are prior comparisons of health care spending in MA and TM. As noted earlier, our key advance\\nis access to detailed claims data for a large share of the MA market. Absent such\\n\\n\\x0cVOL. 11 NO. 2\\x08\\n\\nCURTO ET AL.: HEALTH CARE IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MEDICARE\\n\\n305\\n\\ndata, prior studies have used a variety of approaches to infer health care \\xc2\\xadutilization\\nand spending differences between MA and TM. These include comparing MA\\nplans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (mandatory) self reports of enrollee utilization to utilization measures in\\nTM claims data (Landon et al. 2012), analyzing beneficiaries\\xe2\\x80\\x99 self reports of care\\nreceived in TM and in MA (Ayanian et al. 2013), analyzing hospital discharge\\ndata from New York counties experiencing MA exit (Duggan, Gruber, and Vabson\\n2018), and inferring cost differences from estimates of demand for MA plans and\\na \\xc2\\xadsupply-side model of the market (Curto et al. 2014). These papers have tended to\\nfind lower health care utilization in MA\\xe2\\x80\\x94with estimates ranging from 10 percent\\nto 60 percent.\\nOur finding of similar pricing in MA and TM echoes a recent finding by Baker\\net al. (2016) and contrasts with the conventional wisdom that MA prices will be\\nhigher than TM prices due to the greater bargaining power enjoyed by the larger\\npublic sector (e.g., Philipson et al. 2010). It also differs from prior findings that\\nTM prices are substantially lower than prices in the private, u\\xc2\\xad nder-65 market both\\non the inpatient side (Cooper et al. 2015) and the outpatient side (Clemens and\\nGottlieb 2017). It seems plausible that the lower prices that private insurers pay for\\n\\xc2\\xadover-65 enrollees relative to u\\xc2\\xad nder-65 enrollees is the consequence of regulation that\\nis specific to the o\\xc2\\xad ver-65 population, and requires hospitals to accept TM rates if an\\nalternative payment rate was not negotiated (Berenson et al. 2015).\\nOur findings of similar geographic variation in spending and pricing in MA and\\nTM also contrast with recent findings that geographic variation in spending in commercial (i.e., \\xc2\\xadunder-65) insurance is similar to TM, but stems from much larger\\npricing variation and lower quantity variation in commercial insurance relative to\\nTM (Philipson et al. 2010, Institute of Medicine 2013, and Cooper et al. 2015). This\\ncontrast between TM and commercial insurance has been interpreted as reflecting\\nthe lower powered incentives in the public sector relative to the private sector in constraining utilization, and monopsony power in the public sector to constrain prices\\nrelative to what the private sector can achieve (Philipson et al. 2010). Of course,\\nthere are other reasons why patterns of health care provision for those under 65\\nmay differ from the patterns for the over 65. We consider this same set of facts in\\nthe context of Medicare Advantage, which arguably provides a cleaner comparison\\ngroup to TM for understanding variation under private and public regimes since MA\\nand TM are provided to the same broad population.\\nOur finding that MA appears to reduce both \\xe2\\x80\\x9chigh-value\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9clow-value\\xe2\\x80\\x9d care in\\nsimilar magnitude contributes to what we believe is an emerging, cautionary tale on\\nthe bluntness of policy instruments in the health care sector. Our evidence here speaks\\nto the blunt nature of \\xc2\\xadsupply-side restrictions on care. Likewise, on the demand\\nside, recent evidence suggests that high deductible plans reduce \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xc2\\xadhigh-value\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xc2\\xadlow-value\\xe2\\x80\\x9d care in equal measure (\\xc2\\xadBrot-Goldberg et al. 2017), and that even targeted increases in the price of some types of care can depress care use across the\\nboard, including free preventive care services (Cabral and Cullen 2017).\\nMost broadly, our work is part of the large literature on the relative consequences\\nof public and private ownership. This literature has spanned a range of disparate\\nindustries, including education, pensions, electricity, and transportation. In the specific context of health care, recent empirical work has emphasized that the private\\n\\n\\x0c306\\n\\nAMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS\\x08\\n\\nAPRIL 2019\\n\\nsector may be more efficient than the public sector at setting reimbursement prices\\nfor providers (Clemens, Gottlieb, and Moln\\xc3\\xa1r 2017) and at setting \\xc2\\xadcost sharing to\\ncombat moral hazard (Einav, Finkelstein, and Polyakova 2018).\\nThe rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section I provides some institutional\\n\\xc2\\xadbackground on our setting. Section II describes our data, baseline sample, and summary statistics. Section III describes our approaches for constructing a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomparable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d set of TM enrollees to compare spending in TM and MA. Section IV compares\\nhealth care spending in MA and TM\\xe2\\x80\\x94overall and for various categories of people\\nand spending. Section V examines differences between MA and TM enrollees in\\nhealth care utilization and in health care prices, and examines some potential mechanisms for utilization reductions. The last section concludes.\\nI. Setting and Background\\n\\nThe Medicare Advantage (MA) program allows Medicare beneficiaries to opt\\nout of traditional f\\xc2\\xad ee-for-service Medicare coverage and enroll in private insurance\\nplans. The program was established in the early 1980s with two goals: to expand\\nthe choices available to beneficiaries and to capture cost savings from managed\\ncare. In return for covering enrolled beneficiaries\\xe2\\x80\\x99 health care expenses, private\\nMA plans receive a \\xc2\\xadrisk-adjusted, capitated monthly payment from the Centers for\\nMedicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which is the federal agency that manages\\nthe Medicare program.\\nThere has historically been a tension between the two goals of expanding access\\nto MA and limiting costs (McGuire, Newhouse, and Sinaiko 2011). Insurers have\\ntended to participate more in periods with higher payments, and to offer more plans\\nin areas with higher payments. MA plans also enroll relatively healthier beneficiaries, complicating the problem of setting appropriate capitation rates. Reforms over\\nthe last decade have aimed to address these problems by introducing a risk scoring\\nsystem to adjust plan payments based on enrollee health, and a competitive bidding system that replaced the fixed reimbursement rates used earlier. These changes,\\ncombined with an increase in capitation rates set by CMS, have coincided with the\\nexpansion of plan offerings and enrollment seen in Figure 1. Enrollment in MA\\ntends to be especially high in urban areas; in 2010, MA penetration was 33 percent\\nin urban counties and 18 percent in rural counties.\\nTo participate in MA, insurers must contract with a set of health care providers\\nand offer at least the same insurance benefits as Traditional Medicare (TM), which\\ncovers inpatient (Part A) and outpatient (Part B) health care services. MA plans\\ntypically provide additional benefits as well, in the form of more generous cost\\nsharing or supplemental coverage of dental, vision, or drug benefits. Medicare\\nbeneficiaries observe the MA plan offerings in their county of residence and can\\nchoose to enroll in any of the available MA plans during an annual \\xe2\\x80\\x9copen enrollment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d period every fall. The trade-off they face in choosing between MA and TM\\nis that MA plans typically restrict access to health care providers, but provide\\nadditional benefits as described above. In our data (before applying the sample\\nrestrictions described below), 73 percent of MA enrollees were in HMO or PPO\\nplans with limited provider networks.\\n\\n\\x0cCURTO ET AL.: HEALTH CARE IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MEDICARE\\n\\nVOL. 11 NO. 2\\x08\\n\\n307\\n\\n35%\\n\\nMA share of Medicare enrollees\\n\\n30%\\n\\n25%\\n\\n20%\\n\\n15%\\n\\n10%\\n\\n5%\\n\\n0%\\n1985\\n\\n1990\\n\\n1995\\n\\n2000\\n\\n2005\\n\\n2010\\n\\n2015\\n\\nFigure 1. MA Penetration over Time\\nNotes: The figure shows the share of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans, year by year.\\nAll data are from December of the year indicated.\\nSource: CMS\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Medicare Managed Care Contract Plans Monthly Summary Reports\\n\\nEvery year, plans enter into a bidding process, which dictates the benefits and premium associated with each plan that is offered to beneficiaries. While the precise rules\\nby which plan bids translate to plan premiums and benefits are somewhat complicated,\\nwe summarize the key features here (see Curto et al. 2014 for a more detailed description). Each plan submits a bid \\xe2\\x80\\x8bb\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8a, which should be interpreted as the monthly compensation required by the plan to provide \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstandard\\xe2\\x80\\x9d monthly coverage in the local\\narea in which the plan is offered to an \\xe2\\x80\\x9caverage\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Medicare beneficiary. By \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstandard\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\ncoverage, we refer to the standard Part A and Part B financial coverage offered by TM;\\nMA plans typically offer more comprehensive coverage, but they obtain a separate\\ncompensation for it (known as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9crebate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) on top of their bid \\xe2\\x80\\x8bb\\xe2\\x80\\x8b. As will be clearer\\nlater, by \\xe2\\x80\\x9caverage\\xe2\\x80\\x9d beneficiary we refer to a beneficiary with an average health risk.\\nThis bid b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b \\xe2\\x80\\x8bis then assessed against its local benchmark B\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x8b \\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8a, which is set administratively by CMS. In principle, the benchmark B\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x8b \\xe2\\x80\\x8bis supposed to approximate the\\ncounterfactual cost to CMS from covering an \\xe2\\x80\\x9caverage\\xe2\\x80\\x9d beneficiary in that county\\nthrough TM. In practice, the variation in benchmarks across locations departs somewhat from this principle, presumably reflecting various political economy considerations. On average in our observation period (2010), benchmark rates are higher\\nthan corresponding TM costs, and more so in some areas than in others; subsequent\\nto our time period of analysis, the Affordable Care Act has reduced the level of\\nthese MA benchmark rates. Overall in our data (again, before applying the sample\\nrestrictions described below), the average benchmark across counties (weighted by\\nthe number of Medicare beneficiaries) is $836 per e\\xc2\\xad nrollee-month, compared to an\\naverage TM cost of $798, and this difference is lower in urban counties (benchmark\\n\\n\\x0c308\\n\\nAMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS\\x08\\n\\nAPRIL 2019\\n\\nof $866 and average TM costs of $842) than in rural counties ($770 versus $716).\\nHowever, in our observation period, the vast majority of plan bids are lower than the\\ncorresponding benchmarks, making MA plans financially more generous than TM,\\nwhere enrollees can face large \\xc2\\xadout-of-pocket costs.1\\nCapitation payment to insurers for enrolling a given enrollee in a given MA plan\\ndepends not only on the plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bid b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b \\xe2\\x80\\x8bbut also on the enrollee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s risk score r\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b i\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8a , which is\\nproportional to her predicted health care costs in TM over the next year. Adjusting\\nreimbursement for risk score is a key component of CMS\\xe2\\x80\\x99 attempt to limit selection\\ninto MA by adjusting plan compensation for predictable heterogeneity in health care\\ncost across beneficiaries. CMS assigns a risk score to each Medicare beneficiary\\nbased on demographic information and detailed c\\xc2\\xad laim-based information on chronic\\nhealth conditions measured over the previous 12 months. The average beneficiary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nrisk score is normalized to one, so that plans obtain compensation of \\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8br\\xe2\\x80\\x8bi\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x89 b\\xe2\\x80\\x8bfor covering beneficiary i\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b. For purposes of setting MA plan payments, CMS deflates estimated risk scores for MA enrollees (by 3.41 percent in 2010, which is our sample\\nyear) to reflect CMS\\xe2\\x80\\x99 estimate of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cupcoding\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of risk scores for MA beneficiaries\\n(CMS 2009, Geruso and Layton 2015).\\nThus, broadly speaking, plan compensation is designed to reimburse an MA\\ninsurer for the costs an enrollee would incur\\xe2\\x80\\x94based on her county and risk\\nscore\\xe2\\x80\\x94had she remained in TM. This motivates our baseline approach (described\\nbelow) of comparing enrollees who are in the same county with the same risk score\\nwhen comparing utilization and health care spending in MA and TM.\\nII. Data and Sample Construction\\n\\nA. Data Sources\\nThis paper uses data from two main sources: the Health Care Cost Institute\\n(HCCI) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). All the data\\npertain to spending and enrollment in 2010. Online Appendix A provides more\\ndetails on the data and sample definition; online Appendix B provides more details\\non the definition and construction of the specific health care spending and utilization\\nvariables we analyze.\\nThe HCCI data are the key, novel data in this paper. HCCI is provided with\\nclaim-level data from three large MA insurers\\xe2\\x80\\x94Aetna, Humana, and\\n\\xc2\\xad\\nUnitedHealthcare. HCCI pools these data (masking the individual insurers) and\\nmakes these data available for research. In 2010, these three insurers (hereafter\\nreferred to as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHCCI insurers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) covered almost 40 percent of MA enrollees:\\nUnitedHealthcare was the largest (national market share of 18 percent), Humana was\\nsecond (15 percent), and Aetna fifth (4 percent) (Gold et al. 2010). The \\xc2\\xadclaim-level\\ndata reflect claims that these three insurers paid out to h\\xc2\\xad ealth care providers. The\\n\\n1\\nIf \\xe2\\x80\\x8bb > B\\xe2\\x80\\x8b, the difference is charged as a premium to the consumer. If b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b < B\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8a, which is almost always the case\\nempirically, 75 percent of the difference is given to the consumer through the rebate, and 25 percent is retained\\nby CMS.\\n\\n\\x0cVOL. 11 NO. 2\\x08\\n\\nCURTO ET AL.: HEALTH CARE IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MEDICARE\\n\\n309\\n\\nHCCI data also contain monthly enrollment indicators and some limited enrollee\\ndemographics (age bins, gender, and zip code).\\nThe CMS data serve multiple roles. One role is to provide parallel \\xc2\\xadclaim-level\\ndata for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Traditional Medicare (TM). Because TM\\noffers \\xc2\\xadfee-for service coverage, we essentially observe every health care claim made\\nby TM enrollees during 2010. The TM claims data allow us to form a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbenchmark\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\ncomparison of health care spending and utilization against which we can compare\\nthe measures obtained from HCCI.\\nThe CMS data have a second, equally important role: providing enrollment,\\ndemographic, health, and mortality data for all enrollees (TM and MA). For the\\nuniverse of Medicare enrollees, we can observe monthly enrollment information in\\nTM (Parts A and/or B) or MA, risk score, demographics (zip code, age, and gender), dual eligibility status (in Medicaid and Medicare), detailed health conditions\\nfrom the prior year, and mortality. The detailed CMS data on MA enrollees allow\\nus to validate the completeness of our baseline sample in HCCI, and to adjust our\\ncomparison to TM spending for the differential demographics, health conditions,\\nand mortality among MA enrollees compared to TM enrollees.\\nFinally, the CMS data contain detailed information on payments to MA insurers\\nby CMS. This allows us to construct payments to MA plans per e\\xc2\\xad nrollee-month, as\\nwell as payment components.\\nB. Baseline Sample\\nThe HCCI data include most, but not all, MA enrollees covered by the three HCCI\\ninsurers. Based on the qualitative information that HCCI obtained from the three\\nparticipating insurers, it appears that inclusion in the HCCI data was made on a\\n\\xc2\\xadplan-by-plan basis, with \\xe2\\x80\\x9chighly capitated plans\\xe2\\x80\\x9d left out. That is, insurance plans that\\npay providers on a capitated basis are omitted from the HCCI data. The HCCI data\\nalso indicate that they exclude special needs plans (SNPs), which are MA plans for\\nindividuals with specific diseases (such as \\xc2\\xadend-stage liver disease, chronic heart failure, or \\xc2\\xadHIV-AIDS) or certain characteristics (such as residence in a nursing home).\\nIdeally, we would have plan identifiers in the HCCI data, which would allow us to\\nmatch this information to the plan identifiers in the CMS data, and thus know which\\nMA plans are excluded. This would allow us to adjust for the demographics and\\nhealth conditions of MA enrollees specifically enrolled in HCCI plans. However,\\nwith the exception of SNPs that are not in the HCCI data and can be identified in the\\nCMS enrollment data, plan and insurer identifiers are omitted from the HCCI data.\\nInstead, we rely on the fact that the MA market is localized and the use of provider\\ncapitation is most common in particular regions such as California and construct our\\nbaseline sample by focusing on states where the HCCI data coverage appears to be\\napproximately complete.\\nWe judge the completeness of the HCCI data by comparing enrollment statistics for the HCCI insurers in the HCCI and CMS data. In the CMS data, we know\\nfor each MA enrollee whether he or she was enrolled in an MA plan offered by\\none of the HCCI insurers. This allows us to generate a pseudo HCCI enrollment\\ndataset in the CMS data, which covers all enrollees who \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshould\\xe2\\x80\\x9d have been in the\\n\\n\\x0c310\\n\\nAMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS\\x08\\n\\nAPRIL 2019\\n\\nHCCI data if no plans were omitted. We then compare e\\xc2\\xad nrollee-month counts in\\nthis pseudo HCCI enrollment data and cross validate the actual HCCI data against\\nit. Specifically, we compare \\xc2\\xadenrollee-month counts at the state level across the two\\n\\xc2\\xaddatasets, restricting the analysis to individuals who are 65 and over; we do not\\nrequire individuals to be enrolled for a full year.\\nWe define our baseline sample to be the set of 36 states where we have a close\\nto complete sample of HCCI insurers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 enrollees, which we define to mean that the\\ncount of \\xc2\\xadenrollee-months in HCCI in the state is within 10 percent of the count for\\nthe HCCI insurers in the pseudo HCCI enrollment data. In practice, in these 36\\ncomplete data states, total HCCI enrollment is within 1 percent of total enrollment\\nin the pseudo HCCI enrollment data, leaving us reasonably sanguine that we have\\ncaptured the entire set of MA enrollees for these three insurers. Online Appendix\\nTable A1 provides more details on s\\xc2\\xad tate-by-state \\xc2\\xadenrollee-month counts in the HCCI\\ninsurers as measured in the HCCI and CMS data.\\nThe 36 states in our baseline sample represent about 60 percent of enrollees for the\\nHCCI insurers. As shown in online Appendix Figure A1, the excluded states are disproportionately concentrated in the western United States. Online Appendix Table A1\\nshows the MA share of total Medicare enrollees and the HCCI insurer share of MA\\nenrollees by state, including both the 36 complete data states and the 15 omitted states.\\nTable 1 shows how our baseline sample is constructed, and panel A presents basic\\ndemographic statistics from both the CMS and HCCI data. Throughout the paper,\\nrisk scores for TM enrollees are unadjusted, while risk scores for MA enrollees are\\nadjusted to reflect the 3.41 percent deflation CMS applies in determining MA payments, as described above and in CMS (2009, p. 19).\\nColumns 1 through 3 of Table 1 present CMS data across all plans and states,\\nwhile columns 4 through 6 present CMS data for our baseline sample, which is comprised of the 36 states above and omits enrollees in SNPs. In each case, we present\\nstatistics for all TM enrollees, for all MA enrollees, and then for enrollees covered\\nby the three HCCI insurers. Columns 7 and 8 present statistics for the HCCI data,\\nfor the entire sample in column 7, and for our baseline sample in column 8.\\nWe use Table 1 to make several observations. First, comparing columns 1\\xe2\\x80\\x933 to\\ncolumns 4\\xe2\\x80\\x936, the 36 states that constitute the baseline sample do not seem to be\\nvery different from the overall sample, making us feel reasonably comfortable that\\nthe findings we report throughout the paper are likely to be relevant for states not\\ncovered by our baseline sample. Second, comparing column 2 to 3 or column 5 to 6,\\nit appears that the three HCCI insurers attract enrollees that seem reasonably similar\\nto the overall MA enrollees, suggesting that our subsequent findings may apply to\\nthe broader MA population. Third, as has been documented elsewhere, MA enrollees\\nare slightly younger and significantly healthier than TM enrollees: their risk scores\\n(which are proportional to their predicted health care spending) are about 5\\xc2\\xad \\xe2\\x80\\x9310 percent lower, and their annual mortality rates are almost a third lower. This suggests\\nthat a straight comparison of TM and MA health care spending would be misleading,\\nmotivating the various corrections for selection we describe in the next section.\\nFinally, it is reassuring that, for our baseline sample, the enrollment counts and\\ndemographics (that we can measure in both datasets) are remarkably similar when\\nmeasured in the pseudo HCCI enrollment dataset we construct in the CMS data\\n\\n\\x0cVOL. 11 NO. 2\\x08\\n\\nCURTO ET AL.: HEALTH CARE IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MEDICARE\\n\\n311\\n\\nTable 1\\xe2\\x80\\x94Baseline Sample\\nData source / sample\\n\\nPanel A.

Summary Statistics\\nPanels B and C of Table 1 report summary statistics on total health care spending\\nand CMS payments per enrollee.\\nSpending and Payments in MA.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Our first result is the size of CMS payments\\nto MA insurers in excess of MA insurers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 health care spending on enrollees. We\\ndefine total health care spending as the sum of insurer health care spending and any\\n\\xc2\\xadout-of-pocket spending by the beneficiary. Insurer spending is based on observed\\npayment amounts\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is, transacted prices, not list prices. \\xc2\\xadOut-of-pocket spending\\nis the amount owed by the enrollee (due to deductibles and c\\xc2\\xad oinsurance).3\\nOur measure of health care spending is a n\\xc2\\xad ear-exhaustive measure of all health\\ncare claims. Specifically, it covers several categories of spending: inpatient spending,\\nwhich is associated with providers identified as hospitals and physicians billing for\\ntreatment provided in an inpatient hospital setting; outpatient spending, which also\\nincludes home health care and durable medical equipment (e.g., wheelchair rentals);\\nand skilled nursing facility (SNF) spending.4 Average total health care spending per\\n\\xc2\\xadenrollee-month in MA is $642 in our baseline sample (Table 1, column 8). Of this,\\n$590 is paid by the insurer, and $52 is owed by the enrollee.\\nPayments to MA insurers for \\xe2\\x80\\x9corganic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d MA services (i.e., for services that would\\nbe covered by TM) are $767 per e\\xc2\\xad nrollee-month in our baseline sample (Table 1,\\ncolumn 6).5 The comparison of insurer MA revenue of $767 per e\\xc2\\xad nrollee-month to\\nthe insurer payments to health care providers of $590 suggests that net revenues for\\nMA insurers are $177 per \\xc2\\xadenrollee-month, or about 30 percent above MA insurer\\nhealth care spending. If this applied to the entire MA population in 2010 (including\\nthose outside our sample) it would imply $21 billion in annual (2010) revenue for\\nMA insurers in excess of their spending on health care claims.\\nOf course, MA insurers incur additional costs, such as administrative and advertising expenses, which we do not observe in our data. A rough estimate is that\\nthese additional costs are approximately 8 percent of expenditure on MA health\\ncare claims.6 By comparison, the government estimates that administrative costs\\n3\\nTM enrollees can purchase supplemental private insurance (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMedigap\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or employer sponsored) to cover some\\nor all of their \\xc2\\xadout-of-pocket expenses. About half do so. If they do, the supplemental insurer is the primary payer of\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xc2\\xadout-of-pocket\\xe2\\x80\\x9d amount owed by the beneficiary.\\n4\\nOne (small) category of spending that is not in our measure of total spending is hospice care. This is because\\nhospice care is billed directly to CMS even for MA enrollees, so it is observed in CMS data for both TM and MA\\nand doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fully conform to the empirical exercise. In practice, we show below that the exclusion of hospice spending does not substantively affect the comparison of total spending.\\n5\\nWe define payments to MA insurers to be the sum of CMS spending on MA ($778) and additional consumer\\npremiums for MA ($6) minus the portion of the consumer rebate that is passed on to consumers for additional services, not covered by Medicare Part A and Part B services ($17). As discussed in Section I, MA insurers typically\\noffer more comprehensive coverage than TM, but they obtain a separate compensation (rebate) from CMS for it. On\\naverage in our baseline sample, the consumer rebate is $51 per \\xc2\\xadenrollee-month, and $34 of it is for more generous\\ncoverage of the health care services that would be covered by TM and that we study in the paper, while the remaining $17 of the rebate is for additional consumer benefits that are not captured by the analogous TM spending (such\\nas premium discounts, or dental and vision coverage).\\n6\\nThis estimate is based on data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) for the year\\n2015, which contain information at the i\\xc2\\xad nsurer-state level on revenues and cost components for each insurer, which\\nare part of a mandatory report by the insurer to the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insurance commissioner (ideally we would use 2010\\ndata, but 2015 was the first year where numbers for Medicare coverage were reported separately from other lines\\n\\n\\x0cCURTO ET AL.: HEALTH CARE IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MEDICARE\\n\\nVOL. 11 NO. 2\\x08\\n\\n313\\n\\nMA spending per enrollee-month (US dollars)\\n\\n1,100\\n\\n1,000\\nCoefficients of variation:\\nTM \\xe2\\x80\\x94 0.114\\nMA \\xe2\\x80\\x94 0.136\\n\\n900\\n\\n800\\n\\n700\\n\\n600\\n\\n500\\n\\n400\\n400\\n\\n500\\n\\n600\\n\\n700\\n\\n800\\n\\n900\\n\\n1,000\\n\\n1,100\\n\\nTM spending per enrollee-month (US dollars)\\nFigure 2. State-by-State Comparison of TM and MA Spending\\nNotes: The figure plots MA spending per enrollee-month against TM spending per enrollee-month for each of\\nthe 36 states in our baseline sample.

The size of each bubble is proportional to the number of total Medicare\\nenrollees in the state.\\n\\nfor Medicare (including the federal government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s costs of administering Medicare\\nAdvantage) were about 1.7 percent of Medicare TM claims in 2010 (Boards of\\nTrustees 2011).\\nSpending in MA and TM: Raw Comparisons.\\xe2\\x80\\x94The raw summary statistics also\\nshow dramatic differences in total health care spending between the TM and MA\\npopulations. In our baseline sample, the average TM enrollee spends $911 per\\nmonth (Table 1, column 4), while the average MA enrollee spends 30 percent less,\\n$642 (Table 1, column 8).\\nFigure 2 shows raw spending in MA and TM separately for each of the 36 states\\nin our baseline sample. Spending is lower in MA in all states, but the differences\\nrange from about 3 percent lower MA spending in Alaska to over 45 percent lower\\nMA spending in Florida and Vermont.\\nGeographic variation in spending within TM has attracted a great deal of attention. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDartmouth Atlas\\xe2\\x80\\x9d finding of large differences across areas in TM spending\\nand utilization without corresponding differences in mortality is widely viewed as\\nindicative of the inefficiencies of the public Medicare system (Fisher et al. 2003a, b;\\nSkinner 2011; and Institute of Medicine 2013). Our analysis suggests that, if\\nof insurance). Using these data, we focused on the three HCCI insurers in the 36 states that constitute our baseline\\nsample.

The\\ncoefficient of variation across states (weighting each state by its total Medicare\\nenrollment) is 0.136 in MA, about 20 percent higher than the 0.114 coefficient of\\nvariation we estimate in TM.7 In online Appendix Figure A2, we show that MA also\\nexhibits the positive correlation across states between spending and mortality that\\nhas been widely documented in TM.\\nIII. Measurement Approach\\n\\nA. (Standard ) Framework\\nLower baseline spending in MA relative to TM may partly or entirely reflect\\ndifferences in the beneficiaries who enroll in TM and MA. We have already seen in\\nTable 1 that MA enrollees tend to be healthier than TM enrollees. A standard potential outcome framework is therefore useful to organize our measurement exercise.\\nLet M\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x8b \\xe2\\x80\\x8bA\\xe2\\x80\\x8bi\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x87 = 1\\xe2\\x80\\x8bif beneficiary \\xe2\\x80\\x8bi\\xe2\\x80\\x8bis enrolled in a plan offered by one of the three HCCI\\ninsurers in MA, and \\xe2\\x80\\x8bM\\xe2\\x80\\x8bAi\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x87 = 0\\xe2\\x80\\x8bif \\xe2\\x80\\x8bi\\xe2\\x80\\x8bis in TM.

Column 1 reproduces the raw, unweighted\\nnumbers already shown in column 4 of Table 1. Column 2 of Table 2 re-weights the\\nTM data to match the distribution of MA enrollees across counties. Average TM\\nspending per \\xc2\\xadenrollee-month increases from $911 to $942, reflecting the fact that\\nMA enrollees are disproportionately in more expensive counties; this is primarily\\ndriven by the w\\n\\xc2\\xad ell documented higher MA penetration in urban areas, in which\\nhealth care delivery tends to be more expensive. Columns 3 and 4 add risk scores to\\nthe re-weighting of the TM population, so that it matches, county by county, the risk\\nscore distribution of MA enrollees. In column 3, we match on risk score bins that are\\nquite coarse, of width 0.5; 58 percent of MA enrollees are in the 3 largest bins (0.5\\xe2\\x80\\x931,\\n\\xc2\\xad1\\xe2\\x80\\x931.5, and 1.\\xc2\\xad5\\xe2\\x80\\x932). In column 4, we use more granular risk score bins (of width 0.1).\\nIt is evident from column 3 (and not surprising given Table 1) that re-weighting on\\nrisk scores is important, reducing the average monthly spending by 9 percent relative to re-weighting on county only in column 2. However, it is quite remarkable that\\nthe much more granular matching on the risk score distribution makes little difference, with columns 3 and 4 showing essentially identical results.

The relative importance of selection or treatment is particularly important in the context of assessing the cost implications of any expansion of the MA\\nprogram to cover those currently enrolled in TM.\\nIf we want to condition on a richer set of variables, it gets more difficult to apply\\nthe same re-weighting strategy as the data become sparse and it is common to observe\\nMA beneficiaries with a vector of characteristics for which there is no match in the\\nTM sample.

These observables are used with a particular functional form to produce\\nthe risk score.

Using Mortality to Address Selection on Unobservable Health\\nIt is less obvious how to correct for selection on unobservables that affect the\\npropensity to enroll in MA and may also be correlated with health care spending.\\nOur main approach to address it is to leverage the fact that we can observe mortality\\noutcomes for individuals in both TM and MA. As we saw in Table 1, mortality is\\nlower for MA enrollees than for TM enrollees; it is also lower conditional on county\\nand risk score (not shown). While clearly imperfect, it may provide a rough sense\\nas to how much additional selection may affect the interpretation of the results, and\\nthis could vary for different types of health care utilization outcomes.\\n\\n\\x0c318\\n\\nAMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS\\x08\\n\\nAPRIL 2019\\n\\nWe thus continue by making the strong assumption that mortality outcomes are\\nunaffected by enrollment in MA. Under this assumption, we can use realized mortality rates as a substitute metric to measure health risk. Such a metric will capture\\npotential selection on health risk that is not captured by the risk score used earlier\\n(Brown et al. 2014), and it will also be robust with respect to differential coding of\\nhealth conditions, which has been shown to be more aggressive in MA relative to\\nTM (Geruso and Layton 2015).\\nTo implement this approach, we estimate the mortality rate (within the same calendar year of 2010) for each individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s county and risk score bin g\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b i\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x87 = (\\xe2\\x80\\x8bzi\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b,\\xe2\\x80\\x86\\xe2\\x80\\x8br\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\xaf i\\xe2\\x80\\xb2\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x89)\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\xaf ,\\nbut do so separately for MA and TM enrollees.9 We can then construct a variable\\n\\xcb\\x86\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8bi\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x87 = m(\\xe2\\x80\\x8bzi\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b,\\xe2\\x80\\x86\\xe2\\x80\\x8br\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\xaf \\xe2\\x80\\xb2i\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\xaf , M\\xe2\\x80\\x8bAi\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b)\\xe2\\x80\\x8b, which captures the individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s predicted mortality, and we\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8bm\\nthen turn to our first empirical strategy, but replacing the individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s risk score\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\n\\xcb\\x86\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8bi\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b, and (as before) re-weighting on\\nr\\xe2\\x80\\x8bi\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8bwith the individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s predicted mortality \\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8bm\\n\\xcb\\x86\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\xaf \\xe2\\x80\\xb2i\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\xaf )\\xe2\\x80\\x8b, where the predicted mortality m\\n\\xcb\\x86\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\xaf \\xe2\\x80\\xb2i\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b.\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xcb\\x86\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8bi\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b is binned into bins \\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8bm\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8bg\\xe2\\x80\\xb2\\xe2\\x80\\xb2\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\xaf i\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\xaf \\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x87 = (\\xe2\\x80\\x8bzi\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8b,\\xe2\\x80\\x86\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8bm\\nColumn 4 of panel B of Table 2 shows results for this second approach, which\\nadditionally adjusts for unobserved health; it shows results where we follow the\\nabove exercise and use predicted mortality bins of width 0.01.

As can be\\nseen, \\xc2\\xadre-weighting by predicted mortality makes a significant difference. Therefore,\\nin what follows, we will report comparisons between MA and TM using two\\napproaches: adjusting for selection on priced observables (Table 2, panel A, column\\n4), and additionally adjusting for selection on unobserved health (Table 2, panel B,\\ncolumn 4).\\nIV. Differences in Spending in MA and TM\\n\\nOverall Differences.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Table 2 shows average spending differences across all our\\nbaseline sample enrollees in MA (column 5) and comparison samples in TM. The\\nunweighted data (Table 2, column 1 of panel A) indicate that health care spending\\nin MA is $269 (30 percent) lower per e\\xc2\\xad nrollee-month than in TM. Adjusting for differences on priced observables (Table 2, panel A, column 4), we estimate that health\\ncare spending by MA enrollees is $212 (25 percent) lower per \\xc2\\xadenrollee-month than in\\na comparable (on county and risk score) sample of TM enrollees. Stated differently,\\nin the spirit of CMS\\xe2\\x80\\x99 capitation payment formula, if total health care spending of MA\\nenrollees under TM were the same as for TM enrollees with the same risk scores in\\nthe same counties, they would cost $855 per e\\xc2\\xad nrollee-month, while in MA, their total\\nhealth care spending is only $642. Applying this estimate to the entire MA population\\n9\\nWe have also estimated specifications that replace mortality rates in 2010 with mortality rates over longer\\nhorizons (up to five years).

Doing this (Table 2, panel B, column 4) indicates that health care\\nspending in MA is only $64 (9 percent) lower than in a comparable (on county and\\npredicted mortality rate) sample of TM enrollees. Recall that MA insurers are paid\\nbased on risk scores, so the higher difference in spending that arises from adjusting\\nfor selection on priced observables (Table 2, panel A) is more directly associated\\nwith the profits of MA insurers from the current set of MA enrollees, while using\\nmortality to adjust for unobserved health may be more relevant in the context of\\na counterfactual of moving MA enrollees to TM (or vice versa), assuming that it\\nindeed captures much of the selection on unobserved health.\\nIn the remaining tables, we compare differences across types of consumers or\\ncare.

Each row represents a different subsample\\n\\n\\x0c320\\n\\nAMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS\\x08\\n\\nAPRIL 2019\\n\\nof enrollees. Across the board, overall spending in MA tends to be substantially\\nlower than the (\\xc2\\xadre-weighted) TM analog; the average difference reported in panel\\nA of Table 2 is not driven by any specific s\\xc2\\xad ubpopulation. Yet, we see some heterogeneous effects across types of enrollees. The difference is higher in both absolute\\nand \\xc2\\xadrelative terms for older beneficiaries than for younger ones. The spending differences are much greater for urban counties, which is where the vast majority (77\\npercent) of MA beneficiaries enroll, than for rural counties. Put differently, average\\nspending per month in MA is almost the same for rural and urban counties, but TM\\nspending is much higher in urban counties, thus generating the differential difference. This sharp difference between urban and rural counties is also reflected in the\\nMA revenues (i.e., in plan payments for \\xe2\\x80\\x9corganic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d MA services from panel C of\\nTable 1), which we estimate to be $205 higher than claims cost in urban counties and\\nonly $83 higher in rural ones. Figure 3 shows that states with higher TM spending\\nhave greater MA \\xe2\\x80\\x9csavings\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as measured by the percentage difference between MA\\nspending and adjusted TM spending. This is consistent with the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconventional wisdom\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that higher spending TM areas are less efficient or productive (e.g., Skinner\\n2011).\\nPanel B of Table 3 compares different quantiles of the MA and TM spending\\ndistributions. This allows us to assess, for example, whether the spending difference\\nis driven by the highest spenders. We see the overall lower MA spending across all\\nparts of the distribution, with larger percentage differences at the lower end.\\nDifferences by Spending Type.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Table 4 reports spending differences across different categories of care. It shows total spending broken down into three mutually\\nexclusive and exhaustive categories: inpatient, outpatient, and SNF. MA spending\\nis lower in all three categories. The biggest difference is in SNF spending, where\\nMA spending is \\xc2\\xad30\\xe2\\x80\\x9350 percent lower than TM spending for comparable enrollees.\\nHowever, SNF spending accounts for only a small share (11 percent) of overall\\nspending, so this large percentage difference does not contribute much to the overall\\ndifference in spending. The Institute of Medicine (2013) recently called attention to\\nthe fact that variation in \\xc2\\xadpost-acute spending is a major driver of geographic variation in TM spending. This appears to be true in MA as well, where the geographic\\nvariation in SNF spending is even larger (relative to other types of spending) than\\nin TM.10 We return to the SNF results when we discuss potential mechanisms for\\nreducing health care use in Section VC below.\\nThe bottom row of Table 4 reports hospice spending in MA and TM. As noted\\nearlier, hospice is covered by TM for both MA and TM enrollees. It is therefore not\\nin our HCCI data on MA spending and we do not include it in our baseline \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctotal\\nspending\\xe2\\x80\\x9d measure.

The bottom row of Table 4\\nsuggests, however, that this is not the case. Hospice spending is too low to have any\\npotential significant offset effect; moreover, it is also lower (rather than higher) for\\nMA enrollees than for TM enrollees.\\nV. Differences in Utilization, Not in Prices\\n\\nIn this section, we examine whether the difference in overall health care spending\\nper \\xc2\\xadenrollee-month between MA and TM is driven by lower health care utilization\\nin MA or by the ability of MA insurers (at least the large ones, from which we have\\ndata) to negotiate lower prices, or both. One challenge in such an exercise is to conceptually separate prices from quantity or quality of care, and this challenge dictates\\nsome of the exercises we report. To preview our results, we find that quantity differences appear responsible for the entire difference; various measures of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprices\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are\\nall quite similar in MA and TM.\\nA. Differences in the Propensity of Health Care Encounters\\nTable 5 compares components of health care utilization. We examine inpatient\\ndays and admissions, days in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), visits to the emergency department (ED), and physician visits. Inpatient and SNF utilization differences between MA and TM are similar to the analogous spending differences\\ncomputed in Table 4. Conditional on an inpatient admission, length of stay is also\\nslightly (6 percent) lower in MA. ED visits are lower in MA, reflecting lower utilization both for outpatient ED visits (ED visits that do not result in an inpatient admission) and inpatient ED visits (which do result in an inpatient admission).

This pattern is consistent with our adjustment\\nfor unobserved health fully adjusting for health differences between TM and MA\\nenrollees, and MA insurers having no discretion over inpatient utilization, which is\\nfully driven by health events.\\n\\xc2\\xadOverused and Underused Care.\\xe2\\x80\\x94In Table 6, we explore differences in potential \\xc2\\xadlow-value and h\\xc2\\xad igh-value care. Panel A examines utilization of diagnostic testing and imaging services, where overuse may be a concern (e.g., \\xc2\\xadBrot-Goldberg\\net al. 2017, US Government Accountability Office 2008). Table 6, panel B, examines utilization of various measures of preventive care, an area where \\xc2\\xadunderuse may\\nbe a concern (\\xc2\\xadBrot-Goldberg et al. 2017).11 We see lower utilization in MA for both\\n\\xc2\\xadlow-value and \\xc2\\xadhigh-value care. Diagnostic tests and imaging procedures are lower\\nin MA by similar percentages as total spending. Preventive care exhibits no obvious pattern relative to overall care; rates of most preventive care are lower in MA,\\nalthough there is variation across the measures.\\n11\\nWe show rates of preventive care by \\xc2\\xadenrollee-month to be consistent with the analysis in the rest of the paper.\\nNaturally, recommended care is not at a monthly level but typically at an annual (or biannual) level.

Within emergency visits, it further distinguishes between\\nthose that require treatment in the ED (as opposed to being treatable in a primary\\ncare setting, such as a lumbar sprain). Finally, within emergency visits that require\\nED care, it distinguishes between those that were and were not preventable by timely\\nambulatory care. Online Appendix B provides more detail on the algorithm and its\\nvalidation.

(Lack of ) Mean Price Differences\\nfor Hospital Admissions for Specific Diagnoses\\nTable 7 shows spending per encounter in MA and TM. Given the close similarity\\nbetween the percentage difference in utilization measures in Table 5 and the percentage difference in the corresponding spending measures in Table 4, it is not surprising that spending per encounter is quite similar between MA and TM. Inpatient\\nspending per admission, inpatient spending per day, and SNF spending per SNF day\\nare essentially the same in MA and TM. Interestingly, spending per outpatient ED\\nvisit is 9\\xc2\\xad \\xe2\\x80\\x9310 percent higher in MA; this may reflect utilization management for MA\\npatients that discourages relatively less severe cases from coming to the ED or from\\nbeing admitted from the ED to the hospital. We also note that neither re-weighting\\napproach makes much difference for inpatient spending; the spending per encounter\\nstatistics are quite similar already in the raw comparison of means.\\nThis similar spending per encounter for MA and TM enrollees suggests that\\nprices may be similar in MA and TM. However, spending per encounter can also\\nbe affected by differences in providers seen or in reason for the visit.

TM-MA Price Differences for Inpatient Admissions, across DRGs\\nNotes: The figure plots the (percentage) difference between average MA prices and TM prices for a hospital admission, overall and for the 20 most common DRGs in MA. Average MA or TM prices for a given DRG are computed\\nusing a common (MA) basket of state admission shares for that DRG. The national average price in MA or TM is\\ncomputed by weighting each DRG (including the less common ones not shown here) by its (national) share of MA\\nadmissions. The size of each bubble (except for the overall \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAverage\\xe2\\x80\\x9d bubble) is proportional to the number of MA\\nadmissions with that DRG.\\n\\nrate and a D\\n\\xc2\\xad RG-specific rate; it is our understanding (although no contractual data\\nare available to verify it) that these hospitals are predominantly paid by MA insurers\\nin a similar way. In TM, and presumably in MA as well, some accommodation for\\nexceptions is allowed, resulting in payments that may deviate from the \\xc2\\xadDRG-hospital\\nformula rates.\\nWe compute a parallel set of prices in MA and TM. For both, our starting unit of\\nanalysis is an admission in MA, which is characterized by a hospital and a DRG.\\nThe MA price is simply the observed (transacted) payments for the admission in the\\nMA claims data. Construction of the TM price proceeds in two steps. First, for each\\nMA admission, we calculate the formula price in TM, applying the PPS reimbursement formula which, as noted, is a function of the hospital and the DRG. Second,\\nwe adjust our TM formula prices to reflect average differences between TM formula\\nand TM actual (transacted) prices since we are comparing to actual (transacted)\\nprices in MA.13 Online Appendix C provides more detail.\\n13\\nIn principle, we could follow the exact same approach as for MA prices, and estimate transacted TM prices\\ndirectly in the CMS data, where we observe TM payments for each admission, along with its hospital and DRG. In\\npractice, however, we are constrained from doing this for two reasons: hospital identifiers are encrypted in the MA\\ndata, and our DUAs prohibit our exporting data below a minimum cell size. Fortunately, the TM \\xc2\\xadhospital-specific\\nbase payment rates (which determine the TM formula payments) are available in our MA data; we are extremely\\ngrateful to Zack Cooper for providing us with this mapping. We construct actual and formula TM prices in the CMS\\ndata and use these to construct adjustment factors to reflect average differences between TM formula and actual\\nprices by DRG or by state.\\n\\n\\x0cVOL. 11 NO. 2\\x08\\n\\nCURTO ET AL.: HEALTH CARE IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MEDICARE\\n\\n327\\n\\nFigure 4 shows our estimate of the average price in TM and MA overall, and for\\nthe top 20 DRGs (by their share of MA admissions); online Appendix Table A2 provides the underlying numbers. In reporting \\xc2\\xadDRG-specific average prices, we weight\\nthe admissions in each DRG by the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s share of MA admissions in all DRGs,\\nso that any differences in average prices across DRGs within MA (or within TM)\\nreflect price differences for a common \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstate basket,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and are not contaminated by\\ndifferences in the geographic distribution of admissions by DRG across states. The\\nnational average price is computed by weighting each DRG by its (national) share\\nof MA admissions.\\nInpatient prices are extremely similar in MA and TM. The national average\\nadmission price is $9,945 in TM and $10,054 in MA. The price for an average MA\\nadmission is only 1.1 percent higher in MA relative to TM. The largest difference\\namong the top 20 DRGs is for chest pain (DRG #313), for which the average MA\\nprice is about 6 percent lower than in TM. For 10 of the top 20 DRGs, the average\\nprice in MA is within 2 percent of that in TM.\\nThe close similarity of inpatient admission prices between MA and TM echoes\\nsimilar findings by Baker et al. (2016) and is interesting given that it is frequently\\nconjectured that because the public sector has greater bargaining power, public\\n\\xc2\\xadfee-for-service may achieve lower prices than private insurance (e.g., Philipson\\net al. 2010). Consistent with this conjecture, prior empirical work has shown that\\nfor the same service, TM tends to reimburse at substantially lower prices than commercial (under-65) private insurance both in the outpatient setting (Clemens and\\nGottlieb 2017) and the inpatient setting (Cooper et al. 2015). In contrast, we do not\\nfind that TM prices are substantially lower than MA prices.14 One potential explanation for this discrepancy is that regulation requires hospitals to accept f\\xc2\\xad ee-for-service\\nMedicare rates for Medicare beneficiaries when they are not included in the MA\\nplan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s network; as a result, MA plans may have greater bargaining power\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\nthus obtain lower rates\\xe2\\x80\\x94than commercial plans that serve the u\\xc2\\xad nder-65 population.\\nBerenson et al. (2015) provides more details on this institutional environment, and\\nreports on results from a survey of hospital and MA plan executives, which are very\\nconsistent with our findings.\\nGeographic Variation in Hospital Prices.\\xe2\\x80\\x94We also compare geographic variation in inpatient prices for MA and TM. We construct average state prices in MA and\\nTM following a parallel process to what we did for measuring DRG prices; here, we\\nweight the admissions in each state using the DRG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s national share of MA admissions, so that comparisons of s\\xc2\\xad tate-level average prices within MA (or within TM)\\nare not contaminated by differences in the mix of DRGs across states.\\nFigure 5 shows the results; online Appendix Table A3 shows the underlying numbers.

Potential Channels for Saving\\nOur results thus far strongly point to differences in utilization metrics, rather than\\npayment rates, that are driving the overall differences in spending between TM and\\nMA. How might MA plans reduce health care utilization? Some mechanisms that\\nhave been proposed include limited provider networks through which beneficiaries\\nreceive care, coordination of care programs to more efficiently deliver appropriate\\nservices and avoid excessive utilization, and financial incentives to physicians to\\ninfluence the quality and quantity of services delivered (e.g., Landon et al. 2012).\\n15\\nLike us, this analysis focuses on pricing variation in hospitals. The recent Cooper et al. (2015) comparison of\\npricing variation in TM compared to commercial (i.e., private, under-65) plans also uses data from HCCI, specifically\\n\\xc2\\xad2007\\xe2\\x80\\x932011 data for commercial insurance. We confirmed that we replicate their finding of substantially greater\\nvariation in pricing in commercial insurance relative to TM when, as with our main analysis here, we use data only\\nfrom 2010 and from the subset of 36 states in our baseline analysis. Specifically, using the MA share of admissions\\nin each DRG to construct average prices for each state, and estimating the coefficient of variation across states\\nweighting each state by the Medicare enrollment in that state (as in Figure 5), we estimate that pricing variation\\nis over 50 percent larger in commercial insurance (coefficient of variation = 0.14) than in TM (coefficient of\\nvariation = 0.08).\\n\\n\\x0cVOL. 11 NO. 2\\x08\\n\\nCURTO ET AL.: HEALTH CARE IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MEDICARE\\n\\n329\\n\\nTable 8\\xe2\\x80\\x94Potential Channels for Cost Saving\\nTM,\\nunweighted\\n(1)\\nPanel A.

All statistics are at the enrollee-month\\nlevel. All spending numbers are in dollars/month. Panel A reports (unconditional) hospital discharge destinations.\\na\\nWeighting based on our preferred weighting, as in column 4 of both panels in Table 2.\\n\\nBy contrast, in TM there are virtually no restrictions on physician clinical decisions\\nor patient choices of care.\\nWe have already seen evidence of one \\xe2\\x80\\x9csignature\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of MA mechanisms to reduce\\ncare utilization: all these mechanisms should constrain patient entry into care, particularly expensive care, so that the average person using that care in MA is in worse\\nhealth, and has higher cost than the average person using that care in TM. In other\\nwords, MA enrollees should have fewer encounters, but have greater spending (or\\nutilization) per encounter. Consistent with this, we found that spending per outpatient ED visit was in fact slightly higher in MA than in TM (see Table 7).\\nIn Table 8, we provide additional evidence consistent with restrictions on utilization. In panel A, we explore differences between TM and MA in the distribution\\nof discharge destinations of hospitalized patients. Destinations are roughly ordered\\nin how expensive they are (from cheaper to more expensive). Inpatients covered by\\nMA are disproportionately discharged to less expensive destinations. In particular,\\ndischarges to SNFs (or other \\xc2\\xadpost-acute care) are substantially less common, while\\ndischarges home (or to home health services) are relatively more likely.\\nIn addition to limiting use of care, MA may also constrain the type of service,\\nencouraging use of less expensive substitutes. Panel B points to some patterns that\\nare suggestive of such channels. First, we analyze the frequency of surgeries. We\\nfind the surgery rate to be in fact higher, not lower, in MA by about 20 to 30 percent.\\nHowever, inpatient surgeries are similar and outpatient surgeries are much higher,\\nwhich is suggestive of MA insurers using outpatient surgeries to substitute away\\nfrom inpatient surgeries and perhaps (given the fact that overall number of surgeries\\nis higher) from other types of expensive, \\xc2\\xadnonsurgical admissions as well. Second,\\nwe examine two types of physician visits: primary care and specialist visits. We\\nalready saw in Table 5 that MA enrollees are associated with fewer physician visits.\\nThe results in Table 8 show that this is driven primarily by fewer specialist visits;\\nrates of primary care visits are similar.\\n\\n\\x0c330\\n\\nAMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS\\x08\\n\\nAPRIL 2019\\n\\nVI. Conclusion\\n\\nWe have compared health care spending and utilization in public and private\\nMedicare. This setting provides a rare opportunity for a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cside by side\\xe2\\x80\\x9d comparison\\nof public and private health insurance systems operating on a similar scale, for the\\nsame population, in the same markets, and with the same providers. Novel data from\\nthe Health Care Cost Institute on the health care claims of MA enrollees allow us a\\nrare look inside the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblack box\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of health care utilization and spending in MA.\\nWe find that MA insurer revenues are 30 percent higher than their health care\\nspending. Health care spending per \\xc2\\xadenrollee-month in MA is 30 percent lower than\\nin TM; holding enrollee county and risk score fixed, this spending difference shrinks\\nto 25 percent, and adjusting for mortality differences further reduces it to 9 percent.\\nThe lower spending by MA enrollees is entirely due to lower health care utilization. Prices appear similar in MA and TM. Where we can most directly measure\\nthis\\xe2\\x80\\x94the price of an admission for a given DRG at a given hospital\\xe2\\x80\\x94we estimate\\nthat average prices in MA are 1.1 percent higher than in TM. Reductions in utilization appear similar both for types of care where there is concern about \\xe2\\x80\\x9coveruse\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(e.g., imaging and diagnostic tests) and where there is concern about \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunderuse\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(e.g., preventive care).\\nWe provide suggestive evidence for some of the potential channels by which MA\\nmay reduce health care utilization for enrollees. We find that utilization is lower\\nin MA but that, conditional on an encounter, spending per encounter is similar or\\nslightly higher in MA. This suggests that MA plans restrict utilization on the margin to sicker individuals. Relatedly, individuals discharged from the hospital are\\nmuch more likely to be sent home\\xe2\\x80\\x94and less likely to be sent to a p\\xc2\\xad ost-acute care\\nfacility\\xe2\\x80\\x94if they are enrolled in MA rather than in TM. We also find evidence consistent with substitution to less expensive types of care in MA; for example, differences\\nin specialist visits are much larger than differences in primary care visits.\\nFinally, in light of the widespread interest in geographic variation in health care\\nspending in TM, and recent work on geographic variation in commercial (\\xc2\\xadunder-65)\\nprivate insurance, we explore similar comparisons in MA. Although geographic\\nvariation in spending in TM is often viewed as a reflection of the inefficiencies in\\na public health insurance system, we find similar\\xe2\\x80\\x94in fact, slightly larger\\xe2\\x80\\x94geographic variation in spending in MA compared to TM. And while recent work has\\nemphasized the much greater geographic pricing variation in private commercial\\ninsurance than in TM, we find similar\\xe2\\x80\\x94in fact, slightly smaller\\xe2\\x80\\x94geographic variation in pricing in MA compared to TM.\\nOne natural question these findings raise is their implications for MA insurers and consumers. For insurers, our estimates from MA data indicate that their\\nrevenue exceeds their health care expenditures by $177 (about 30 percent) per\\n\\xc2\\xadenrollee-month. An important area for further work is to examine how this varies\\nwith competitive and other market conditions and whether these potential cost savings may be dissipated through other forms of costs, such as the administrative costs\\nof providing the insurance and the marketing costs of attracting enrollees.\\nImplications for consumers are more elusive, since the elements of their objective function are not as straightforward to define or measure. A simple revealed\\n\\n\\x0cVOL. 11 NO. 2\\x08\\n\\nCURTO ET AL.: HEALTH CARE IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MEDICARE\\n\\n331\\n\\np\\xc2\\xad reference argument would suggest that consumers who choose MA are better off\\nin MA than in TM. Other inferences are harder to make. Quality of the health care\\nexperience is difficult to assess; our measures of preventive care point to reductions\\nthere that are similar in magnitude to those for other forms of care. We calculated\\nthat the mean actuarial benefit to consumers (i.e., rebates that are passed on to consumers in the form of other benefits) was $51 per e\\xc2\\xad nrollee-month, but, of course,\\nthe rebate may be valued differently from its actuarial value, and MA plans have\\nother attributes that will affect consumer surplus, such as limited networks. The\\nimplications of privately provided Medicare for both consumers and producers is an\\nimportant area for further work.\\nREFERENCES\\nAyanian, John Z., Bruce E. Landon, Robert C. Saunders, L.
