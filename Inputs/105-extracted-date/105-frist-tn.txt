Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern for some of the provisions in the omnibus measure that we have passed today. I voted for this bill because I believe that there are some very good provisions in it, and, on balance, I think it serves the American people well. It re-energizes our national drug control effort. It tries to boost the morale and readiness of our armed forces, rather than continuing the dangerous trend toward a hollow military. It helps protect citizens' second amendment rights. It prohibits Federal funding of needle exchanges. The bill retains language blocking Members of Congress, judges and members of the Federal executive service from receiving a cost-of-living increase. There is a one-year moratorium on Department of Education-sponsored national testing. I voted for this bill because I have been assured that we have stayed within the budget caps. 
I am concerned, however, about the integrity of the budget and appropriations process and the classification of emergency spending that has prevailed in this omnibus measure. Other Senators have spoken here on the Senate floor about the dereliction of congressional duty in failing to pass 13 individual spending bills during this year's session of the Senate. Instead, because of partisan politics, we are here passing a massive spending bill that rolls eight appropriations bills into one large catch-all bill, which also includes dozens of extraneous matters. If that is not bad enough, we have also included `emergency' spending to the tune of more than $20 billion. 
This spending is considered outside of the budget and therefore not subject to the budget caps. What this means, however, is that this $20 billion comes directly out of the budget surplus. It is sometimes necessary to appropriate funds for emergencies like hurricanes, floods or other natural disasters. I am disappointed, however, that we have appropriated billions of dollars for things that can hardly be considered emergencies. Our troops have been in Bosnia for three years--is this a surprise? The Year 2000 problem? With foresight, we could have planned for this through the regular appropriations process rather than designating it as an emergency. So instead of making room for these spending priorities, the President has declared them emergencies and instead of imposing fiscal discipline, he--and we--have used the surplus that the President demanded be saved for Social Security to pay for them. 
As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I think it should be our first priority next year to examine how we classify emergency spending. No longer should the Congress--or the President--be allowed to spend our budget surplus for matters that should be paid for through the regular appropriations process. Second, I would like to reiterate my support for Senator Domenici's biennial budgeting bill. It is at times like this that the need for biennial budgeting becomes even clearer. 
Mr. President, as I said, this bill, though far from perfect, will work more good than mischief. There are real problems with this bill and the process that created it; however, we must sometimes accept that our system of government divides power between Congress and the President. The President's priorities differ from most of our priorities. In these circumstances, compromise must rule the day. 
Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I look forward to meeting our budgeting challenges when we return next year. I hope that we are able to continue on the course that we set last year when we enacted tight discretionary spending caps and charted a course toward a $1.5 trillion surplus. While I am concerned about the process that got us here today, I remain hopeful that we will take the necessary steps next year to keep us on our course toward fiscal responsibility and continued prosperity.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that will correct a grave injustice to users of kerosene for home heating. My bill would amend last year's change to the tax code concerning kerosene to allow registered vendors to administer claims for the refund of kerosene sold for home heating use. 
As many of you know, on July 1, 1998, new regulations regarding the taxation of kerosene went into effect, and I have heard from many Tennesseans who are concerned about the new tax policies. These provisions were included in the House version of the `Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.' While these provisions were not included in the Senate version of the bill, the House language prevailed when the Senate and House worked out the conference agreement on this bill. Prior to the 1997 change in law, kerosene was not taxable unless it was blended with taxable diesel fuel or used as an aviation fuel, nor was it subject to dyeing requirements. 
There have been continued problems with the use of untaxed kerosene being blended with taxable highway fuel, like diesel. As a result, some members of the House of Representatives determined and diesel fuel compliance measures, like dyeing, should be extended to kerosene. According to the new law, kerosene is taxed at 24.4 cents per gallon unless it is indelibly dyed and used only for a nontaxable use like home heating. 
I am concerned about these changes, especially since kerosene is often used as a heating oil or in space heaters. This is a nontaxable use; however, it is unclear whether dyed kerosene may be used in space heaters due to health concerns. In addition, many small oil companies and kerosene venders do not have sufficient facilities to sell both dyed and undyed kerosene, and many states have regulations mandating that only undyed kerosene may be used in home heaters. As a result, many consumers of kerosene for non-taxable home heating purposes will either be forced, or will choose for safety reasons, to purchase the taxable undyed kerosene. Under current law and IRS regulation, only the taxpayer is allowed to file a claim for a fuel credit if he or she purchases taxable kerosene for a non-taxable purpose other than from a blocked pump. 
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has provided refund and credit procedures for vendors and/or purchasers of the clear, taxed kerosene when the kerosene is intended for nontaxable purposes like home heating. This process, however, is complex and potentially unwieldy. Individual purchasers may claim a credit on line 59 of the 1040 tax form for whatever amount of tax they paid on clear kerosene bought for a nontaxable use. It is true that an individual must file a return, even if he or she otherwise would not, in order to receive the credit from the IRS. Vendors may claim a credit on their tax returns or may claim a 
quarterly refund if at least $750 is owed. 
Because many of these kerosene consumers do not file tax return form 1040, this provision is an undue burden on hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Tennesseans, and many thousands of Americans. The complex nature of the kerosene tax refund policies on individual consumers who use kerosene for home heating is unduly burdensome. Additionally, for the consumers to pay a 24.4 cent tax per gallon at all strikes me as unjust taxation. Many of those who use kerosene for home heating are poor and can ill-afford to pay approximately 25% more per gallon of kerosene--even if it is to be refunded at a later time. 
I sent a letter to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on August 13, 1998 asking Commissioner Rossotti to issue a regulation that would allow kerosene vendors to file refund claims on behalf of their consumers. The Commissioner responded that such a regulation would require Congressional action to actually change the statute. 
This bill would do just that. I urge my colleagues to support this measure and I strongly urge passage of this bill.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the very important issue of education. 
I am very disappointed that some Democrats in Congress and those in the White House have chosen to demagogue and politicize education as we attempt to wind down our legislative year. These Democrats would like for the American people to believe that Republicans just don't care about education and that we are refusing to spend more money to improve our educational system. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
Since I took office in 1995, I have seen a 27 percent increase in the amount of money this Congress has appropriated for education. In 1994, we spent $24.6 billion for education. For fiscal year 1999, we have proposed to spend $31.4 billion--exactly, I might add, that the President requested for discretionary spending. Historically, the federal commitment to education has risen from $23.9 billion in 1959 to over $564 billion in 1996. As a percentage of GDP. educational expenditures have risen from 4.7 to 7.4 percent over the same timeframe. 
For many Democrats, more money and more federal education programs are the answer to our Nation's education woes. Over the last few days, we have heard Democrats lament how Republicans have held up all of the Democratic efforts to provide funding for school construction and to reduce class size. 
For these Democrats, more money is a surrogate for the structural reform that American education needs. Structural reform, change--this is what these Democrats fear. Instead, their response to crisis is more money and another federal program. 
The last thing that we need is another federal program. Through my work as the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Education Task Force, I discovered that there are approximately 552 federal education programs. The Department of Education administers 244 of these programs, and EVEN IF you count only those `providing direct and indirect instructional assistance to students in kindergarten through grade 12,' the GAO found that there are still 69 programs. 
Among these programs, overlap is pervasive. In my office, we call this chart the `spider web chart.' This chart, prepared by the GAO, shows that 23 federal departments and agencies administer multiple federal programs to three targeted groups: teachers, at-risk and delinquent youth, and young children. For early childhood, for example, there are 90 programs in 11 agencies and offices. In fact, one disadvantaged child could be eligible for as many as 13 programs. 
In addition, the effectiveness of many of these programs is doubtful or unknown. The GAO has expressed concern that the Department of Education does not know how well new or newly modified programs are being implemented, or to what extent established programs are working. The efficacy of Title I also remains uncertain. 
Lastly, it should come as no surprise that so many programs and so much confusion comes at great cost. Critics of the education establishment note that although federal funds make up only 7% of their budgets, they impose 50% of their administrative costs. As one concrete example, Frank Brogan, Florida's Commissioner of Education, has reported that it takes 297 state employees to oversee and administer $1 billion in federal funds. In contrast, only 374 employees oversee approximately $7 billion in state funds. Thus, it takes six times as many people to administer a federal dollar as a sate dollar. 
Brogan went on to say: 
We at the State and local level feel the crushing burden cased by too many Federal regulations, procedures, and mandates. Florida spends millions of dollars every year to administer inflexible, categorical Federal programs that divert precious dollars away from raisin student achievement. Many of these Federal program typify the misguided, one-size-fits-all command and control approach. Most have the requisite focus on inputs like more regulations, increasing budgets, and fixed options and processes. The operative question in evaluating the effectiveness of these programs is usually: How much money have we put into the system? 
Cozette Buckney, Chief Education Officer, of the Chicago school 
system echoed the sentiments of many state and local officials: 
Excessive paperwork is a concern. Too many reports, the time lines for some of the reports, the cost factor involved, the administrative staff just do not warrant that kind of time on task. That is taking from what we need to do to make certain our students are achieving and our teachers are prepared. 
Senator Wyden and I introduced legislation to help with this regulatory tangle and untie the hands of states and localities. Our Ed-Flex expansion bill would expand to 50 states the enormously popular `Ed-Flex' demonstration program that has already been `field-tested' and proven successful in 12 states. 
Ed-Flex frees responsible states from the burden of unnecessary, time-consuming Washington regulations, so long as states are complying with certain core federal principles, such as civil rights, and so long as the states are making progress toward improving their students' results. Under the Ed-Flex program, the Department of Education delegates to the states its power to grant individual school districts temporary waivers from certain federal requirements that interfere with state and local efforts to improve education. To be eligible, a state must waive its own regulations on schools. It must also hold schools accountable for results. The 12 states that currently participate in Ed-Flex have used this flexibility to allow school districts to innovate and better use federal resources to improve student outcomes. 
I would also like to add that educational flexibility should extend beyond teaching techniques, curricula, and the rest of what happens in public school classrooms. It should reach to the management of those schools. One of the most important lessons about the prospective changes in education operations is the realization that decentralized, on-the-spot leadership by principals and other administrators is crucial to the success of a school. 
Unfortunately, many of America's school systems are frozen into managerial patterns that reward conformity and discourage independent leadership. American business has had to make structural adaptations to meet the challenge of the world market and international competition. Top-heavy managerial structures have given way to more flexible--and therefore more responsive--ways of engaging the work force in team efforts. The result has been greater productivity and enhanced quality. 
That is a good example of the kind of adaptation our schools can make, to free up the enormous resources of talent and commitment both among teachers and in the ranks of administrators at all levels. 
Republicans would like to stick with this strategy of untying the hands of states and localities and giving states and local school districts more flexibility. Rather than create another 2 or 3 entitlement programs that are prescriptive and inflexible, we believe that we should allow states to use additional federal monies in whatever manner the state determines the additional money can best be used. 
For some states, this may very well be for school construction. For others, it may be for hiring more teachers. But for others, it may be for wiring every school, or for putting more computers in the classroom. Some states may decide that they need the money for teacher training, to improve the teachers that they already have in the classrooms. 
The point is--how do we in the federal government know better than those in the states and local communities--and parents--what their students need the most? The answer is that we don't. 
Some in Washington argue that by allowing states the flexibility to use federal money in the best way state officials see fit removes accountability from the equation. But to whom are state and local officials more responsive--the sprawling federal bureaucracy or local teachers, parents and residents? 
This Congress has actively addressed federal education. We had lengthy and thoughtful debate on a variety of education initiatives during consideration of the Coverdell Education Savings Accounts bill. We passed the Coverdell bill to allow parents to save more of their own money for use in paying educational expenses including, but not limited to, computers, school uniforms, tutors, textbooks or tuition. 
The President vetoed the Coverdell bill. 
This Congress has passed the Higher Education Amendments and made great strides in improving teacher quality. 
Just a few days ago, we passed the Charter School bill to support charter schools which are given more flexibility and freedom from burdensome state and federal 
regulations. I am encouraged by the success of charter schools in the states that have them, and remain hopeful that when all 50 states have increased flexibility with Ed-Flex, that similar gains may be seen in the regular public schools. If charter schools are successful, we must give our regular public schools the same freedoms and opportunities to improve student achievement that we have given charters. 
In closing, my colleagues have heard me many times discuss the poor state of our American education system. In recent international comparisons, we have performed abysmally--scoring in the middle of the pack or at the very bottom depending on the age category and subject tested. 
Washington should not, however, rush to address this crisis by creating new programs with new mandates on parents and teachers, schools and localities. The last thing that our schools need is more bureaucracy and federal intrusion. Instead, what Washington should and can do is to free the hands of states and localities and to support local and state education reform efforts. When localities find ideas that work, the federal government should either get out of the way or lend a helping hand. 
I applaud the efforts of those on both sides of the aisle who are fighting for education. This is not a partisan issue. Witness my efforts with Senator Wyden on Ed-Flex--a bill that is also supported by Senators Kerrey, Ford, Glenn, and Levin on the Democratic side and more than a dozen senators on the Republican side. Most of us here in the Senate are parents and we all want what is best for our children--and all children. 
But let's not let extremist Democrats, who are hostage to the old order, paint the Republicans as the Grinches who stole Christmas for America's school children. It is extremist Democrats, with their well-intentioned but completely misguided approach of throwing more money into the federal education abyss and adding more and more programs to the already complex maze of federal education programs, who are short-changing the future of America's students. 
The temptation for too many of us is to measure our commitment to education by the size of the federal wallet. But let's not just throw money at our problems. Let's not just create more of the same old tired education programs. 
Let's focus on results. Let's give parents and local school boards control of schools, and empower them to chart a course that improves student outcomes. Let's allow States to decide how they can best utilize increased federal resources.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to express my continued support for S. 2208, the Healthcare Quality Enhancement Act, which seeks to reform and improve the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (AHCPR). 
Studies show that health care quality is dictated more by where you live than by scientific evidence or what is the best practice in medicine. Today, we have more biomedical research results than ever before, yet we are falling short in our success to disseminate our findings and to influence practice behavior. In 1843, Dr. Holmes published his famous article on hand washing for the prevention of puerperal fever in the New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine and Surgery. While it is an accepted and expected practice today, it took several decades before his recommendation became a universally accepted practice. 
The landmark Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study was published in 1985. Then, three years later, the American Diabetes Association published its eye care guidelines for patients with diabetes. Unfortunately, however, today the national rates for annual diabetic eye exam is still only 38.4 percent. Clearly, the practical application of scientifically sound diabetic eye care recommendations has not fared much better than the highly beneficial and very important hand washing theory. While there are more scientific discoveries than ever before, the practical introduction of these new scientific discoveries does not appear to be much faster today than it was more than 100 years ago. 
Through S. 2208, I am seeking to close the gap between what we know and what we do in health care. The expired statute of AHCPR represented an outdated approach to health care quality improvement. S. 2208 would establish the Agency for Healthcare Quality Research (AHQR), whose mission is the overall improvement in health care quality. 
Built upon the current AHCPR, the Agency for Healthcare Quality Research is refocused and enhanced to become both the hub and driving force of federal efforts to improve quality of health care in all practice environments. The Agency will assist, not burden physicians in four specific ways. First, it will aggressively support state-of-the-art information systems for health care quality. Improved computer systems will advance quality scoring and facilitate quality-based decision making in patient care. Next, it will support research in areas of primary care delivery, priority populations and access in under served areas. The Agency's authority is expanded to support health care improvement in all types of office practice--both solo practitioners and managed care. In addition, it will promote data collection that makes sense. Physicians want information on quality to enable them to compare their outcomes with their peers. Statistically accurate, sample-based national surveys based on existing structures will efficiently provide reliable and affordable data. And finally, the Agency will promote quality by sharing information with doctors, not the federal government. While proven medical advances are made daily, patients wait too long to benefit from these discoveries. We must get the science to the people who use it--physicians. 
I would like to point out that S. 2208 does not create a new bureaucracy, nor does it expand the federal government. Rather, it refocuses an existing agency, the AHCPR, on a research mission that can better serve the health and health care of all Americans. The reauthorization of the AHCPR and the creation of the Agency for Healthcare Quality Research enjoys broad-based support. By taking leadership in supporting research on health care quality improvement, eight Senators, including myself, are co-sponsoring this bill. They are Senators Collins, Faircloth, Jeffords, Inouye, Mack, Breaux, and Lieberman. In addition, S. 2208 was later incorporated in another bill which received co-sponsorship from 49 Senators. Also, I am pleased to report that 44 leading organizations, consisting of health care professionals, patient advocates, major health care organizations and health services researchers, have also lent their support for this measure. 
Americans want and deserve better health care. For this compelling reason, I will reintroduce S. 2208 in the 106th Congress. I urge my colleagues to support health care quality improvement and to refocus the federal government's role in this vitally important area of research.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to address the Senate today on the passage of the Health Professions Education Partnerships Act of 1998. This bill reauthorizes the programs funded through Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act. These programs are intended to increase access to primary care and to improve the distribution of members of the health professions--physicians, dentists, pharmacists, nurses, and others--to underserved areas. For many years, this legislation has helped our nation's schools of health serve the needs of their communities better and prepare the health care practitioners of the future. This bill provides a comprehensive and flexible authority to support training programs for health professions and related community-based educational partnerships. It will improve the quality, diversity, and distribution of the work force. 
The Senate has worked diligently on this effort for the past four years. Reauthorization has been a priority since the authority expired for Title VII programs in 1995 and for Title VIII programs in 1994. In 1995, Senators Kassebaum, Kennedy, and I introduced S. 555 to take the 44 programs involved and consolidate them into six groups or clusters. Performance outcomes and improved data collection were added. This approach was used to streamline the granting process, and to allow the Department of Health and Human Services greater flexibility to leverage areas of development; and to align with community workforce needs. It also provided flexibility for strategic planning of the workforce supply, and insured that a greater percentage of program dollars would go directly to grantees versus federal administration. 
After this bill, S. 555, passed in the Senate but failed to pass in the House during the 104th Congress, I identified areas of disagreement and developed ways to address these obstacles. At a hearing in April 1997, I had the opportunity to listen to concerned groups and outline possibilities for compromise. My staff has worked very hard to maintain a high level of input from constituency groups. We worked with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to address their concerns. We worked to ensure that this bill lived up to the goal of increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in the health professions. We are very pleased that the Congressional Hispanic Caucus supports S. 1754. 
This bill enjoys broad support in the medical and public health community. The bill is supported by a broad range of professional societies for physicians, nurses, pharmacists, psychologists, dentists, and others.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today before we adjourn the 105th Congress to acknowledge significant legislation addressing women's health needs in the United States. I originally introduced S. 1722, the `Women's Health Research and Prevention Amendments of 1998,' on March 6, 1998, with our Majority Leader, Senator Trent Lott, to increase awareness of some of the most pressing diseases and health issues that confront women in our country. I am gratified that the Senate has moved to enact this legislation which will reauthorize important women's health activities at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
We introduced this bill to create greater awareness of women's health issues and to highlight the critical role our public health agencies, the NIH and CDC, play in providing a broad spectrum of activities to improve women's health--including research, screening, prevention, treatment, education, and data collection. The bill has enjoyed broad bipartisan support, which is a testament to the need to combat the diseases affecting women and to maintain the crucial health services that help prevent these diseases. Today we move from raising awareness of these important issues to acting upon them. 
This bill includes valuable provisions which support basic and clinical research at the National Institutes of Health. Among other things, these provisions reauthorize research on osteoporosis and aging processes in women; the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) which was widely prescribed from 1938 to 1971 and has been shown to be harmful to pregnant women and their children; and breast and cervical cancer. These provisions also establish a new program focused on cardiovascular disease--the number one cause of death in women. The reauthorization of these research programs will help assure scientific progress in our fight against these diseases and will lessen their burden on women and their families. 
At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the bill reauthorizes the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program which provides for crucial screening services for breast and cervical cancers to underserved women. It is especially fitting that we enact this legislation today since October is Breast Cancer Awareness month. The American Cancer Society estimates that this year more than 180,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and more than 40,000 women will lose their lives. These are not just statistics--they represent our mothers, sisters, aunts, and daughters. It is with them in mind that we pass this legislation today. 
The bill also includes reauthorizations of data collection activities through the National Center for Health Statistics and the National Program of Cancer Registries, the leading sources of national data on the health status of U.S. women. These programs make significant contributions to the health and well-being of women in the United States. 
Mr. President, I am proud of our work on women's health. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our Majority Leader, Senator Lott, for his leadership and support on this issue. I would also like to thank Anne Phelps and ZoeÿAE4 Beckerman of my staff for their hard work on the reauthorization of these programs.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Medicare+Choice program was created as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to provide Medicare beneficiaries with high quality, cost effective options, in addition to the continuing option of traditional fee-for-service Medicare. When fully implemented, Medicare+Choice will provide seniors with one stop shopping for health care; including hospital and physician coverage, prescription drugs, and even preventive benefits, at a savings. 
This change in Medicare is monumental. It is dramatic. And it is essential to preserving and strengthening Medicare for our seniors and individuals with disabilities. This change breeds challenges--some that can be predicted but many which cannot. The potential for these challenges to hurt and harm is very real. The senior, so relieved to finally find a health plan that covers the cost of his prescription drugs because of Medicare+Choice, hears this week that he might not have that plan--or that coverage next year. Who to call? What to do? We as a government must respond. This Administration must move decisively to respond and to mend flaws in the system. 
We on the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare are working hard to address ways to strengthen the security provided by Medicare. And the red flags raised by the announcements this week underscore the importance of this work. No longer can we be satisfied with an outdated, 30 year old bureaucracy as the best way to care for our nation's seniors. A typical 65 year old senior who retires moves from a private sector health care system--with a variety of quality, low cost options, including prescription drug coverage, and out-of-pocket protections--to a more limited, antiquated government program, without any limits on how much you are required to pay and no drug coverage. By updating Medicare, we not only ensure its continued existence past the current bankruptcy date 10 years from now, but we provide continuity of care, limited out of pocket expenses, and a mechanism for improving quality of care that you the patient receive. 
As of October 8, forty-three of the current health care plans participating in Medicare announced their intention not to renew their Medicare contracts in 1999. Another 52 plans are reducing service areas. The net result is that 414,292 beneficiaries in 371 counties face the daunting task of securing alternative coverage provided by Medicare by January 1, 1999. Although this represents a small number of total beneficiaries, about one percent, those who have relied on their health plan to bridge the traditional gap between Medicare and Medigap now must either find another HMO (which means switching doctors in many cases), or move back to traditional fee-for-service Medicare which frequently means more personal expense. Should these individuals choose the traditional Medicare option, they will probably also scramble to find a supplementary Medigap policy, with likely higher premiums than their original Medigap policy and perhaps fewer benefits. 10% of the disadvantaged beneficiaries live in areas where no alternative Medicare HMO plans are offered. However, traditional Medicare remains an option for every beneficiary, and by law, seniors may return to that program. 
In addition to the serious dilemmas this disruption has caused for those seniors, the extent to which HMOs pulled out sent shock waves throughout the Federal government and health care industry. There are many profound questions provoked by this announcement. Why are insurance companies, hospital systems, and physicians who once applauded the Medicare+Choice program, now seemingly hesitant to participate? Are the pullouts the beginning of a trend which will ultimately undermine the Medicare+Choice program, which was specifically designed to restore Medicare's fiscal health and give seniors more options? To what extent are insurance companies and health plans over-reacting to natural `growing pains' associated with the implementation of new policies? What actions, if any, should HCFA and Congress take in response to what President Clinton characterized as HMO's breaking `their commitment to Medicare beneficiaries?' The President now vows to initiate `abandonment' legislation to punish those plans leaving and prevent a further exodus, but will he only succeed in discouraging new Medicare participating contracts? How can we avoid a short-sighted political response and create realistic incentives to provide seamless continuous coverage across geographic boundaries? How can we more adequately risk adjust payments to encourage health plans to accept, rather than avoid the most seriously ill? How can we incentivize health plans, who have little experience in caring for the chronically ill, to develop systems that appropriately address the very unique and specific needs of the older population? 
The insurance industry is responding defensively to charges that they have `abandoned beneficiaries.' They contend that in many regions Medicare's payments to HMOs fall far short of even covering the cost of care for beneficiaries. Furthermore, they argue at the very time a fledgling market structure most needs flexibility, the Administration has instead placed such rigid bureaucratic burdens that their hands are tied and they have no choice but to opt out of certain regions. Some believe the recent pullouts may simply reflect an effort on the part of insurance companies to bide time in the hopes that Congress will eventually ease requirements and make further progress with plan payments. 
Seeing what has happened to their HMO competitors, provider-sponsored plans, or PSO's, have also been wary of Medicare+Choice contracts. Their uneasiness over the Administration's treatment of new participants, however, is secondary to their concern that private sector plans may boycott their facilities, viewing them as competing insurers, rather than providers. PSOs face an uphill battle with state regulatory agencies. They fear that other insurers will use them as a `dumping ground' for the expensive, chronically ill cases many insurers are tempted to avoid. 
Both HMOs and PSOs complain loudly about the high administrative costs inherent in new Medicare contracts. By participating with the government, they agree to submit large amounts of data, pay for extensive education campaigns for their enrollees, participate in government sponsored health fairs, and keep up with all the regulatory rules and regulations. Mayo Clinic estimates that the rules governing their participation in Medicare are spelled out in 586 pages of law and accompanied by 111,088 pages of regulation, guidance, and supporting documents. We in government should listen to this call for simplification, streamlining the regulatory burden, demanding accountability without trying to micromanage. 
The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the government agency in charge of Medicare, is surprisingly optimistic and upbeat about the long term feasibility of Medicare+Choice. They urge skeptics to remember that the program is in its infancy. They point to data on Medicare HMO participation, which after a rocky start in the mid 1980s, now boasts one in six Medicare beneficiaries. They anticipate increased enrollment as more Medicare recipients have a greater understanding of their options and of how the opportunity to have a plan that meets specific needs meaning better care with greater security, not less. To date, full scale educational efforts have only occurred in five states. The beneficiary education program, which includes a booklet and hotline campaign, is slated for nationwide expansion by August, 1999. Most seniors are still unaware of their options in their regions. Many associate expanded choice with insecurity. Only education will change this. And that is a government responsibility. 
HCFA also takes issue with the HMOs' assertion that it is underpaying managed care plans. They cite evidence obtained by the Physician Payment Review Commission in 1997 that Medicare has been paying $2 billion a year too much to managed care plans. This observation led to HCFA's September decision to reject the insurance companies' proposal to resubmit their cost projections, to obtain additional reimbursement. HCFA did not intend to raise reimbursement levels, and feared that such an opportunity would allow plans to hike beneficiary premiums and decrease benefits. In addition, HCFA points to reluctance on the part of HMOs to pay their fair share of marketing and education costs. But, despite HCFA's point that, in the aggregate, they overpay HMOs, the agency governing Medicare may not be adequately considering the fact that within that average there may well be plans with a disproportionate number of older and sicker beneficiaries who are indeed underpaid. We must be committed to fair and just payment to these plans for the service we are asking them to deliver. Because of the tendency, at the federal level, to look at averages, rather than individuals, and the reality of where people live, we must commit to address reasonable compensation in greater detail. The reality is: the reimbursement system for health care plans is surprisingly disassociated with the actual costs of delivering care. We must invest today in designing and implementing a realistic, scientifically based reimbursement structure. 
A key component of the Balanced Budget Act was the move toward equity in payment across the country. Many HMOs were counting on receiving additional funds, following review by HCFA on the vast geographic disparities in payment. However, HCFA decided to postpone this adjustment until 2000, based on inadequate funds following an across-the-board 2% update. Thus, the so-called `blended rates' will not be applied until 2000. HCFA plans to incorporate risk adjustment in 2000 to reduce selective enrollment by plans and reduce total overpayments to managed care plans. HCFA has also recognized the adjustments necessary in implementing new plans, and has thus allowed leeway with quality improvement plans. There are some who feel that recent developments could have been avoided if HCFA acted more rapidly and more responsibly in carrying out Congress' mandate. Congressman Bilirakis, chairman of the House Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, stated that federal health officials were `guided by a rigid bureaucratic mentality which led to ossification rather than modernization of the Medicare program.' 
The decision of so many managed care plans to withdraw and downsize their Medicare contracts raises a red flag. We must first resolve the immediate coverage disruptions facing many of our elderly, and then we--this Congress, this President, HCFA, the insurance industry and seniors--must pledge to work together to make this program a success. Not only in the short term, but with an eye to the future. To survive, Medicare must change. Medicare needs the flexibility to respond to the changing health care environment, not only for our generation, but for our children and grandchildren. Now is the time for commitment and compassion, rather than overreaction or prematurely concluding failure of changes made to date. Knee jerk reactions, rather than thoughtfully moving to solve the problems, will only wreak further havoc on this evolving program. A commitment to education, and a more rational, responsive administrative and oversight structure must be pursued to meet future needs in Medicare and the care of our seniors. On a positive note, there are 48 pending applications of private plans wishing to enter the Medicare Market; 25 plans have requested to expand their current service areas. By working with HCFA, the insurance industry, hospitals, health care providers, and beneficiaries, we can assure that the Medicare+Choice program will reach its full potential of better and more secure care for seniors and individuals with disabilities. 
Also embedded within my remarks is a challenge to the Congress. Although we just passed, last year, the Balanced Budget Act that stretched the solvency of Medicare until 2008, it is clear that the Congress must promptly revisit Medicare once the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare files its report by March 1, 1999. The dynamics of American health care, and the rapid changes in care for the nation's seniors, will not allow for maintenance of the status quo for the next decade. It is my hope that the current focus on Medicare+Choice serves as a catalyst for renewed discussion on the future of Medicare once we have the Medicare Commission's recommendations in hand. We will be remiss in our responsibility if we do not again next year continue our efforts to insure the solvency and improve the quality of the Medicare program--for our seniors, our parents and grandparents, today--and for all Americans--including our children--tomorrow.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 50th anniversary of the American Red Cross Blood Services. The Red Cross Blood Services has been saving lives since its inception during World War II. Today, in a rapidly changing health care environment, with ever increasing challenges, the Red Cross continues to serve patients throughout our country. 
The Red Cross is America's first nationwide, volunteer blood collection and distribution system. During World War II, the Red Cross saved soldiers' lives by collecting and distributing blood. This led to the first National Civilian Blood Program, with the opening of the first blood center in 1948. Today, the Red Cross serves over 3,000 hospitals nationwide by supplying almost half of the nation's blood for transfusion. This life-giving service is made possible by volunteers who generously donate nearly six million units of blood each year.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to raise awareness of a startlingly common problem occurring every 15 seconds across our nation--and that is the issue of domestic violence. October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, and I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the devastating impact of domestic violence on individuals, families and our communities. 
Few people want to tell the dark secrets of their family. Though many keep incidents of domestic violence secret, it is a sad part of our national landscape. Through the efforts of medical researchers, law enforcement officers, advocates, and victims, more attention is now being paid. In the last two years alone, according to the National Library of Medicine, approximately 500 articles have been written on domestic violence in prominent journals and periodicals. 
Despite these efforts, many remain uncomfortable talking about domestic violence. According to the Department of Justice Violence Against Women Office, domestic violence is a crime that is frequently underreported to law enforcement authorities. Victims often live in fear and do not share their troubled secrets. They fear threats, additional violence and more pain.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the `golden hour' is a basic fundamental principle of emergency care, of emergency responsiveness in trauma care. The Senator from Alaska is entirely correct. When a serious trauma occurs, it is that first hour, that `golden hour' that is absolutely critical. 
The principle is very simple; that is, the quicker one can respond and get to appropriate treatment, the better the outcome. The `golden hour'--put that in quotation marks. But it is a fundamental principle that every emergency room and every trauma surgeon understands. It refers to the principle that the severely injured patients are more likely to survive with rapid, responsive, appropriate resuscitation, and treatment. 
Patients with otherwise potentially survivable injuries can die unless there is intervention--frequently, surgical intervention--with appropriate resources accessed by that surgeon, or by that trauma personnel that is available. Delaying or failing to perform that needed emergency action or emergency surgery is the most common cause of those otherwise preventable deaths.

Mr. FRIST. There is. I think it is important. Again, the terms `medevac' and `early' are very appropriate. It is appropriate for people of the lay public to understand what those differences are. 
In the case where you have a medevac trauma death, whereby the patient dies instantly, or within a very few minutes of whatever injury was incurred, there is little that can be done unless medevac treatment for that trauma takes place. So-called `early' death occurs within 2 to 3 hours of injury. In either case, the ability to get care immediately is the most single important factor in determining survivability and outcome.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this is very well accepted in the emergency care peer review. The literature carefully documents it, and it is just as we discussed. With each passing hour the chances of survival diminish. If you draw a curve, the chance of survival in that first hour is very high, the second hour a little bit less, but still high, and every hour it diminishes over time. And that is the underlying principle of the so-called `golden hour.'

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, telemedicine is, indeed, one of the most exciting new technologies to come along in medicine and in the application of carrying out what we know in terms of new knowledge, current knowledge, and the application. But it is very important for people to understand that its real limitation is that it is used principally for diagnostic purposes today. Over time that will change a bit. And it is advancing every day. But the quotation you just read is exactly correct. Telemedicine will never eliminate the need for emergency transportation, emergency transport, to an acute care facility.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing yesterday that resulted in a bipartisan call to address the readiness crisis in our armed forces. Senators charged the Joint Chiefs with warming over the critical defense shortfalls in a previous hearing last February in order to defend the President's Budget. 
Many of us in Congress have been expressing to the Administration for years our concerns regarding the deep cuts in personnel, equipment, and training. Senator McCain offered these warnings in a report he commissioned entitled `Going Hollow' as far back as 1993. I have written repeatedly on the subject of military readiness. In fact, last May I wrote that `the hollow state of readiness so many have warned about has arrived.'

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on Sunday, September 20th, I traveled to Sparta, TN, to deliver remarks at the dedication of a memorial honoring the brave Americans from White County, Tennessee who were prisoners of war or missing in action during World War II. I ask that my remarks be printed in the Record. 
Dedication of a World War II Memorial Honoring the POW/MIAS of White County, Tennessee 
It is an honor and a special privilege for me to participate in the dedication of this memorial to the World War II POWs and MIAs of White County. To each and every one of them--those who died, and those we are blessed to still have with us--we owe an unending debt of love, respect, and gratitude for the sacrifice they made, the pain they suffered, and the trauma they endured to ensure that the flame of freedom would never be extinguished. 
Their wounds, and the wounds of their families, are ones that do not close easily with the passage of time. Rather, they abide as long as even one missing American remains unaccounted for. And so, we must not only remember, but re-dedicate ourselves to the accounting of every last American serviceman from Korea, and Viet Nam and, yes, even World War II, for America can never move forward by leaving even one missing son behind. 
Many of you here today were their comrades-in-arms--in Italy and France; in Germany and Japan. You fought the same battles. You flew the same missions. You sacrificed for the same noble cause. All of you were different. You came from different states and different backgrounds, but you shared one thing in common: you loved America; you were willing to die for freedom. 
And so, to you also, we offer our love, our thanks, and our promise that we will never forget not only those who died and those who returned, but those who fate is still unknown. 
And we promise to remember something more: We promise to remember that peace is a fragile thing; that strength is the only way to avoid war; and that freedom is always just one generation away from extinction. 
If we remember those things, no future American generation will be required, as you were, to place themselves in harm's way to secure for their posterity the benefits and blessings of freedom. 
Before I close, I'd like to mention one last thing, and that's my thanks to the American Legion who has stood steadfast and determined in the fight to account for every American from every war who is still a prisoner or missing in action. 
I thank them for that, and all the other sponsors of today's ceremony. May this marker we dedicate today, forever guard the memory of those who are gone; salute the courage of those who returned, and stand like a beacon of hope for every American whose homecoming we still await. 
God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Inhofe amendment. Clearly, the FAA will be against this amendment because they will not voluntarily relinquish anything in terms of regulatory authority. I believe this amendment is reasonable. It provides, in essence, due process for pilots who do have their privileges revoked, with attention given to safety. It really assures accountability within the FAA. 
As a pilot who has been witness to the potential abuses--and the Senator from Oklahoma has demonstrated several well-documented examples of how the FAA has really unfairly used a necessary power to prematurely revoke certificates--this amendment will address the issue while assuring accountability. 
I rise in support of the amendment, a more reasonable approach which assures accountability and assures due process.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the achievement of Mr. Sam Howard, Chief Executive Officer of Phoenix Healthcare Corporation, who was recently selected to serve as Chairman of the Nashville Chamber of Commerce. Aside from the general prestige which accompanies attaining such an honor, Mr. Howard bears the distinction of being the first African American to hold this position. His talent and skills will certainly benefit the city of Nashville. 
As the first African American to hold this position, Mr. Howard has a unique opportunity to encourage minority membership within the Chamber of Commerce and to promote minority entrepreneurs. The Urban Journal's July 1, 1998 edition highlighted Mr. Howard's top goals, including the development of a foreign trade mission, as well as focusing attention on public education and investments in the field of biomedicine and biotechnology. 
Mr. Howard serves with me as a member of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. The Commission has held a number of field hearings in Tennessee to gather the views and concerns of industry leaders and beneficiaries in the state. Mr. Howard's perspective as CEO of a health maintenance organization, which contracts with companies, Medicare and the TennCare program, is appropriate and useful for the Commission's goal of identifying challenges facing the Medicare program and for creating potential solutions. 
Mr. President, I congratulate Mr. Howard on this worthy achievement and thank him for serving as a role model for the next generation. I am proud of his optimistic view toward life, and his perseverance and dedication toward overcoming obstacles. I wish him well throughout his tenure as Chairman of the Nashville Chamber of Commerce.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to really cut through a lot of the emotion and a lot of the rhetoric and really bring together how I view this particular issue. And really I will take very few minutes because, to me, it becomes very clear once the facts are put on the table. 
I speak as a U.S. Senator, as someone who understands an obligation to his fellow man, as being a trustee in the U.S. Senate to the American people; but I also want to speak as a physician, one who has spent his entire adult life in the practice of medicine, reaching out to people, being trained at hospitals across this country, exposed to accepted therapeutic procedures, understanding what peer review is about, and to let you know how I assess where we are today. 
It really comes down to a single statement, which is as follows: Partial-birth abortion should never--should never--be performed, because it is needlessly risky to the woman, because it is an unnecessary procedure, because it is inhumane to the fetus, and because it is medically unacceptable and offends the very basic civil sensibilities of people all across this country. 
Several points. No. 1, there has been this whole myth of how common this procedure is. Let me just say that the procedure is being done today as we speak. Initially, it was billed as being a very rare procedure, that really just a handful are being done, and therefore we don't need Federal legislation. Well, one of the byproducts of this ongoing debate over the last 2 1/2 to 3 years has been that we know this procedure is being performed every day. In fact, we looked at information that has come out and we know that one facility has reported almost 1,500 of these in 1 year. One physician reported doing more than 700 of these procedures, and another, over 2,000 of these procedures. Remember, these are brutal procedures. 
A second point. This procedure has been defined on the floor, and it will be defined again, because it is important for people to understand what a brutal procedure this is. But an equally important point is that this procedure poses substantial risk for the mother, for the woman. It is a dangerous procedure being performed every day on the fringe, outside of mainstream medicine. 
It is important for people to understand that this procedure is not taught in any medical school in the United States of America. It is important for the American people to understand that generally accepted textbooks do not even mention this procedure. It is not defined. It is important for America to understand that there are no peer-reviewed, credible studies on partial-birth abortion that evaluate in any way its safety. It is important for the American people to know that our OB/GYN, obstetrics/gynecologic, residencies who train residents to deliver babies in the future do not have this procedure as a part of their curriculum. Why? Because it is dangerous, it is fringe, outside of the mainstream. It has not been evaluated. Yet, it goes on every day, hurting women all across this country. 
What are the complications? Well, there are a number of standard complications that occur during a third-trimester abortion. That includes perforation of that organ, the uterus, which contains the fetus. There is a second risk of infection when an abortion is performed in that third trimester. There is a third, and that is of bleeding. But, in addition, because the 
way this procedure--this fringe, brutal procedure--is performed--and remember, it is performed in a blind way, with the hand inserted into the uterus with scissors thrust up underneath that head and into the base of the skull. That is all done blindly, in a uterus which is large, containing the fetus, which is engorged, has huge blood vessels within a centimeter of where these scissors are blindly being thrust into the base of the skull. 
I describe it that way because that is the reality, and the risk is there for this procedure, and it is not for other types of procedures, of laceration, of hemorrhage, of bleeding, of having those scissors nick one of those blood vessels and have the patient suffer. One of the problems is because these procedures are not performed at the Massachusetts General Hospital where I practiced, or Vanderbilt Medical Center where I practiced, or Stanford Medical Center where I practiced, where there is peer review, where people are looking in. And because these procedures are performed in clinics not subjected to peer review, we never hear about those complications. But the complications are there, and hospitals see these patients admitted after this procedure. It is a dangerous procedure. The risks are there to women. Yet, we as an American people have allowed that to occur all across this country. 
A third point. This really applies, I think, and enters the field of ethical considerations, which is what we do to the fetus. Remember, the fetus is very far along. This is just prior to delivery of that infant. I want to make this point, and I don't want to dwell on the point, but that taking of scissors and thrusting it into the base of the skull, the expansion of those scissors and the ultimate evacuation of the brain, those contents, is painful to that infant. That infant feels that pain. Thus, it is an inhumane procedure in which no specific pain management is given, and that forcible incising of the cranium, or head, is painful. 
Fourth point. This procedure is unnecessary. It is never --never--the only option. According to the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, who will be referred to again and again, `We could identify no circumstance under which this procedure would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of the woman.' That statement is a very important one because it basically says this is an unnecessary procedure. 
There will be colleagues to follow--and there will be comments by many of my colleagues--saying, `Yes, that is right. We can't identify any particular circumstance where there is not a safer accepted mainstream procedure that could be used.' But I don't like the Federal Government doing anything and saying it is against the law to do any particular procedure, even if you could find it in detail like you have. I don't want them coming in just in the event something will come up. 
Again, let me go back. This is a fringe procedure. It is out of the mainstream, not subjected to peer review. We know it is dangerous. There are always alternative procedures available. 
It is a common procedure performed frequently. It is a dangerous procedure--dangerous to the woman. It is an inhumane procedure thrusting those scissors into that fetus' head. It is an unnecessary procedure. Never is it the only option. Alternative procedures are always available. 
Over the last couple of years as I have studied this issue, a lot of things have been made apparent to me. We need data collection. We need peer review of these sort of fringe procedures that are performed outside of the mainstream. 
There has been, I believe, extraordinary medical consensus that has come forward. It was difficult 2 1/2 or 3 years ago, because physicians who are trained in our 125 academic and medical centers and medical schools have never been exposed to this procedure. It is only the fringe physicians in clinics outside of the major hospitals doing the procedure. Most people didn't know what a partial-birth abortion was. We have educated physicians. We have educated people in the health care arena. And, as a product of that, there has been this extraordinary medical consensus that has emerged. 
Yes, on the floor you can always hear people who stand up and say, `We are against the Federal legislation because it infringes on our right to make decisions about our patients.' They don't come out and defend the procedure. 
We need to come back again and again and recognize that this is not a debate about pro-life, or pro-choice, or abortion to me in any way. Because of the way the bill is written, it focuses very narrowly on a specific procedure that is unnecessary. 
Mr. President, I look forward to coming back and continuing our discussion. I know we have a number of people on the floor who want to speak on this particular issue. 
But let me just close with one final comment before turning back to the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from New Hampshire, who have done an outstanding job in terms of leadership, and say once again that partial-birth abortion should never be performed because it is needless risk, it is inhumane, it is ethically unacceptable, and it is totally unnecessary.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to ask the Senate to go on record and ask the President to use all of the powers available to him to end the Northwest Airlines strike. 
As many of my colleagues are already aware, Northwest Airlines Pilots have been on strike since the 29th of August. At this time there are no talks between pilots and management. Additionally, the management of Northwest Airlines insists that they have made their `final' offer. 
Northwest Airlines loses a minimum of $27 million a day in lost revenue. Additional costs are incurred from placing booked passengers on other airlines. The first ten days of the strike are expected to cost the U.S. economy over $700 million. Further, Northwest is temporarily laying off as many as 30,000 workers by the end of this week. 
Northwest and Northwest Airlink have 552 departures in Tennessee. This is nearly half of Tennessee's air service. Every major city in Tennessee is affected by the Northwest Airlines strike: Jackson, Tennessee has lost 100 percent of its service, Memphis has lost 77 percent, and Knoxville 11 percent. The strike left over 9,000 passengers stranded in Tennessee. Approximately 46 percent of stranded travelers will be unable to find travel on other airlines. 
The numbers of people stranded and the money lost are so large that they have become mere abstractions. Behind the numbers and figures exist struggling small businesses, air travelers experiencing ridiculous inconveniences, and real economic loss. All of these people are innocent bystanders held hostage by a dispute that they have nothing to do with. 
For all of the reasons I have outlined, I am submitting a resolution today that asks the President of the United States to act immediately to bring this strike to a quick conclusion. If necessary, the President should not hesitate to create a Presidential Emergency Board to resolve the dispute between the Air Line Pilots Association and Northwest Airlines. Too many people have already suffered as a result of this strike. It is certainly time to advance the common interests of the pilots, passengers, management and bystanders, and end this strike.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of a Sense of the Senate which, with the help of Senators Feingold, DeWine, Ashcroft, and Grams, I have brought before this body in an effort to more clearly define the role of the United States Agency for International Development in the ongoing multinational effort to address the needs of the people of southern Sudan. At least 1.2 million Sudanese are hovering on the brink of starvation, with an additional 1.4 million being targeted by the World Food Program in an effort to stave off the famine conditions which may soon threaten them. 
This Sense of the Senate we offer both urges the President to go forward with a more aggressive approach to our contribution to that effort, and it gives him explicit Senate backing for the efforts which the Administration is already undertaking to that end. The underlying premise of the legislation is simple: the United States' role in that relief effort and in other, proactive self-sufficiency programs has general recognized the constraints placed upon the members of Operation Lifeline Sudan--the United Nations' agreement with the government of Sudan in Khartoum, where the regime holds veto authority over the member's specific deliveries of humanitarian relief. This flawed arrangement has allowed Khartoum to use that very humanitarian relief as a weapon in their war on the South, and with devastating effect. Indeed, the current famine conditions now threatening the lives of over 2 million Sudanese is largely created by the massive disruptions to the fragile agrarian and pastoralist populations in the South these acts of war represent. While the United States should continue to provide relief through the established channels of Operation Lifeline Sudan, it must also seek to use other distribution channels to reach populations to which Khartoum has routinely and with devastating calculation denied relief agencies access. Additionally, the United States must also begin to plan how we can help in preventing future threats of famine. 
To realize these goals and directives, the Sense of the Senate recommends that the President take three specific actions. First, through the Agency for International Development, he should begin to more aggressively utilize relief agencies which distribute famine relief outside the umbrella of Operation Lifeline Sudan, thus unimpaired by the restrictions of Khartoum. Second, the Agency for International Development should begin to incorporate areas of southern Sudan which are outside of Khartoum's control into its overall strategy for sub-Saharan Africa in an effort to prevent future famine conditions and assist in helping the region realize a greater level of self-sufficiency--both in food production and in rule of law. Finally, the President is urged to use the current tentative cease-fire in Sudan, and international attention the famine has created, to push for the United Nations and the State Department to revamp the terms under which Operation Lifeline Sudan operates. It is especially important to guarantee that food cannot be used as a weapon and thus end Khartoum's veto authority over shipments of humanitarian relief in southern Sudan. 
Mr. President, I am grateful for the support this critical piece of legislation has received on both sides of the aisle, and I am especially thankful for the effort and support of the Senators who have cosponsored this Sense of the Senate. It is important that the Administration and the Congress work together to ensure that the United States relief effort is the most effective it can possibly be.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to add my name as a cosponsor to S. 2354, the `Medicare Home Health Beneficiary Act of 1998'. 
This bill amends title XVIII of the Social Security Act to impose a moratorium on the implementation of the Interim Payment System (IPS) for home health agencies. This IPS was set up by Congress at the recommendation of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) as a transition to a Prospective Payment System. However, the IPS, along with surety bond requirements and other regulatory implementations of the Balanced Budget Act, has had a negative influence on the home health care providers and their patients, forcing many providers out of business. 
The IPS has hurt home health care in Tennessee. For example, in Tennessee, the amount of funding each agency receives per patient per year was based on each agency's costs for Fiscal Year 1994. This method of calculation has the potential to penalize agencies who acted responsibly to hold down costs. One Tennessee provider, who had very low 1994 costs due to aggressive cost control, is concerned that the IPS may force them out of business. We cannot afford to sacrifice quality in home health care, and we must not punish agencies that have always tried to provide quality care at reasonable costs. 
In addition, some home health providers who have a good reputation in their communities, built on years of service, did not submit a full cost report for Fiscal Year 1994 due to accounting methods. Regrettably, these agencies are now classified by HCFA as `new agencies.' If the agency is classified as a new agency, then their historic costs are disregarded in their reimbursement, and they will receive a payment based on a national average. Well, Mr. President, we know that the cost of care in Tennessee may be very different from the cost of care in another region. In fact, in Tennessee, home health costs tend to be higher than the national average. This will make it extremely difficult for these agencies to meet the IPS budget constraint. 
Home health care provides a critical service to our nation's Medicare beneficiaries. The IPS was created to address some of the problems with cost control in the home health industry. However, it appears that this interim plan manages to create more problems than it solves. In fact, I believe it can do more harm than good. We need to impose a moratorium on IPS and encourage implementation of a system of fair reimbursement payment rates that ensures all home health providers are cost-effective without sacrificing quality of care for patients. We must find a way to terminate those agencies that take advantage of seniors and the Medicare system, while ensuring continuity of high quality home health care for our nation's most vulnerable populations.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate having the opportunity to offer this amendment which I hope will be accepted by both floor managers on this important Defense bill. 
Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering today would provide $5,000,000 for the Marine Corps within the Operation and Maintenance, Marine Corps account, and $2,000,000 within the Other Procurement, Army ac- 
count for the Army to allow both Service branches to obtain lightweight maintenance enclosures or LMEs for deployment in forward maintenance operations in the field. More specifically, these funds will provide our soldiers and Marines the capability to forward-deploy lightweight, low cost shelter systems that are easy to operate, provide protection for field maintenance operations in difficult environments, and at a cost that is one-quarter the cost of the older model units previously utilized by the Army and Marine Corps. 
The House of Representatives recognized the requirement for these Lightweight Maintenance Enclosures by authorizing the identical level of funding that I am recommending in my amendment, in the House version of the National Defense Authorization bill for fiscal year 1999 (H.R. 3616). In the House Committee report (H. Rept. 105-532), the House National Security Committee stated that the Army identified its requirement for the LMEs after the President's budget request was submitted to the Congress, and therefore authorized funding for LMEs in the House authorization bill. The House also approved a $5,000,000 authorization for the Marine Corps to meet their requirements for LMEs as well. 
Furthermore, Mr. President, the Chief of Staff of the Army, General Dennis Reimer, identified `Soldier Life Support' equipment, including LMEs, as being among the Army's top 10 highest unfunded priorities. 
Unfortunately, despite the authorization in place in the House-passed Defense authorization bill, no appropriations have been provided in either the House or Senate versions of the Defense appropriations bills. Therefore, it is my hope that the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, and his outstanding Ranking Member, Senator Inouye, would be willing to accept this small amendment and take it to conference with the House. Let me quickly say that I would be pleased to work with the two managers of the bill to find appropriate offsets to accommodate this small but important amendment as we head toward conference following final disposition of this bill. 
Finally, we are working vigorously with our counterparts in the House, including Representative Van Hilleary of Tennessee, and Members of the Virginia delegation, including Representative Rick Boucher, to hold the LME authorization levels in conference with the Senate and to, hopefully, pave the way for acceptance of this pending amendment in conference on the Defense appropriations bill. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I would hope that the Senate would approve this amendment today. The funding that I am seeking meets a real soldier life support requirement for both the Army and the Marines. It will allow our soldiers and Marines to have a cost-effective, lightweight, forward-deployed maintenance shelter system that is easy to operate, durable and significantly less expensive than the current, older, less effective shelters and tents that we currently use in the field. For these reasons, I would ask that the Senate approve this modest amendment today.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, honoring those who die in the service of others is a practice as old as life itself. From ancient times to the present day, those who survive pay tribute to those who have fallen with songs and symbols, flowers and ceremonies. 
And it is a good thing, for it is at times like these that words often fail us. Few memorial addresses have outlived those who uttered them--not because of the inadequacy of the speakers, but because of the inadequacy of words themselves. To quote General James A. Garfield, who spoke at the first memorial at Arlington National Cemetery--where Officers Gibson and Chestnut will be buried later this week--`If silence is ever golden, it must be here beside the graves of men whose lives were more significant than speech, and whose death was a poem the music of which can never be sung.' 
John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut were such men, as their countless friends and associates have testified, and so I add my small tribute to the hundreds that have already been offered in the hope that it may, in some small way, console the hearts of those they leave behind. 
Mr. President, long after these men are laid to their final rest, the memory of their warmth and their many kindnesses, their lives and their heroic sacrifice will live on in the hearts and minds of all of us--indeed, of all who visit the soaring symbol of freedom and democracy they died to defend. From this day forward it will stand, like a silent sentry, guarding the memory of their valor and courage. 
May the Almighty god who watches over all of us, comfort and strengthen their wives and children in the days ahead, and may He protect all who place themselves in harm's way so that we may enjoy the blessings and benefits of freedom. 
Mr. President, I thank the chair and yield the floor.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Patients' Bill of Rights, a bill that was introduced last week by my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Don Nickles, and members of the Senate Republican Task Force on Health Care Quality, our distinguished majority leader, Trent Lott, with a total of 47 cosponsors. 
I am really quite pleased with this particular bill. I have had the opportunity to work on the task force because it is a product of months and months of very thoughtful discussion, vigorous debate among ourselves. I think, as most people know, on the task force were some of our most conservative members and some of our most moderate members within our caucus. It really is a consensus proposal to improve health care quality. As a practicing physician, I am absolutely convinced that health care is delivered best when that relationship between the doctor and the patient is given the very highest priority. My goal in this debate, the debate that we will have over the coming weeks, is to do everything possible to empower patients and doctors to be that focal point, to be that place where ultimately the quality of care is decided. 
Much of the debate will center around who is practicing medicine today. Is it bureaucrats in Washington? Is it bureaucrats in health maintenance organizations? Is it bureaucrats in the U.S. Congress? Ultimately, I think that we can address this issue, if in coming together in a bipartisan way with a reasonable, timely voice, with a reasonable thought, come back to that central premise that the doctor and the patient or the nurse and the patient, at the level where that really very intimate interaction is carried out, where one's problems are professed and treatment plans and diagnoses are generated, if we keep coming back to that as being the central focus of the Patients' Bill of Rights in everything that we do over the next several weeks, we will be doing a great service to the public, to all Americans. 
Now, our proposal that has been put forth is grounded on a Patients' Bill of Rights. It offers a number of protections for individuals, for patients, for potential patients, and that is No. 1, by guaranteeing full access to information as to what is in one's health plan. 
If you ask your typical Tennessean or American, you say, what really does your plan cover and what does it not cover, most of us, including me, throw up our hands and say, `I don't know.' If you, going back to my own field, develop a cardiomyopathy and a sick heart, it deteriorates over time and you need a heart transplant, does your plan, I could ask any of my colleagues, cover heart transplants? And they will probably say, `I don't know. I understand it is very expensive. I also understand it could save my life. But I don't know the answer to that question.' 
We need to guarantee full access to everybody. Whether it is a health maintenance organization, a managed care plan, any type of plan, we need to guarantee that patient full access to that information. We do that in our bill. 
Secondly, we do need to make sure that patients receive the necessary emergency care, and it really does boil down to the fact that if a so-called prudent lay person, meaning somebody with average intelligence, common sense, develops chest pain, they don't know whether it is indigestion or a massive heart attack. They go to the emergency room. They should be able to walk into that emergency room and be taken care of without fear that coverage will be denied for that particular service. We address that right up front. We allow patients to keep their doctor during a pregnancy or extended illness even if their doctor for some reason leaves a plan or is terminated from a plan, so-called continuity of care. We allow individual patients direct access to that pediatrician without having to go through a gatekeeper or to that obstetrician or gynecologist without having to go through a gatekeeper first. 
The great fear I think that all of us in America have today, and I think it is the fear that, again, drives much of the debate, is that our health plan will not be there for us if we get sick. If my young 11-year-old son develops a heart murmur, a virus, will there be somebody there to help him? Will that health plan respond to those needs? Or will my HMO deny me seeing the doctor who I feel is the very best person to take care of my son, who I know and people have told me is a better doctor. Will I be denied the opportunity to see that doctor by my health plan? 
Many people fear that they will be denied the benefits they have even paid for and that they have been promised. Others are absolutely convinced today that their health plan cares much more about cost, cares much more about profits, cares much more about the bottom line than about quality. And that is because of the focus on cost and saving money. 
We in this body talk about how we have to slow the cost of health care, we have to reduce health expenditures because of all of those pressures. HMOs have been allowed to go too far. They have not been held accountable. Our bill takes that focus and puts it right on quality, on quality. I say that because you can list 10 rights, and you can list 400 mandates, and you can say we have licked the problem. Unless you come back to focusing on quality, you have made yourself feel good. We have responded to the public sentiment of let's bash the HMOs, but you have done nothing for that next generation, nothing for the overall health care system unless you come back to those two principles: The doctor-patient, the primacy of that doctor-patient interaction, No. 1, and, No. 2, focus on quality. 
Therefore, you will see in the bills that are before us--and there are basically two bills, one from each side of the aisle, although I hope that both sides will end up to some degree through debate coming to a bipartisan agreement, but the bills are very different, and I think that is where the debate is going to have to play out because every day you are exposed on this floor and through press conferences to `Let's kill the HMOs, capture that sentiment, put these mandates on the people and we fix the system.' 
What we have to do as a body is figure out really how to fix the system with the help of the American people, recognize that our health care system is changing and changing dynamically, and what we define as quality is changing dynamically. And thus whatever we do we cannot establish a system through well-intended mandates which rigidify this system and destroy the dynamism that is inherent in the public marketplace, in the private marketplace, in private industry, in Government-run programs today which recognize that quality is a new science, it is an evolving science, it is dynamic, it is energetic, everyday breakthroughs are made on how we determine quality. So let's be very careful and make sure that we, through well-intended mandates, don't come and box in this dynamism which is so important to the future of health care delivery. 
Our bill focuses on quality. Now, any physician today--and I am a physician. I have worked with managed care before coming to the Senate--any physician will tell you that managed care--and we use the word `HMOs' and everybody needs to recognize that managed care is a broad spectrum of entities. But a physician will tell you, anybody who has worked with an HMO, HMOs have gone too far. Not all of them. HMOs too often control the whole issue of what service is covered and what is not, regardless of what that physician may feel is in the best interest of the patient. And that same physician will very quickly tell you that what coverage you are allowed to give that patient ultimately defines the care and the outcome of that patient. 
Therefore, I don't blame my fellow physicians coming forward and saying, listen, I am being held accountable for decisions that I am not even allowed to make, whether it is coverage or admission to a hospital or the number of days in a hospital. I am not making that decision, yet I am held accountable. 
Well, our bill hits this inequity head on. Basically, it says it is not fair. That is inequitable. You, physician, you should not be held accountable. The HMO should be held accountable. 
We need to fix the system. The critical measure of this bill that we have put forward is to hold the health plans accountable for the coverage decisions they make and to take the whole essence and the power of denial of care out of the hands of the HMOs and place it in the hands of the way we fix the system--a strong appeals process internally and a strong external appeals process where decisions can be made by medical experts--yes, physicians--medical experts independent of the plan. 
Our bill requires that health plans make coverage determinations rapidly, quickly, not weeks later or months later or years later. We put some time specifically, actually in the bill; we say it must be made sometime but definitely not later than 72 hours after the request. We want to protect patients, before harm occurs, by setting up a process that is not present in many--I don't know whether to say most or not--but it is simply not present in many of the HMOs today. But it is a process for patients and their families to get an immediate answer over what is covered and what is not covered and, if there is a disagreement, resolution right then and there, not a year later or 5 years later or 2 years later, after whatever potential for harm may occur. 
Furthermore, we require health plans to provide quick internal grievance, as well as these independent, external, appeals processes in areas where there might be some question, like: Is a particular procedure or use of a device investigational or experimental? The whole point is, we need to hold the plans accountable. And we do it by fixing the system. 
Our bill provides protections for patients who rely on health plans that States do not. This will be another issue, but our bill basically says that there are a group of people who are unprotected today. Yes, the purpose of our bill, and where we see the Federal responsibility as being, is to protect the unprotected, the people who, by law, are not being protected by an entity. That is the group that we focus on. We fix the system where it is broken, without this whole issue--which has really captured the attention of the press and really taken focus away from the quality issue, which is the really important issue--this issue about lining the pockets of trial lawyers in the process of the bills that are discussed today. 
We do demand that all 125 million Americans have this strong internal appeals process, grievance process, as well as external appeals process. We want the questions answered up front, when it really matters, and not years later by a trial lawyer. 
Our bill guarantees patients the right to access their own medical information. It gives them the right to make modifications and to amend their medical information if they find something that is incorrect. In addition, we require health plans to inform you of the plan's practices with regard to confidentiality of medical information, with regard to privacy of your medical record. We require health plans to establish safeguards to protect that confidentiality, to protect that privacy, to protect that security of your health information. 
As you can tell, I just believe the heart of the problem that we have today with HMOs is that they focus too much on cost, on the bottom line, without anybody coming in and demanding that they look at quality--quality. Our bill, more than any other bill, focuses on this issue of quality. 
Some believe that quality can be legislated today. It is a subtle issue, but it is a point that I have a real obligation to make because I have been so intimately involved. That is, the science of quality and understanding what quality is today in health care is a relatively young science. It is a science that is maybe 10 years old. I think you can crystallize that by asking yourself, What is quality today? How did I choose my doctor? Did I choose my doctor because I knew that he was a better doctor than the doctor across town? If you feel your doctor is pretty good, step back and ask yourself, Do I really know he is a good doctor? Or is he just a nice guy? Does he just answer the telephone when I call? What are the standards that we, as a society, have to compare one doctor to another doctor? We are entrusting our lives to them for a heart transplant or heart surgery. How do we judge them? The information is not there. The answer is: We don't have the answer. 
Therefore, we as a body have to be very careful before we come in and mandate what quality is, because we don't know what quality is. We are learning about it, but it is an evolving science. It is something we are learning about on an ongoing basis. It is important because one approach mandates quality, the other says let's support and figure out what quality is. That is the Federal responsibility: Let's pull together the private entities, the public entities; let's take advantage of state-of-the-art information systems; let's coordinate this information and determine what quality is and then disseminate that information out so we can educate people broadly so they can answer that very basic question, `Do I have a good doctor or do I not have a good doctor?' Or, `Is that plan a good plan for me and that one a bad plan for me?' 
Mandating data collection: Right now, there are plans being proposed on both sides in the House and Senate that just say let's collect more data, let's have all information from a health plan--demographics and age and gender and outcome and results and patient satisfaction surveys--let's just collect all that data and send it to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. It sounds pretty good, if we knew what it meant, if it didn't mean that a doctor is going to have to sit down and talk to a patient and then go take a piece of paper and fill out a 20-point questionnaire and then give it to a bureaucrat, whom he has had to go out and hire to sit in his office to compile it for a health care plan that has another whole system, to send it to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who gets this data from millions and millions of doctor-patient interactions. And what are we going to do with it? Let's invest in the science of figuring out what we do with it before we mandate the collection. 
Our legislation promotes quality improvement by supporting research, to give patients and physicians better and more useful information to judge quality. Our Patients' Bill of Rights establishes an agency. We call it the Agency for Health Care Quality Research, AHQR. I hate to use those initials, but by the time this debate is finished, I hope everybody in America knows what AHQR is. Its purpose is to foster overall improvement in health care quality through supporting pertinent health sciences research, then disseminating that information through public and private partnerships--pretty simple, pretty straightforward. I believe it is the fundamental problem we have today with managed care, with HMOs, with focusing on dollars, with focusing on the bottom line, because nobody is focusing on quality. 
Some of my colleagues will come forward and say, `You mean as a Republican you want to create a whole new Federal bureaucracy and agency?' The answer is no. We don't do it very well, I think, in Washington. But when we go in one direction, I think it is important to build on the past, and we have done just that. The agency that we propose is built on the platform of a current agency which I feel is doing a very good job. But we take that agency, called the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, we refocus the agency on quality, because quality is the issue today. It may have been `cost' 5 years ago, but it is `quality' today. Then we enhance that agency to become the hub and the driving force of all of the many quality efforts that are going on in Federal programs today. 
There are many different agencies all across this country, Federal agencies, that do focus on health care. They all have--not all of them, but many of them have programs and a little subdivision devoted to quality. Our Agency for Health Care Quality Research will help coordinate all of those many very positive efforts. We will focus on not just HMO quality, where so much of the debate and anger is, but we will focus on quality on the managed care setting, the urban setting, the rural setting, the setting of the solo private practitioner. This agency will have, as its mission, improving quality, and the disseminating of that information to everybody in health care today. 
Thus, if we agree that this fundamental issue on our debate is that HMOs have, to some extent--I don't want to sort of categorize them because I don't think that is fair--but if the debate is that HMOs have ignored quality because of an almost obsession with cost, then let's hit the problem; let's go after how we, as a nation, can improve quality and what is our Federal responsibility. If we are talking about a Patients' Bill of Rights, the ones that we have in our bill are very, very important. But I think the most basic right for a patient is that right to quality health care. That is what our bill, like no other bill, addresses. 
This particular agency has a role that is not to mandate. It is not to mandate a national definition of `quality,' but, rather, it is to support the science that is necessary to provide information to patients so they will know whether or not they are receiving good quality of care, to provide information to physicians so they can compare what they are doing to the next physician and modify their behavior, so they will know what good quality is and modify their behavior so they can deliver better care to all of their patients, 
information to enable employers and individuals to become wise purchasers or wise shoppers of health care based not on cost, or not on cost alone, but on cost and quality. 
The agency will stimulate public-private partnerships to advance and share what we learn about quality. Quality just means different things to different people. It is constantly being refined. As I said, it is just a few years old as a science; therefore, in collaboration with the private sector, the agency will conduct and will coordinate health science research that really will accelerate our understanding of what quality means to clinicians and to patients, how to measure that quality and how to use this information to improve your own health and your own quality of life. 
This agency will have as a major purpose and objective the sharing of this information. We have medical advances that are made daily. We see them in the newspaper; we see them on the news each night when we go home. In truth, many of these discoveries do not make it out into the general practice of medicine for too long. We need to do a better job in narrowing the gap between what we know and what we do, and this agency will accomplish that. 
We need to get the science that we know is good science quicker to the American people by sharing this information among public entities and private entities, and this effective dissemination will be a major purpose of the agency. 
In addition, the agency will develop evidence rating systems to know what a good doctor is, what a good plan is, whether or not the treatment that has been recommended for your diabetes is an effective treatment. 
This agency will play a vital role in facilitating innovative inpatient care in this whole area of new technologies and assessment of new technologies. As chairman of the Science, Technology, and Space Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee and the Public Health and Safety Subcommittee of the Labor Committee, we held hearings and people came before us again and again about new technologies and the confusing methodologies that our Federal Government has set up, that each agency has set up, hoops through which they need to travel before that new technology is disseminated or shared with the American people. 
The agency that we are setting up will establish a consistent methodology with coordination across Federal agencies so that people will know what guidelines they must follow in a consistent way to have technologies evaluated and then appropriately disseminated. 
In its mission to promote and facilitate quality and quality development, this particular agency will have a focus on improved information-based computer systems which are so necessary for quality scoring and which will facilitate informed decisionmaking by providers, by physicians, by nurses, and by patients. The agency will aggressively support the development of these state-of-the-art information systems for health care quality which then can be shared both by the public and the private sector. The setting is important. Again, as I mentioned previously, so much of the discussion today, as we talk about bills of rights, is focused just on health maintenance organizations. 
I think it is important for our colleagues to realize that our bill goes beyond just health maintenance organizations and looks at quality in all different settings. Quality improvement applies to the care that is given in that solo private practitioner's office in the managed care setting or at the health maintenance organization. This agency will understand that part of its mission will be to specifically address quality in rural areas in underserved areas, using such technologies as telemedicine and other long-distance-type technologies. 
Our bill addresses the fact that patients do want to know if they are receiving good care, but compared to what? Statistically accurate, sample-based national surveys will efficiently provide reliable and affordable data without the other approach, which is excessively mandated, overly intrusive, potentially destructive mandatory reporting requirements, which as I have described previously, in the long run take away time from that doctor-patient interaction. 
You simply do not need to have a doctor, after every patient interaction, fill out a questionnaire at every visit and then send that information to Washington. It can be a waste of physician time, taking time away from the patient, and will ultimately drive up what patients have to pay for the care they receive. Our approach is very different. 
As I mentioned, they are sample-based national surveys. We expand the current Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to require that outcomes be measured and reported to Congress so that as a nation--as a nation--we can better determine the state of quality and the cost of quality in our Nation's health care. 
The role of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research is not to mandate national standards of clinical practice. Definitions and measures of quality, as I said, are an evolving science, a science that is critically important to our ability to make educated, informed decisions. 
Another aspect of our bill that is important for our colleagues to understand is a part of the bill--because it is a very important part of the bill--is the strong focus on women's health issues. As a nation, it is time that we focus on diseases and health issues that are faced by women. In our bill we specifically emphasize women's health research and prevention activities at the National Institutes of Health and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The goal is to support the critical role that our public health agencies--the NIH and the CDC--play in providing a broad spectrum of activities to improve women's health. That includes research, screening, prevention, treatment, and education. 
Among others, these provisions in women's health promote basic and clinical research for the aging process in women, for osteoporosis, for breast cancer, Paget's disease, for ovarian cancer. We expand our research efforts in the important area of cardiovascular disease. Many people--in fact, I am sure many of our colleagues--do not realize that the No. 1 killer, cause of death for U.S. women is cardiovascular disease. We need to expand our research efforts there. We do that in our bill. 
Our bill reauthorizes the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening Program which provides crucial screening services for breast and cervical cancers to underserved women. Our bill supports data collection through the National Center for Health Statistics and National Program of Cancer Registries, which are the leading sources of national data on the health status of women. Support of these valuable programs will help ensure scientific progress in our fight against these diseases and will lessen the burden of these diseases on millions of women and their families. 
Another component of our bill which is not in any bill currently before the U.S. Senate except for ours--which is not a part of the Patients' Bill of Rights in the House of Representatives--it is a part of the bill, again, which I feel demonstrates that this piece of legislation is forward thinking; it fulfills our responsibility, I believe, of looking ahead and seeing what obvious challenges there are, challenges that could potentially disrupt the delivery of health care in this country--that is our responsibility--and to respond, and to respond now, before they become potentially debilitating, have a debilitating effect on health care in this country. 
This provision is one--and it is a right--it is one of the Bill of Rights, and it is a right that every woman and every man and every child should be free from the fear that an insurance plan or an HMO will discriminate against them because of a positive genetic test. 
The human genome project, a 15-year, very successful project, initiated by our Federal Government, being carried out in a wonderfully unique public-private partnership, by the year 2005, we will have defined over 3 billion bits of genetic information called DNA which comprise the human genome which explains in large part our genetic makeup--3 
billion bits of information defined over this very successful program. 
We have learned tremendous scientific progress, but it has introduced the fact that once we link these genes to diseases and conditions--and we see it happening almost every day; there was an article in the Washington Post just yesterday about linking several genes with Alzheimer's disease and the onset or when Alzheimer's disease comes being linked to these genes. 
Again, tremendous science, yet it strikes right at the heart of this fear that the information in some way will not be used to help you but will be used to hurt you, that access to that information and the result of whether or not you have that gene will be used by an HMO or an insurance company to deny you coverage, to increase your premium, to use against you that fear in not getting a test, a potentially beneficial test. If you had a test which, with 80 percent predictability, said you were going to have breast cancer, wouldn't you want to know the result of that test? I would, because it means I might get a mammogram once a year instead of once every 2 years, or I might do a breast exam once a week instead of once a month, because we know the earlier diagnosis of best cancer, earlier detection, means earlier treatment, and earlier treatment means cure instead of delay, which means, many times, it cannot be cured. 
The promise of that test will be defeated unless we act, and we act today, to eliminate the fear of genetic discrimination based on genetic tests which are coming online at a rapid pace. Our ability to predict what diseases individuals may be at risk for in the future has caused grave concern that this powerful information--information that affects every one of us in the room; we all have this genetic information; we all carry it in our genes--the fear that that information might be used against you. 
I am really troubled when the Tennessee Breast Cancer Coalition tells me that genetic counselors right now are facing women every day who are afraid to even have these genetic tests performed. Women are avoiding genetic testing due to concerns that they will lose their insurance coverage even though that genetic test might be saving them. We must prohibit discrimination in health insurance against healthy individuals and their families based on genetic information. 
Think about it--3 billion of these little bits of information on a single human genome; we all carry genetic mutations that may place us at risk in the future for some disease, even if we are healthy today. Therefore, each of us is at potential risk for discrimination. 
If I receive a genetic test that shows I am at risk for cancer, diabetes, or heart disease, should this predictive information be used against me or my family? The answer is no. That is a right. We address that right in our bill. I think it an important point because it shows our bill is forward looking, looking to the future, not a set of rigid mandates based on what we think we know about quality today, but we look to the future. 
I want to commend the Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe, whose original bill provided the framework and really the sound principles upon which this legislation is based. She has supported our task force effort and worked with us in a step-by-step way to craft this legislation. I also would like to mention Senator Jeffords, who had the foresight to include these provisions, since we are talking about basic rights. 
Our bill very specifically prohibits health insurers from requiring collection of the results of these predictive genetic tests. It prohibits them from using that information, if they do have it, to deny coverage. And it prohibits insurers from using that information, if they do have it, to adjust rates or to increase rates. 
Preventing genetic discrimination does have enormous implications that I will continue to come back to, and that is improving quality. It improves the quality of care to an individual patient. But also, if one is afraid to have the results of a genetic test released to somebody outside or participate in a large protocol, investigational protocol, that means that research overall into what these tests mean and how they might be beneficial will be slowed down, thus affecting the quality of health care for all Americans. 
Lastly, our bill enhances access and choice of health insurance coverage in a number of ways which we will debate on the floor, areas that increase access to and affordability of health care of several areas, that include provisions which I am very excited about, and that is to allow the self-employed individuals, for the first time, to fully conduct their health care expenses. It only makes sense. We have really been punishing self-employed individuals, not giving them the same tax treatment that somebody has if they are working for a large company. It doesn't make sense. What we want to do is level that playing field and allow these self-employed individuals to fully deduct their health care expenses, just like people who work for large companies. It addresses access, because it means that these self-employed individuals are more likely to go out and enter the insurance market. 
Our bill provides greater flexibility to employees who use the so-called flexible spending accounts to pay for health care. Our bill gives individuals the opportunity to have control over the health care decisions and costs through medical savings accounts. Medical savings accounts allow a patient to access the physician of their choice and to choose the medical treatment that they want if they choose that option. 
As you can tell, our bill contains a lot. The reason that I wanted this afternoon to outline our bill is to make sure that our colleagues spend the next several days looking very carefully at the differences between the two bills that are before us, because the approach is very, very different. Both bills are well intended. I will say that I am very hopeful that we can pass a bill, a strong Bill of Rights. But that Bill of Rights needs to include a right to quality health care for all Americans. Our approach is very, very different. The intentions, I believe, of both bills are the same. 
I am hopeful that we can engage in this debate without too much in the way of rhetoric. There is a lot of rhetoric that has been thrown on the floor here and in press conferences, but I hope we can come back and say this is an important issue. It is not one, really, to play politics with. It is not one to defer to another Congress or to filibuster or to make a part of the next elections. It is the sort of issues that we, as trustees to the American people, have an obligation to address and to address in this Congress. 
Our Patients' Bill of Rights offers all Americans quality improvement based on the foundation of strong science. Our Patients' Bill of Rights offers all Americans patient protection, to access the care they need from the doctor they choose. Our Patient Bill of Rights offers all Americans trust in that doctor-patient relationship, that central point through which I believe quality needs to be defined and health care delivered. We reinstate that trust. Our Patient's Bill of Rights offers all Americans access to more affordable health insurance coverage. Our bill does represent a forward-looking approach to provide for continuous improvement in health care quality, and it meets our goal of assuring that the doctor and the patient define quality--not HMOs, not bureaucrats, not trial attorneys, and not the U.S. Congress.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce the `Patients' Bill of Rights' with my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Don Nickles, the members of the Senate Republican Task Force on Health Care Quality, and our distinguished Majority Leader, Senator Trent Lott. 
This bill is a product of several months of thoughtful discussion and debate among Republican members to reach a consensus proposal to improve health care quality. 
As a physician who has practiced medicine for twenty years, I know that health care is delivered best when the relationship between doctor and patient is given the highest priority. My goal is to provide the necessary support to empower doctors and patients to make important health care decisions. 
This proposal includes a `Patients' Bill of Rights' which offers protection for patients by insuring them full access to information about their health plan; making sure patients receive necessary emergency care; allowing patients to keep their doctor during a pregnancy or extended illness, even if their doctor is dropped by their plan; and allowing patients direct access to obstetric and gynecological care and pediatric care without having to obtain a referral from a gatekeeper. 
Many consumers fear that their health care plans will not give them access to care when they need it most, that they will be denied the benefits they have paid for and been promised, and that their health plans care more about cost than they do about quality. A critical measure of this bill is to hold health plans accountable for the coverage decisions they make and to take the power of denial of care out of the hands of HMOs and place it in the hands of independent medical experts. Our bill requires health plans to make coverage determinations in less than 72 hours if a doctor determines that further delay could jeopardize the life or health of a patient. We want to protect patients before harm occurs by setting up a process for patients and their families to get an immediate answer. Furthermore, we require health plans to provide quick internal grievance and independent external appeals processes in cases where a plan may deny coverage for necessary medical action or because it is an experimental procedure. 
Our bill fills a need by providing protections for patients who rely on plans that states cannot touch. Our bill provides independent review of health plans for 125 million Americans without lining the pockets of trial lawyers in the process. Further litigation serves to divert billions of dollars away from health care and puts in the pockets of trial lawyers. 
Our bill guarantees patients the right to have access to their own medical information and the right to amend their medical information if mistakes are made. We require health plans to inform a patient of the plan's practices to protect the confidentiality of their medical record and requires health plans to establish safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of health information. 
Our bill has a strong focus on quality and a firm commitment to improve quality. Some believe that quality can be legislated. Some here in Washington believe they know how to define quality. Yet the risk of writing today's concept of quality into law, is that it is an evolving science and if we are too rigid, we fail to capture the innovation that improves quality of care and our ability to measure it. 
Our legislation promotes quality improvement by supporting research to give patients and physicians better information regarding quality. The `Patients' Bill of Rights' establishes an Agency for Health Care Quality Research (AHQR), whose purpose is to foster overall improvement in health care quality through supporting pertinent research and disseminating information. The Agency is built on the platform of the current Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, but is refocused and enhanced to become the hub and driving force of federal efforts to improve quality of health care in all practice environments--from managed care to solo private practice, from urban to rural settings, and from federal to non-federal programs. 
The role of the Agency is not to mandate a national definition of quality, but to support the science necessary to provide information to patients regarding the quality of the care they receive; to allow physicians to compare their quality outcomes with their peers; and to enable employers and individuals to be prudent purchasers based on quality. 
The new Agency will build public-private partnerships to advance and share quality measures. Quality means different things to different people. Therefore, in collaboration with the private sector, the Agency shall conduct research that can figure out what quality really means to patients and clinicians, how to measure quality, and what actions can improve care. 
It will promote quality by sharing information. While proven medical advances are made daily, patients wait too long to benefit from these discoveries. We must get the science to the people by better sharing of information and more effective dissemination. The Agency is required to develop evidence-rating systems to help people judge the quality of science. 
The Agency plays an important role in facilitating innovation in patient care with streamlined assessment of new technologies. Patients should benefit from breakthrough technologies sooner, while inefficient methods should be phased out faster. The Agency will be accessible to both private and public entities for technology assessments and will share information on assessment methodologies. 
Currently, quality measurement too often requires manual chart reviews for such simple data as frequently of procedures, infection rates, or other complications. Improved computer systems will advance quality scoring and facilitate decision-making in patient care. The Agency will aggressively support the development of state-of-the-art information systems systems for health care quality. 
While most policy discussions this year are targeting managed care, quality improvement is just as important to the solo private practitioner. The Agency will focus on primary care delivery research to examine how science is translated in the doctor's office. The agency will specifically address quality in rural and other underserved areas by advancing telemedicine services and other distance technologies. 
Most of the many federal health care programs today support some kind of health services research and conduct various quality improvement projects. The Agency shall coordinate these initiatives to avoid disjointed, uncoordinated, or duplicative efforts. 
Finally, this debate is due to the fact that patients want to know if they receive quality health care. But compared to what? Statistically accurate, sample-based national surveys will efficiently provide reliable and affordable data--without excessive, overly intrusive, and potentially destructive, mandatory reporting requirements. This is accomplished through an expansion of the current Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to require that outcomes be measured and reported to Congress so the public may better determine the state of quality, and cost, of the nation's health care. 
The role of the AHQR is not to mandate national standards of clinical practice. Definitions and measures of quality are an evolving science, a science critically important to making educated and appropriate choices in a rapidly changing and dynamic health care system. This bill will go a long way in bridging the gap between what we know and what we do in health care today. 
The bill we are introducing today has a strong focus on women's health issues. On March 6, 1998, I introduced S. 1722, the `Women's Health Research and Prevention Amendments of 1998' with our Majority Leader, Senator Trent Lott, to increase awareness of some of the most pressing diseases and health issues that women in our country face. These provisions, which have been included in the Patients' Bill of Rights Act, focus on women's health research and prevention activities at the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The goal of these provisions is to create greater awareness of women's health issues and to highlight the critical role our public health agencies, the NIH and CDC, play in providing a broad spectrum of activities to improve women's health--including research, screening, prevention, treatment, education, and data collection. 
Among others, these provisions promote basic and clinical research for osteoporosis and breast and ovarian cancer. We expand our research efforts into the underlying causes and prevention of cardiovascular diseases in women--the leading cause of death in U.S. women. The bill reauthorizes the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening Program which provides for crucial screening services for breast and cervical cancers to underserved women and supports data collection through the National Center for Health Statistics and the National Program of Cancer Registries which are the leading sources of national data on the health status of U.S. women. 
The reauthorization of these research programs will help assure scientific progress in our fight against these diseases and will lessen their burden on women and their families. We have the support of nearly the full Senate Labor and Human Resources committee and many members of the United States Senate from both sides of the aisle for these provisions. The level of support for these programs is a testament to the need to combat the disease affecting women and to maintain the crucial health services that help prevent these diseases. 
One of the provisions I am most proud to include in this bill is the prohibition on genetic discrimination in healthy insurance practices. We as a nation must face the fear of discrimination in health insurance practices based on our increasing ability to gather genetic information about ourselves and our families. Our ability to predict what diseases individuals may be at risk for in the future has caused great concern that this powerful information--the information we all carry in our genes--may be used against us. 
I am deeply troubled when I hear from the Tennessee Breast Cancer Coalition that genetic counselors are facing women everyday who are afraid of the consequences of genetic testing. Women are avoiding genetic testing due to concerns about loss of health insurance coverage for themselves or their families--even though a genetic test might reveal that a woman is not at high risk and therefore allow her to make more informed health care choices. 
I am a strong advocate for legislation which would prohibit discrimination in health insurance against healthy individuals and their families based on their genetic information. We all carry genetic mutations that may place us at risk for future disease--therefore we are all at risk for discrimination. If I receive a genetic test which shows I am at risk for cancer, diabetes, or heart disease, should this predictive information be used against me or my family? Particularly when I am currently healthy and, in fact, may never develop the illness? I think the American public has answered quite clearly, `no.' 
The Senate Republican Task Force made the same decision to say `no.' Not only are we addressing the rights of patients today--but we are thinking forward to future concerns of patients. I must commend the efforts of my colleague Senator Snowe whose original bill, S. 89, has provided a framework and the sound principles for the basis of the legislation. She has supported the Task Force effort and worked with us step by step to craft this legislation. I must also commend the members of the Task Force, particularly Senator Jeffords, who had the foresight to include these provisions. 
Our bill prohibits health insurers from collecting genetic information about a patient; prohibits health insurers from using predictive genetic information to deny coverage; prohibits health insurers from using predictive genetic information in setting premiums or rates; and requires health insurers to inform patients of the health plans' confidentiality practices and safeguards in place if a patient wishes to disclose genetic information for purposes of treatment. 
Preventing genetic discrimination has enormous implications for improving the quality of care patients receive. As a physician and researcher, I am particularly concerned that the fear of discrimination will prevent individuals from participating in research studies and therefore hinder the scientific answers we need which hold the promise of higher quality medical care. I am concerned that individuals feel safe taking advantage of new genetic technologies to improve their medical care. 
The goal of our bill is to provide the public with peace of mind. If families or individuals want to undergo genetic testing, this bill will ensure that insurance companies cannot discriminate based on this information. We must act now. Only with these measures can we ensure that knowledge about our genetic heritage will be used to improve our health--and not force us to hide in fear that this information will cause us harm. 
Finally, our bill enhances access and choice of health insurance coverage by increasing access to and affordability of health care. The bill includes provisions to allow self-employed individuals to fully deduct their health care expenses; provides greater flexibility to employees who utilize flexible spending accounts to pay for health care; and gives incentives to individuals to have control over their health care decisions and costs through expansion of the use of Medical Savings Accounts. This option will allow a patient to access the physician of their choice and choose the medical treatment they need without any interference from a gatekeeper. 
The `Patient's Bill of Rights' offers all Americans: quality improvement built on a foundation of science, patient protection to access the care they need from the provider of choice, trust in the health care delivery system, and access to affordable health insurance coverage. I am pleased that this bill represents a forward-looking approach to provide for continuous improvement in health care quality. It meets our goal of assuring that the doctor and patient define quality, not HMOs, not bureaucrats and not trial attorneys.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the bicentennial of the Public Health Service. On July 16, 1798, the Fifth Congress passed, and President John Adams signed, an Act which established the Public Health Service. The Public Health Service was originally established to provide medical care to sick and disabled seamen. Today the scope of their service includes educational activities, the provision of medical care, and activities on the forefront of biomedical research. I commend the members of the Public Health Service not only for their commitment to public health, but also their willingness to serve, and to contribute to the prevention and eradication of diseases. 
Before being elected to the Senate in 1994, I was a heart and lung transplant surgeon for many years. The question I'm most often asked is, `Why would you leave medicine for politics?' My simple answer is: I didn't `leave.' I'm away only for awhile. The deeper answer is that while--on the surface--politics seems so different from medicine, the underlying motivation is exactly the same. Medicine exists to improve the life of another human being. The primacy of the patient is the central focus of all that physicians do. The same can be said of public service and public policy. They exist to serve the best interest of the citizenry. As a physician, I had the opportunity to help one person at a time. As a United States Senator, I have the chance--every day--to improve the lives of millions of Americans in Tennessee and throughout the country, as well as help secure the future of the next generation. 
The Officers of the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service have a long history of service to the American people. For two centuries, the physicians of the Public Health Service have been on the forefront of protecting America from disease. As Fitzhugh Mullen chronicled in his book `Plagues and Politics,' PHS officers have played a leading role in the control of infectious diseases--from plague control measures, to the eradication of smallpox, to the continuing response to outbreaks that threaten the public health, such as Legionnaire's disease and hantavirus. 
As the leader of the Commissioned Corps, the Surgeon General has a critical role in promoting public health. I have been a strong supporter of the position of Surgeon General. I believe America needs a physician who will champion public health messages. We need a physician to focus national and international attention on public health problems. Reports from the Surgeon General have such credibility they are repeated by the media, health professionals, medical journals, and health educators. As chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes affect more Americans, we need a medical voice we can trust to talk to us about the need for prevention. We need a physician to educate the American people about the links between personal behavior and illness. 
In Dr. David Satcher, America's new Surgeon General, we have the voice we need. I had the privilege of knowing Dr. Satcher from his time in Nashville. Because of his knowledge of population-based medicine, family medicine, and public health, he is eminently qualified to be our messenger to the American people on health issues. This past April, I had the privilege of introducing Dr. Satcher when he presented his first Surgeon General's report--a report on tobacco use among US racial and ethnic minority groups. 
Surgeons General have led the fight against smoking for more than 30 years, and I'm pleased to see that the health consequences from tobacco use are also high on Dr. Satcher's agenda. Since the first report on the dangers of smoking by Surgeon General Luther Terry in 1964, there have been 24 reports on smoking, including the latest on smoking and minority populations. This most recent report notes the increasing rates of smoking among African-American and Hispanic teenagers, and cites the need for further research into prevention and cessation activities. Between 1991 and 1997, smoking among African American teenagers increased from 12.6 percent to 22.7 percent--an increase of 80 percent! Among Hispanic teenagers, smoking prevalence increased from 25 percent in 1991 to 34 percent in 1997. But teen smoking is not just a problem among minority populations. In 1997, cigarette smoking among white teenagers was nearly 40 percent--up from 31 percent in 1991. Teen smoking is a public health crisis that must be addressed. 
There has been a great deal of attention given to reaching an agreement with the tobacco companies to reduce teen smoking. There is no silver bullet to stop young people from smoking. It will require a comprehensive approach that addresses three aspects: access, public health, and advertising. 
Today, children and teenagers have ready access to cigarettes. Limiting that access includes everything from raising the price of a pack of cigarettes to restricting their ability to purchase cigarettes--including their access to vending machines. The cost must be high enough to discourage teenagers from smoking, but not high enough to create a black market. 
The second aspect is the need for strong public health initiatives, including research, treatment, and surveillance. We must deal with the issue of nicotine addiction--through a better understanding of the physiology of addiction; through the best research programs--including basic science and behavioral research; and through effective programs that not only keep people from starting, but help them quit. 
The third component is advertising. Society can no longer tolerate the specific targeting of young people by tobacco companies. This raises a Constitutional issue--the freedom to advertise versus what I regard as the wrongful targeting of children--8,9,10,12 years-old--in order to encourage them to smoke. 
In the beginning of the 105th Congress, I was honored to assume the chairmanship of a newly established subcommittee on public health and safety, with jurisdiction over many agencies of the Department of Health and Human Services. In establishing the Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, the Senate recognized the importance of public health. As Chairman, I've been able to bring public awareness to health issues facing this nation and to address the reauthorization of public health programs and agencies. 
This past March, I was pleased to chair a subcommittee hearing on Global Health. We live in a global society. To paraphrase the Institute of Medicine's report, `America's Vital Interest in Global Health,' we can consider no site too remote, no person too removed, and no organism too isolated to affect our citizens. 
Last January, I spent a week on a medical missionary tour of Africa, specifically Kenya, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I was struck by how medical care and services varied--from sophisticated Western-style hospitals with adequate laboratory capacity to small hospitals without electricity and running water. Several of the small hospitals are in remote areas that were virtually impossible to reach, except by small plane. While in Kenya, I heard about an ongoing epidemic of Rift Valley Fever where more than 300 people had already died. I saw first-hand patients with infectious health problems common in much of the world: tuberculosis, HIV, malaria and other parasitic infections. 
The United States is uniquely poised to look beyond our borders and reach out to other countries. As a world leader in medical science, biomedical research, and pharmaceutical drug development, we can play a leadership role in global health issues through our federal agencies. However, the development of an effective global disease surveillance and response network requires the involvement of all countries and a partnership between the public and private sectors. 
This past year, the subcommittee has also addressed the reauthorization of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), the nation's leading agency on health services research. The current debate on health care quality has led us to reexamine the federal role in supporting innovation and promoting quality in health care. We need solutions that are not only based on sound science but also serve the interests of patients. While there are many good private sector initiatives, there is a role for the federal government in implementing biomedical research results. As we reauthorize AHCPR, we will focus on health care quality, public-private partnerships, and advancing the science of quality improvement efforts. 
This past March, I introduced `The Women's Health Research and Prevention Amendments of 1998'--a bill with broad bipartisan support that addresses diseases that affect women. I'm very pleased that, since 1993, we have developed guidelines to include women and minorities in NIH-sponsored trials. However, we must continue to do more. We must continue to review the women's health research agenda as we set research priorities. We need to incorporate new scientific knowledge on women's health. The women's health bill reauthorizes NIH programs for vital research activities into the causes, prevention, and treatment for some of the major diseases affecting women--including osteoporosis, breast and ovarian cancer, heart disease, as well as research into the aging processes of women. Our bill also reauthorizes several programs at the CDC for prevention and education activities on women's health issues. CDC's programs provide critical health services in each of our States to detect, prevent, and diagnose diseases such as breast and cervical cancer. Also, CDC programs--such as those at the National Center for Health Statistics--provide data that can assist us in making informed policy decisions about health care. 
In conjunction with Senators from both sides of the aisle, I introduced `The Health Professions Education Partnerships Act'--a bill that represents an opportunity to help improve the quality of, and access to, health care for millions of Americans. The Bill reauthorizes the programs funded through title VII and title VIII of the Public Health Service Act. For many years, this legislation has helped our nation's schools of health better serve the health needs of their communities, and better prepare the practitioners of the future. The Bill strives to increase the number of health practitioners, including physicians, dentists, and nurses, in underserved areas and to improve the representation of minorities and disadvantaged individuals in the health professions. These programs have often been the assistance of last resort for many disadvantaged students seeking careers in health. 
Equally important is the legislation's goal to meet the need of underserved communities, often in rural or inner-city areas. Programs funded through this bill support the infrastructure which facilitates the training and practice of health care providers in underserved areas. Patients in underserved areas depend on these programs for their health care. Training providers in these areas greatly increases the likelihood that they will work in these areas when they complete their education. The Bill would also allow the Secretary of HHS to make grants to certain health professions schools designated `Centers of Excellence'--to assist these schools in supporting health professions education for under represented minority individuals. To qualify, these schools would: have a significant number of underrepresented minorities enrolled in the school; been effective in assisting minorities to complete their degree programs; and have been effective in recruiting underrepresented minorities as students and as faculty. `Centers of Excellence' are currently designated at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. This bill establishes Hispanic and Native American Centers of Excellence to increase the number of Hispanic and Native American health professionals. 
Mr. President, for the past two centuries, the Public Health Service has been contributing unique ideas, ethics, and skills to public service. I congratulate the Public Health Service as it celebrates 200 years of public health and science. As the Public Health Service rises to meet the challenges of the next 200 years, I know they'll be every bit as successful as they have been in the past.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of the continued funding of the International Space Station. Mr. President, there is no denying that the International Space Station has problems. It has had real problems with the prime contractor, the performance of foreign partners and program management, all of which are acknowledged, but all of which, I repeat, are being addressed by NASA and the U.S. Congress. 
In the Commerce Committee, a price cap was approved for the International Space Station. This price cap, in my opinion, begins to address many of the guiding principles that I have discussed here on the Senate floor--guiding principles which direct our investment in research and development, and that is good science, fiscal accountability, and program effectiveness. This program, indeed, represents a long-term investment, and it is very hard for us on the floor of the U.S. Senate and in this Congress to understand the importance of long-term investments. But this provides a long-term investment in a one-of-a-kind research facility. 
Although the price tag of this facility is approaching $100 billion over the life of the station, the potential of the research to be conducted in this space station is enormous. As a scientist, as one who has conducted research, I understand that there are no guarantees in research. However, if we are to continue to dream, to continue to want to improve the quality of our lives, continue to promote the economic stability of this country, vis-a-vis our neighbors, we must continue to conduct such research, investing long-term. 
The space station will provide a unique environment for research with a complete absence of gravity, allowing new insights into human health that we simply cannot explore today in any environment: research on cardiovascular disease, disease of the heart and the vessels of the body, understanding cancer, understanding hormonal disorders and osteoporosis and how the immune system functions. Yes, we have heard a lot about it in the last several hours--the whole issue of cost. We spent over $20 billion on this effort since its inception in 1985. Since the major redesign and the inclusion of the Russians in 1994, the program has spent an additional $11 billion. These amounts are for development only and don't include the costs associated with the shuttle to visit the Mir station. 
The real question is, Should we sacrifice this $20 billion investment and terminate this project by some action today? By ending this project, we not only forego the importance of research to be conducted aboard the station, but also the technology development that will be necessary to build and operate the space station. 
Research and development simply has played too important a role in the economic vitality of our Nation to put it at such great risk. There are many that expect the next great industry to be space. And, yes; I hope the Senate will soon take up consideration of the Commercial Space Act of 1997 as a new industry. Commercial space accounted for $7 billion in 1995. By one estimate space could be a $120 billion worldwide business by the year 2000. This type of growth will mean substantial changes in how things are currently done. 
Historically, the government has taken the lead on many long-term research projects. Many are high risk. The outcome we simply don't know. The benefits of that research we cannot predict. 
The Federal Government should continue this tradition by continuing to build the International Space Station. However, NASA simply cannot be given a blank check. We, the Members of this body, must continue to hold NASA accountable for good management of the program. 
We must be prepared to deal with the various risks associated with the program. There are many challenges; many we can't predict in assembling the components of the space station. The men and women who will make this happen need and will continue to need the support of the American people. 
There has been much discussion of the report on the Cost Assessment and Validation Task Force. They don't recommend ending the program. They simply say the program plan shall be revised so that it is achievable within the financial resources available. I think Congress should determine what resources are available for the program and allow NASA to complete it accordingly. 
Mr. President, I look forward to the launching of the first element of the station this fall, and I hope that we will soon see the beginning of another successful NASA project. 
Mr. President, I urge support for continued funding of the International Space Station. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced legislation that would elevate Congress' commitment to federally-funded research and development. This critical federal investment, performed throughout our national laboratories, universities, and private industry, is currently fueling 50% of our national economy through improvements in capital and labor productivity. While it is imperative that we reinforce this commitment by raising the funding levels, we must also establish a solid foundation for Congress to evaluate current and future civilian federally-funded research and development programs. 
Now is not the time to let American leadership in science and technology slip. As a Congress and as a nation, we must reaffirm our national commitment to science and technology and redouble our efforts to ensure that funding is not only maintained, but increased as America moves into the next century. Nothing less than the future of our Nation, and our leadership position in the world, depend upon it.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, General Daniel Smith, a builder of civilization in the Tennessee Frontier, will be remembered at his home, Rock Castle in Hendersonville, Tennessee, on October 17, 1998 for his 250th birthday. As a licensed surveyor, Daniel Smith worked with Thomas Walker in 1781 to extend the state lines of North Carolina and Virginia to determine the boundary between the unsettled territories of the future Kentucky and Tennessee. 
After serving as Captain in the Revolutionary War, he received a 3,140 acre land grant from North Carolina as payment for his surveying work and service during the Revolution. In 1784, Daniel Smith brought his family from Virginia to the North Carolina Territory that would become Tennessee. He served as Brigadier General of the Metro District and Secretary of the Territory South of the River Ohio. 
In 1784, Daniel Smith produced the first map of the `Tennessee Government.' As chairman of the committee to draft a state constitution, he is credited with naming the State of Tennessee. He served twice as a United States Senator. I now yield to my colleague from Tennessee.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today I introduce, with my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, the Education Flexibility Amendments of 1998. This bipartisan measure will expand the immensely popular and highly successful Ed-Flex program to all 50 states in the country. As you may know, Ed-Flex is currently a demonstration program, available only to 12 states. Under the Frist-Wyden bill, all states would be allowed to participate in the program and the 12 original states would be permitted to expand Ed-Flex waiver authority to include programs under the Adult Education and Technology for Education Acts. 
As the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Task Force on Education, formed by Budget Chairman Pete Domenici, I heard first-hand accounts of the success of the Ed-Flex program and the need for flexibility for our states that are overburdened by federal requirements. The Commissioner of the Florida Department of Education, Frank Brogan, told the Task Force that it takes 297 state employees to oversee and administer $1 billion in federal funds. In contrast, only 374 employees oversee approximately $7 billion in state funds. Thus, it takes six times as many people to administer a federal dollar as a state dollar. 
Brogan went on to say: 
We at the State and Local level feel the crushing burden caused by too many Federal regulations, procedures, and mandates. Florida spends millions of dollars every year to administer inflexible, categorical Federal programs that divert precious dollars away from raising student achievement. 
This must change. 
Secretary Riley told the Task Force that, `through our Ed-Flex demonstration initiative, we are giving State-level officials broad authority to waive federal requirements that present an obstacle to innovation in their schools.' The Department of Education further notes, ` Ed-Flex can help participating states and local school districts use federal funds in ways that provide maximum support for effective school reform based on challenging academic standards for all students.' 
The National Governors Association has expressed its strong support for the expansion of Ed-Flex. At the NGA Winter Meeting, the Governors expressed their interest in expanding Ed-Flex to all 50 states. At this same meeting, President Clinton also expressed his support for Ed-Flex expansion. 
I pose the following question to my colleagues: who isn't for expanding Ed-Flex? 
Numerous articles have highlighted the innovative reform efforts underway in the Chicago Public School System and have extolled its early successes. Illinois is an Ed-Flex state. Cozette Buckney of the Chicago School System attributes much of the Chicago success to flexibility--the very flexibility offered to states and localities by Ed-Flex. She pleaded, `Let us be accountable to you for getting the results, but give us the flexibility to do it the way that works best for us.' 
According to other Chicago officials: 
One of the frustrating things with Federal assistance that has come in through this process is we oftentimes find our way saying how can we do what we want to do and how can we use federal funding so that we can make sure that it is happening. Most of our initiatives are locally based, locally funded, locally developed by people who have been working in Chicago for many years. We know the system, and we believe we know the things that it needs to have happen in order to improve. So the more flexibility that we have with federal and states funds, the easier it is to make those changes. 
During another Education Task Force hearing, we heard from Texas that they have granted over 4,000 waivers, largely to streamline the paperwork associated with administering and applying for the various federal programs. According to Texas Education Official Madeleine Manigold: 
Ed-Flex has allowed Texas to foster the coordination of programs and streamlining of administration of programs that are actually operated by the United States Department of Education, while maintaining the underlying purpose of the covered federal programs. 
Rest assured, though I support the concept of block grants to states as a means to achieve even greater flexibility, Ed-Flex expansion is NOT a block grant proposal. States may NOT pool funds from various federal education programs, and they must ensure that the underlying purposes of the program in question will continue to be met. Ed-Flex simply allows states some relief from the burgeoning mass of bureaucratic federal regulations and requirements in administering designated federal education programs. 
It's time to bring some common sense to education reform. Ed-Flex is a good first step toward granting states and localities more flexibility in using federal funds in the most effective and efficient way possible. Our states and localities are the engines of change--let's give all of our states the freedom and capability to meet the challenges of education with innovation and creativity.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to advocate better healthcare for Americans and to introduce legislation strengthening the scientific foundation of healthcare quality improvement efforts. Let me make a few introductory comments before summarizing the `Healthcare Quality Enhancement Act of 1998.' 
First, I want to make it clear: all patients deserve better healthcare quality, not just HMO enrollees as recent discussions have most frequently focused on regarding consumer protections. 
All Americans deserve better healthcare. We need healthcare quality improvement that reaches everybody through better healthcare plans, tertiary care centers, fee-for-service solo practices, and all other kinds of patient care. 
We should not wait for another movie like the one titled `As Good as It Gets' to talk about healthcare quality for 70% percent of employees and 86% of Medicare beneficiaries who are not traditional-HMO enrollees. 
Quality of care fundamentally rests on the achievements of biomedical research. We all know that sound science is the best way to improve quality in patient care. All components of the outcome of healthcare can be effectively improved by statistically valid science: health status can be turned around by transplantation when someone's life is in jeopardy due to a diseased organ; social functioning can be improved by shock wave lithotripsy that leads to faster recovery; and patient satisfaction can be better when children with moderate or severe asthma get proper anti-inflammatory treatment. 
While being amazed by the promise of new scientific achievements, few patients realize the implications of abundant and growing production in biomedical research. 
Over the past 20 years, the number of articles indexed annually in the Medline database of the National Library of Medicine nearly doubled. 
Randomized clinical trials are considered sources of the highest quality evidence on the value of a new intervention. Over the past two decades, the number of clinical trials in my own field of cardiology have increased five-fold. 
In health services research, 10 times more clinical trials are published today than 20 years ago (e.g., clinical trials comparing inpatient care with outpatient care, trials of physician profiling and other information interventions). 
But we are falling short in our success to disseminate our findings and influence practice behavior. 
In spite of all these scientific achievements, we cannot further build up biomedical research production for the next millennium if our network for sharing it with practitioners remains on a nineteenth's century level. 
The landmark Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study was published in 1985. This randomized controlled clinical trial validated a scientific achievement almost a decade earlier. The American Diabetes Association published its eye care guidelines for patients with diabetes mellitus in 1988. Today, the national rate for annual diabetic eye exam is still only 38.4%. 
There are more scientific discoveries than ever before, but practical introduction of new scientific discoveries does not seem to be much faster today than it was more than 100 years ago. We need to close the gap between what we know and what we do in healthcare. That requires a federal role in sharing information about what works to improve quality. 
All Americans want better healthcare and the federal government must respond by offering helpful information on quality, channeling scientific evidence to clinicians, and investing in research on improving health services. 
For this reason, today I am introducing legislation to establish the `Agency for Healthcare Quality' which builds on the platform of the current Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research, but refocuses it on quality to become the central figure in our efforts to improve the quality of healthcare. 
Healthcare quality is a matter of personal preference--it means different things to different people. We all remember when healthcare quality became a political showdown, the low back pain guidelines backfired because they were viewed as an attempt to mandate `cook book' medicine, and the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research had a near death experience. 
Over the past three years, since I first came to the United States Senate, I have looked very closely at this agency. The Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, which I chair, has held three hearings to invite public input on this agency. As a result, this legislation responds to many of the past criticisms of the agency. This legislation will take AHCPR--under a new name--to new heights and will establish it as the center of healthcare quality research for the 
country. 
The new Agency for Healthcare Quality will: 
1. promote quality by sharing information. While proven medical advances are made daily, patients are waiting too long to benefit from these discoveries. We must get the science to the people by better sharing of information and more effective dissemination. In addition, the Agency will develop evidence-rating systems to help people in judging the quality of science. 
2. build public-private partnerships to advance and share true quality measures. Quality means different things to different people. In collaboration with the private sector, the Agency shall conduct research that can figure out what quality really means to patients and to clinicians, how to measure quality, and what actions can improve the outcome of healthcare. 
3. report annually on the state of quality, and cost, of the nation's healthcare. Americans want to know if they receive good quality healthcare. But compared to what? Statistically accurate, sample-based national surveys will efficiently provide reliable and affordable data --without excessive, overly intrusive, and potentially destructive mandatory reporting requirements. 
4. aggressively support improved information systems for health quality. Currently, quality measurement too often requires manual chart reviews for such simple data as frequency of procedures, infection rates, or other complications. Improved computer systems will advance quality scoring and facilitate quality-based decision-making in patient treatment. 
5. support primary care research, and address issues of access in underserved areas. While most policy discussions this year are targeting managed care, quality improvement is just as important to the solo private practitioner. The Agency's authority is expanded to support healthcare improvement in all types of office practice--not just managed care. The agency shall specifically address quality in rural and other undeserved areas by advancing telemedicine services which share clinical expertise with more patients. 
6. facilitate innovation in patient care with streamlined evaluation and assessment of new technologies. Patients should benefit from proven breakthrough technologies sooner, while inefficient methods should be phased out faster. Today, manufacturers and distributors of new technologies face major hurdles in trying to secure coverage. The Medicare technology committee has been particularly criticized for its process. Criteria are unclear, delays are long, and decisions are unpredictable. The Agency will be accessible to both private and public entities for technology assessments and will share information on assessment methodologies. 
7. coordinate quality improvement efforts of the government. Most of the many federal healthcare programs today support some kind of health services research and conduct various quality improvement projects. The Agency shall coordinate these many initiatives to avoid disjointed, uncoordinated, or duplicative efforts. 
In summary, we need to practice, not just publish, better patient care. We all want to see better quality. 
Real improvement can come from progress in health sciences, from promoting innovation in patient care, and from better practical application of new scientific advances. The Agency for Healthcare Quality will focus on overall improvement in healthcare and enable us to judge the quality of care we receive. 
Americans want better healthcare and the federal government shall respond by offering helpful information on quality, channeling scientific evidence to clinicians, and investing in research on improving health services. 
Mr. President the `Healthcare Quality Enhancement Act of 1998' will reduce the gap between what we know and what we do in healthcare. The refocused Agency for Healthcare Quality is the right step forward and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to improve healthcare for all Americans.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S.J. Res. 50, which I joined the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, in introducing. This resolution expresses the Senate's disapproval of the rule submitted by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) on June 1, 1998, which requires the acquisition of surety bonds for home health agencies under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. HCFA's rule endangers the existence of small and non-hospital based home health agencies because of the excessive expenses and requirements that are created by this rule. I am concerned that patients will lose access to agencies where they can attain home health services and that many employees will lose jobs because of the financial stress that is created by this rule. 
Even the two Congressional leaders, Pete Stark and Karen Thurman, who introduced the surety bond regulations, realize that the requirements have gone beyond the original intent of Congress. The initial requirement system was based on the successful Medicaid program in Florida, yet the new requirements proposed by HCFA do not only penalize potentially harmful providers but also many of the health care agencies that deliver essential high-quality care. HCFA's proposal differs from the successful Florida model in many ways. In Florida, bond requirements were required to be capped at $50,000, yet agencies under the HCFA proposal must purchase 15 percent of its Medicare reimbursement the previous year or $50,000 worth of bonds, whichever is greater. 
A report done by the United States Small Business Administration in its April 15, 1998 letter asking HCFA to remove the 15 percent provision in the surety bond regulation recognizes that HCFA failed to comply with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which requires agencies to account for the impact of a proposal on all small entities and to consider alternatives to reduce the burden on those agencies. This report states that HCFA did not conduct regulatory flexibility analysis of the proposal's impact on small entities. HCFA was not monitoring the impact of this regulation on all small home health providers but only those with `aberrant billing practices.' Therefore, many of the high-quality small home health care agencies are being pushed out of the health care sector because of the outrageous bond requirements. 
HCFA also requires all home health care agencies to buy surety bonds regardless of their credit history, whereas in Florida those agencies with at least one year in the Medicare program and no payment history problems were exempted. HCFA also requires these companies to secure bonds every year regardless of performance. These excessive requirements and costs will push many smaller, freestanding home health agencies out of business. If these companies are forced to shut down, the elderly and disabled will lose these essential services. For, this rule should prevent fraud, yet it should not penalize the law-abiding companies for the abuses of less than 1% of the agencies. 
Since this rule submitted by HCFA seems to impose conditions that go beyond those bonding companies bear in the course of their normal business, many surety companies are not offering bonds to Medicare home health agencies. Even those offering bonds are creating a prohibitive cost or demanding collateral equal to the face value of the bond or personal guarantees that exceed the face value of the bond. Because of the effects of this rule, small and non-hospital based agencies now risk loss of their Medicare provider number, and their employees and Medicare patients can also be adversely effected. 
The capitalization requirement in HCFA's proposal creates a barrier to market entry because entry is based on factors such as overhead costs, location, profit margins, and competition in the area. 
With all of these expenses and requirements, one would assume that only health care agencies that have abused the system would be required to abide by this rule. Yet, this system penalizes small home health care agencies that have been serving the elderly and disabled with high-quality for years. This rule should prevent fraud, not limit the access to care for those serviced by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Because this rule will hurt many small home health care agencies with these exorbitant expenses and requirements, and therefore cause many elderly and disabled people to lose access to health care, I strongly suggest that this rule submitted by HCFA be reworked with consideration given to these responsible, small health care providers that provide essential services for thousands of U.S. citizens.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National Bone Marrow Registry Reauthorization Act of 1998. Transplantation of bone marrow is a procedure that offers hope to patients and their families and has saved the lives of many patients with leukemia and other life threatening conditions. As a physician, I know first-hand the heartache of waiting for a donor, and how the gift of bone marrow can change a patient's life. Of patients needing bone marrow transplants, 70% do not have a family member with matching bone marrow. These patients must rely on an unrelated donor. The National Marrow Donor Registry helps patients needing a bone marrow transplant find that unrelated donor with matching bone marrow. 
Since its inception in 1987, the National Marrow Donor Program has grown to include more than 3 million volunteers willing to donate bone marrow to an unrelated patient. The program has facilitated over 6,500 marrow transplants around the world. The annual number of transplants rose from 840 in 1994 to over 1,280 in 1997. 
This bill is companion legislation to H.R.2202, introduced by Congressman Bill Young which has 218 co-sponsors. Congressman Bill Young helped found the National Marrow Donor Program and has long been a champion of bone marrow transplantation. The companion House bill was unanimously voice voted out of the House Commerce Committee on May 14 and was unanimously passed by the House of Representatives on May 19, 1998. This kind of bipartisan support stems from the enormous need for this program. In this short legislative year, it is a must-pass bill. 
The statutory authority for the legislation expired in 1994. An Act reauthorizing both the solid organ and bone marrow programs passed the Senate in 1996, but failed to pass the House. 
This bill is the result of a collaborative effort by the House and Senate to reauthorize the National Bone Marrow Registry. In April, during National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week, the Senate Labor Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety and the House Commerce Subcommittee on Health and Environment held a joint hearing on increasing bone marrow donation and transplantation. During the hearing, we heard from patients and their families, including testimony from Robert Wedge, a young man who continues to wait for a matching donor to be found. Robert's brother, Cornell, is a member of my staff. Our office has partnered with his loving family and the Congressional Black Caucus to hold a bone marrow drive here in Congress. We also heard from a father whose son's life was saved by a bone marrow transplant. We heard from professionals involved in the operation of the program, and the message throughout the hearing was consistent. The need for bone marrow donation is urgent, and we must continue to address the unique issues surrounding recruitment and transplantation of bone marrow among minorities. 
The National Bone Marrow Registry clearly helps save lives. However, there is room for improvement in recruitment of donors and in the services provided to patients needing transplant. 
Racial and ethnic minority populations are underrepresented in the Registry. The registry is working to increase the number of racial and ethnic minority donors. Today, the Registry includes more than 700,000 minority volunteers, a growth of almost 150%. However, more potential donors are needed before the probability of a match for a minority patient is comparable to that of a patient who is not a minority. This bill addresses the need for increasing the number and availability of minority donors. By directing special attention to informational and educational activities to recruit minority donors, including African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans, and those of mixed racial heritage, the registry will increase the number of potential donors and help save lives. 
To help patients and their families with the search for a bone marrow donor, the bill also establishes an Office of Patient Advocacy. The office will provide information to patients about the search process, the costs of the transplants, and patient outcomes at different transplant centers, and will also help resolve difficulties with the transplant process. 
To facilitate donation, the bill will provide services for those volunteering as potential donors. Activities will help keep the registry of donors up-to-date, and case-management services will be provided to those donors who may be suitably matched to a patient needing bone marrow. 
Bone marrow transplantation is a proven life-saving procedure. In recent years, the same type of blood cells used in transplants have been found in the umbilical cord after a baby is delivered. Using cells from umbilical cords may provide an alternative source of cells, but many questions, including those of ethics and safety, need to be answered. In 1996, the National Institutes of Health began a five-year, multi-center study to see if the use of umbilical cord blood cells is a safe and effective alternative to bone marrow transplantation for children and adults with a variety of cancers, blood diseases, and genetic disorders. The ongoing study includes a review of the data throughout the investigation. 
The current bill does not include the use of umbilical cord blood cells, but the report language for the House bill includes a request that the Secretary of Health and Human Services keep the appropriate Congressional Subcommittees informed of advances in knowledge about the uses of blood cells from umbilical cords. If the study addresses the concerns about the use of blood cells from umbilical cords, we can then proceed to address possible expansion of the Registry to include this source of blood cells. 
The bill also proposes a significant increase in funds to carry out the activities for recruitment and retention of potential donors, and for the patients needing transplants and their families. As I noted earlier, the current authorization expired in 1994. The bill proposes authorization of the program at $18 million (an increase from $15.27 million appropriated in fiscal year 1998).

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the course of today we will continue our discussions and debate on the pending tobacco legislation, a topic that has been the focus of much of our activity over the past several weeks, a focus which I hope will become increasingly addressed over this week. I ask that amendments that are talked about being introduced are actually brought to the floor so that they can be debated. We have legislation in the Chamber that has a fascinating history, legislation that continues to evolve, legislation that I believe is very important as we stay focused on that goal of decreasing, and maybe even someday eliminating, youth smoking. 
I am concerned that we have gotten off track in our consideration of what I believe has to be comprehensive tobacco legislation. There are some people who would just like to establish a tax and have funds to go possibly to public health, but also to many other issues totally unrelated to what our focus should be, and that is youth smoking. There are others who say we need to address just the advertising aspects of this particular bill. There are others who say that we look at just vending machines; and there are others who say we can solve this whole problem by looking at just the public health initiatives of behavioral change, of figuring out what causes addiction. 
I for one believe we need to address all of these issues, and we run the danger, maybe for political reasons, maybe for selfish reasons, of taking a bill that did start as a comprehensive bill and stripping away certain things so that we will end up with just a tax or just a public health initiative or just an issue of access itself, and I think we need to do all of that. 
As to youth smoking, we have talked again and again over the last 2 weeks about the alarming statistics of youth smoking. The one statistic that seems to stick with people is one that is real, and that is that over the course of today, between now and tomorrow morning, 3,000 kids, underaged children, will start smoking for all sorts of reasons. 
We know it is peer pressure, we know it is advertising, we know it is access, we know that it is looking cool; but regardless, the bottom line is that 3,000 kids who were not smoking yesterday by the end of today will be smoking. 
What has become increasingly clear and possibly covered up by the industry, in part--confused by politics--is that 1,000 of those 3,000 will become addicted to smoking, and by being addicted, it means your body becomes dependent on that, it is out of your control, to a large extent because of physiological responses. But, regardless, the bottom line is that one out of every three of those children, the age of my children, 15, 12, 11, 10 years of age, who start smoking today, one out of three will die prematurely; that is, die earlier than they would--of lung disease, of cancer, of emphysema--earlier than they would have if they hadn't started smoking. 
So, the problem is very, very clear today, much clearer than it was even 5 years ago or 10 years ago. Therefore, I think it is useful to stick with that statistic. You can argue the statistic, but the bottom line is that 1,000 children who start smoking today will die prematurely. 
The other two out of three children may or may not continue smoking. They may not be affected, because it is not crystal clear that smoking 100 percent of the time causes cancer. But we know that it has a very, very strong influence on whatever our genetic predisposition is to cancer, all sorts of cancer, and to heart disease which--as a heart surgeon and heart specialist, I have operated on thousands and thousands and thousands of people whose heart disease I would attribute--to genetics? yes, but also in large part to smoking. 
Focus on the health of our children and their children. Many of us in this Chamber do have children who are in those teenage years. A fascinating statistic is that about half of the people who start smoking, half of all people who start smoking today, are 8 years old, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 years of age. Half of all people who start smoking today in this country are 14 years of age and younger. That is very different from in the past. I think in large part that does come from the fact that that group of people have been targeted in recent years, over the last 5 or 10 years--unlike 20 years ago--because if you can addict people at that age, they will not only purchase more cigarettes as youths but, because of their addiction, over their entire lifetimes. 
This whole passage through adolescence is something which really confuses the issue. It would be much easier if we said let's stop everybody from smoking, because then you could really engage in huge, huge policy. But if you really stay focused on the youth, it introduces all sorts of factors that may not apply later: Advertising, how we advertise to youth--is it just Joe Camel, or is it other seductive types of advertising? And then, how you separate that advertising from broader-scale advertising, something that we cannot do in the U.S. Senate or the U.S. Congress. I believe it does almost demand participation by the industry, to agree that somebody 8 years of age or 10 years of age or 12 years of age should not be targeted by such advertising, which clearly results in a crippling addiction which will ultimately kill that child later in life. 
For many years, individuals, if we look at the history, have not been successful in suing the tobacco industry because of a doctrine called assumption of risk doctrine. No jury would side with a plaintiff, because the smoker had assumed the risk associated with smoking. 
However, if we review very briefly this recent history, over the last several months a group of State attorneys general got together and starting suing the industry to recover Medicaid costs, Medicaid costs being principally incurred by a State, because two-thirds of Medicaid funds are paid for by the State and about a third from the Federal Government. And therefore it was the State attorneys general. The Medicaid Program is our joint State-Federal partnership program that is directed at health care for our indigent population, a population that falls below the poverty level. That is why this grassroots effort, now elevated to this body, started at the State level. The State attorneys general got together to recover the Medicaid--predominantly State--costs for smoking-related illnesses, thus avoiding this whole doctrine called the assumption of risk doctrine. 
It has been fascinating, because in the course of these lawsuits, and in large part because of the lawsuits--and we have seen it unfold before committees here in the U.S. Congress as well--internal industry documents have been made public. They have been made public for the first time and are now on the Internet, accessible to the media, to committees here in the U.S. Senate, as well as to people who are, on their own, on the Internet; they have access to these documents today. 
It is very clear the industry knew a lot more about the science--that is, the addictive nature of nicotine--than they had let on, that they knew a lot more about the destructive effects of smoking tobacco than was ever previously thought. 
The focus of the discussion today, which really demands that we address the issue, is that the debate no longer is that 
smoking may be harmful to your health, as it was 20 years ago--we know that it is harmful to your health--the debate that we need to address in the U.S. Senate, however, is the youth smoking, where one really doesn't engage in free choice to start smoking at 10 or 11 or 12 years of age. That free choice can be targeted, can be shifted by very aggressive marketing. And that is what has been done today. 
If we look back again a few months, some of these States began to settle for huge sums from the tobacco industry. Mississippi, as we know, just 2 years ago settled for $3 billion; Florida and Texas were the next to settle, for $11.5 billion and $15.3 billion, respectively. And then just last month, Minnesota, the most recent to settle, settled for about $6.6 billion. Look a few months later and how all of this evolved. In the Spring of 1997, interested parties came to the bargaining table. I say `interested parties,' because you really did have the public health advocates at the table: You had the State attorneys general representing the Medicaid population, representing the expense of the States at the table; you had the industry--something which we don't have today in the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Senate--we had the industry actually at the table, coming to certain agreements. 
Let me add very quickly, it was fascinating, because I am from a tobacco State; we have 23,000 hard-working women and men and farming families who work very hard, get up every morning to produce a legal product in this country. It is interesting, in this great agreement--I guess I should qualify `great'--in this historic agreement, the tobacco farmers and the agricultural community were not represented at that table. 
Regardless, the other three groups--the public health group, the industry itself, the attorneys general--sat down, and the basic elements of that, and I would say historic, June 20 settlement included a number of things: No. 1, industry payments of $368.5 billion, agreed to by industry, members of the plaintiffs' bar, the attorneys general, and the public health groups. That $368.5 billion was to be paid over about 25 years. It would be funded by what calculated out to be raising the price of cigarettes by 70 cents per pack over a 10-year period. 
Second, an important component, I believe, is the advertising restrictions. The industry came forward and said that, we will voluntarily limit our first amendment rights by refocusing advertising, if the remaining aspects of that agreement would go into effect. 
Third, there were youth access provisions and really some pretty tough licensing requirements for retailers who sell tobacco. All of us know the problem we have with access today. If you go into any community and ask a young 16-year-old or 15-year-old, `Could you get a pack of cigarettes?' they would say, `Yes, without a problem.' 
Fourth, that June 20, 1997, settlement had $2.5 billion per year for smoking cessation programs, public education campaigns, and State enforcement. It gave FDA authority to regulate tobacco and smoking. It had no class action suits or suits by any government entity. It had immunity for the industry from all punitive damages for past actions. Individuals were allowed to bring suits to cover compensatory damages for past conduct and compensatory and punitive damages for future conduct. 
Because that settlement required the enactment of Federal law, it came before the U.S. Congress. 
We are here today in large part because that June 20 settlement requires us to be here or it just doesn't occur. Implementing the provisions of that settlement or implementing provisions similar to it does require Federal legislation. 
We had committees that had jurisdiction over several provisions in this June 20 agreement. Judiciary had a role, the Labor Committee had its expertise in the FDA, the Finance Committee had jurisdiction over international trade aspects, the Commerce Committee had jurisdiction over the liability and interstate commerce expertise, the Agriculture Committee had a keen interest in the effect of this type of really unprecedented legislation on farmers, all of which ultimately were pulled together--at least that expertise was pulled together--through the Commerce Committee and bringing it to the floor to be amended accordingly. 
We are right now in the middle of that amendment process. A number of people are talking about amendments to make the bill better, and the bill was brought to the floor recognizing it was not a perfect bill, that it was important for that amendment process to take place to modify it, to improve it, to make sure that it does achieve the objectives of decreasing youth smoking over time. I encourage my colleagues to come forward to participate with their amendments so we can achieve that objective and, sometime within the next several days or next several weeks, bring this to some resolution. 
I do believe, as I said, it takes a comprehensive approach. I think we do have to address, first, the advertising targeted at children. An article in the Journal of the American Medical Association of February 17 stated very clearly that advertising is more influential than peer pressure in enticing our children to try smoking, and it estimated--and I recognize these estimates are really all over the board--but it estimated that about 700,000 kids a year are affected by advertising. Big debate. We have talked about it a lot over the last several weeks. Is it advertising? Is it peer pressure? How do you control peer pressure at that very tricky age of walking through adolescence? They are inextricably tied together. If you have very effective advertising that makes smoking look cool and makes you part of a group and makes you feel good at 12 years of age, then peer pressure builds. If somebody asks is it peer pressure or advertising, it is very confusing. 
In our business, in the political business, in public service, we know the effects of marketing. We know that kids are targeted, and we know that builds and establishes peer pressure which does affect somebody at that age, in adolescence, when they are reaching out for identity and for security and for acceptance. Therefore, either dealing directly with the industry or indirectly, we have to have the industry agree not to target kids. Our society simply must stop glamorizing smoking in the way that it does today, which increases the peer pressure. This applies to television; it applies to movies; it applies to 30-second spots; it applies to billboards. We have to stop that marketing directly to children, and I believe the industry has to take the lead in that regard. 
Secondly, to have a truly comprehensive program, we do have to have a strong public health initiative, including tobacco-related research, including tobacco-related treatment, and including tobacco-related surveillance. It is fascinating in terms of how we would use certain moneys, because a number of people want to use certain moneys for programs totally unrelated 
to public health initiatives, totally unrelated to research. 
If we just step back and imagine what could be done if moneys were spent effectively and if there were appropriate moneys available for research, we might--we just might--in 5 years, in 10 years, maybe 3 years, eliminate the problem. For example, if we knew where in the brain addiction to nicotine actually occurs--and let me say that there are ways to detect that through PET scanning, positron-emission tomography, today--we know roughly in the brain where the addictive center to nicotine actually occurs. 
With the rapid advances made in science, with the appropriate focus and the appropriate resources, it is not far-fetched that we will identify not only the location, where we have taken the first steps, but the actual receptors, and design a drug, a chemical, a hormone to go to that particular site and turn off the addictive potential, the addictive connections that cause that 8-year-old or that 10-year-old who starts to smoke to smoke forever out of their control. 
That one little bit of research could solve this whole problem. We can't give any statistic probability that that research will result in that sort of effect, but the potential is there. It takes that emphasis on that particular dimension, moving there and saying we do need to put the appropriate funds there, that some effort in this comprehensive approach must be directed to research. A strong commitment to basic science and behavioral research is critical. 
Such focused research made possible by this bill might even uncover a pill. I can almost see a day where people will smoke for 6 months or smoke for a year. If we can kill that addictive potential, that 6 months to a year might not have the same impact on one's coronary arteries in the development of atherosclerotic plaques--hardening of the arteries--which cause heart attacks and ultimately death. 
Will we get there? We don't know unless we focus research in that area, and right now we do not have sufficient research there. We do need to look at certain behavioral research: How can we stop people from smoking who are addicted to smoking? We just don't know very much about that. 
Later today, I think we will be talking a lot about drugs, other drugs--not just nicotine, not just cigarettes--and the importance of developing a more comprehensive policy. I welcome that opportunity, again, because I have youngsters. I have three boys, who are going through this period of adolescence, who are going to be tempted and exposed to all of the seductive advertising, peer pressure, wanting to be accepted, that we have all gone through and most of our children go through. 
A comprehensive approach: The research, the scientific research, smoking cessation programs, behavioral research, the addictive potential, the advertising that I spoke to. 
The third component is that of access. It is too easy today. We held hearings in our Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, which I chair, in the Labor Committee and had some really powerful, powerful testimony come forward by the users, by those young adolescents who have started to smoke. We heard chilling testimony about how easy it was to purchase tobacco products. 
We can do a great job in a small community. If there are 12 places where one can buy tobacco, we can have 5 of those really enforce the access laws. Just imagine 12 convenient stores in a community. You can have five that really stick to the law. You can have another five that do pretty well. But if there is just one in that community that continues to sell cigarettes, for whatever reason, the access programs don't work at all. We need to have more effective access. 
Nickita from Baltimore, who is now 18 years old, started smoking when she was 14 years of age. She testified that she would normally get her cigarettes from the store. She testified that she never had a problem buying cigarettes in the store. In fact, `People in my community, as young as 9 years old, go to the store and get cigarettes. They simply do not ask for IDs,' she said. 
The lesson I learned from this testimony is that we must enforce youth access laws. We must make it impossible for children to buy cigarettes in any neighborhood in this country. It is really shameful that in America in 1998 a teenager can purchase tobacco in any neighborhood in the United States of America. 
There are three elements--access, advertising, public health and basic science initiatives. In this whole arena of access, price is an issue. I voted against the tax of $1.50 that was proposed on this floor 2 weeks ago very simply because price addresses one aspect of the three aspects that I think are important to decrease youth smoking. Price does affect purchasing. While it is one of the levels, one of the factors, it is not the only factor. 
Consumption, though, had been decreasing in the 1970s. However, between 1980 and 1993, the downward trend really accelerated, with consumption falling by 3 percent a year at the same time that the inflation-adjusted price of cigarettes increased by 80 percent. 
In addition, in the early 1990s, we saw price cuts, and consumption leveled off with only modest decreases in the price until 1996. Then in 1997, prices rose by 2.3 percent, and consumption fell again by 3 percent. 
Expert testimony provided in hearings before us, based on data from both this country and others, clearly demonstrates that the price of cigarettes does affect consumption. But price alone simply will not solve the problem; that a comprehensive approach is necessary. 
Mr. President, I think the bill on the floor is a good start in addressing, in a comprehensive way, this issue of decreasing youth smoking. It also addresses an issue that was ignored by the June 20 settlement, an issue that I mentioned--that of the agricultural community and that of tobacco farmers. 
We have two competing amendments or proposals right now that are being considered. I am very hopeful that an agreement can be reached between those two. They have very different concepts. On the other hand, both have as their goal to do what is in the best interest of those hard-working men and women who are in the farming community, who, through no fault of their own, we have this targeting of the youth by the industry, who, through no fault of their own, affect this idea of easy access. They are literally getting up every morning, going out, working hard in the fields to produce a legal product. I am very pleased that this group is being addressed. I look forward to having some resolution of the two competing groups. 
Mr. President, I will wrap up my comments shortly because other people are on the floor. I think this bill is not perfect yet. I think we need to look very closely at how we have designated whatever funds are generated by this particular bill and to look at what programs they create. 
The version of the bill on the floor now, unlike the original Commerce version of the bill, is much, much better in that most of the huge bureaucracies that came out of the Commerce Committee bill have been eliminated, have been reduced. I think there are still a number of those programs that we need to go back and address. 
Some people have come to the floor and have basically said that the bill on the floor is merely an attempt to destroy an industry that is producing a legal product by raising the price too much. I think this is a legitimate concern. We have had a countless number of financial experts present data; some have had a vested interest, some have not. A number of them have come before the several committees who have held hearings on this jurisdiction, and it really seems nobody can answer the question of the appropriate price and what a price increase of 50 cents or 70 cents or $1 or $1.50 will do on the industry itself. 
We do know one thing; and that is that the industry at one time agreed, back in June, to a $368.5 billion exchange for some assurances that they would have some predictability in future lawsuits. Now that has been radically changed at the end of 2 weeks ago. We need to all get together to see what that next step should be, what further amendments need to be applied. Again, personally, I believe that the industry has to be at the table, has to agree not to target the youth today. 
Black market--something that is very, very real. If the price is raised too high, at least based on the testimony that has come before our committees, a black market would most certainly occur, and then we would ultimately end up destroying exactly what we are trying to achieve--that is a reduction in youth smoking. 
Mr. President, I guess in closing my remarks I just want to emphasize how effective and responsible we can be if we have a comprehensive settlement. And that is what it is going to take --public health initiatives, appropriate research, addressing the 
issue of access, and addressing the issue of advertising. We must have an industry that does not market to kids. We have to have the cooperation of the industry. 
Mr. President, let me just make one final comment that is on the Food and Drug Administration. I have been very active in working to see that the Food and Drug Administration is the agency that would oversee whatever regulation we pass on the floor of the U.S. Senate and through the U.S. Congress. The approach was to set up a separate chapter within the Food and Drug Administration rather than try to regulate tobacco or cigarettes through a three or four sentence clause that is existing in the device aspects of the Food and Drug Administration legislation today. 
We did this for a number of reasons. I have outlined those reasons on the floor today. I am very pleased where we stand with that today, in terms of setting up a new chapter that recognizes that tobacco really is a unique product. It is not a device to be regulated like a pacemaker or like an artificial heart device or like a laser. And that is where an attempt was made by the administration to regulate tobacco. 
Are there parts of that that might be improved? I think we can consider that as we go through the amendment process. I still have some concerns with some parts of the Commerce bill. I look forward to seeing them modified. 
I think as a heart surgeon, as a lung surgeon, I have a real obligation to point out that smoking does kill people-- there is no question--No. 2, that tobacco is a legal product in this country--and I think it should stay a legal product in this country where adults who have the maturity, have the education to make choices for themselves should have that opportunity--but, thirdly, I feel very strongly that we need to address youth smoking and do our very best as a nation for our children and for that next generation through a comprehensive strategy to work to reduce youth smoking. 
Mr. President, we have two colleagues on the floor, and I would simply ask unanimous consent if they could limit their comments or let me inquire in terms of, from each of them, how long they would require? I would like to have some limitation because we want to get to other amendments early this morning.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as a physician and surgeon, I've had the opportunity to witness everyday the remarkable difference that medical science and technology have made in people's lives. 
In just the short space of time that I've been practicing medicine--less than 20 years--I've seen how the products of medical research and development--lasers, mechanical cardiac assist devices, mechanical valves, automatic internal defibrillators--have not only saved but vastly improved the quality of hundreds of thousands of lives every year. 
And as a physician, I can envision a future in which science and technology will roll back the current frontiers of medical knowledge, identify the causes, and eliminate most of the effects of the diseases that now plague mankind. It's absolutely astounding to contemplate. 
However, as a Senator, I've been afforded a different opportunity. And that's the opportunity to see, and learn, and understand -- not just medicine--but America. And, as a Senator, I can envision the difference that science and technology will make in the life of our Nation. 
Mr. President, as a country of immigrants we are a people drawn from diverse backgrounds and ideas. And there is no doubt that this unique amalgamation is one source of our remarkable strength and resiliency. But as diverse as our individual heritages are, a common thread runs through all of us. That thread is our common heritage as Americans, and it unites and strengthens us as well. 
Our forefathers came to this land to build a new life. Not surprisingly, they in turn created a nation of builders. We build homes. We build communities. We build factories and businesses. But most of all, Mr. President, we build futures--because we also build hope. 
As a people, Americans rise to a challenge. And as a nation --to every challenge we've ever faced. At no time was this more apparent than during World War II when we were forced to make drastic sacrifices to survive. The legacy of those choices has driven our economy and our policies ever since, and one of those legacies is the federal investment in science and technology. 
Science and technology have shaped our world in ways both grand and small. We've put men into space and looked into the farthest corners of the known universe. We've broken the code of the human genome and begun to dismantle previously incurable disease. We've created a virtual world and a whole new realm called cyberspace. Yet, technology also surrounds us in millions of little ways we no longer even notice: the computers that run our cars; the cellular phones that keep us in touch; the stop lights, the grocery store checkouts, the microwaves that help our lives run smoother and faster. 
In my Senate office alone, technology has made a tremendous difference--both in terms of helping me keep in touch with the people of Tennessee, and by helping them access important information. 
For example, while in the past Senators kept in touch by phone, letter, and trips to the state, today I regularly schedule video conferences with Tennessee schools--from the elementary to the university level. In March I spoke to the entire student body of George Washington Elementary School in Kingsport. Certain students were selected by their teachers to ask questions, and the rest watched on closed-circuit television. In April, I visited with students from Austin Peay State University in Clarksville. So, it no longer takes a week-end to speak with my constitutents face-to-face. At 11:50 that morning I was voting on the floor of the United States Senate; at noon, I was having a conversation with students in Tennessee. 
And thanks to the Internet--another remarkable product of federal research funds--this one funded by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)--my Senate Website not only allows me to share my voting record, press releases, and speeches with constituents, it allows them to voice their opinions and concerns and ask questions about issues before the Senate. 
Our office also uses a digital camera--which allows photographs to be downloaded, printed, and disseminated almost instantly. On a recent trip to Bosnia, for instance, I took pictures of our troops from Tennessee, downloaded them into my laptop, e-mailed them to local newspapers in Tennessee, as well as to my Washington office where they were posted on the Web for all to see. The whole process took only a few minutes. 
As we can see, today's world runs on technology, and through its investment in research and development, the federal government has played a significant role in creating it. In fact, more than 56 percent of all basic research is produced with federal funds. 
Much of our economy runs on technology as well. Half of all U.S. economic growth is the result of our technical progress. Technology helps provide new goods and services, new jobs and new capital, even whole new industries. 
Developments in chemicals technology, for example, have lead to the production of new petrochemicals, agrochemicals, food and pharmaceuticals, and advanced health care materials such as those used in skin grafts. 
Information technologies have spawned whole new industry segments in cellular communications, electronic commerce, and global information access. 
The space imaging and remote sensing technology that produced the U.S. Global Positioning System, has in turn become a core technology in several industries key to the U.S. economy, including agriculture, aviation, construction, land use, transportation, and mining. And those industries have themselves produced dramatic advancements. In agriculture alone, GPS- enabled precision farming has allowed more limited applications of pesticides and fertilizers, which in turn have resulted in less environmental damage at lower costs with more precise crop yield determinations. 
Without a doubt, technology is the principal driving force behind our long-term economic growth and our rising standard of living. In fact, according to the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), technology is the single most important factor in sustained economic growth. Not only is the performance of U.S. businesses and their contributions to economic growth directly linked to their use of technology, but as cited in a study conducted by the Department of Commerce, manufacturing businesses that used eight or more advanced technologies grew 14.4 percent more than plants that used none--and, production wages were more than 14 percent higher. 
For any who might still remain unconvinced that our federal investment in science and technology has not produced phenomenal returns, let me give just two quick examples. 
Over the last three decades, the Department of Defense has funded $5 billion in university research in information technology. Those programs alone created one-third to one-half of all major breakthroughs in the computer and communications industries. Today, those businesses account for $500 billion of GDP--a return on our investment of 3,000 percent! In fact, studies of just one university alone--MIT--found that in Massachusetts MIT grads and faculty founded over 600 companies that produced 300,000 jobs and $40 billion in sales. In Silicon Valley, MIT grads founded 225 companies which produced 150,000 jobs and more than $22 billion in sales. 
In one industry alone--biotechnology--government's $43 million annual investment has not only produced the human capital of the biotech industry--scientists, engineers, managers--and new knowledge that's led to an understanding of the molecular basis of disease, but also new companies and new wealth. To, again, use MIT as an example, in Massachusetts alone, MIT-related companies have produced 10,000 new jobs, $3 billion in annual revenues, and 100 new biotech patents licensed the U.S. companies that have induced investment of $650 million. Those companies now produce nine of the 10 FDA-approved biotech drugs that stop heart attacks and treat cancer, cystic fibrosis and diabetes, and we've only just begun to tap the potential returns of this rapidly advancing new field. 
But universities are not just the fountainhead of innovation. The are the wellsprings that provide the intellectual underpinning of future progress. They train the people who will translate new discoveries into new products and processes and industries. 
For example, Jennifer Mills, a physics undergraduate from Portland, Oregon, wrote much of the computer code responsible for the remarkable images sent back to Earth by the Hubble telescope. James McLurkin, an undergrad engineer, created a tiny robot that may well revolutionize certain kinds of surgery--enabling surgeons to operate inside the body without ever touching the patient!  
AMERICA'S INVESTMENT IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MUST CONTINUE 
Clearly, America's investment in science and technology must continue. The two central questions that Congress must ask and answer, however, are: (1) Will science and technology continue to be as great a Congressional priority in the future as it has been in the past; and (2) Will the kind of financial investment necessary to sustain future progress ever be possible in light of our other growing financial commitments? 
Mr. President, the history of the last five decades has shown us that there is a federal role in the creation and nurturing of science and technology, and that--even in times of fiscal austerity--that commitment has been relatively consistent. 
However, the last three decades have also shown us something else: fiscal reality. The simple truth is there's just not enough money to do everything we'd like to do. 
It took some time for us to realize that, and by the time we did, we found ourselves in a fiscal situation that is only now being addressed. And--budget surpluses notwithstanding--discretionary spending is under immense fiscal pressure. 
One only has to look back over the last 30 years to confirm the trend. In 1965, mandatory federal spending on entitlements and interest on the debt accounted for 30 percent of the federal budget. Fully 70 percent went toward discretionary programs--research, education, roads, bridges, national parks, and national defense. 
Today-- just 30 years later-- that ratio has been almost completely reversed: 67 percent of the budget is spent on mandatory programs and interest on the debt; leaving only 33 percent for everything else, including research. In fact, total R&D spending today as a percentage of GDP is just .75 percent--as compared to 2.2 percent in the mid-1960s when superpower rivalry and the race to space fueled a national commitment to science and technology. As the BabyBoom generation begins to retire and the discretionary portion of the budget shrinks even further, this situation will only grow worse. 
Thus, Mr. President, we have both a long-term problem: addressing the ever-increasing level of mandatory spending; and a near-term challenge: apportioning the ever-dwindling amount of discretionary funding. 
The confluence of this increased dependency on technology and decreased fiscal flexibility has created a problem too obvious to ignore: Not all deserving programs can be funded; Not all authorized programs can be fully implemented. 
In other words, Mr. President, the luxury of fully funding science and technology programs across the board has long since passed. We must set priorities.

 Mr. FRIST. And so, an idea was born. Last June, Nashville saw the debut of Chet Atkins' Musician Days, a celebration of the contribution of musicians from around the world in every genre of music. Over four days, a total of 169 acts comprised of 604 artists from seven countries performed at 43 venues throughout the city. From a star-studded concert featuring 90 performers at the historic Ryman Auditorium, former home of the Grand Ole Opry, to a myriad of informal acoustic jam sessions at smaller stages all over the city, it was an event that few will soon forget. 
A big part of Musician Days is its focus on the future of music. Throughout the festival, budding musicians are encouraged to bring their instruments for impromptu sessions with the pros. Proceeds from last year's inaugural event went to the Chet Atkins Music Education Fund, to be distributed to organizations that encourage the musical education of our nation's young people. 
The success of Chet Atkins' Musician Days in 1997 led to plans for an even bigger event this year. Next month, thousands of music lovers will again descend upon Music City USA for several days of first-rate concerts, musical workshops, and good fellowship. As we anticipate this year's repeat performance, it seems fitting for us to proclaim the week of June 22-28 as `National Musicians Week' in honor of these silent heroes, the players behind the stars, and the critical role they play in the musical legacy we all enjoy.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the pending tobacco legislation. I am concerned that we have gotten off track in our consideration of comprehensive tobacco legislation and the importance of preventing children smoking. 
Our focus must be youth smoking. 
In an earlier speech on this floor, I reminded my colleagues of some of the alarming statistics about youth smoking. I will not dwell on all of those statistics; however, it is important to remember that 3,000 kids will start smoking today, and 1,000 of those children who start smoking over these 24 hours will die prematurely. Our purpose is to prevent these deaths. 
I urge my colleagues to focus on the health of our children, and their children--to keep in mind youngsters traveling that tricky path from childhood to adulthood, surrounded by temptations and convinced of their own invincibility. What can we do to make it more likely that these children will arrive at adulthood without crippling addictions? 
Mr. President, before answering that question and discussing the pending legislation, I want to pause and recall some recent history that helps explain how we have reached this point in the legislative process. 
For many years, individuals were not successful in suing the tobacco industry because of the `assumption of risk' doctrine. No jury would side with the plaintiff because the smoker assumed the risks associated with smoking. However, a group of State attorneys general got together and started suing the industry to recover Medicaid cost for smoking related illness, thus avoiding the `assumption of risk' doctrine. 
In the course of these lawsuits, internal industry documents were made public. From these documents, we learned that the Industry knew a lot more about the addictive nature of nicotine and the destructive effects of smoking tobacco than was previously thought. 
Some states began to settle for huge sums from the tobacco industry. Mississippi settled in 1996 for $3 billion. Florida and Texas were the next to settle, for $11.5 billion and $15.3 billion respectively. And, as we have all read in the last week, Minnesota is the most recent to settle--at $6.6 billion. 
In the spring of 1997, everyone came to the bargaining table --40 attorneys general, the industry, members of the plaintiffs' bar, and public health groups. They all sat down and worked out an historic tobacco settlement on June 20, 1997. The basic elements of the June 20th settlement included: 
Industry payments of $368.5 billion over 25 years--to be funded by raising the price of cigarettes by $.70 per pack over 10 years; 
Advertising restrictions--the industry voluntarily limited its First Amendment rights; 
Youth access provisions and tough licensing for retailers who sell tobacco; 
$2.5 billion per year for smoking cessation programs, public education campaigns and state enforcement; 
FDA authority to regulate tobacco and smoking; 
No class action suits or suits by any government entity; 
Immunity for the industry from all punitive damages for past actions; and 
Individuals were allowed to bring suits to recover compensatory damages for past conduct and compensatory and punitive damages for future conduct. 
Because the settlement required the enactment of federal law, it came before Congress. We are here because the June 20th settlement requires us to be here. Implementing the provisions of that settlement, or provisions similar to it, requires federal legislation. 
As we all know, several committees had jurisdiction over different provisions in the June 20th Agreement. Judiciary obviously had its role; the Labor Committee had its expertise in the public health programs and the FDA authority; Finance had jurisdiction over international trade aspects; Commerce, the liability and interstate commerce expertise; and the Agriculture Committee had a keen interest in the effects this type of unprecedented legislation will have on farmers--the one group not invited to the bargaining table during settlement negotiations. 
After months of work, it became clear that it was impossible for all of these committees to put together their respective pieces of a comprehensive package in a vacuum. The Majority Leader asked Chairman McCain to take on the herculean task of crafting comprehensive legislation to address underage smoking through the Commerce Committee. 
The bipartisan bill produced by Senator McCain and the Commerce Committee is by no means perfect. Even Senator McCain admits that. But it is important that we not lose sight of the Commerce bill's virtue: it is a comprehensive approach. It is vital that the United States Senate address children smoking in a timely, thoughtful manner--the Commerce bill gives us the structure for doing this. 
I return, then, to our central legislative focus: preventing youth smoking. After 6 hearings in the Labor Committee, 11 hearings in the Commerce Committee, and chairing a hearing on October 27, 1997 in my subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, I am convinced that the goal of cutting underage smoking in half over the next 10 years can be achieved only by a three-component comprehensive strategy. All three parts are necessary. No single part will accomplish this goal. 
1. First, we must address advertising targeted to children. An article in the Journal of the American Medical Association reported on February 17 that advertising is more influential than peer pressure in enticing our children to try smoking, and it estimated approximately 700,000 kids a year are affected by advertising. The industry cannot continue to target kids, our society must stop glamorizing smoking on television and in the movies, and we must restrict advertising at sporting events and near our schools. 
We tell our kids not to smoke, but then we look the other way when retailers sell to kids. We tell our kids that tobacco will shorten their lives, but clever advertising drowns out our message. So, we must restrict tobacco marketing that appeals to kids, but I know that the industry, like all industries marketing legal products, has substantial First Amendments rights that must be respected. 
2. The second element of a comprehensive program is that there must be strong, effective public health initiatives, including tobacco-related research, treatment and surveillance. A bold effort is necessary to keep people from starting to smoke and to help people stop smoking. A strong commitment to basic science and behavioral research is critical. We need the very best scientific research on the physiology of nicotine addiction. 
Such focused research made possible by this bill might even uncover a pill that eliminates the addictive nature of nicotine. Such a discovery alone would solve the destructive aspects of youth (and adult) smoking. This type of research might have benefits beyond tobacco; it also could be vital in our fight against substance abuse more generally. 
3. Access is the third element. We must attack how easy it is for kids to get their hands on tobacco products. States must enforce the laws against youth smoking. Retail outlets must be a partner in our efforts to stop youth smoking. We must make vending machines far less accessible to kids. The price of cigarettes must go up--enough to discourage a teenager from purchasing, but not enough to create a black market--and there must be consequences for the underage teenagers who are caught with tobacco products. 
As Chairman of the Public Health and Safety subcommittee, I heard chilling testimony from teens about how easily they purchased tobacco products. Nickita from Baltimore, now 18 years old, started smoking when she was 14. She testified that she would normally get her cigarettes from the store. She testified that she never had a problem buying cigarettes in the store, in fact, `people in my community as young as 9 years old go to the store and get cigarettes. They do not ask for I.D.s.' 
The lesson I learned from this testimony: We must enforce youth access laws. We must make it impossible for children to buy cigarettes in any neighborhood in this country. It is shameful that in America in 1998, a teenager can purchase tobacco in any of our neighborhoods. 
Price is also a factor in access. While it is obviously only one of many factors, price does affect the level of a product's consumption. Consumption had been decreasing in the 1970s; however, between 1980-1993 the downward trend accelerated, with consumption falling by 3% a year at the same time that the inflation adjusted price of cigarettes increased by 80%. In addition, the early 1990s saw price cuts, and consumption leveled off with only modest decreases in price until 1996. Then, in 1997, prices rose by 2.3%, and consumption fell again by 3%. 
Expert testimony, based on data from this country and others, clearly demonstrates that the price of cigarettes affects consumption. But a higher price alone won't solve this problem; a comprehensive solution is necessary. 
Mr. President, I believe the Commerce Committee's bill is a good start toward addressing all three aspects of a comprehensive package: advertising, public health, and access. It also addresses an issue ignored by the June 20th settlement: tobacco farmers. These farmers were not at the table during the negotiation of the June 20th agreement. The industry ignored them. The attorneys general ignored them. Yet these hardworking men and women bear absolutely no responsibility for ads targeting kids or for underage sales. These men and women work hard for modest incomes, and we cannot ignore the impact that this legislation will have on their circumstances. The Commerce bill tries to rectify this oversight. 
So, the Commerce bill addresses the three areas a comprehensive approach must include, and it protects tobacco farmers. That does not make the bill ideal. It is by no means perfect; however, it is not necessarily guilty of all the charges lodged against it. 
Some urge that the bill is merely an attempt to destroy an industry that is producing a legal product, by raising the price too much. This is a legitimate concern. Are the numbers in the Commerce bill too high? We have had countless numbers of financial experts come before several of the committees of jurisdiction, and no one agrees on the answer to this question. Wall Street, the Treasury Department, and public health groups all have different levels. 
We do know one thing: the industry agreed to $368.5 billion in exchange for some 
assurances that they were immune from future cost of unpredictable lawsuits. Maybe the Commerce bill's figure of $516 billion is too high without similar assurances of protection. The industry obviously feels it is. But we know we cannot always trust the industry. I hope that, through our debate here, we can find common ground on the issue of the tobacco industry's payments. 
I do not believe that those who support a comprehensive solution to teen smoking are trying to destroy the industry. Tobacco products are legal to manufacture and consume. We are engaged, however, in the tricky exercise of finding a price level that will help diminish teen consumption without bankrupting the industry or creating a black market. I am confident that we can work together in good faith to find that price. 
I am gratified that the Senate rejected Senator Kennedy's amendment, which would have treated industry payments as an excise tax of $1.50 per pack. This $1.50 tax was too much. The proponents were no longer as concerned with a comprehensive program targeted at preventing children from smoking as they were with enacting an excessively punitive excise tax, which would have punished smokers--who we need to be helping--and hit the working poor the hardest. 
There is a temptation, especially among those who are always searching for revenue streams, to seize upon the opportunity of an excise tax to raise vast amounts of funds for other initiatives. We should be guided by health objectives and not by the search for revenue streams. The funds generated by the agreement should be used for tobacco related and health related activities--not the creation of new entitlements. 
Mr. President, let me also address a related issue the tobacco industry is raising: Is the Commerce bill just a big tax bill? I find the industry's complaint that it is somewhat ironic. As I already noted, the industry volunteered to make over $368 billion in payments--all passed on to the consumer--as part of the July 20th payment. The industry called that payment a `voluntary payment.' That level was simply not enough; for one thing, it did nothing for the tobacco farmer, who was abandoned by the industry. Something more than $368 billion was necessary. 
Yet now the industry complains that the entire amount of the payments included in the Commerce bill is a `tax.' Maybe, as I said, the Commerce bill's payments are too much. But it is disingenuous for the tobacco industry to now contend that the payments are all a tax; they came to us and sought our legislation, and they volunteered over $368 billion. We upped the ante a bit--in large part to protect farmers--and now it's suddenly a giant tax. We cannot treat this argument too seriously. 
I want to emphasize how much more effective we can be with a settlement. We must have an industry that doesn't market to kids--a settlement gets us that--a price increase alone does not. Without the cooperation of the industry, there is no doubt that this bill will be held up in the courts--putting us years behind in our effort to reduce smoking. The industry does have First Amendment rights, and it can exercise them. 
I invite the industry to come back to us and provide us with credible information about the level of payments they can afford. The industry can work with us to prevent youth smoking--or it can distort the record and continue to be vilified in the public eye. For the sake of stopping children smoking, I prefer that the industry rise above causing the problem of youth smoking and be part of the solution. 
Some have charged that the Commerce bill is too bureaucratic. I believe that our families, communities and states should be empowered to fight teen smoking in the manner most suitable for the concerns of that state or community. We don't need big federal government structures to achieve our goal. The Manager's Amendment to the Commerce bill has done a good job of streamlining the bureaucracy it originally created. I am especially supportive of the increased empowerment and flexibility given to the States for the use of funds and for control over the public health initiatives. 
Having said that, a comprehensive approach to prevent youth smoking isn't a simple undertaking. If we are after results, there must be a structure in place. I believe that we can effectively and efficiently use existing structures, in conjunction with the States, to have a comprehensive approach. Indeed, I played a crucial role in helping draft those portions of the Commerce bill dealing with the Food & Drug Administration. These provisions have earned widespread support, and I spoke on the floor Monday to explain them. They prove that we can use an existing agency to implement common-sense regulations to reduce youth smoking. 
Another criticism of the Commerce bill concerns the possibility that it may create a black market. We should be realistic about the possibility of a black market. If we create a black market by raising the price too high--as was done in Canada--then we will lose all control over youth access. Again, this is one reason I voted against Senator Kennedy's $1.50 per pack tax. Instinctively, and based on testimony to the Commerce Committee, I believe that price level is too high. 
In short, Mr. President, I do have concerns with some parts of the Commerce bill. For this reason, I will be open-minded in considering amendments to it. The Commerce bill is a good starting point, but it is only a starting point. We can and should improve on it--as long as we do not lose sight of our ultimate objective: a comprehensive approach to prevent teen smoking. 
The single criterion I will employ in assessing the amendments that come before the Senate is this: Is the amendment likely to complement a comprehensive strategy to prevent teen smoking? In other words, does it help restrict advertising targeted at children, promote public health, and address access to tobacco? If so, I will consider it; if not, I will reject it. 
I respectfully suggest, Mr. President, that my colleagues keep the same focus. Rather than attempting to treat the tobacco bill as a new revenue stream--like my colleagues who want a $1.50 per pack excise tax--and rather than treating the bill as a chance to create many new federal programs, I urge my colleagues to focus on the children who will start to smoke during this debate. One-third of those children will die prematurely because they started to smoke. We must focus on stopping them from smoking. 
Four years ago, I was saving lives as a heart and lung surgeon. I saw the ravages of tobacco in the operating room. The people of Tennessee elected me to use common sense to advance the public good. I submit that crafting a comprehensive approach to keep children from smoking is a chance for the Senate to save lives through the exercise of common sense. I urge my colleagues not to stray from that goal.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of `Space Day' to recognize the accomplishments and achievements we have made in the United States over the last quarter of the century in space-related activities. 
The space industry has rapidly evolved from public sector dominance to private sector innovation. Throughout the industry's infancy, the Department of Defense's military operations and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's activities dominated the emerging space frontier. These DOD and NASA initiatives served as catalysts in the commercialization of space. Many advances in technology have resulted, leading to new jobs, industries, and exciting new opportunities for uses of space that we cannot yet imagine. 
The growth within the space industry, and the opportunities created have been dramatic. The space industry is a major contributor to our economy, and has spurred technological advances over the past 20 plus years. In 1996, total industry revenues from the commercial sector exceeded those from the government sector for the first time ever. Revenues from the space industry are currently running at approximately $85 billion annually, and are projected to increase to approximately $121 billion by the year 2000. 
Although participation in space initiatives has been and continues to be capital intensive, this arena is fertile ground for smaller entrepreneurs and innovative startups. One of the key factors has been the huge market for satellite launches. The demand for telecommunications services and the distribution of television and cable programming caused the satellite capacity to expand. This industry is continuously evolving to include a host of new satellite-based services including worldwide mobile telephony, and infrastructure for the television industry. Through continued Federal investment in space ventures, we can also see other emerging applications such as distance learning, telemedicine, and the exploration of microgravity conditions of materials in a clean space environment on the International Space Station. 
Transferrable technologies--`spinoffs'--from government space initiatives are now being used in various commercial applications. For example, as a result of tests aimed at improving the performance of NASA's Space Shuttle, the Boeing Company was able to hone its design of the Boeing 777 aircraft at NASA's facilities. Several NASA innovations were instrumental in the development of that aircraft, including wind tunnel tests to confirm the structural integrity, use of lightweight composite structures for increased fuel efficiency and range, and the use of computer modeling to conduct advanced computer-based aerodynamic analysis. The is the largest twin engine jet manufactured today. Other such spinoffs include fire retardant materials used in space flight suits now being used for fire fighters and automotive insulation for race car drivers, and various sensors that monitor radioactive materials and environmental control, to cite just a few. 
The benefits to the taxpayer through the development of new industries, new products, new services, and improved quality of life represents a substantial return on the national investment in space-related initiatives. 
Today, on Space Day, we recognize and honor those visionaries, entrepreneurs, and leaders who have made great accomplishments in the advancement of technology through space-related endeavors.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Spallation Neutron Source currently being developed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee will be the most powerful spallation source of neutrons in the world. It will enable scientists to `see' and thus understand the physical, chemical, and biological properties of materials at the atomic level. 
In nuclear physics, Mr. President, the study of neutrons led to the development of nuclear weapons, nuclear energy, medical isotopes, and our understanding of the energy and evolution of the stars and the origins of the solar system. 
In condensed matter physics, neutrons are used--among other things-- to study magnetic materials, magnetic resistance, and the dynamic aspects of glasses, liquids, amorphous solids, and phase behavior. 
In materials science, neutrons are used to study diffusion, crystal structures, the spatial distribution of impurities, and the stress capacities of forgings, castings, and welds. 
In chemistry, neutrons are used to determine molecular, crystal, and large-scale structure. 
In biology, neutrons are used to determine the structure of protein and protein complexes in lipids and biological membranes, and to determine the molecular arrangements on biological surfaces to help us better understand the function of cell surface receptors. 
The one common requirement in all of these research fields is an intense source of neutrons. And the only such source other than a large nuclear reactor is an energetic particle accelerator such as the Spallation Neutron Source. 
Mr. President, as I've just pointed out with this by-no-means-complete list of examples, neutron scattering has now become an indispensable tool within a broad range of scientific disciplines: physics, chemistry, materials science, nuclear physics, biology, earth science, engineering and medicine--which is why the Spallation Neutron Source is a critical element of our vision of the future. 
Far from a jobs program or a pie-in-the-sky experiment, Mr. President, spallation is the newest anchor of our national research effort. And it will contribute to America's economic and technological growth in thousands of ways. 
By helping us understand the properties of materials at the atomic level, U.S. chemical companies will produce better fibers, plastics, and catalysts; U.S. pharmaceutical companies will produce better drugs--with higher potencies and fewer side effects; U.S. automobile manufacturers will build cars that run better and are safer to operate; and U.S. aircraft manufacturers will build planes that are stronger, lighter, faster, and safer--with fewer defects, lower stress levels, and greater fuel efficiency. 
We'll create stronger magnets and magnetic materials--that will result in more efficient electric motors and generators, better magnetic recording tapes, computer hard drives, and medical magnetic resonance systems. 
And all across America, U.S. industries will produce everything from better low-fat foods, credit cards, and cosmetics, to clothes that don't wrinkle and bags that don't break, to better airport detection equipment and bulletproof vests. 
In the next century, the achievements will be even greater--especially in the field of medicine. We'll see drug delivery systems that release medicine precisely when and where the body needs it--without side effects; artificial blood that will eliminate the need to screen for viruses or procure exact blood types in times of emergency; corrosion-resistant medical implants that will last a lifetime and never have to be replaced; and smaller, faster electronic chips that will lower energy costs and increase convenience in hundreds of products. 
In other words, Mr. President, spallation is not only essential to the advancement of important scientific research, it's absolutely critical to retaining our competitive edge in the global economy and the quality of life we have come to enjoy. 
Completion of the Spallation Neutron Source--on time and on budget-- must be a priority for another reason as well. Over the last 20 years, America has fallen alarmingly behind Europe in the availability of up-to-date neutron sources and instrumentation. The major research reactors in our inventory--the HFIR at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and the High Flux Beam Reactor--were built more than 30 years ago. With the demise of the ANS (Advanced Neutron Source), and all it represented in terms of maintaining America's strength is neutron science, we cannot reasonably expect those aging facilities to sustain our entire neutron scattering effort. 
Fortunately, unlike ANS--whose pricetag [$3B] and lack of public support caused the Administration to abandon the effort--Spallation is both affordable [$2B] and strongly endorsed by both the White House and the Congress. 
Mr. President, the Spallation Neutron Source is a big part of that vision of our vision for the future. As with all of America's truly imaginative ventures--the space program, the Human Genome Project, the Hubble telescope--its benefits will be felt for years to come. 
But there is another reason Spallation must be supported, Mr. President. It is, in my view, exactly the kind of project the federal effort was designed to produce and support: It's good science--that is both knowledge-driven and mission-driven; it will be fiscally accountable--if we in Congress do it right; it has a consistent approach; it will have measurable results; it will create a flow of technology, from research through commercialization; it will promote excellence throughout the American research infrastructure, and across a broad range of initiatives; and it will create partnerships among industry, academia, and the national labs. 
And because of the way it was set-up as a cooperative partnership among the national labs--Lawrence Berkeley will be responsible for the ion source; Los Alamos, for the linear accelerator; Brookhaven, for the accumulator ring; Argonne, for the instrumentation and experiment facilities; and Oak Ridge for the conventional facilities, target apparatus, and overall project management--it will increase Congress' ability to focus on the importance of science and technology; decrease the likelihood that it will get side-tracked by politics; and ensure that spallation is consistent and effective. 
In other words, Mr. President, the real effects of this project don't end with Spallation, they begin with it--and with us and our commitment to science and technology future.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on May 13, 1998, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee unanimously supported Bill Ivey's nomination to be the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). As a member of this committee, and as a Tennessean, I believe Bill Ivey will bring a much needed, new voice to this agency. 
Many people in my home State have viewed the NEA as an elitist agency. Bill Ivey brings a new vision with a perspective of the real world. In fact, a newspaper in Tennessee noted that the `Country Music Foundation director would provide `Heart of America' leadership.' 
Bill Ivey has been the Director of the Country Music Foundation in Nashville, Tennessee since 1971. He has played an integral role in the Nashville music community. He has taught at Vanderbilt University's Blair School of Music and has written a variety of essays on America's musical traditions. 
The National Endowment for the Arts has come under increased scrutiny in recent years. Both the American people and Congress have questioned its stewardship of the taxpayers' dollar. Through committee work and the appropriations process, many innovative reform options have been considered, but few have been adopted. Bill Ivey offers the prospect of a fresh start for the National Endowment for the Arts so that all Americans will have pride and a stake in its activities.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the next several days, we will be discussing a comprehensive piece of legislation that many of us have participated in drafting over the last really 9, 10 months--a piece of legislation, which I think is a superb start to accomplishing the goal on which I hope we will continue to focus. I think we are going to see, over the next several days, a lot of debate and probably a number of amendments. We will see a lot of arguing back and forth and a lot of turf wars will be expressed here on the floor. 
I just make a plea to my colleagues that, throughout that period of time, we keep coming back to what our true focus is, the reason for having this bill. It really goes back to some of the data and statistics that have already been mentioned, which I am sure we will mention again and again. But we are here in order to reduce the number of kids smoking, teen smoking, under-age smoking. 
We have heard over the last several months about the number of kids who start smoking every day; 3,000 kids start smoking every day. And 1,000, or 1 out of every 3 of those kids who start today, will die prematurely. That means they will die earlier than they would if they had never started smoking. That means a thousand children today, over the last 24 hours, have started smoking and will die before their time because they started smoking today. Ninety percent of all adult smokers began smoking at or before age 18. In fact, 50 percent of all adults smoking today started under the age of 14--maybe 8, 10, 12, or 13 years of age. 
The problem we face today--and, of course, I speak as a Senator now, but I also speak as a physician who has taken an oath to dedicate my life to improving the quality of life of others--is that of premature death. It is as simple as that. However, the problem is not getting better, it is actually getting worse. In fact, the percentage of teens smoking every day has increased by 40 percent--these are teenagers, children--from 17 percent of 12th graders smoking in 1992 to 24 percent in 1997. If you look at the teenagers smoking from the 8th grade to the 12th grade, it climbed from 13 percent in 1992 to 18 percent in 1997. So this problem right now is becoming worse. 
Really, the statement I want to make and urge all my colleagues to keep in mind is that our focus has to be on the health of the next generation and to keep in mind the challenges that youngsters face as they travel from that very tricky path from childhood to adulthood, surrounded by these temptations. Really, what we need to do is address over the next several days, using the template of this bill now on the floor, and ask the question: What can we do to make it more likely that these children will arrive at adulthood without crippling addictions? 
Mr. President, I would like to briefly comment on one aspect of this bill, on which I have spent a great deal of time. I want to comment on it this evening, as this bill is introduced. It is a part of the bill that is greatly misunderstood by many because they haven't yet read the bill or had it presented to them. It has to do with the Food and Drug Administration authority in this bill. I am not going to walk through the provisions, but I want to briefly explain what we set out to do and what is in the bill. 
Right now, drugs and medical devices are regulated by the FDA in a single chapter. An attempt has been made by the current administration to regulate tobacco through this chapter, chapter 5 of FDA law, with the authorities given the devices. How and why? It basically is a way, through existing regulation, existing statute or authority, to regulate tobacco as a drug delivery device; but to me it is like taking a round peg and trying to put it in a square hole or taking a square peg and trying to put it in a round hole--it just doesn't fit. It just doesn t fit to try and say that tobacco should be regulated as a drug delivery device. The attempt has been made to regulate tobacco by using the restrictive device authority in chapter V. I point this out because it is the reason we have created a whole new chapter for the regulation of tobacco. This new chapter reflects that tobacco 
is a unique product, very different from drugs and very different from devices. 
Chapter 5 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act is that chapter that, heretofore, an attempt has been made to regulate tobacco through. It is the drug and device chapter. Tobacco just does not fit there. Here is one brief example, so that people will understand why we created a new chapter. Chapter 5 calls on the Secretary to determine whether the regulatory actions taken will `provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness' of the drug or the device. 
Well, clearly, tobacco is not safe or effective; we know that. It is dangerous to one's health. That has clearly been demonstrated over the last 20, 25 years. You can talk about the effectiveness of a pacemaker or a heart valve or an artificial heart; you can talk about those devices as being safe and effective. You really cannot apply that to tobacco. Therefore, instead of taking tobacco and ramming it through the drug and device provisions, we felt it was important to look at the unique nature of tobacco, write a separate chapter, and that is what is in the bill today. It is called chapter 9. This gave us the flexibility to create a new standard that was appropriate for tobacco products. The bill states that the Secretary may find that regulations and other requirements imposed on tobacco products `are appropriate for the protection of public health.' This is the standard we use instead of the safety and effectiveness standard found in chapter 5. 
There are a number of other provisions in the device section that are duplicative or not well-suited when you are attempting to regulate tobacco. Yes, they are appropriate for drugs and devices, but not for tobacco. This chapter 9, which is in the underlying bill, the managers' amendment, contains certain new provisions that grant the secretary explicit authority to undertake regulatory measures particularly relevant to tobacco. It requires manufacturers to submit to the secretary information about the ingredients, components and substances in their products. 
It requires reporting of the content delivery and form of nicotine in their products. It requires reporting of their research on the health, behavioral, and physiological effects of tobacco products. It requires reporting on the reductions in risks associated with available technology, as well as research on the marketing of tobacco products. Yes, this bill does create a new, separate chapter for regulation of tobacco products. But the reason it is important is because it does not fit, it does not make sense to regulate tobacco as safe or effective. 
With that, Mr. President, the only primary change made to the FDA provisions in the underlying McCain bill is a revision which I support. In the managers' amendment there is a prohibition of the FDA from banning tobacco sales from a particular type of retail outlet such as convenience stores. In the managers' amendment, we limit the FDA authority to the removal of the license of individual operators for failure to comply with a licensing agreement. This addresses the concerns by many of the retailers who came forward concerned that the FDA could ban sales from good operators who are not selling to kids because of a few bad actors. I support that revision in the initial FDA provisions of the bill. 
In closing, Mr. President, I do have concerns with the McCain bill. I will be open minded when considering amendments to it. I think it is a very good starting point. But it is a starting point. We can and should work on improving it over the next several days as long as we do not lose sight of our ultimate objective. And that is a comprehensive approach that looks at public health initiatives, that looks at youth access issues, that looks at the advertising and marketing, because, I believe, that it is only by having a comprehensive approach that we will achieve the objective of preventing teen smoking. 
I will be employing one criterion as I look at each of the amendments as they come forward. And that is, Is this amendment likely to complement a comprehensive campaign to prevent youth smoking? In other words, does it help restrict advertising, promote public health, and address youth access to tobacco with the end result of a reduction in youth smoking? 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to ask that my colleagues join with me in paying tribute to the 19th Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Clifton B. Cates. I am confident the Senate will grant approval to express a Sense of the Congress that the next LPD-17 amphibious vessel be named in General Cates' honor. 
General Cates was a native of Tennessee, born in Tiptonville, and later educated at the University of Tennessee earning a Bachelor of Laws degree. He was Commissioned a second lieutenant on June 13, 1917. General Cates had a remarkable career that took him to battles defending American interests around the globe. The then-Lieutenant Cates demonstrated his dedication to duty in such legendary battles as Belleau Wood and Verdun where he won the Navy Cross and two Silver Star medals. 
During WW II, General Cates commanded the 1st Marine Regiment's landing in Guadalcanal and later was the Commander of the Fourth Marine Division in the Marianas operation. General Cates fought in Tinian and perhaps the most famous of Marine Corps clashes, the seizure of Iwo Jima. The valor demonstrated by the General in all of these hard fought battles continues to be an example for young Marines deployed around the world today. 
General Cates died at age 76 in June of 1970 after an extremely distinguished and long career. It is only appropriate that the Congress express its desire to have the Secretary of the Navy bestow the honor of naming a vessel for General Cates.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1609, the `Next Generation Internet Research Act of 1998.' This legislation funds six agencies that are involved in creating advanced computer networking technology that will make tomorrow's Internet faster, more versatile, more affordable, and more accessible than today. The Next Generation Internet (NGI) is an advanced research program which fosters partnerships among academia, industry, and Federal laboratories to develop and experiment with technologies that will enable more powerful, flexible information networks in the 21st century. The overall objective of the program is to perform fundamental research in technologies that will accelerate the development of a high-speed, high-quality network infrastructure to support revolutionary applications. 
The Internet is a prototypical success story. There are in fact, multiple dimensions to its success. It was a successful public-private collaboration. It demonstrated successful commercial application of technology developed as part of a mission-directed research program. It exhibited a successful transition of an operational system from the public to the private sector. And most importantly, it is a prime example of a successful Federal investment. 
In some respects the Internet is now `suffering' from too much success. We are currently constrained by the capacity and capabilities of today's Internet technologies, which were not designed for either the scale or mode of its current use. Even though new applications and dramatic private investment have increased the Internet's abilities, technological bottlenecks have sprung up throughout the system. 
The Next Generation Internet comes at a crucial juncture in the development of the nation's information infrastructure. During the period of NGI-sponsored research, the telecommunications backbone of the US will likely undergo a dramatic transition in which the levels of packet-based traffic will surpass that of conventional telephone traffic. The speed and degree of the impending transition is indicative of the urgency with which the NGI goals must be pursued and the results of that research transition to the commercial sector. 
Recently, I had a first-hand look at some of these advanced applications. Highway 1, a non-profit organization established to educate Members of Congress and their staffs about the Internet and associated technical developments, showcased several remarkable projects. As a physician, I was intrigued by the virtual reality `Immersion Desk' collaboration demonstration. Using special glasses, I was able to take a guided tour of the human ear, observing its structure in three dimensions, and able to interact with the guided and the structure in `real time'. It was immediately obvious to me the educational benefits that will evolve from putting similar devices into the hands of our nation's teachers and students. Sophisticated applications, such as the ones I witnessed at Highway 1, place heavy technical demands upon the network. However, until the Internet's infrastructure limitations have been overcome, these applications will remain outside the reach of those who benefit the most. 
Some of the limitations that now impede advanced applications can be mastered through a straightforward application of the existing technology, but there is an entire class of problems that requires new approaches. I believe that our nation's research and development enterprise hold the key. The Next Generation Internet program will provide grants to our universities and national laboratories to perform the research that will surmount these technical challenges and create the technology that will energize the Internet of tomorrow. 
Mr. President, I believe that passage of this legislation will continue the tradition of prudent and successful investment in science and technology. The Next Generation Internet Research Act will help ensure that the Internet reaches its maximum potential to provide greater education and economic benefits to the country.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the life of Ronald E. Wynn, who died Friday, May 1, 1998. I first met Ron as a patient in 1987. He bears the distinction of being the first African-American to receive a heart transplant at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and I had the honor of performing his surgery. While our relationship was initially that of doctor/patient, it later evolved into something deeper. Ron's wife describes him as someone who `always had a smile on his face' and who `always tried to help other people.' These characteristics, along with our shared desire to promote the need for organ donation, caused our friendship to grow. 
Several of my transplant patients came to me in 1987 with the idea of bicycling across the state of Tennessee to promote organ donation awareness. My initial thought was they were crazy. I told them, `It's one thing to go swimming and riding and jumping running around at a controlled event, where help is just around the corner. But to go pedaling across a state with nobody around to help and no place to go if you get in trouble--it's not twenty-five miles, with people standing cheering you on; it's five hundred miles, with long stretches of deserted road, and huge hills, and cars zipping past. It's too risky.' Ron was one of those courageous souls who sought to publicize this worthwhile goal by participating in this event, and he, along with several others, eventually persuaded me that it could be done in a safe and effective manner. Because of their influence, I, too, became an advocate for this program and took an active role in publicizing and promoting this event. `Transplant Bikers Across Tennessee' became a phenomenal success which helped increase donor awareness across our state and our country. 
Ron's contributions to our state spanned a wide range of achievement and service. One of our local papers, The Tennessean, chronicled Ron's life in its May 5, 1998 edition. Ron graduated from Pearl Senior High School in 1965 and from Fisk University in 1969 with a degree in physics. He then continued his education by doing graduate work at Fisk in physics and mathematics, and put that education to practice by working as a health physicist reviewing radioactive material applications. Ron also served as a reserve officer in the Navy and was the first African-American on the amphibious assault carrier the USS Francis Marion. While these achievements are impressive and commendable, his family stated that he `will be remembered most of his generous spirit.' 
As hard as you try not to become too attached to your patients, it happens all the same. As a physician or a nurse, you will pull for them, you cheer them on, you attend to their needs--physically and emotionally, and in the end, they make an impression on you that isn't erased just because the surgery is completed. Ron's passing is a great loss to so many people. It is also a personal loss for me. His loyalty to organ donor awareness is to be commended, and, as a tribute to this man who sought to help others who depend on organ donation for life, we should carry on this work in his memory. 
At the successful completion of the `Transplant Bikers Across Tennessee' event, Ron and the other participants were engulfed by the media. Ron responded by saying, `A lot of people have called us heroes this week, but the real heroes are those people, the ones who donate their organs so that out of their tragic deaths people like me can have a life.' Ron will be sorely missed by his family, friends, and community. I have made it a goal to continue efforts to increase public awareness and to ensure that we are doing all we can to save lives through organ donation.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in recognition of the warm bonds of affection that exist between the people of Israel and the people of the United States, and the enduring friendship that unites our two nations, I rise today to congratulate the State of Israel on the 50th Anniversary of its birth as an independent nation. 
Mr. President, no people in the world have more in common with Americans than the people of Israel. No two nations are more committed to freedom, to justice, and to peace than Israel and the United States. 
As nations of immigrants, we cherish our common culture and honor the rich traditions that make us one. We revere our families, nourish our faith, and never hesitate to make sacrifices in the present if they will secure a better future for our children. 
As such, we make loyal friends and determined adversaries--as both our friends and our foes around the world have learned throughout the years. 
Mr. President, those shared values and similar heritage have made us more than fellow democracies. They've made us fast friends, valued trading partners, and strategic allies. And I pray that nothing ever happens to change that relationship. 
These things were never clearer to me than they were when I visited Israel last year. It was, in fact, my first foreign visit as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. What I learned and saw there will remain with me for the rest of my life. 
Together with my wife, Karyn, I visited Jericho, Haifa and Tel Aviv. I traveled to the Golan Heights, spent a night on a kibbutz, and stood on the shores of the Sea of Galilee. I met with diplomats and military leaders, visited industries and hospitals, and throughout it all I was excited by Israel's economy and impressed with its commitment to technological excellence. 
But my most memorable moments had nothing to do with international politics or diplomacy. They came from my contact with a people whose spirit is as strong and unshakable as the 3,000 years of history that lies beneath every step one takes in that holy land. 
Mr. President, in preparing for my trip to Israel, and especially to Jerusalem, I read a lot about its topography, its history, its climate, and its culture. But nothing prepared me for its incomparable beauty. It is a place whose sights and melodies permeate your being and leave an indelible mark on your soul. 
After experiencing it first-hand, it is not at all hard to imagine why this 3,000-year-old link--unmatched in all of history--exists between a place and a people, and why--even through centuries of war, oppression, exile and dispersion--that link has never been severed. 
But Israel is much more than its collected history, as the last five decades have decidedly proven. It is a demonstration of what can be accomplished when a people are determined to overcome every obstacle to freedom and self-determination. Although young--50 years is but a moment in the long history of the Jewish people--Israel is today a vibrant, thriving democracy whose achievements in science, technology, agriculture, industry, and trade are a match for any nation centuries older. 
Yet while the land of Israel is the land of the Jewish people, it is also the land of us all--as the more than two and a half million tourists who visit Israel every year will attest. Few places on earth have been as cherished and as loved by so many millions throughout the world as the places of Israel. It is, as one writer described it, `a symphony of voices, heard by all the people of the world.' 
Today, Mr. President, I know all those whose hearts have been touched by the music of Israel, join me in wishing her well. Together, we congratulate her on her remarkable achievements, we thank her for her friendship, and we pray for the day when all who dwell within her boundaries will, as St. Augustine prayed,  
`. . live in such delight, 
such pleasure and such play 
As that to them a thousand years 
Doth seem as yesterday.'

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, please notify me at 13 minutes. 
Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment by the Senator from New Mexico. Senator Bingaman has offered an amendment which would create a new program intended to lower dropout rates in our Nation's schools. It does replace a program that was in existence up until 1995. That program is no longer funded, nor was funding requested by the President of the United States back in 1995, 1996, 1997, nor was it requested by the Department of Education, as I understand. It is a new program, though, and I will come back to that. 
Senator Bingaman's amendment would amend title V of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize this new entity, and up to $125 million in that first year, with the objective which I obviously share; that is, reducing dropout rates. 
Secondly, the amendment, as I mentioned, authorizes $125 million for grants in that first year and authorizes an additional $25 million for a national clearinghouse on dropout data. 
In addition, it would create an office in the Department of Education, it would create a new office of dropout prevention, and would also allow for the creation of a dropout czar at the Department of Education to focus attention on this issue. 
I say all of that because it is a new program not currently funded. It is a Federal program. And that is important, because so much of the discussion that we have undertaken over the last 3 to 4 days and that I, as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Task Force on Education, have reviewed over the last 6 months is that if there is one thing we have too many Federal programs with too much overlap, and it is too confusing and too burdensome. I think we have made great progress in the last 2 days on this bill and in simplifying and streamlining with some of the amendments as well. 
The second point I want to come back to is that we do have a problem today in dropout rates, but we have made huge progress, huge progress, over the last 30 years. I have had the opportunity to go back and look at the statistics and the data in our task force. We need to do a lot more. I encourage all of us, and maybe we can take it back to the Labor Committee where we can really analyze this data and see what the trends mean. 
But basically there are two points I want to make. I think we need fewer programs, not just another program, to address problems; and, No. 2, real progress has been made in lowering the dropout rate among all subgroups in this country, some more than others.  
The 1997 Digest of Education Statistics, produced by the National Center for Education Statistics on this very issue, has a chart. Contrary to what Senator Bingaman has said, let me go back and look at the entire 36-year period, because I think it puts it in a much better perspective for us. 
From 1960 to 1996, the dropout rate has fallen dramatically, from 27.2 percent down to 11 percent. The dropout rate over this period of time has fallen by much more than a half--almost by two-thirds. The current dropout rate is 11.1 percent. In fact, if we look at the data from the last several years, we have not improved in science in the last 30 years and we have not improved in math and we have not improved in reading. The one area we have improved in education in this country is lowering that dropout rate. I don't want to minimize the problem because I agree it is a problem, but we cut it not just by a quarter, not just by a half, but almost two-thirds, down to 11.1 percent. 
In the same 1997 Digest, we learn from 1972 to 1996, look at women of Hispanic origin, the rate has dropped from 34.9 to 28.3--still too high. The intent of the amendment is to address the 28.3 percent, but it is the wrong approach, another Federal program. If we look at black men, the rate has dropped from 30.6 percent in 1967 down to 13 percent in 1996. That is dramatic. Not by just half, but two-thirds. Currently, it is 13.6 percent. Women of all races, the rate has dropped from 26.7 percent in 1960 to 10.9 percent in 1996. I wish we could see that much progress made in improvement in terms of science, math, and reading where we haven't seen any progress whatever. For men of all races, the rate has dropped from 27.8 percent in 1960 down to 11.4 percent in 1996. So we have made huge progress over the last 30 years. 
Senator Bingaman and I are both members of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, and much of the data I refer to was reviewed in the Senate Budget Committee task force. I do hope we have the opportunity, regardless of the outcome of this amendment, to go back and ask why the Hispanic dropout rate has gotten better but not as good as we would like and why for black men it has gotten remarkably better. I do not fully understand that and would like to find out in committee through hearings to see if we can address and if we can come up with an overall strategy. 
I suggest we look at creative ways to assist all of our students. We approached that to some extent yesterday through the block grant, the Gorton-Frist amendent yesterday, which really allows States and localities to identify problems like this which may not be in every locality, which are not in every locality, every school district, but allow States and localities to identify for themselves what that problem would be, and give them, through this block grant approach, the flexibility to decide how, for themselves, based on their priorities, based on their needs, they can address that specific problem and spend those education dollars that we provide. Clearly, our current system of complicated overlapping programs is not the answer, and therefore I hesitate and therefore oppose having another new Federal program in this regard. 
I have spoken a number of times about findings of the task force itself. It really comes down to having a fragmented Federal education effort; it ends up being uncoordinated. The General Accounting Office in our hearings presented testimony to the task force and noted how the Federal Government does target 
certain populations with a variety of Federal education programs. Again, the block grant approach through the Gorton-Frist amendment still allows the existence of programs but you give individual school districts or States the opportunity to use that money as they see fit or to keep those categorical programs. 
The General Accounting Office, in this chart I will show briefly on the floor, illustrates the problem that we have today by just having another program. This chart shows target groups served by multiple programs and agencies. In the middle is the target group which is aimed by the Federal Government called `at-risk and delinquent youth.' This is the area that the dropout rate potential student exists. Look what we have today. Department of Agriculture has programs, Department of Education has programs, Department of Health and Human Services has programs, Department of the Interior has programs, and now we want to add yet another program. 
In fact, for this `at-risk youth' target group, we have 59 programs at the Department of Health and Human Services, 7 administered by the Department of Defense, 8 by the Department of Education, 4 by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 9 by the Department of Labor, 22 by the Department of Justice, 3 by the Department of the Interior, 7 by the Department of Agriculture, and 8 by various other agencies. We have 127 Federal programs right now that are directed to at-risk and delinquent youth. We take it from 127 to 128. I think we can't kid ourselves that by adding another new program to address this fundamental problem, that that will be the answer. 
The task force also held a hearing on January 28 called `Federal Education Funding: The State and Local Perspective.' It was made clear at the hearing that additional Federal programs, which have numerous regulations and are costly to administer, is just simply not the best approach. In terms of the Federal burden, the commissioner of education for the State of Florida told the task force, using an example, that it takes 297 State employees to oversee and administer $1 billion in Federal funds; in contrast, only 374 employees oversee approximately $7 billion in State funds. The point being it takes almost six times as many people to administer a Federal dollar as a State dollar. 
For some reason, and it has been reflected on the floor over the last 2 days, we had a problematic reluctance to ask the question, `What works, what doesn't work,' and let us promote what works. I have been dismayed through the whole process of the last several months looking at education, looking at the sort of chart that you just saw where we have 127 programs already designed to look at that at-risk youth. Is 128 going to make a difference? I think not. 
In summary, if you step away from it, we have a too-complicated Federal effort today. We don't need to have one more program in this already incoherent structure. No. 2, we have data to show that we have made, since 1960, dramatic progress, improvements in the dropout rates. Still, we have a problem. Still we need to address it. I argue that the best place to address that instead of right now on the floor where very few people have this data is in a committee, where you can debate it, look at the data, analyze it, and say why is one group doing better and one is not. 
Third, the Senate did agree yesterday to the Gorton-Frist block grant approach which gives the opportunity for a State or a locality to obtain the same amount of funds and use those funds to address the specific problem--whether it is the dropout rate or whether it is technology or whether it is more books, they get to choose. 
For these three reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose and defeat Senator Bingaman's amendment. I look forward to working with him in the Labor Committee to address the issue that he has brought to the floor.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Gorton amendment and also rise to explain the amendment which I just submitted. 
As has previously been referred to this morning, I have had the opportunity over the past 6 months to chair the Senate Budget Committee task force on education. During that series of seven hearings that we held, I listened very carefully to a number of witnesses. Both Democrats and Republicans alike came before our committee and discussed the nature of the Federal role in education. The terms that were used and the picture painted was that we had this sprawling endeavor, that is duplicative in many ways, that has not been focused to the degree that any of us would like, which in turn, in many ways, has tied the hands of the education establishment, has tied the hands of State communities and local communities and local school administrators and teachers and principals and parents. We have heard it again and again. 
I applaud Senator Gorton for building upon his amendment from last year. The amendment that we see today, which I think goes a long way toward accomplishing the goals as recommended by the task force to consolidate--not eliminate, but consolidate--the various efforts we have at the Federal level to accomplish what we want to accomplish; that is, to educate the young people, K through 12 today. We have not been successful in the past. We all know that. That has been demonstrated again and again. 
The amendment that I introduced today makes the Gorton amendment, I believe, even stronger. Under the Gorton amendment, a State must choose within a 1-year time period and pursuant to a majority vote in their State legislature and with the concurrence of the Governor, one of three options. Again, the beauty of this amendment is that there are three options. After the initial selection under the Gorton amendment, a State can only change that selection one time and only after a 3-year period. 
My amendment would simply allow a State which has chosen to remain in the current system--again that is the beauty; if a State elects not to change under the Gorton amendment, they don't have to change--if a State does say we will stay exactly as we are today, continue the categorical program that they have today, under my amendment they will be able to opt any time over the next 4 years to go into one of the block grant programs. 
That is the extent of my amendment. In addition, we heard from States like Kentucky that have biennial State legislatures, and it gives them the opportunity to make that decision after they next meet, since the underlying amendment had this 1-year time limit. The real theme to the Gorton amendment is the flexibility that is given to localities--flexibility for individual localities and individual States to decide for themselves, based on their own priorities, based on their own identified needs, how to best spend their education dollars. 
My amendment builds on that flexibility, allowing States to decide, and they are given more choice. The need for consolidation could not be clearer today. We know that over the last 20 years we have had stagnant student performance in science, mathematics, and reading. We have seen that data again and again. Our task force looked at the Federal role in education, and we found this sprawling, unfocused effort that did suffer from a programmatic reluctance to ask the fundamental question: What works and what doesn't work? There is something inherent in the program that prevented us from asking that question, until today. 
We saw these huge charts that take the 500 Federal programs, or 2,900 programs of the Department of Education, and we saw these overlapping, intertwining, well-intended programs that have lacked the focus, have lacked the streamlined consolidation approach, and they have not worked. What the Gorton amendment allows us to do is choose a system, not change it all for two block grants of about $10 billion, to choose based on your individual needs what might work for you. 
We have already tabled, over the last 2 days, a school construction program. We will debate other amendments that create a program for dropout prevention, to create new programs. The beauty of the Gorton amendment is that we give the States and the localities the money, and if they have a problem with dropouts, they can identify that program and use the money there. If they don't have a problem, they don't have to use it there. For technology development, we give the States and the localities the option to decide how to spend that money. 
It is not a partisan issue. People have tried to make it, both in the media and sometimes on the floor, Republicans versus Democrats. We listened carefully in our task force to the Democratic officials from the Chicago school system. They extolled the virtues of flexibility. That is what the Gorton amendment is all about. They said that the flexibility in much of their own program's success in reforming the Chicago system can be--it draws back to that use of block grants, which has that flexibility. They said to our task force: `We know the system, and we believe we know the things that it needs to have in order to improve.' They continued: `So the more flexibility we have with Federal and State funds, the easier it is to make those changes.' 
Florida's commissioner of education went on to say: `We at the State and local level feel the crushing burden caused by too many Federal regulations, procedures, and mandates. Florida spends millions of dollars every year to administer inflexible categorical Federal programs that divert precious dollars away from raising student achievement. Many of these Federal programs typify the misguided, one-size-fits-all command and control approach.' 
Those were the words of Florida's commissioner of education. 
We also heard that the Department of Education has indeed made some progress in eliminating some regulations and consolidating programs. Secretary of Education Riley reported that the Department eliminated 64 programs. But then we heard 2 weeks later from the General Accounting Office that the Department still oversees 244 separate individual programs. Given that the Department and the Secretary are moving in the direction of streamlining and consolidation, it is really confusing to me why the Department and the administration oppose the Gorton amendment, which does just that; it consolidates, it does not eliminate the Department of Education, it does not eliminate the targeted populations; it consolidates and allows individual communities to best choose how to use those same amounts of dollars. 
Accountability was mentioned. It is a red herring. The Gorton amendment very specifically provides for accountability to both the Federal Government and to those people who really care the most. I am absolutely convinced that the people who really care the most are the parents of those children in those schools. The Gorton amendment very specifically requires public involvement in planning a strategy for the use of block-granted funds and an accounting to the public of the results once the funds are used. Accountability is specifically addressed. 
Targeting. We heard about the title I population. That is specifically spelled out in this amendment. There is no weakening of the targeting nature of the Federal funding of things like title I. It is interesting to note that the Gorton amendment does not do this. In fact, 100 percent of title I part A funds would flow directly to the local education agencies--100 percent. There is no cutting there. Under the Gorton 
amendment, 100 percent of the funds would be used by the schools in the classrooms, not with that administrative overlay, administrative cut taken off to be spent here in Washington, DC. No; this makes sure that the targeted populations receive the funds in the classroom. 
The premise behind both my second-degree amendment and the Gorton amendment is flexibility. States and localities will have the flexibility to decide for themselves how to best use education dollars, not the U.S. Congress' well-intended layering on of program on program, not the administration's budget proposal sent to us in which there were eight new education programs. Another four have been proposed here in the last 2 days. No; we want those moneys, that accountability, that flexibility to be carried out at the local level. 
The task force heard testimony of numerous witnesses. We heard from Susan Gendrich, who runs a wonderful public school in Murfreesboro, TN, called Cason Lane Academy. We heard that the real beauty, the reason they have been able to accomplish so much, is because they were given the flexibility to have remedial schoolwork in the afternoons by using unused funds that otherwise would have gone to something they did not need. 
Yes, let the States and the localities exercise some creativity. That is where the innovation actually is. Again, remember, in the last 20 years we have been stagnant in school performance. What we have done through 500 programs, spending $100 billion a year, has not improved education in our public schools. Let's give them an option. That is what this is, an option to keep what you have, to go to a block grant program. Our current approach is simply not working. Let's try a new approach, something novel, and return decisionmaking authority to those closest to our students--the States and the localities. 
Mr. President, I urge adoption of the Frist amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. FRIST. In my 29 seconds, let me make it very clear that the Gorton amendment continues to target title I, the student. The disadvantaged students still get the money, still get the programs. The difference is that 100 percent of the money gets down to the classroom where it is needed. 
The Gorton amendment has as its underlying theme flexibility and accountability, the two things that we have heard again and again are necessary to accomplish our goals of educating students. We are not doing a good job. Our education system is not successful. When we compare ourselves in the 12th grade to science students all over the world, out of 21 countries only 2 do worse than us. It is not successful. 
This bill preserves choice. It gives options: No. 1, to continue to receive this $10 billion in Federal funds under the current system with the same regulations, no change. You can choose that. Or your second choice: Have those Federal funds sent directly to the local school districts minus the Federal regulations. Or choice No. 3: Have Federal funds sent to the State education authority minus Federal regulations. 
As Frank Grogan, Florida's commissioner of education, said:  
With education, we are already beginning to see States becoming living laboratories. If left to pursue reform without added Federal burdens and interference, States can learn from the success and mistakes of others with the freedom to emulate some programs as models and/or discard those that are ineffective. 
The Gorton amendment gives that opportunity, with accountability built into those States and the local level. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment proposed by the Senator from Louisiana. Both she and I agree on many different issues. I will come to why I oppose the amendment itself. But let me say that I do agree with her in her statement that it is important to reward excellence, and to reward it appropriately, in terms of our Nation's schools. It is especially important when, clearly, what we are doing today is not accomplishing it in the aggregate. We do need to identify particular schools, reward them, change what they are doing, so we will improve the overall standards of all schools. 
In Tennessee, there have been many schools that have received and earned the Blue Ribbon Schools Excellence in Education awards. I am proud of them, to go by and see them. They are given a Presidential Citation, a flag of excellence signifying that school's exemplary status. 
I understand the Senator from Louisiana wants to expand on this notion of honoring success, but to do so by having the schools receive national financial rewards of $100,000. 
We agree on many points, in terms of encouraging success, but we differ on one key element. The one key element, all of our colleagues must be aware of, because it is key in this amendment, and that is that this amendment has been offered as a result of the Senator's opposition to the Coverdell Savings Account A+ Act. As a result of this opposition, the proposed amendment would strike section 101 of the Coverdell bill. In effect, it is a poison pill to the Coverdell savings account initiative. 
As chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Task Force on Education, I have had the opportunity over the last 6 months to conduct hearings and to hear from people who are at schools, who run schools in the local communities. I have heard again and again how important it is--repeatedly--that we must look for creative solutions, for innovation, to the problems that plague our Nation's schools. Senator Coverdell's plans for savings accounts is a good, positive first step. The proposed amendment would gut that totally. I do not believe it is the final solution, but the proposal does take us in that very important direction of empowering that parent-child team. 
I would like to just take a moment to highlight the provisions of the Coverdell bill which I believe make it an effective tool, a positive tool, in helping students and families across the country which, if this amendment were to pass, the Coverdell advantages would go away. What does the Coverdell A+ Accounts do? We expand the education savings accounts in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 by increasing the annual contribution limit for education IRAs from $500 to $2,000. The bill, very importantly, expands the definition of what is qualified education expenses. They are currently limited to higher education. The Coverdell bill expands it to K-12--K-12 expenses, the sort of expenses we have already talked about. 
It could be anything from equipment to computers to books to supplies, or if you are an individual with a disability, to give you the tools that you might not otherwise have so you can learn, homeschooling expenses, uniforms, transportation costs--all of these would be encompassed by the Coverdell bill. If the amendment by the Senator from Louisiana is agreed to instead of the Coverdell bill, they will all go away. We all know that it is the parents, the parents who want the very best for their children. I believe it is important--which the Coverdell bill does--to encourage parents to invest in their children's education, to give them that opportunity, to lower the barriers to do so, to give them the incentives to invest in their children. 
The President signed into law on August 5, 1997, the Taxpayer Relief Act, which authorized new education IRAs. But that was just for higher education, not K-12. I am fully supportive of every measure we can put on the table helping families plan for higher education expenses. I also believe this effort should be expanded to provide tax allowances for what families spend on elementary and secondary education. That is not allowed today but will be allowed under the Coverdell proposal. 
While our colleges and universities are the very best in the world--and this was put before our task force committee again and again--the foundation on which those colleges and universities rest is not sturdy; it is weak. In fact, our elementary and secondary schools are not the envy of the world, unlike our colleges and universities. 
In a recent TIMMS, the third, math and science study, scores show just how poorly our student are measuring up to their international counterparts. I referred to this earlier. This is the 12th grade mathematics general knowledge achievement compared to 21 other countries. You don't need to read the chart, but these are countries that do better than us, such countries as Austria, Slovenia does better than us, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland. Only 2 nations--these are the nations we do equal to--only 2 nations out of 21 do worse than the United States in the 12th grade mathematics. The same can be said of science. So we are not doing, in K-12, anywhere near what we should be doing. 
Even our colleges and universities have to take on that additional burden by reteaching students that they receive. Approximately 30 percent of freshmen in college today require remedial course work. We need to direct our attention to this K-12 foundation, which the Coverdell bill does. 
Under current law, we assist parents, students, and families with numerous tax allowances for higher education. We have HOPE and Lifetime Learning Savings. We have the education IRAs for higher education. We have the State prepaid tuition programs. We have U.S. savings bonds. In terms of loans for students, we provide deductions for interest payments--all for higher education. We are the best in the world. Now is the time to look at K-12 education. 
I would like to talk just very briefly about why I think a new approach is needed. By agreeing to the amendment that is proposed by the Senator from Louisiana, again, we are gutting the Coverdell bill. In essence, we are saying let's not change the system at all, that we are doing OK. That is in essence what this amendment is doing. Are we doing OK? This chart basically shows, in science, trends in average science scale scores over the last 20 years, going from 1970 on your left to 1996 on the right. This is age 17, the purple line. The green line is age 13. The orange line is age 7. And the whole point is that, over the last 20 years, we are not improving at all. 
I just compared globally; we are doing worse. Out of 21 nations, in the 12th grade, only 2 nations did worse than us. So, in spite of all 500 programs that we have today, in spite of spending about $74 billion at the Federal level, we are doing no better. 
Beneath the surface of this whole disappointment of stagnant student performance and despite a commitment of increased resources--and let me show very briefly on this chart what we have been doing as a nation. 
This is 1971 to 1997, about a 27-year period. This is how much we spend per pupil in adjusted dollars today. That is what the red line is, constant 1996-1997 dollars. What it shows is that in 1970 we were spending, in today's dollars, about $4,000. Today, we are spending about 50 percent more, about $6,000. We have had a stagnant performance at the same time we have had increased expenditures. 
A vote for the amendment by the Senator from Louisiana says, let's not change the system, let's keep doing exactly what we are doing today--something with which I heartily disagree. 
Beneath the surface of this whole disappointment that we see in terms of stagnant student performance, there is an acute crisis in our urban schools. One out of every four public school students are enrolled in an urban school district. 
A recent report examining our urban schools noted:  
It is hard to exaggerate the education crisis in America's cities. Words like scandal, failure, corruption and despair echo in the pages of the Nation's newspapers. 
Another area of concern is the Federal component in the landscape of American education. I show this chart again not so much to show the details, but this is a chart that was generated by the General Accounting Office. As the task force chairman, I basically found it can be depicted by a chart like this, that we have today at the Federal level a sprawling and unfocused effort which suffers from a programmatic reluctance to ask itself what works and what doesn't work. 
Over the last couple of days, we have said that we have heard again and again maybe one more program will help out. This basically shows, among three target groups--this happens to be teachers, and the various departments and various Federal programs are around the border--how they influence teachers. Just walk away from it, and you see that this is a spider web almost of unrelated programs all targeted at the individuals. There are over 500 such programs right now. 
What we need to do, if anything, is to consolidate and to improve. We do need to change. We do need to allow that creativity, to allow that innovation. A vote for the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana guts the Coverdell bill. It says, let's not change, let's not structurally improve the system. 
In the last few minutes, I talked about the disparity between the assistance we provide for higher education and elementary and secondary education. I have shown the data which show our children are not at the level we need for them to be if we are to remain competitive in the global marketplace. 
I talked a little bit about the need for creative solutions in our K-12 system, the sort of solutions that are offered in the Coverdell bill. I mentioned provisions in the bill of the Senator from Georgia which will enable the parent-child team--and that is what we need to stay focused on--to make important education decisions in the early years. 
Coming back to the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana, awarding schools is on the right track. It is a good approach. We need to recognize success. I might add, we need to replicate that success as well. I will say, as an alternative to the Coverdell bill, it is totally unacceptable. Savings accounts are too important for families in Tennessee and all across this 
Nation. We simply cannot afford to desert this effort, despite the merits of these other proposals. Savings accounts, bonds for school construction, State prepaid tuition, the underlying Coverdell bill provides all of this. To replace that bill with a program that does recognize merit but does nothing more is simply unsatisfactory. 
I urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana and support the underlying bill. I reserve the remainder of my time.  
Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I believe it is important that we put character back into our vocabulary. The American people are crying out for virtue and values--character is critical and we must focus our efforts in extending this message. 
I have been a faithful co-sponsor of the Character Counts movement, which seeks to teach the core elements of good character to our nation's young people. 
I am pleased to submit a resolution in the Senate to expand this message to our nation's institutions of higher education. Specifically, I am submitting a concurrent resolution expressing that it is the sense of the Congress that the Nation must place greater emphasis on helping young Americans to develop habits of good character that are essential to their own well-being and to that of our communities. 
I believe that we should encourage parents, faculty, and staff across the Nation to emphasize character development in our homes, in our communities, in our schools, and in our colleges and universities. Congress should support and encourage character building initiatives in schools across American and urge colleges and universities to affirm that the development of character is one of the primary goals of higher education. 
This concurrent resolution has already been submitted in the House of Representatives by a member of the Tennessee congressional delegation, Congressman Bob Clement. I am proud to note that it has received bipartisan support. It is a privilege for me to submit this concurrent resolution in the Senate.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, each year, American companies are forced to lay off workers or shut down entirely, but it's not because of hard economic times. Instead, the costs of product liability insurance and outrageous damage awards are driving them out of business. We now live in the most litigious society on earth. Our courts are packed with frivolous lawsuits filed by people seeking multi-million dollar payments for modest damages. As a result, we are all paying a huge price--from the job market to the supermarket. Let us take the first step by reforming the product liability system. 
Congress did just that, when it sent President Clinton the Product Liability Legal Reform Act. This legislation was a carefully crafted bipartisan bill that, among other things, would have limited most punitive damage awards to twice the plaintiff's compensatory damages, or $25,000--whichever is greater. The bill would have simply injected predictability and sanity into our out-of-control legal system and protected American companies from unfair and outrageous damage awards. 
The American people and America's employers, however, were dealt a big blow when President Clinton vetoed this bipartisan, common-sense reform effort. Almost 90 percent of the American people supported the bill. Consumers already pay 30 percent more on the price of a step ladder and 95 percent more for the price of childhood vaccine due to outrageous product liability costs, and we simply can't afford to pay any more. American workers and businesses needed this bill to help stem to tide of job loss and help create new jobs. 
So, why would Mr. Clinton veto this legislation? Possibly because the most vocal opponents of this bill the plaintiff's trial lawyers--were also the target supporters of his re-election effort. The President had a choice to make. He had to choose between the plaintiff's trial bar who provide him millions in dollars in campaign funds, and American workers particularly those in manufacturing jobs. He choose the trial lawyers. Unfortunately, his decision is not only bad politics, is terrible policy for the American People. That's way even many prominent members of this own party in Congress were shocked his veto. 
Negotiations continue with the White House on product liability reform, 
but to date I have seen no significant movement that would constitute real progress. Thus far, only watered-down proposals that attempt to deceive the American people into believing that real reform will take place have been offered. 
My purpose in coming to the floor today is to challenge my colleagues to act on real product liability reform. Or, send the one part of this legislative effort that there is some consensus on to the President. I am speaking of Senators McCain and Lieberman's Bio-materials Access Assurance Act. 
Every year 7.5 million patients are threatened when medical suppliers choose to discontinue a product because the liability concerns outweigh any potential gains. In my experience as a cardio-thoracic surgeon, you can't overstate the vital nature of bringing the best and newest technology to the operating table. The list of life-saving devices affected is too long to mention. Everything from annuloplasty rings and tissue valves used in valve implantation to the blood filters and cardiotomy reservoirs needed for heart surgery are all at risk of serious shortage if the Congress does not act. 
Many implantable devices are already in short supply. At least 14 biomaterials suppliers have limited or stopped selling the raw materials used in the manufacture of devices. Many major suppliers have stopped selling materials to the U.S. market because of liability concerns. Dow Chemical no longer manufactures medical grade resin for the implant market. Dupont has discontinued the supply of Teflon, Dacron, and Delron used in the permanent medical implant industry. 
A 1997 study indicated where this problem is going within the next one to three years: U.S. manufacturers will divert resources from research and development to the search for replacement materials; and financial resources for investment will begin to dry up and innovation within our boarders will suffer. 
Further, within three to 10 years: A biomaterials `crisis' will occur; major segments of the biomaterials industry will move overseas, killing smaller manufacturers where we see so much innovation today; patients will not have access to life-saving and life-enhancing implants. 
Let me be clear: These devices save millions of lives every year. I've used these implants and devices in my own surgical practice to save the lives of hundreds. My hands as a surgeon and my patients are witnesses to the importance of this issue. The time to act is now. 
We have another opportunity this year to bring both of these important legislative initiatives to the President's desk. I sincerely hope that both ends of Pennsylvania are up to the challenge.

Mr. FRIST. I rise to speak in favor of the amendment from the Senator from Oklahoma and in opposition to the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts. 
The amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma, which I think we are going to have widespread agreement on, basically says that-- 
The Senate will not pass any health care legislation that will-- 
make health insurance unaffordable for working families and increase the number of uninsured Americans . . . 
And in addition, it will not pass any health care legislation that will-- 
. . . impose political considerations on clinical decisions, instead of allowing such decisions to be made on the basis of sound science and the best interest of patients. 
I would like to take the time and say why passage of the Nickles amendment means we should defeat the Kennedy amendment. Basically, physicians do not treat patients unless we know that the anticipated risks to that patient are outweighed by the benefits. If we were to pass the amendment by Senator Kennedy, the Senator from Massachusetts, those unintended disadvantages would far outweigh the good intentions that we have. 
No. 1 is the issue of cost. We know that if we are mandating benefits today the cost of health insurance goes up. When health insurance goes up, those hard-working men and women, the single mom, working mom with the child, can lose her health insurance. 
So we feel good because we are out there arguing quality. However, what we are really doing is putting mandates on the American people. I can guarantee you, because the data shows it, we drive health care costs up when we impose mandates. Who is hurt? The people we think we are helping--the working poor people who are out there. 
A study by the Lewin Group showed that a 1 percent increase in premium implies that 200,000 people will lose their insurance. In fact, they said 200,000 to 400,000 people will lose their insurance. Yet, when we hear a little increase of 1 percent in your insurance premium we think anybody can take that. They do not. People will lose their insurance with these mandates. We should make the commitment, which the Nickles resolution does, not to pass legislation that drives the price of health care costs up and makes the uninsured a bigger problem. 
No. 2, good science. We need good science. Some mandates in some cases may be OK, but let us base that on good science where we are really helping people. 
Length of stay--mastectomy. Let me point out length of stay, how long you stay in a hospital, is not even mentioned in the landmark NIH consensus statement and guidelines for the management of breast cancer. In the guidelines that were determined by consensus to effect quality of care, the length of stay is not mentioned. In fact, in this particular bill where we talk about length of stay, length of stay is not necessarily the right issue. 
A 1996 study of 525 women who underwent outpatient mastectomies at Henry Ford Hospital in Michigan reported increased quality, accelerated physical recovery, earlier return to occupational activities, and numerous improved psychological advantages. 
My point is, if we are talking quality, this rubric of quality, we need to look at critical quality issues. Inpatient versus outpatient isn't necessarily a quality issue. It is an oversimplification. There are numerous studies. 
A 1995 study at the New Jersey College of Medicine of 133 
women who underwent outpatient partial mastectomies showed a lower rate of postoperative infection and a higher rate of satisfaction in comparison to a group having surgery on an inpatient basis. 
In addition, the amendment itself also has other mandates, mandating reimbursement for prescription drugs. That is something that Medicare does not even do. If you mandate coverage for prescription drugs, I will guarantee you, you are going to drive the costs of health care insurance up to the point that you are going to be driving people out of the marketplace where they will not have access to even an adequate level of health care. 
Thus, in closing, I rise to support--and I hope we will have a 100-0 vote for the Nickles amendment. Listen to what the Nickles amendment says. Let us not hurt quality of health care when we think we are helping it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on this past Sunday night history was made, perfection was attained, and a dynasty was firmly established in women's collegiate basketball. It is with great Tennessee pride that I salute the 1998 NCAA National Championship Lady Vols of the University of Tennessee.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this evening, along with my fellow Lady Vol fan, Senator Fred Thompson, I introduce this sense-of-the-Senate resolution establishing the Tennessee Lady Vols as the new dynasty in collegiate women's basketball. When one recites the great basketball dynasties of all time, the Boston Celtics, the Chicago Bulls, and the UCLA Bruins Men's team, one should certainly complete that list with the Tennessee Lady Vols. 
The greatest coach in women's basketball history, Pat Summitt, who recently appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated as the `Wizard of Knoxville,' has led the Lady Vols to their third national championship in a row by defeating a great Louisiana Tech team by the score of 93-75 in the NCAA Tournament final. This victory capped a perfect season at 39 wins and zero losses, the most victories ever for a woman's team. In fact, their current winning streak is 45 games. 
I watched, along with my fellow Tennesseans, with pride as the Lady Vols marched through their perfect season, defeating 39 teams by an average margin of 30 points. And 16 of these victories were against teams ranked in the top 25 in the Nation. This dominance is likely to continue into next year because, as all Lady Vol fans know, only one of these champion players is a senior. 
In closing, I would like to acknowledge the tremendous effort and the team play by the Lady Vols, who include team members, now familiar to this country, Niya Butts, Kyra Elzy, Laurie Milligan, Misty Greene, Kellie Jolly, Semeka Randall, Chamique Holdsclaw, Tamika Catchings, Brynae Laxton, Kristen Clement, LaShonda Stephens, and Teresa Geter. 
I would especially like to acknowledge the tremendous coaching job of Pat Summitt, and all the members of the University of Tennessee who have helped contribute to the building of this great dynasty. Lastly, I would like to recognize the most important group, and one which I am honored to be included in, the great Tennessee Vol fans. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, both East Tennessee State University's (ETSU) College of Nursing and the James Quillen College of Medicine are featured in the `1998 Best Graduate Schools,' published by U.S. News and World Report. This national recognition was given because of their excellent reputation for providing a variety of programs and specialty offerings. 
According to the guide, the Quillen College of Medicine is ranked sixth in the nation for its programs in rural medicine. The ETSU College of Nursing is ranked 26th among the nation's more than 300 graduate schools offering the family nurse practitioner program, which is part of the university's master of science in nursing curriculum. The rankings were determined based on a reputation survey that was sent to academic deans and senior faculty members at medical and nursing schools across the country. These programs are to be commended for providing high quality education and for their efforts to meet the health care needs in rural areas. 
As a physician, I know that programs in rural medicine are necessary and vital in meeting the health care needs of those who otherwise would not have access to care. Mr. President, it is programs like these that promote and encourage an interest in rural medicine for young people entering the medical profession today.

Mr. FRIST. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise in support of the cloture vote to proceed. The vote will take place in about an hour. 
What is the answer to the basic question of why should we proceed? The answer is for our children. We can no longer defend the status quo. The Coverdell Parent and Student Savings Account Plus Act is our next step in improving education for our children for the next generation. I will just point out that it builds on the new education IRAs from the Taxpayer Relief Act, which were directed to higher education. Senator Coverdell's proposal focuses on primary and secondary education. 
Why is that important? The answer is that no longer is the status quo defensible in American education. I want to take a few minutes to share why I say that. 
Over the last 6 months, I have had the opportunity to chair the Senate Budget Committee's Task Force on Education. In our hearings--a series of six hearings over the last 6 months--I have discovered several things: The current Federal establishment is so complex that it is difficult for even somebody from Government to come forward and say how many programs we have at the Federal level for education. I have learned that we have committed as a nation, as a people, as a U.S. Congress, substantial and growing resources to secondary and elementary education, but we have few proven good results to show for it. Our student performance is essentially flat over time. According to Secretary Riley, some of our schools `don't deserve to be called schools.' 
I have a few charts which depict why I say that we are not doing enough, and why we cannot defend the status quo. 
The first question we might ask is, are we as a nation, as a society, spending enough money today, putting enough resources into primary and secondary education? That is a fairly subjective question to ask. What we can answer is, are we spending increasing amounts over time? And the answer to that is yes. 
This first chart shows current expenditures per pupil in average daily attendance in public elementary and secondary schools. It goes from 1970 up to the current 1997 years. If you look at the green line in current dollars, it has gone from approximately $1,000 per pupil up to over $6,000 per pupil. If you apply that same curve to constant 1996-1997 dollars adjusting for inflation, we have gone from about $3,600 per pupil up to over $6,000, a 50-percent increase. Thus, over time, per pupil in today's dollars, we have increased spending about 50 percent per pupil. 
That, I believe, reflects what actually is being discussed in the Budget Committee as we speak--where we are going to increase spending more per pupil, a willingness, a commitment on the part of the Congress and the American people to spend more, to put more resources in education. 
I should point out that in 1997, we spent $36.6 billion on elementary and secondary education. It is important to note that the Federal spending of that amount is only about 7 percent. States and localities provide the rest. 
A second question is, what is the Federal role in primary and secondary education? We asked that question. I will put up a fairly large chart that is very complicated. In our own office, we call this the `spider web' chart. This is the chart that was produced by the General Accounting Office (GAO). GAO brought this chart to us to explain to us the Federal role in primary and secondary education. 
GAO basically took three areas--one is teachers, one is at-risk and delinquent youth and one is young children--to demonstrate the overlapping complexity. In fact, GAO's testimony that day was entitled `Multiple Programs and Lack of Data Raise Efficiency and Effectiveness Concerns.' That title really describes this chart very well. 
If we take one of these populations--the at-risk and delinquent youth, we can see, using this one example that there are 59 programs at the Department of Health and Human Services that are directed at this group; 7 are administered by the Department of Defense; 8 by the Department of Education; 4 by the Department of Housing and Urban Development; 9 by the Department of Labor; 22 by the Department of Justice; 3 by the Department of the Interior; 7 by the Department of Agriculture; 3 by the Department of Energy; 1 by the Department of Treasury; and 18 by various other agencies. 
This chart around the border shows that there are 23 Federal departments and agencies administering these multiple Federal programs to just these three targeted groups. Again, it is unimportant to figure out right now for the purposes of our discussion today what each of these programs are doing. The point is, it is very complicated with a lot of overlap. Is there room for streamlining and simplification and innovation? I think yes. 
Third question: With this bureaucracy and with this increased spending over time, how are we as a nation doing? What have our results been? 
Just 3 weeks ago, on February 24, the last battery of TIMSS, which is the Third International Math and Science Study, was released. This test measures the achievement of students at the end of their last year in secondary school, that is the 12th grade in the United States. These latest trends reflect the downward trend in America vis-a-vis our international competition, our international counterparts. 
I will go through several charts very quickly that summarize and demonstrate what Dr. Pat Forgione, the Commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, stated in his press release on the results. Let me quote him:  
Our most significant finding is that U.S. 12th grade students do not do well. When our graduating seniors are compared to the students graduating secondary school in other countries, our students rank near the bottom. This holds true in both science and math, and for both our typical and our top level students. 
Secretary Riley said, `These results are entirely unacceptable.' 
This first chart shows in the field of general science knowledge where we as a nation stand. The scores are in the columns on the right. All of these countries on the left are nations with average scores significantly higher than the United States. The United States is in the second lower category. There were only two nations tested who did significantly worse than the United States in the general science knowledge. 
You can see all the countries that did better: Sweden, the Netherlands, Iceland, Norway, Canada, New Zealand, Australia. This 
portion of the test measures skills `necessary for citizens in their daily life.' We are right at the bottom. 
Our next chart shows mathematics general knowledge achievement. The layout is the same. On the left are the countries which did better than the United States. We are at a level of 461. The average for all countries tested was 500. We are significantly below the average. Again, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Iceland, Norway, in terms of mathematics general knowledge do better than the United States. Again, this is measuring what citizens need to know in daily life. Only two countries did worse than us, Cypress and South Africa. 
Some people say, `That may be true, but is it a dumbing down or does our lower level pull the median down?' To answer that question, unfortunately, I turn to the next chart. We look just at advanced science students, just our very best compared to the very best in other countries to answer that fundamental question of whether or not the bottom rung brings our median down. 
For a long time, we thought our very best were better than the very best from other countries. Unfortunately, it is just not true. Again, the layout is just the same. These are nations with average scores higher than the United States. This is the average physics performance of the advanced science students. Again, you can see that we are at the bottom of the rung of the ladder. In fact, there are no nations--no nations--that did worse than our best students in this competition. 
Clearly, we are doing poorly when we compare ourselves internationally. But then let's go back and say, `Well, are we doing better than we did 20 years ago?' 
We see we are spending 50 percent more per pupil. Are we doing better? Is the payout for our investment real? What is the return? 
Unfortunately, this next chart, again 1970 to 1996, shows the data. In spite of increased spending and lower class sizes, the trends are completely flat. The red is 9-year-olds, the blue is 13-year-olds, the green is 17-year-olds. These are the trends in reading on this first chart. 
The bottom line is that we have seen no improvement whatsoever in the last 20 years. The next chart shows in the field of science, once again, the average science scale scores for our Nation over time in control testing is completely flat--flat line, very little return on our investment. 
I think this argues that we can't defend the status quo. We can't have bills filibustered which are innovative, which are creative, which inject that creativity and innovation in our system today, because the status quo is simply unacceptable. 
Access has improved over time. In 1900, only 6 percent of American students graduated from high school. In 1967, 50 percent of the population finished high school. Today, completing high school is nearly a universal phenomenon with 94 percent of America's youth completing high school, although many not on time. So access has greatly improved; quality has not improved. 
The Coverdell Parent and Student Savings Account Plus Act is not the cure-all. We recognize it is not the cure-all, but it is our next step in improving education in this country. It empowers the parent-child team, it encourages savings for education, it recognizes that the status quo is not sufficient in preparing our children for the future, and it encourages innovation and new ideas. 
In closing, I urge my colleagues to allow this bill to come to the floor to be debated and voted upon. I urge its support and look forward to defending this bill as our next best step in reforming education in our country. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.  
Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Health Professions Reauthorization Act. First, I would like to tell you a story illustrating the importance of this legislation, which strives to increase the numbers of health practitioners in rural, underserved areas, to increase the number of underrepresented minorities and focus on primary care. My story is about a young man who dreamed of a career in medicine. Keith Junior, grew up in Nashville. During his high school years, he often visited the Meharry Medical College campus where he was warmly received and encouraged by the health care professionals and staff. Meharry's Health Careers Opportunity Program, (HCOP) helped him develop his academic skills and supplement his undergraduate experiences, in a supportive environment with a rich history and caring spirit. 
After completing college, Mr. Junior pursued an application to medical school. However, his undergraduate grades and MCAT scores were considered low. The HCOP program helped him to improve those scores. Because Meharry has a commitment to students who demonstrate a potential for success which might be otherwise overlooked by other institutions he applied there, was accepted and graduated. 
Dr. Junior recalls his experiences in the Meharry HCOP as invaluable in helping him to realize his dream of a career in medicine. He is now an internist and Interim Director of the Matthew Walker Health Center in Nashville, Tennessee. More important, he serves as a role model of success for younger generations to emulate. 
Mr. President, this story illustrates the many real life successes for individuals who benefit from the Title VII and Title VIII programs, of the Public Health Service Act. I rise today to introduce the Health Professions Reauthorization Act of 1998 which funds those programs. For many years this legislation has helped our nation's schools of health to serve the health needs of their communities better and to prepare the practitioners of the future. 
A critical component of the Title VII and VIII programs has been the goal to help students in need. These programs have often represented the assistance of last resort for many disadvantaged students seeking careers in health. I believe several schools in Tennessee tell this story well: in the East Tennessee State University Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public and Allied Health approximately 89% of their students are deemed disadvantaged by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Both East Tennessee State University's College of Nursing and the James Quillen College of Medicine are featured in the `1998 Best Graduate Schools,' published by U.S. News and World Report. These schools were praised for their programs in rural medicine. I am extremely proud of these programs because they have been given national recognition for their mission which is to train primary health care professionals and to encourage an interest in serving rural areas. 
Equally important is this legislation's goal to fill the health care needs of many underserved communities, often in rural or inner city areas. With the assistance of Title VIII programs, the Vanderbilt School of Nursing reports that 72 percent of its 1997 graduating class is working in medically underserved areas. East Tennessee State University was also able to open the first nurse-managed primary care clinic in rural Appalachia with pretty impressive results: 7,663 primary care visits, 25% of which were preventive services; 51% of the patients were covered by Tennessee's Medicaid Program (TennCare) and 16% of the patients were uninsured; 54% of the visits were care for children under the age of 18. 
The examples from my medical colleagues in Tennessee are representative of the needs and results elsewhere in the nation due to the Health Professions Act, and I believe the revisions made in this bill continue to strengthen these programs and prepare us for the next century. 
This bill reauthorizes the programs funded through Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act. They are intended: to improve the distribution of health professions workers to underserved areas; to strengthen the infrastructures of organizations which facilitate their training and performance; to improve accountability for federal dollars used in these processes; and to improve the representation of minorities and disadvantaged individuals in the health professions, better reflecting the communities which they serve. 
However, more importantly, this bill represents an opportunity to improve the quality of, and access to, health care for millions of Americans. Why? 
It is the only measure to counter the maldistributions caused by current Graduate Medical Education programs and market forces. Patients in underserved areas depend on programs funded by this bill in order to receive their health care. Training providers in these areas greatly increases the likelihood they will work in these areas when they complete their education. 
It is an example of our government's ability to act as a catalyst. Too often we, as legislators, are forced to step in and micro manage such health care issues as hospital lengths of stay in order to preserve quality of care. 
I believe we are far better served to develop programs that stimulate the types of efforts which create innovative solutions for these problems, and give practitioners/clinicians the tools necessary to make needed changes. 
It fosters collaboration. Although foundations are still being laid, the many interest groups involved in this bill are learning to work together. They have discovered that they do have areas of common interest and they are learning to build on those incentives. Within many institutions new interdisciplinary programs are being developed and this legislation further stimulates those activities. 
Finally, over time, this bill will streamline care and improve cost-effectiveness. 
Although its costs are quite small when compared to other health care measures, we still see it as an opportunity to set an example of efficient, high quality care. 
Over the years, there have been many successes among the more than 300 programs funded through this legislation. Thus, clarification of the goals and objectives of these programs is a priority. We had to find ways to function within our budgetary constraints as well. 
In 1995, Senators Kassebaum, Kennedy and I attempted to take the 44 programs involved and consolidate them into 6 groups or clusters. Performance outcomes were added. This approach was used to streamline the granting process, and to allow HHS to use budgetary factors: to leverage areas of development; and to align with community workforce needs. 
It also provided flexibility for strategic planning of the workforce supply, and insured a greater percentage of program dollars would go directly to grantees versus federal administration. Further, the FY98 Appropriations bill passed by the Senate, also clustered these programs. 
After the Act passed in the Senate in 1996 but failed to pass in the House, I re-examined it to identify areas of disagreement. Over the past year, I made a concerted effort to overcome those obstacles. Another hearing was held on April 25, 1997 because I wanted to be sure that I listened to all parties and that all possibilities for compromise were addressed. My staff has worked very hard to maintain that level of input. We sought to involve the many constituency groups in the preparation of this legislation. The 1998 Health Professions Reauthorization Act accomplishes the goals passed by the Senate last year in several ways: 
It still uses only 7 clusters, but has 15 lines of authority as well. This approach, while more complex is also more reflective of both existing and potential alliances. It gives security about funding to groups within these clusters, and in turn, allows them to plan longer range. 
Flexibility is built into the bill over time. As funding lines change, the Secretary's authority to move funds across program lines increases. Thus, programs can grow into the cluster concept. This revision will better reflect the constantly changing healthcare needs of communities and more rapidly changing health care delivery system. 
Since so much of the Act's flexibility is based on the discretion of the Secretary, we have added advisory councils to insure that the view points of those on the front lines are heard. This will restore confidence among the grantees and encourage positive collaboration between agency officers and the programs they manage. In addition, these councils will report back to Congress to assure oversight of these programs. 
To encourage independence from federal funding, matching requirements for non-federal funds are required wherever appropriate. Federal dollars provide the seed money necessary for many health clinics to get on their feet, and in turn secure other financing mechanisms. 
Programs which attempt to resolve cultural barriers, especially those related to language, are restored. 
Community-based organizations are empowered so that the patient's voice can be heard. 
Geriatric initiatives have been strengthened and expanded to train health care personnel as we promote and integrate geriatrics into American medicine. Today there are 33 million older Americans, and by 2030 it is expected that the elderly population will reach 66 million strong, when 1 of every 5 Americans will be 65 years of age or older.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to announce the establishment of the National Commission for Science and Mathematics Leadership. This effort is a direct result of the United States' devastating performance of 12th grade students on the recently released Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), the most comprehensive and rigorous comparison of quantitative skills across nations. If we, as a nation, are going to continue to be global leaders in the new knowledge-based economy, we must first re-evaluate our current failures in our classrooms. I concur with Secretary Daley when he stated, `These results are entirely unacceptable.' 
TIMSS was designed to constructively assess the students' knowledge of mathematics and science needed to function effectively in society as adults. American 12th graders were outperformed in mathematics and science literacy by their counterparts in 12 of 20 countries, and only faired better than 2, Cypress and South Africa. In advanced mathematics and physics, no country performed more poorly. We simply cannot accept the conclusion of this study without considering its consequences on our entire educational system. 
The 4th grade TIMSS measurement indicated that the American students are well above the international average in mathematics and very near the top in achievement in science. However, the United States Is the only country in TIMSS whose students dropped in ranking from above average in mathematics at the fourth grade level to slightly below average performance at the eighth grade. And it only gets worse. Why does this drop-off occur? American students start out equal with or ahead in basic skills and steadily decline the longer they stay in school, compared with the students of our country's main trading partners. 
Our children cannot afford to be illiterate in mathematics and science. The rapidly changing American society demands skills requiring mathematics, science, and technology. Information Technology, perhaps the fastest growing sector of our economy with 90% of new jobs, relies on more than basic high school literacy in mathematics and science. 
The National Commission on Science and Mathematics Leadership is a first step toward improving our current educational system. It is a solid commitment from Congress to establish a core of national experts to review and propose recommendations for assuring leadership in science and mathematics training in the United States. Furthermore, using TIMSS as a comprehensive and valuable tool, the Commission, in coordination with the National Academy of Sciences, will analyze the results of this international study to better our schools, and more importantly, the future of our children.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am very pleased to introduce today, with the majority leader, the Women's Health Research and Prevention Amendments of 1998. The purpose of this bill is to increase awareness of some of the most pressing diseases and health issues that women in our country face. This bill focuses on women's health research and prevention activities at the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Our goal, in introducing this bill today, is to create greater awareness of women's health issues and to highlight the critical role our public health agencies--the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, and the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention--play in providing a broad spectrum of activities to improve women's health, including research, screening, health data management, prevention and treatment of diseases, and broad health education. 
This bill reauthorizes programs at the National Institutes of Health for vital research activities into the causes, prevention, and treatment for some of the major diseases affecting women, including osteoporosis, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, as well as research into the aging processes of women. 
Let me cite just a few statistics to illustrate the need for further research into these health issues. 
Osteoporosis is a health threat for 28 million Americans, 80 percent of whom are women. One in every two women over the age of 50 years will have an osteoporosis-related fracture. 
One out of every eight women will develop breast cancer over the course of their lifetimes, and 1 in 25 will die of breast cancer. 
Ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of death from cancer among women. One of the most troubling aspects of ovarian cancer is the challenge we have in diagnosing this disease earlier and earlier. We know that a late diagnosis results in a worse outcome. The reauthorization of these research programs will help assure scientific progress in our fight against these diseases and will lessen their burden on women and their families. 
For far too long, women in this country have been neglected in many of our research clinical studies. I am very pleased that, since 1993, we have developed guidelines to include women and minorities in NIH-sponsored trials. However, we must continue to do more. We must continue to review our women's health research agenda to set future research priorities and to incorporate new scientific knowledge regarding women's health. We must continue to focus and coordinate all our efforts in research areas, including clinical trial research design, genetic factors, the aging process, and other gender-based differences. 
I am also pleased in this bill that we authorize a new research program at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute at the NIH to target heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases in women. This program, originally introduced by my colleague, Senator Boxer, will advance research into cardiovascular diseases--the leading cause of death in the United States in women. More than 500,000 American women will die annually from cardiovascular diseases. Cardiovascular diseases--that is, diseases of the heart and the blood vessels--kill almost twice as many American women as all other cancers. 
One of the biggest myths in medicine is that heart disease is only a male problem. When we think of a heart attack, many people associate it with men. Even in my own studies during my internship and residency in medicine--not that long ago--all the models, the pictures that were used in textbooks, the warning signs on TV--always pictured a man. 
However, since 1984, the number of cardiovascular disease deaths in women has exceeded those of men. And in 1995, 50,000 more women died of heart disease than men. The program we are including in the bill today will expand the research programs at NIH to concentrate more on cardiovascular diseases in women. 
Our bill reauthorizes several programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for prevention and education activities on women's health issues. We are reauthorizing the National Center for Health Statistics, the National Program of Cancer Registries, the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, the Centers for Research and Demonstration of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, and the Community Programs on Domestic Violence. 
CDC's programs provide critical health services in each of our States and in our communities to detect, prevent, and diagnose diseases such as breast and cervical cancer. For the past 7 years, the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program has provided critical cancer screening services to underserved women, especially low-income women, elderly women, and members of racial and ethnic minority groups. CDC supports early detection programs in all 50 States, in 5 territories, in the District of Columbia, and in 14 American Indian/Alaskan Native organizations. Through March 1997, more than 1.3 million screening tests have been provided by this one program. 
CDC programs provide critical data and statistics about women's health that assist us in making informed policy decisions about health care. The National Center for Health Statistics often provides the only national data on the health status of U.S. women and their use of health care. A recent report by the National Center for Health Statistics entitled `Women: Work and Health' summarized the data on health conditions affecting working women. This report is the first comprehensive survey on work-related health issues encountered by the more than 60 million women in the American labor force. 
I thank the majority leader for his leadership on this issue and for his efforts in the introduction of this bill. I am pleased to state that this bill is bipartisan. We have included provisions that are the product of the efforts of many of my colleagues--Senators Snowe, Harkin, Boxer, and many others. We have the support of nearly the full Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, and over 27 Members of the Senate are original cosponsors of this bipartisan bill. The level of support for this bill is a real testament to the need to combat the diseases affecting women and to maintain those crucial health services that help prevent these diseases. 
This bill, again, is introduced to generate discussion of these important programs. We intend to consider these programs within the context of the upcoming NIH reauthorization bill to be introduced over the next several months. I encourage all Members and constituencies to review the current programs and to provide input as we set the future agenda of women's health research and prevention in this Nation.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as we come to the end of what is recognized as National Heart Month, I would like to recognize and commend two outstanding organizations, which are celebrating their fiftieth anniversary this year. These organizations are the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the American Heart Association (AHA). 
In 1948, President Truman signed the National Heart Act which established the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute at the NIH. The mission of the NHLBI is to `provide for research and control relating to diseases of the heart and circulation in a supreme endeavor to develop quickly more effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of such diseases.' In reviewing their record over the past fifty years I am proud of the advances and investments the Institute has made in the area of biomedical research. To help in the prevention and diagnosis of heart disease, the NHLBI began research studies such as the Framingham Heart Studies which advanced the understanding of the risk factors for heart disease that are universally known today, but was critically lacking in 1948. These factors are of course high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes and the lack of exercise. These studies led to the development of effective medications to control high blood pressure that have helped reduce deaths from `brain attack', commonly known as stroke. The NHLBI has also performed a critical role in the development of techniques to restore blood flow to the heart, including the use of `clot-busting' drugs. These developments have cut the average length of hospitalization for a heart attack to under ten days. 
The NHLBI has also made significant progress in lung and blood research. The programs helped protect the health of our children through the work on prevention and treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and new techniques for treating asthma. Blood research at NHLBI led to the establishment of the Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center in 1972 to continue its work to cure sickle cell anemia. They have also laid the ground work for advances in the management of blood resources, including the storage and preservation of denoted blood, blood type matching, bone marrow transplantation, and enabling safe blood transfusions and more successful organ transplantations. 
As one who has devoted his life to medicine, and even more specifically to heart surgery and transplantation, I can tell you, without the NHLBI leading the way, many of the treatments for heart and pulmonary disease we take for granted today would not have been possible or would still be in development. To understand the impact of the last fifty years, let me relay a few statistics. In the fifty years since the establishment of the NHBLI, heart attacks have decreased by more than 50 percent and stroke by at least 66 percent. 
However, to say that we have cardiovascular disease under control is a mistake. It is the number one killer in America, claiming 960,592 lives in 1995 or 1 out of every 2.4 deaths. In my own state of Tennessee for every 100,000 people living in the state, 220 died of cardiovascular diseases. The 1998 estimated annual cost of cardiovascular disease to the United States for health care expenses and lost productivity is $274 billion. 
The American Heart Association, which I have had a long history of working with, has also played a tremendous role in fighting heart disease by investing in research, education and community service programs. Founded in 1948 the AHA held the first national conference on cardiovascular disease in 1950. Throughout the past fifty years, the AHA has been funding important research projects. Some examples of early breakthroughs that are attributed to the AHA is the first open heart surgery in 1953, and the implantation of the first externally powered pacemaker in 1957. The AHA has continued supporting research and most recently funded the 1992 Nobel Prize winner Dr. Edwin Krebs whose research on how proteins are switched on to perform functions within cells has helped scientists understand organ transplantation rejection. 
In the areas of public education and community service, I would like to single out the American Heart Association efforts in starting the education of `closed chest cardiac pulmonary resuscitation', known as CPR in 1960 and their first public health campaign on the early warning signs of heart disease begun in 1970. Currently the AHA is focusing on women and heart disease, dispelling the myth that it is a man's disease. They point out that since 1984 the number of cardiovascular disease deaths for females has exceeded those of males and that in 1995 over half a million women died of heart disease, which was 50,000 more than men. Coronary heart disease is the number one killer of American women and claims more lives than the leading 16 causes of death combined and almost twice as many as all forms of cancer. 
As they reach their fiftieth year, the NHLBI and AHA can look back with pride on the remarkable achievements in treating cardiovascular diseases. However, they will be the first ones to tell you that more can and needs to be done. In the next fifty years, the future of biomedical research into areas of heart disease is very promising. Molecular genetic approaches are emerging as a powerful tool of understanding the causes of disease and for developing diagnostic tests and effective drug therapies. In fact, genetic defects have already been discovered that have been shown to indicate an increased risk of high blood pressure. More extensive investigation of genetic susceptibility for heart disease may lead to new treatments and may even reveal ways to reverse the progression of these diseases. 
Gene therapy, in which patients with a defective gene receive copies of a healthy gene, is still in the experimental stage. However recent successes in gene-based therapy, such as gene-based stimulation of new blood vessels around a blocked artery, show how close we are to putting gene-based therapies into practice. There is also important NHLBI research occurring to look at new ways to reduce the risk of immune rejection and graft-verses-host disease in bone marrow and organ transplantation. 
Mr. President, today I recognize the past fifty years of achievement of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and American Heart Association on an issue that is of tremendous importance not just to me as a heart and lung transplant surgeon, but to all citizens. Through their efforts we are more aware of the dangers and causes of heart disease. Through their efforts we are more prepared to fight cardiovascular disease and are armed with more effective treatments that continue to be developed. Based on the demonstrated history of dedication by these organizations and how far we have come in fighting cardiovascular disease, I look to the next fifty years with optimism and anticipation of what science will accomplish in building on the solid foundation begun in 1948.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, at the end of this month, Jack Van Hooser the Commissioner for Rehabilitation Services for the State of Tennessee is retiring after thirty-five years of dedicated service. Throughout his career, Jack has been a tireless servant of the State of Tennessee and has worked to empower individuals with disabilities to achieve independence and gain employment. Jack's record of achievement is impressive. In 1996, under his direction, the Tennessee Vocational Rehabilitation Program served 26,032 individuals with disabilities of which 81 percent were severely disabled. Of the individuals, served 5,820 were successfully employed with more than 90 percent of them working in the competitive labor market. The annualized income of these 5,820 individuals, once they entered the work force increased from $8.732 million to $64.233 million. I am proud of Jack's leadership and the achievement of his agency. 
Jack began to develop the strong leadership skills that have transcended through his distinguished career while attending Columbia High School in Columbia, Tennessee. At Columbia High, Jack was elected President of the Student Body, and served as the captain of the football, baseball and basketball teams. In football, Jack was All-State for two years and made the All-Southern and All-American teams. 
After High School, Jack attended Tennessee Tech where he met his wife of forty-three years, Wanda with whom he has two sons, Jay and Dave. He continued his sports career at Tennessee Tech where he played football and baseball. As Tennessee Tech's quarterback he made the All-Conference Team and the little All-American Football Team. Jack served in the United States Army for two years upon graduation. 
Jack went back to school and earned a master's degree from the University of Tennessee after his military service and was a teacher and athletic coach in Lake City, Florida and Isaac Litton High School in Nashville. Even today, serving as a softball coach, his passion for sports and coaching is evident. 
In 1960, Jack began his service to the citizens of Tennessee with the Tennessee Division of Rehabilitation Services. He started as a Disabilities Examiner, helping individuals with disabilities get their benefits. Jack, went on to supervise, train and develop the staff of the Division of Rehabilitation Services. As I review Jack's record of achievement, I notice that he has held several important positions that touched all aspects of the program until he ultimately headed the program in 1995. I am proud of his dedication to help Tennesseans with disabilities achieve employment, to help give them opportunity and independence. That caring and dedication should serve as an example to us all as we carry out the critical work of the United States Senate. 
Friday, Jack Van Hooser will retire. He will spend more time with his wife and family. I have no doubt that he will also teach his four granddaughters, not only how to play softball, but teach them how to be leaders and serve their fellow citizens with the dignity and respect he has for so many years.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, Saturday, February 14, has a special significance: it is the first National Donor Day to promote the Five Points of Life, gifts that we can give others to help save lives. The Five Points of Life are whole blood, platelets, bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, and organ/tissue transplants; gifts of these valuable resources have been responsible for saving numerous lives. 
The National Donor Day was developed by a partnership of the Saturn Motor Company, one of the leading corporations in my home state of Tennessee, and the United Auto Workers. The National Donor Day has the strong support of the Department of Health and Human Services and the enthusiastic cooperation of other volunteer associations, such as the American Red Cross, America's Blood Centers, National Marrow Donor Program, National Minority Organ/Tissue Transplant Education Program, the Transplant Recipients International Organization, Coalition on Donation, and Rotary International. 
On National Donor Day, February 14, all Saturn automobile dealerships will be participating in a program to promote donation of the Five Points of Life. Blood donor drives will be conducted, and registration forms will be available to sign up as an organ donor or bone marrow donor. 
This type of public/private partnership is the key to solving the shortage of donors. The stocks of whole blood and platelets have to be constantly replaced so their life-saving components will be available to the millions who use them. There are over 56,000 people on the waiting list for organ transplants, and ten die each day because organs are not available to save their lives. The National Marrow Donor Program has over 2.6 million people registered, but still there are many people who need bone marrow donation who are unable to find a suitable match among these individuals. Medical science has developed ways to save peoples' lives by using these resources, but unless everyone helps by offering the gift of Five Points of Life, all the skills of our doctors and physicians are for nought. 
In response to this need for the Five Points of Life, people from all over the country are stepping up to meet the call. Tom Meredith from Nashville is a donor dad whose tragedy at the loss of two children was somewhat alleviated by the thought that their donated organs benefitted 97 people. Dr. Kenneth Moritsugu, an Assistant Surgeon General of the United States, is a donor husband and donor dad who tells movingly how organs donated by his wife and daughter, who were killed in separate traffic accidents, brought life to many others. 
Mr. President, this altruism in the face of despair is a challenge to us all to become donors and give a gift of the Five Points of Life. I only wish all of you had the chance to see first-hand, as I have, the look of joy on the face of a child who, after receiving a transplant, no longer has to gasp for breath. As we give gifts of love to our spouses and sweethearts this Saturday, Valentine's Day, let us promise to give another gift of love to others we may not even know, the greatest gift of all, the gift of life.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to support the underlying bill and hope that we will be able to proceed with a discussion of the bill today. No longer can we divorce science from ethical consideration. Science moves too fast today. We see it, with what has resulted from Dolly with this cloning procedure. Science and ethics must march hand in hand. 
What does this bill do? No. 1: It prevents cloning of a human being. It stops people, like Dr. Seed, who have proposed cloning human individuals dead in their tracks. 
No. 2: It creates a commission, 25 people, bipartisan, broadly representative of the American people, ethicists on board, the very best scientists on board, social scientists on board and lay people on board. That commission will consider new technology, will consider cloning, will consider the next potential great 
advance that is out there with that ethical, theological and scientific environment. 
What does this bill do? This bill does not stop any current research being done in in vitro fertilization, in stem cells, in transplantation. And I challenge any scientist, because the scientific community and the private industry and all say, `No, we can't stop science,' we need to involve that ethical decisionmaking today--I do challenge any scientist who reads the wording in the bill to send me a peer-reviewed study that is banned by the wording of this bill. Read the bill. 
Do we eliminate all embryo research? No, only a single technique, that balance we have achieved between hope and the potential opportunities for a technique versus the ethical consideration and the science we have achieved by looking at a single technique. 
We don't eliminate all embryo research, just a single technique when applied to the procedure when it clones a human embryo. That is the only area. 
Do we eliminate all of this technique? Do we eliminate all of this somatic cell nuclear transfer? Absolutely not. The Dolly experiments continue. The animal research continues in somatic cell nuclear transfer. 
The only thing we eliminate is the future application when this technique is used only in the circumstance to create a live cloned human embryo. All animal research continues today. This is an untested procedure. It may be harmful. It has not been proven to be safe today. Shouldn't we be looking at it in animal models instead of taking it to the human population? That is what this bill does. Slow down. Let's do that animal research before creating live cloned human embryos. 
It is a tough issue. I don't want to slow down science and the progress of science, but I do think that we, as a society, absolutely must recognize that not all science can proceed ahead without consideration by the American people, without consideration of the ethical implications. All of the hopes that have been mentioned in terms of curing disease projected into the future, I have those same hopes, but I also recognize that we can't go totally on uncharted courses. Science has been abused in the past. We can look back at Hitler and what Hitler did in the name of science. We have to take these ethical considerations and put them hand in hand in the progress of science. 
Let me close and simply say, the commission is vital to this legislation. We have to have a forum that is not on the Senate floor, that is not just in the scientific communities, to address these issues. That is what this commission achieves.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination of Dr. David Satcher for the positions of Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health. Dr. Koop called the position of Surgeon General `a high calling, with an obligation to interpret health and medical facts for the public.' `A high calling'--a high calling because one subjects oneself to all sorts of accusations, in portraits painted that may not quite be accurate. In fact, sometimes they may be false and sometimes misguided and certainly misleading. Therefore, I would like to focus my comments over the next several minutes on debunking some of the accusations we have heard on the floor over the past week, one by one. 
No. 1, Dr. Satcher's position regarding abortion. Let me say at the outset that I strongly support the ban on partial-birth abortions passed by this Congress, vetoed by the President. I questioned Dr. Satcher about his agreement with the President's position. Let me say that in talking with him, the issues of partial-birth abortion deeply trouble Dr. Satcher. He has said both to me and in writing to this committee that he supports the ban of this procedure in concept, but he stops short of Federal legislation when the health of the mother is involved. 
I do not agree with the President's position or Dr. Satcher's agreement with the President. In a letter of October 28, he wrote me the following, which is reassuring to me. It says: 
Let me state unequivocally that I have no intention of using the positions of the Assistant Secretary for Health and Surgeon General to promote issues related to abortion. 
He continues: 
I share no one's political agenda. And I want to use the power of these positions to focus on issues that unite Americans--not divide them. 
He continues: 
If I am confirmed by the Senate, I will strongly promote a message of abstinence and responsibility to our youth, which I believe can help to reduce the number of abortions in our country. 
If you look over Dr. Satcher's past--not an agenda we want to impose on him, but his past--over the last 25 years, he has never made abortion a part of his agenda in promoting the public health. And, as you look forward, using the words that I just quoted, he has made the statement that abortion is not going to be a part of his agenda in the future. 
No. 2, AZT trials in Africa and Asia. I have talked about this on the floor, but let me just very briefly say that today, actually over the course of the day, 1,000 HIV-infected babies will be born in developing countries. These babies will go ahead and, unfortunately, die. 
The goal of the studies that have been carried out, proposed, and are under discussion, was to find a way to stop transmission of that HIV virus from HIV-infected pregnant women to their children. You do not do that--you do not do that--by studying Western-style, prohibitively expensive technology impractical in developing countries, Western-style medicine that requires intravenous administration, repeated visits back to the physician or to the clinic, because there is absolutely no chance that that sort of therapy can be applied in the developing countries where the goal is to prevent transmission. 
That is the goal of the study--not to make us feel good, not to prove that the therapy works for the United States or England or France--but to decrease transmission in those countries. And you do not do that by eliminating an arm of the study that includes the current standard of care. We are blessed in this country where the standard of care is not a placebo or doing nothing. Unfortunately, in Africa--and I was just there 3 weeks ago--the current standard of care is no therapy. That has to be an arm of the trial when you are looking at a new intervention. 
I am absolutely convinced, as a physician, as a clinical researcher, that the trials in Africa met the institutional, the national, and the international ethical standards as defined today. 
These studies came in 1994. The World Health Organization recommended that studies be done to test the safety and efficacy of this short-term AZT therapy which had the potential of helping developing countries. In fact, I would argue that it would be unethical to take a Western-style therapy that can only be applied in countries that have the technological advances, that can have repeated visits, that have the money, it would be unethical to take that and experiment on a population that could not potentially benefit from that in the future. 
Third issue. Federal funding of needle exchange programs and educational conferences has come up again and again and again. Dr. Satcher will very simply--talking about the man; no programs and documents coming from here and there; talking about the man--Dr. Satcher, the man nominated, has never advocated, has never supported taxpayer-funded needle exchange programs for drug abusers. Let me repeat, Dr. Satcher has never advocated or supported taxpayer-funded needle exchange programs for drug abusers. 
Dr. Satcher, furthermore, in both written and oral conversations, believes strongly that we should never do anything to advocate the use of illegal drugs.

Mr. FRIST. Let me run through this in the interest of time. 
No. 4, research on guns. The CDC National Center for Injury Prevention and Control has been criticized by some for supporting grantees with an alleged bias against guns as we look at violence. These studies have been carried out. 
Again, I have talked to Dr. Satcher personally and discussed, in my office, this issue. I brought up at that time the fact that raw data had not been made available from a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, that it should be made public. And I am actually very pleased that the raw data is now available on the Internet for everybody to see. I appreciate his rapid response. 
Fifth issue. Dr. Satcher has been accused of secretly conducting blind HIV studies on newborn babies and sending them home infected without treatment. Not true. Not true. It makes for great sound bites, and it catches the people's imagination, but it is simply not true. 
Again, look at what happens. The big issue is what is the incidence at the time? What is the incidence? What is the prevalence of HIV infection in your community? How would you find that out today? 
Well, the study that was actually carried out was that samples were obtained that had been discarded, set aside from clinics and from hospitals, all done once again with ethical standards of the time, and tests were done on that blood to see what the underlying incidence was. Yes, they were not labeled. In fact, all of the personal labeling had been stripped from the discarded samples. Why? Because of the privacy of those individuals. 
Another point that has not been mentioned is that each of these clinics, each of these hospitals who participated in this baseline study to see what the incidence of HIV infection is, had at the time offered voluntary HIV counseling and testing at every site where this study took place. Therefore, each and every woman did have the opportunity to learn her HIV status. 
Those are the issues that have come forward. Let me just briefly say, in Dr. Satcher's own words, because we have tended to look at all these other issues--I think we need to look at his past, his principles, and his agenda. What is his agenda? His agenda is--and I quote--  
As Surgeon General, I would strive to provide our citizens with cutting-edge technology in plain old-fashioned, straight talk. Whether we are talking about smoking or poor diets, I want to send the message of good health to the American people. 
He continued, as he looked forward in his vision: 
My goals as Assistant Secretary for Health and Surgeon General are to be an effective adviser to the Secretary by providing sound medical, public health and scientific advice as appropriate. I want to bring more attention, awareness and clarity to the opportunities for disease prevention and health promotion that are available to individuals, to families, to communities in this country. I want to help make the health of children and youth a greater priority for the Nation and serve as a positive and inspirational role model to them. 
Personal responsibility and prevention, that is Dr. Satcher's agenda for the future. 
Dr. Satcher has dedicated his career to public health. He is well qualified to lead the U.S. Public Health Service and its commissioned officers to meet these worthy goals. I urge my colleagues to support the vote which will take place in a few minutes, the cloture vote, and to support Dr. Satcher as the next Surgeon General. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, Cadet Captain Guy Pryor, a student at Haywood High School, in Brownsville, Tennessee, will soon be honored by the Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps with its highest honor, the Cadet Gold Valor Award. Cadet Pryor is receiving this award for his heroic efforts on Sunday, December 19, 1997, as he attempted to save the life of an automobile accident victim. 
Cadet Pryor and his friends left a Sunday evening church party in Jackson when they came upon the scene of an accident, a head-on collision. One of the cars in the accident, a Toyota pick-up, was already engulfed in flames, lying in a ditch, having rolled about 100 feet from the crash site. The man trapped in the vehicle was desperately calling for help. 
Without hesitating, Cadet Pryor ran to the truck, and began pulling at the passenger door. Those watching cautioned him that the truck might well explode at any moment, and called for him to move from the truck. The flames were already so hot Cadet Pryor's palms burned, and an onlooker threw him a coat to better insulate his hands against the fire. 
Cadet Pryor succeeded in pulling the man from the truck just as paramedics arrived. Unfortunately, the victim, Hugh Rainey Pegram of Jackson, died on the way to the hospital, and our hearts go out to his loved ones. Cadet Pryor was taken to the hospital for treatment of his burned hands and released. 
So often we do not hear about our young people who distinguish themselves. Cadet Pryor is a hero in the truest sense of the word because at great peril to himself, he gave willingly and without question to a fellow human being in need. His spirit of service and selflessness is an example for all of us to emulate. 
This recognition from the Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps is a wonderful testament to Cadet Pryor's bravery that Sunday night. The Cadet Gold Valor Award brings honor to Cadet Pryor and his family, and also to the outstanding Tennessee 944th unit of the Junior ROTC at Haywood County High School. Cadet Pryor's story is an inspiration to us all, and I am proud to be his United States Senator.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak, hopefully in part at least, to clarify where we are today in terms of a bill which is enormously important to all of us, to our families, to our children, to health care, to medical science. It is a bill that has been talked about in the context of cloning, of human cloning. For the past year--not on the specifics of the bill--no, but there has been debate in the past year about whether or not today, in 1998, our society is ready to clone, or have mass production, of cloned human individuals. 
My distinguished colleague from Massachusetts just spoke to the importance of science, and of protecting scientific discoveries that will contribute to health care for the next generation. As a scientist, let me say at the outset that I could not agree more wholeheartedly with the commitment to not slowing down science in its efforts to improve health care. 
I say this, and I will qualify my statement by saying that we have to today consider the ethical implications that surround scientific discovery. We must consider the ethical ramifications that might--in certain very narrowly defined and specific arenas--tell us to stop, tell us to slow down before we jump or really leap ahead--into the unknown. This would have huge moral and ethical implications, not just in how we deal with each other as individuals, but also in terms of how we deal with each other globally. This is because we are talking about affecting the overall genetic pool as well as the psychosocial implications of how we are defined as individuals. 
This does need to be addressed. It is going to take an ongoing dialogue. We cannot--cannot--answer all the questions here in this Senate Chamber or in the U.S. Congress. It does take the overall debate of `What are the ethical limitations to various aspects of science today?' into the public square--where we can meet with scientists, lay people, bioethicists, people from the business community, theologians, and ethicists broadly. 
We need to face that. And I mention that because this bill has not been brought to the floor formally. We have the objection. But I think it is important to understand what this particular bill does. It does two important things. No. 1, it establishes a commission, a bioethical commission which is composed of 25 people, a permanent commission that will look at the bioethical issues of new innovations, new science, new technology so that we do not have to debate every new breakthrough, every new technology which is coming with increasing frequency here in this Chamber. 
This commission is to be comprised of 24 individuals. Subcommittees are set up in terms of ethics, medicine, theology, science and social sciences. It is broadly representative, not with politicians on it. In fact, there is an exclusion in there for putting politicians on it, but it will be appointed in a bicameral way by both sides of the aisle, broadly representative, with each member serving for 3 years, rotating members, with ongoing discussion. 
There is no forum today for the American people to have the ethical, theological, scientific, social implications of this new technology discussed. And that is why this is striking such a strong chord here today. So some people say, `Why don't we run away from this? Why don't we just say,' based on what I have just implied, `let's don't address it now. Let's wait until the future?' 
Well, in truth, that is what has happened over the last year. We had a breakthrough. And it is a breakthrough using a specific technology which in a sheep--Dolly--really captured the attention of the world because it demonstrated for the first time that we are on the edge or on a precipice looking out to a type of science which we have never had to face before realistically, and that is the replication, the duplication of the human being. 
How have we handled it? It is not like we have not talked 
about human cloning. Yet a lot of people will come forward and say we have not addressed this in this body or as a Nation. 
As chairman of a subcommittee which is focused on issues of public health and safety, I can tell you that the subcommittee actually held two hearings. The first hearing was entitled `Examining Scientific Discoveries In Cloning, Focusing On Challenges For Public Policy.' And that particular hearing was in March of last year. We had a number of people come forward. Again, this is for the benefit of my colleagues so they can go back and look at the testimony that was presented really aimed directly at the Wilmut experiment on Dolly, somatic cell nuclear transfer and its implications. 
That discussion was begun back in March. Harold Varmus, who is Director of the National Institutes of Health, Public Health Service, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, came and testified. His testimony is available, talking about this specific technique. Dr. Ian Wilmut talked before our committee in a public hearing. He is an embryologist at Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, Scotland. I had an opportunity to visit the institute there and view the type of research that is going on personally. 
Dr. Wilmut's testimony has been presented to this body. I would encourage my colleagues to go back and look at that public hearing. We looked principally, at that particular hearing, at the scientific discoveries. But we wanted to hear from members of the National Bioethics Advisory Committee, or NBAC. The NBAC committee was eventually charged, over a 90-day period, to look at this issue of human cloning and to make recommendations. And we had Dr. Alta Charo, professor of law, University of Wisconsin, on behalf of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission testifying. 
We also had John Wallwork, director of the transplant unit--transplantation, my field, has been mentioned on the floor today. And I hope to have a few comments on that shortly because I think we have to be very careful not to overstate what the bill, which has not yet even been discussed, does because it is easy to frighten people and say that this bill is going to shut down science in a field like transplantation. It does not do that. This bill is very, very narrowly defined and only in an arena which results in human cloning. 
We held another hearing. And that hearing was entitled, `Ethics And Theology: A Continuation Of The National Discussion On Human Cloning.' I mention this because, as a scientist, as a physician, as someone who has taken care of patients, and now as a U.S. Senator, I am going to come back to again and again that we do have the responsibility to look at the ethical implications of new innovations. That is what we are, trustees of the American people. 
This hearing on `Ethics And Theology: A Continuation Of The National Discussion On Human Cloning' had witnesses, such as James Childress, again a member of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, and also Edwin Kyle, professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia. We had Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a member of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission. We had a number of people testifying from the theological community as well. 
I mentioned both of these hearings and the testimony therein for two reasons: No. 1, to help my colleagues and the American people know where they can reference certain material, and, No. 2, to demonstrate that the dialogue has been ongoing both in Washington, DC, in the U.S. Senate, in Congress broadly, but also on the public square. 
We have heard some call for a private moratorium among the scientific communities. All of that seems pretty good until we recognize that it is not working. Just several weeks ago, we had a proposal by an individual, in essence, to set up an industry. The purpose of that industry is stated, not in these exact words, but that industry which is proposed is to clone human individuals. 
I'm of course, referring to Dr. Seed. Can it be done? We don't know. We know that there is a certain technology that worked in an animal that, if a lot of people focused on that and there were a lot of experiments, could result in a human being. But the pronouncement that in spite of the moratorium, in spite of the discussions today, that we have an individual proposing the creation of an industry that is going to go charging ahead when we don't know the implications to society, to this country, to the world, is something that we must react to. 
Tough issue. Ethics. We are talking about a procedure which has never been applied in the human arena. It has only been performed in animals. A lot of hypothetical examples will come to the floor. This bill addresses the problem that I just stated. We don't have a national forum now in which to intelligently, with broad input, discuss these ethical implications of new technology and new innovations and science. This bill, once it is allowed to be brought to the floor, very specifically sets up a mechanism outside of the U.S. Congress but broadly representative to be able to discuss these issues in a sophisticated, intelligent, ethical way. We need that mechanism. This bill creates that mechanism permanently. 
The second thing that this bill does, it attempts to--and it is tough; I can tell you it is tough in terms of doing it just right, but the bill does it just right--it narrowly focuses on a particular procedure in the big world of science and research. It takes a very specific procedure that has never been even used in human cells in terms of creating embryos and says let's ban that procedure. Let's allow that procedure, even in animals, in the research arena, in cells. Let's learn more about that procedure so we will know what those implications are. But let's ban that narrow procedure when it is used to create a human being, another person. 
Now, the advantage is by banning just that specific technique as it applies to human cloning, you can still continue experimenting with Dollys, bovine models, pigs, cows, baboons--animal research. There will be a lot of people who will say maybe we shouldn't use it there, but that is not what this bill does. It only bans the somatic cell nuclear transfer, so-called Dolly technique, as it applies to human cloning. In vitro research continues, other embryo research continues. This does not stop embryo research, or research on diabetes or sickle cell or cancer. It does not do that. It takes a very narrow procedure which is not commonly even applied to human cloning and says, stop, we will ban that. All other research continues. 
No. 1, we do not ban all somatic cell nuclear transfer, only somatic cell nuclear transfer which is a specific technique as it applies to human cloning. Somatic cell nuclear transfer technology can continue in other fields. It can continue in animals. It can continue in cells. It is important for people to understand that we only ban this very specific procedure when used to produce a cloned human embryo. 
Second, a little while ago a concern was expressed about the definition of `embryo'; the definitions are imprecise. We don't need to get into a debate about how to define an embryo this morning or today or on the floor of the U.S. Senate because we already know what an embryo is. I will just cite two references. The National Institutes of Health Embryo Panel, which had a formal report in 1994, basically said, `In humans, the developing organism from the time of fertilization.' That is their definition of embryo. 
If we look at the very good, although admittedly I will say incomplete, report by the NBAC, the National Bioethics Advisory 
Committee appointed by the President, which had a very short time line, their report I should say had recommendations based on the safety of the procedure. They admitted they did not have the time or the process to look at all the ethical and social and theological implications. They held hearings on it, but their conclusions were not based on those ethical considerations. In their report in 1997, several months ago, they said the embryo is `the developing organism from the time of fertilization.' 
The NIH Embryo Panel--I was not in this body at that point in time, but I have had the opportunity to go back and read their findings and their report--was very clear in their statement that the embryo does have some moral significance. The embryo as just defined by these two definitions does have moral significance today. 
There is a huge debate, a debate which I think we should avoid on this narrow, narrow bill, that can go into abortion, pro-choice and pro-life, when do you define a life. I don't think we need at this point in time to get into that discussion. We do need to recognize that people such as previous panels like the NIH Embryo Panel did give moral significance to that embryo. 
Now, third, in essence, the statement was made the application of nuclear transfer cloning to humans could provide a potential source of organs or tissues of a predetermined genetic background. That statement refers to my own field of transplantation where the concept is that rejection of a heart or of a lung or of a kidney is determined in large part by how different the recipient organism looks at that transplanted organ, genetically how different are they, which explains this whole process we called rejection. That is an inflammatory-like process which says the recipient body will reject that heart, either more often or totally. The genetically closer you get, the less that process of rejection occurs, free of other types of immunosuppression. This whole idea of having lots of copies of an organ, of a DNA, is one line of research in terms of eliminating rejection. 
References were made to spinal cord injuries, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cancer, with the whole premise being that research will be shut down in these fields. I want to assure my colleagues it will not. Again, it is a very specific, narrow procedure as it applies to human cloning. Animal research will continue, plant research will continue, other cellular research will continue. 
Now, NBAC also in their report in 1997 looked at this issue about transplantation, since that was brought up on the floor. Let me refer to their finding, and this is from their Chapter 2, Science and Applications of Cloning, in their report. `Because of ethical and moral concerns raised by the use of embryos for research purposes, it would be far more desirable to explore the direct use of human cells of adult origin to produce specialized cells or tissues for transplantation into patients.' 
I think it pretty much speaks for itself based on their ethical and moral concerns with this type of research that you don't necessarily have to rely on somatic cell nuclear transfer to produce an embryo as being the technique in order to create this likeness to prevent rejection. 
No. 2, they say it deals with transplantation and research. `Given current uncertainties about the feasibility of this, however, much research would be needed in animal systems before it would be scientifically sound and therefore potentially morally acceptable to go forward with this approach.' That is, the approach of somatic cell nuclear transfer. So what NBAC concluded, `Given these uncertainties. . .much research would be needed in animal systems. . ..' 
Our bill allows that research to continue and then make a decision, possibly 5 years from now, 10 years from now, 3 years from now, in terms of what we learn from those animal systems. Our bill says, `Don't use this technique to clone humans.' There are a lot of other strategies. I don't want my colleagues to think that somatic cell nuclear transfer technique is one of the more important techniques today. There are all sorts of strategies in 
terms of the transplantation arena. 
Again, looking at NBAC, they recognize that, `Another strategy for cell-based therapies would be to identify methods by which somatic cells could be de-differentiated and redifferentiated along a particular path. This would eliminate the need to use cells obtained from embryos.' 
Again, now is not the time to go into these details, but I do want to show in part the richness of science to demonstrate that this one particular technique as applied to a human, as applied to human cloning, is the only thing that is being banned, and all this other research continues right along. 
The issue has come up and will likely come up, should we create embryos purely for research purposes? Our bill does not. Let me say at the outset, our bill, as I said, allows embryo research to continue as it is today under the requirements and the regulations that are out there today. What our bill does, it looks at a particular technique with other research and embryos allowed to continue. You can step back and say, should someone be out creating all these mass-produced human embryos just to do research on them and then destroy those embryos? It is an issue which is very likely to come up before this body. 
Let me introduce it and just say that our bill does not allow creation of these embryos using somatic cell nuclear transfer--human embryos. Again, animal research can continue. The Washington Post really captured, I think, what this debate will evolve to as we look at ethics and theology and science, careful not to slow down the progress of science which we want to encourage in all the fields that have been mentioned this morning. The Washington Post editorial in 1994 basically says, `The creation of human embryos specifically for research that will destroy them is unconscionable. Viewed from one angle, this issue can be made to yield endless complexity. What about the suffering of individuals and infertile couples who might be helped by embryo research? What about the status of the brand new embryo? But before you get to these questions, there is a simpler one: Is there a line that should not be crossed even for scientific or other gain, and if so, where is it?" 
This is not a one-side-of-the-aisle issue. In fact, both sides of the aisle have put forth bans on human cloning. President Clinton doesn't believe the Federal Government should be funding embryo-type research. Basically he has said, `The subject raises profound ethical and moral questions as well as issues concerning the appropriate allocation of Federal funds. I appreciate the work of the committees that have considered this complex issue and I understand that advances in in vitro fertilization research and other areas could be derived from sufficient work. However, I do not believe that Federal funds should be used to support the creation of human embryos for research purposes.' 
Well, let me step back and then I will close. The bill, which we had hoped would come to the floor today does two things. No. 1, it creates a bioethics commission, permanent, 24 members, broadly representative of society today, with the disciplines of ethics, bioethics, theology, the social sciences, all well represented, a forum that I think is most appropriate to discuss these very difficult issues of technology that will be coming through even more rapidly in the future. The answer to the question is, why don't we just appoint this commission and pass that part of your bill and not worry? Well, that is what we have sort of been doing for the last several months--sitting back as the national dialog continues. Yet, we have a proposal coming from the private sector at this juncture and that proposal is to go out with the single objective of cloning human beings. If we as trustees of the American people want to step back and say, no, that is too hot an issue for us, that is one approach. My approach is that we go in, we address that specific problem, that cloning of the human individual with the very best legislation that we can do, set up a commission so that in the future both that issue and other issues can be discussed, look at the science, look at the ethics, look at the philosophical and social implications of this research. So that is No. 1, a bioethics commission. 
No. 2 is to target the Dr. Seeds of the world--people who don't have the problem, who don't fully see the ethical potential for harm to society and to the world and, therefore, have basically publicly stated what their objective is--to create human beings, and be appealing for resources to do just that. That is why the American people expect us to come forward and debate and talk about the implications, make sure that we do exactly what I have said, which there will be debate on and that is in a very focused way, target a particular technique which has never been used to clone a human individual. We just want to prevent that and allow that science to continue. 
The editor of the New England Journal of Medicine basically has said in the past: `Knowledge, although important, may be less important to a decent society than the way it is obtained.' 
I hope as we go forward and look at the final disposition of this bill that we come back to that statement. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to speak to the bioethics commission which will be proposed. It is part of a bill which I am not sure is going to make it to the floor today. I would like to comment on that commission. 
Mr. President, I want to comment briefly on this concept which is in the bill that will be considered sometime in the future. I am not sure it will be this afternoon, or next week, or sometime in the future. And the aspect that I want to comment on is this bioethics commission. I think it is critical that at the end of this century and on into the next century we have somewhere in the United States a forum where we can carry on intelligent discussions on the ethical, the theological, the scientific, and the medical issues that are inevitable as science progresses with breakthrough discoveries that have the potential both for very good--very good--but also evil. Where do we digest those in the society when they are coming through not every week nor every month but even more frequently? In response to that, I proposed the national bioethics commission. 
We have the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, so-called NBAC. And I think over the next few days the country will become familiar with that NBAC designation. The NBAC, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission was appointed entirely by the President of the United States. They did a very good job this past year in assimilating data, information, reports, and testimony from experts and the lay public broadly over a 90-day period addressing human cloning. That was a good start. But they very openly said that they were unable to substantively address the ethical issues surrounding human cloning. 
As I have said earlier today, as a scientist, and a public servant now, I want to make the case that we can no longer separate science from the ethical consideration in that we as a body must address how to establish a forum in which such discussions can be carried out. 
The Commission cited inadequate time to tackle the ethical issues in the context of our pluralistic, complex, intricate society in that they chose primarily to focus on scientific concerns as well as the less abstract concept of safety. What is safe or not safe? Is this procedure safe, or is it not safe? They then appealed to each American citizen to step up to the plate and exercise their leadership and their moral leadership in formulating a national policy on human cloning. We need that forum. 
Time has shown that neither the Presidential Commission nor the United States Congress is probably the forum, or at least is an inadequate forum, for addressing these bioethical issues which are of tremendous intricacy and important to society. 
I, therefore, proposed this national bioethics commission in our legislation. It is representative of the public at large. It has the combined participation of experts in law, experts in science, experts in theology, experts in medicine, experts in social science, experts in philosophy, and the interest of members of the public. It is my hope that this commission will forge a new path for our country in the field of bioethics that will enable us to have an informed, a thoughtful, a sophisticated, and scientific debate in the public square without fear on behalf of the public, or politicians, or politics driving our decisions. 
In this proposal, the majority and minority leaders of Congress would appoint the members of the panel. No current Member of Congress or the administration would serve on this panel. We simply must depoliticize these discussions which will simultaneously broaden input from the general public. Each and every citizen of this country should have the opportunity to contribute to these debates. 
This commission would be established within the Institute of Medicine, and would be known as a commission to promote a national dialogue on bioethics. 
Very briefly, it would have 25 members, 6 appointed by the majority leader of the Senate, 6 by the minority leader of the Senate, 6 appointed by the Speaker of the House, and 6 appointed by the minority leader of the House of Representatives. There would be a chairman. In addition, representatives stated in the legislation would be from the fields of law, theology, philosophy, ethics, medicine, science, and social science. The commission 
would be appointed no later than December 1st of this year. We have to move ahead quickly. They would serve for a length of 3 years. And the duties of the commission, as spelled out in the legislation, would be to provide an independent forum for broad public participation and discourse concerning important bioethical issues, including cloning, and provide for a report to Congress concerning the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the commission concerning Federal policy and possible congressional action. 
Subcommittees are established on that commission for legal issues, for theological issues, for philosophical and ethical issues, medical issues, and scientific issues, and for social issues. 
I will not belabor the commission, but want to come back to the concept and the concept is to have an appropriate forum to discuss the types of issues we are discussing today, which I have made the case that we have to act on today in response to proposals that have been made from the private sector and to have a better, a more appropriate, a more responsive, and a more representative forum to address such issues in the future. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am delighted to rise because I think we have before us a very important issue and one that we have not dealt very well with, at least since I have been in the Senate. There will be a lot of debate as we just heard on a number of issues and I am happy to debate those issues. I think they are important to the American people. If the allegations that have been sent to me by fax machine, some of which we have heard just expressed in the Chamber, are true, I would agree that America does deserve better. What I hope that I can do is offer a reasoned voice, a voice based on some experience but more importantly one that is close to science, one that has been involved in placebo controlled trials, one who participates in ethical decisionmaking in medicine, in health care, one who knows Dr. Satcher, whom I hope we hear something about. In fact, I will take a few minutes and talk about Dr. Satcher, the man, the man who came before our committee, the man who has contributed so much throughout his life for the betterment of public health, his fellow man and, more importantly, for that next generation. 
I do think we need a Surgeon General. I was in Africa last week and asked a lot about these AZT trials, and I hope to have a chance to comment on those a little bit later. About a month ago, there was what we thought was a new disease, what the world thought was a new disease called Rift Valley Fever, which killed about 400 people in Kenya over a period of 3 weeks. It came quickly. It came because of the flooding. There was an awakening of a mosquito larvae that carried a deadly virus which could not be identified. There was mass confusion in the scientific community, really all around the world, about, is this a new virus? It causes a huge hemorrhagic bleeding and terrible death. Is it going to extend beyond the borders of Kenya to Africa and to the United States? 
Amidst all that confusion there was not a single voice either in the United States or anywhere in the world to step forward and take that available information to reassure the public, to point out what is known by science. 
Luckily, a few weeks later, the virus itself was described, the floods actually got much better and hopefully we have seen the end of that particular virus for hopefully the next decade. It is a virus that does stay around for decades and decades. But it made me think how important it is to have a reasoned, educated, articulate, concise voice--we do not have it--in the United States right now to interpret the innovation and changes in how health care is delivered today to the American people. 
Just yesterday on this floor we introduced a bill on cloning. It is a difficult bill, a bill I have had to go back and spend a lot of time on, putting on my hat as a scientist to understand, and it made me think once again, wouldn't it be nice to have somebody whose sole job is to be the Nation's doctor and to help interpret science, help interpret what we know, to talk directly to the American people. I am talking really generically about the Surgeon 
General now, because many of my colleagues have come forward in the past and said, do we really need a Surgeon General? Wouldn't it be easier to escape all the politics? 
Let me say I think much of the discussion we are going to hear about is straight politics, nothing beyond that, and I hope we show over the next few hours and the next few days the lack of substance that has been demonstrated by a number of groups today in terms of getting down to reality, the truth, and that is what I want us to demonstrate in this body not just to each other but the American people. Let's rise above politics. 
Now, unfortunately, some people point back to several years ago when the position of Surgeon General appeared to be used for political agendas and social agendas which were outside of the mainstream and America did at that time deserve better. The case I wish to make is that Dr. David Satcher does better. He is the most appropriate person for this position today and will carry it out with the integrity, with the dignity, with the moral values and the forethought, the background and the training that we as Americans expect. 
Now, what is this position of the Surgeon General? A lot of people say, `What does he do?' I already told you my impression of what we need in terms of that articulate, concise, straightforward voice that can listen and talk to the American people. 
In addition, the Assistant Secretary of Health oversees administration of eight agencies of the Public Health Service, which include the office of Surgeon General. In these dual roles, Dr. Satcher would serve as the public doctor, but in interpretation of what is going on, the direction we should go, looking into the health and the future welfare of our children, but also in advising the Secretary of Health and Human Services. That is a void which we have today. The Secretary of Health and Human Services does not have a person to come in and advise on the sorts of policy that will affect everybody in this Chamber today and their children and that next generation. 
I sat through a lot of meetings today with talk about how much money the President can spend, and the President has proposals, the private sector has proposals, how many hundreds of millions of dollars can we spend on television to educate people so that their children won't start smoking or how we can set up a new bureaucracy with new employees out of Washington, DC, or take an old bureaucracy and have them come in and educate our young people today. 
I just want to throw up my hands and say, listen, let's go back to those basic principles. You do not have to spend more money. You do not have to set up big bureaucracies. Let's get that one vocal, intelligent, trained, articulate, eloquent spokesman who can speak for mainstream values, and that one position can be the Surgeon General, without spending all this money on this extra bureaucracy that we do not know whether it will work or not. 
We know the role of Surgeon General works. On this same issue, in 1964, if you asked the world who is the one voice who has had the most impact today on this issue of smoking and teenagers, it has to go back to the Surgeon General's report of 1964. Yes, way ahead of its time. But who better than to have the Surgeon General? Is it better to have the heads of the tobacco companies or the manufacturers or politicians or somebody who can intelligently go in and digest the available scientific data, who can reach out to the American people and interpret what is right and what is wrong for the public health? 
I contend it is the Surgeon General, and if you look back over that longer record, not just the last 6 years but back to 1964 and before, you will see that the Surgeon General's voice has been effective. 
Dr. C. Everett Koop in the 1980s, all of us remember, woke America up to an emerging public health threat. Some people wanted to hide in the sand and say it is not a problem; it is not affecting my family, my community. Therefore, let's not make any 
progress. Dr. C. Everett Koop, as Surgeon General, stepped forward and he said we have an emerging crisis. He said it is HIV positive. It is called AIDS. In candor, in realism, let's help the public. 
I needed help as a health professional at the time to help separate out the facts from the fiction, what you read in the press, what you receive over your fax from some special interest group that wants to take a tiny little topic and blow it out of proportion. Who sets that perspective? I would argue that if it is in the field of public health, the Surgeon General sets that perspective for an audience of health practitioners as well as the public. 
Although we have not been very effective in looking to this office. Yet there the Surgeon General's reports have been very effective and informative regarding public health. About a year and a half ago, the Surgeon General's office issued a report demonstrating that moderate physical activity can reduce the risk of heart disease and some cancers. These very effective reports produced over time have helped to interpret for the public the direction of living a healthier lifestyle. 
Now, if you look back historically at these reports--and I went back and did it because I haven't been around that long, in terms of looking at what has been generated from the office of the Surgeon General--my conclusion is that there has been no political agenda in mind in these reports--I don't want to say without exception because I haven't read every report, but the well being of the Nation, of the public health was at the heart of each of these reports. And I guess as I was in Africa 2 weeks ago as a scientist who looks at new viruses, who looks at the public health challenges, I thought we have public health threats in this country, such as smoking and drug abuse. Just last year we talked in this body about foodborne illnesses, alcoholism, emerging infectious diseases, resistance to antibiotics which we feel so comfortable with. I can tell you the resistance to antibiotics is one of the greatest challenges we have in this Nation but also the world that stands before us. Who is going to help us interpret what that means? Is it going to be a Senator? I don't think so. Is it going to be the Secretary of HHS? I don't think so. Is it going to be the President? No. It is going to be the Surgeon General. 
Dr. Koop called this position of Surgeon General a `high calling with an obligation to interpret health and medical facts for the public.' A high calling. I will tell you, it is a high calling because you put yourself through the sort of accusations which I will contend and hopefully show that many are false. They are totally untrue. They are accusations, totally unproven, and that is going to be the subject I think of much of our discussion today. I hope the American public keeps faith in this institution and in the sort of debate we will engage in and at every case come back and ask those fundamental questions about integrity, about looking at one's past record as we look to the future. 
I haven't said very much yet about Dr. David Satcher. Let me say at the outset that I know Dr. David Satcher. I have known him for a long time. I knew him as a physician, a fellow physician in Nashville, TN. I have known him as an educator, as somebody who has run a medical school. And as we look to the sorts of challenges we have in the future, medical education is one of those challenges--how we maintain the excellent physicians that we have today in a world of managed care, reduced funding by the Federal Government. 
Dr. Satcher is an administrator. I guess a lot of the focus is going to be on the large public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Over the next several days, I have a feeling what is going to happen is that you have the head of a large organization and you have thousands of programs under that organization, and we are going to have people find in some program down at the community level where there is some tracing through the large organization to the fellow at the top who is held 
responsible, and he should be responsible for it as long as the American people look at all of the other positive things that he--in this case, Dr. Satcher--has done in leadership of that organization, which is the largest public health organization, not just in the United States but in the world. 
So I ask my colleagues to paint the larger perspective as we go through, as these examples of local programs are brought forward that have something that I don't agree with personally. We will come back to that. So I hope we can get above the politics and look at the qualifications of this family physician. 
As we move into this next millennium, we need to be thinking about family practice. He is a family practitioner. He has the endorsement of the society that represents family practitioners. Dr. Satcher has taught family practice and chaired a department of family practice. 
Science. Again, I mentioned that yesterday I spent most of the day interpreting what somatic cell nuclear transfer is to my colleagues, to the media, and to the American people and that's good, but I am not sure a United States Senator needs to be spending so much time talking about a specific scientific technique year after year after year. And here we have somebody who is nominated to be the next Surgeon General who has not only a medical degree but a Ph.D., another advanced degree in an advanced science, the science of cytogenetics, somebody who has written research papers, been in the laboratory, applied for grants and received those grants, somebody who understands what a clinical trial is, what peer review is, what a placebo control trial is, somebody who has been in the room as we talk about medical ethics. And medical ethics is tough. You can always find people within the field who disagree. 
But I will contend that as we look at these ethical issues, such as the clinical trials in Africa and other parts of the world, we will come to the conclusion that the appropriate ethical process was undertaken under the leadership of Dr. David Satcher. 
Another hat. Dr. Satcher has a distinguished record of promoting the public health, improving health based upon science, not one's feelings or one's politics, but on science. 
I don't agree with everything that Dr. Satcher says or does, nor do I expect to, but I do want to go back to what he has told me, what he presented to our committee, because it is important for the American people and for my colleagues to fully understand what his vision is, as well as his background, because there is going to be an attempt to insert another agenda on Dr. Satcher which is not his agenda. 
I think in the confirmation process, we have to ask a couple of questions. 
No. 1, does this man, Dr. David Satcher, have the commitment, the intelligence, the training, the experience, the honesty, and the integrity to be the chief spokesperson for Americans on matters concerning health? 
I contend that he does. 
And can he articulate those views? 
He is a good spokesperson. For my colleagues who have had the opportunity to talk to him, he can articulate his views with dignity and with clarity as an eloquent spokesperson. 
He has a demonstrated public service record, which has been reviewed by the chairman in part. He is a good manager. Scientific integrity I have mentioned. 
President of Meharry Medical School in Nashville, TN, how important is that? I contend it is important to have had that past experience. If you had to go out and choose a physician to participate in understanding public health, I think that being the head of a medical school is a wonderful credential to bring to the table. He has an understanding of population-based medicine, a broad understanding of the health care delivery system and--I can tell you and I am sure over the course of the day, a number of people will put in letters of endorsement by the medical societies and by his peers--he is a widely respected physician by the medical community. 
He is a scientist, I mentioned. I should also mention, because we are going to be talking about ethics so much, that he is a wonderful family man with a wonderful wife, wonderful children, teaches Sunday school, understands medical ethics. From everything that I know about Dr. Satcher, he is a reasoned, scientific voice, and he will represent us well as the next Surgeon General. 
Let me look a little bit more at his experience. I mentioned he received his medical degree and his Ph.D. The Ph.D. was in cytogenetics. It was at Case Western Reserve. 
I think it important to have both, that understanding of individual patients--and he has practiced medicine--as well as an understanding of the science and having that advanced degree, a Ph.D. in cytogenetics. 
His experience is broad. We know about the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We know about Meharry Medical College. What you may not know, is that for 3 years, he was professor and chairman of the Department of Community Medicine and Family Practice--that was back in 1979 to 1982--thus, demonstrating his concern for his local communities. 
In a theme which he gave again and again, both in our committee and with me directly, was his commitment to allowing decisions to be made by local communities instead of decisions dictated by the federal government out of Washington, DC. I think that is important, because as we look at a number of these programs and information we are reaching out for, I hope my colleagues will ask the question, did Dr. Satcher, through the CDC, make the decision on that program or did he allow a local community to make a decision using the resources that are available? 
I think his commitment, which has been made very clear to me, 
to have both resources and decisions about public health made by local communities comes from his experience having been a chairman of the Department of Community Medicine and Family Practice at the School of Medicine in Morehouse College down in Atlanta. 
Before that time, Dr. Satcher was a dean, an interim dean, at the Charles R. Drew Postgraduate Medical School. He was also a professor and chairman of the Department of Family Medicine at the Charles R. Drew Postgraduate Medical School in Los Angeles. And, he was medical director of the Second Baptist Free Clinic. 
His professional experience is interesting, because we talk about populations, and I don't want to get too far into the science, but I think it is important that whoever is the Surgeon General does understand what happens with large populations. The Surgeon General becomes the Nation's doctor. And just like when I, as a physician before coming to this body, would see a patient who came in the door, it was my job to interpret, to educate, to listen to and to diagnose. The Nation's doctor does the same for over 250 million people. Therefore, it is important he understands populations and disease in populations. 
It is interesting that Dr. Satcher also was an assistant professor of epidemiology, and that is the statistical study of population-based diseases. Once again, a wonderful credential for the position of Surgeon General. That was at the School of Public Health at the UCLA School of Medicine in Los Angeles. 
Does he understand medical problems? Yes. 
Remember his many published articles--I don't need to go through the articles, but let me relate to you that he has written extensively about hypertension, high blood pressure. Cardiovascular disease is the No. 1 killer in the United States of America today. In the early 1970s, he was director of the hypertension outreach program. He has done research. He understands the importance of preventive as well as therapeutic medicine. 
Board certification. His qualifications: 1994, fellow, American College of Preventive Medicine. Yes, this man understands what we need to do now to prevent, not just treat, the problems that we inevitably will face and probably will face with increasing frequency in the future. 
In 1980, fellowship, American Academy of Family Physicians. I have already mentioned their broad support for their medical colleague in this position. 
1976, board certification, American Board of Family Practice. 
Active in communities. I mentioned that he spent a large period of his life in Nashville, TN, which is my home. These are the sort of things we don't look at a lot here because we get lost in rhetoric. I think a lot is how involved one is as a role model in their own communities. Dr. David Satcher was involved in his own community. I mentioned he taught Sunday school. He is active with the United Way and has been on the board of United Way in middle Tennessee. He was chair of the Minority Health Professions Foundation. He was a board member of the Boy Scouts of America for 10 years. Board member, Easter Seals Society. This man understands his commitment to large populations. He understands public health. What is wonderful to me is it starts with him as a role model, as a father, as an active participant in his own community. 
We are going to come back to a lot of the issues, issues which mostly arose after the committee hearing on Dr. Satcher's nomination. At the hearing, Dr. Satcher had the opportunity to articulate his vision of what this Office of Surgeon General is. And, therefore, I would like to refer back just very briefly to what he has said, to use it as the foundation upon which the discussions about looking to the future will rest. 
This is from the testimony before the Labor Committee. He basically said:  
As Assistant Secretary for Health and the Surgeon General, I would take the best science in the world and place it firmly within the grasp of all Americans. I would not just speak to Americans but would also listen to them, really listen to them. I would want to hear about their expectations and their experiences, their questions and their concerns and engage them in an ongoing conversation about physical activity, about good nutrition. 
We haven't heard much about that thus far in this body, about Dr. Satcher's agenda. 
I hope we talk about Dr. Satcher's plans for good nutrition. 
For responsible behavior and passports to good health and long life. 
He says: 
As Surgeon General, I would strive to provide our citizens with cutting-edge technology in plain old-fashioned straight talk. Whether we are talking about smoking or poor diets, I want to send the message of good health to the American people. 
He continued: 
My goals as Assistant Secretary for Health and Surgeon General are to be an effective advisor to the Secretary by providing sound medical public health and scientific advice as appropriate. I want to bring more attention, awareness and clarity to the opportunities for disease prevention and health promotion that are available to individuals, families and communities in this country. I want to help make the health of children and youth a greater priority for the Nation and serve as a positive and inspirational role model to them. 
That is his vision. 
One last quotation from that testimony, again more to get it in the Record and have my colleagues understand where Dr. Satcher wants to go. He said in closing: 
I will challenge the American people to be the best they can be and to respect the roles of parent, families and communities. I will try to bring people together. That is who I am. 
Let's keep that in mind, that fundamental kernel in mind as we go through and listen to the various arguments made why he should not be Surgeon General. 
As a way of introduction, because that is what we are doing in terms of setting the parameters, instead of going into each of the issues that have been mentioned earlier, let me cite several of the allegations and start that debate as we go back and forth. 
As I have said, a number of allegations have come forward, and I am sorely disappointed in the substance behind those allegations as they come across the fax machine and are presented to me by well-meaning constituents who came forward and said, `What is it? Did Dr. Satcher really do that?' I hope to point out over the next day or so that, no, he did not, and that our responsibility is to come to the truth behind Dr. Satcher. 
Position No. 1 is partial-birth abortions and the proposed ban, and this is one I dealt with very early on, because I feel strongly that this body has a responsibility as trustees to the American people to ban this procedure which offends the sensibilities of everyone. 
The issue of partial-birth abortion also deeply troubles Dr. Satcher, and I hope that everybody who is concerned about this issue has sat down and talked with him and listened to his statements. 
In a letter dated October 28 to me, Dr. Satcher wrote the following:  
Let me state unequivocally that I have no intention of using the positions of Assistant Secretary for Health and Surgeon General to promote issues related to abortion. I share no one's political agenda-- 
Let me read that one more time-- 
I share no one's political agenda, and I want to use the power of these positions to focus on issues that unite Americans, not divide them. If confirmed by the Senate, I will strongly promote a message of abstinence and responsibility to our youth, which I believe can help to reduce the number of abortions in our country. 
In the written responses to the Labor Committee--also it is important to refer at least to that in passing; we will probably come back to it--Dr. Satcher says he supports in concept the ban of this partial birth abortion procedure, and then explains what his position is. But I think what is important, if you look over his past, his 25 years as a professional, abortion has not been on his agenda in terms of promoting the public health, and as you look forward, based on the statements he has made to us directly to the committee and in our own conversations, abortion is not going to be on his agenda. 
I think the people who feel so strongly about the litmus test on the statement by Dr. Satcher that he thinks those sorts of decisions should be made locally--if the litmus test is so strong, I can understand my colleagues voting against Dr. Satcher. But I hope they look more broadly since it is not going to be on his agenda for the future and has not been over the last 25 years. 
Number 2. Dr. Satcher's position regarding AZT, which is a drug that is used successfully, if it is given in a certain high-tech way, to prevent the transmission of the HIV virus from a mother to a child. We are going to come back to this a lot. It is a good issue. It is a good issue because there has been years of extensive debate on this very issue by the countries that are involved, by the United States, by scientists, by theologians, by trained ethicists. We can relive those debates, if you would like. 
But let me try to boil it down to several issues. I was in Africa last week, in countries including Kenya. The per capita spending on health care for an individual in Kenya is about $5 annually. 
Should we take a therapy, ethically, that in this country we know works--the cost down there, if we adopted it, is about $1,000. This therapy works in the United States. But in truth, from a practical standpoint, logistically, because it is intravenous therapy, it requires a series of doses with followup that extends over a long period of time. Practically, economically, logistically, that therapy has zero chance--and nobody says otherwise--to become the standard therapy in a country like Kenya today, zero chance. 
Is it ethical, I ask, for us in the United States to take that arm, that therapy to Kenya and experiment there when there is absolutely no chance that that therapy can ever be used to benefit that population? The answer is, no. By international standards, the answer is, no. 
That is the standard basically. If you are going to be using clinical trials which are dealing with people directly, the therapy has to be in some shape or form potentially beneficial to that population. And $5 per person is what is spent on health care totally--child care, prenatal care, treatment in the hospitals, clinics, medicines. And to thrust a therapy which cost $1,000 into a health care system that cannot support it is, to my mind, unethical. That is No. 1. 
No. 2, placebo control trials. What does that mean? It means basically that someone comes in, you are looking to see whether an intervention works or not, the HIV virus is transmitted from mother to daughter. What can you do to intervene to stop transmission of that virus that is practicable, that is reasonable, that has some chance of being applied there broadly? 
Well, the question is, can you take that very complicated, Western-style, intravenous $1,000 AZT therapy, which is the standard in America now, can you in some way modify that so there is some chance that a shorter course, hopefully given orally, or maybe a shorter course with one intravenous dose, but a shorter, less expensive course, works? Because if it works, you can go out and prevent the transmission of HIV to the millions of babies who are born to mothers who are HIV positive. 
How do you know if it works or not? You have to compare it to 
something. From an ethical standpoint, nobody has been in any one of these AZT trials under discussion that informed consent has not been obtained. So when you go out and say this is like Tuskegee--we can go into that--it is nothing like it. And I look forward to that, coming to the floor in relation to that, because I received these faxes comparing it to a terrible, terrible experiment in this country. It is not like that. We will come back to that. But every person had informed consent in these trials. That is very important because that is one of the national, international norms. 
AZT. Does it work or not? What do you compare it to? Well, the standard today in clinical trials all over the world is that you have a control population and a population that you intervene with. How else are you going to know what the difference is, whether this AZT therapy works? 
Yes, this was a placebo controlled trial. It is the standard of therapy today. People do not get treatment right now for the transmission of HIV. When I was down there as a physician asking, `What do you do?'--one out of four people in this community are HIV positive--`What do you do?' they laughed. `We can't do anything. Why don't you help us devise a protocol?' That is what happened. 
These countries came to the United States of America, through the World Health Organization, and said, `We have to design an intervention that will work, that is practical, that is consistent with it being applied in these countries.' And the response, going through the appropriate ethical channels, were these trials that we are talking about. 
Why placebo control? Why can't we use placebo controls, since we had this control population, in the United States? Well, we do not know today whether AZT, this drug, interacts in some way with a background of malaria. And you have to have a placebo control trial because the population there is not the population in the United States of America or in France or in England or wherever these past trials have been conducted. The only way you can get the answer is through carefully designed placebo control prospective trials to be able to answer that question--does AZT work or not? 
The third issue that has come forward is this needle exchange program. And I think we will get back to that. Let me just make the following statement because it boils it down to everything. 
Dr. Satcher has never advocated taxpayer-funded needle exchange programs for drug abusers. Dr. Satcher has recommended to Congress that we allow scientific studies to answer the key questions involved with this particular issue. Dr. Satcher believes strongly that we should never do anything to advocate the use of illegal drugs. The intravenous use of illegal drugs is wrong. He has said that. He opposes the use of any illegal drugs. 
Secretary Shalala, in a February 1997, report to Congress, concluded the following in regard to this needle exchange program, because it can be pulled out and draw up these images in people's minds of needles going into the arms of drug addicts, especially free needles. We have to step back and look at what the scientific studies show. 
In the letter that she sent to Congress, the following conclusions could be made. Needle exchange programs--and I quote--`can be an effective component of a comprehensive strategy to prevent HIV and other bloodborne infectious diseases in communities that choose to include them.' That is what the science said. We can argue that and we can talk about the social policy. That is what the science says today. But most importantly, the department itself has not yet concluded that the conditions set forth by Congress on Federal funding of needle exchange programs have yet been met. We in Congress have crafted a protection to disallow federal funding of needle exchange programs unless the science shows that such programs will not only reduce HIV infection, but also not increase drug use. 
Fourth, is Dr. Satcher's position on the survey of childbearing women, the blinded surveys. We have heard already 
this morning, and we will continue to hear, that opponents of Dr. Satcher have erroneously claimed--and I use the word `erroneously;' and I underline it--that the infants known to be HIV positive were sent home without parental notification after being tested specifically for HIV. And this is simply untrue. It is not true. 
Again, it takes some understanding of how science today, and the medical community and the public health, obtains baseline data from a population so you will know where you are starting, whether or not interventions work or not, how much of a public health issue it should be. 
In this particular case, samples were gathered from left over blood specimens that were taken for standard tests. The rest of the blood is discarded and put over in a cabinet, typically thrown away. 
Under this study, all personal identifying information is taken off. But that blood has some useful purpose from an epidemiologic standpoint, from a public health standpoint because we can see what the baseline of something like HIV positivity actually is. The information that was gathered from these surveys of this discarded blood is not labeled, is not attached to an individual--Why not? For reasons of privacy, something that we all respect. We do not want people taking blood from us, having our name attached to it, testing it, and then releasing it to the world. However, those same women were counseled about the benefits of being tested and offered an HIV test that would allow them to know their and their baby's HIV status. The allegation is that this was a secret test. Yet, women were offered and encouraged to be tested and to be aware of their HIV status. 
This blind survey was critical. We can look how far we have come and the progress that has been made, in terms of treating HIV infection, with our public health officials, because it was the only totally unbiased way to provide a valid estimate of the number of women infected with HIV as well as their demographic distributions. 
Thank goodness we have access to such information. But again, this whole accusation that infants known to be HIV positive were sent home without telling their parents they were being diagnosed with HIV is simply untrue. This survey yielded population-based numbers of the incidence of HIV, not linked to individuals unless they gave their informed consent. 
Well, as you can tell, I feel strongly about this position of Surgeon General. I will bring my remarks to a close for this time around. I feel strongly that we need a Surgeon General who can articulate the needs, the challenges of public health, which are inevitably there. We need a Surgeon General who can advise the administration because the administration is making decisions every day that affect the public health whether it be in the area of disease or prevention or managed care, organization and delivery of our health care system. 
Secondly, I feel very strongly that Dr. David Satcher is the man for this position. He is a scientist. He is a family man. He is committed to local decisionmaking. He is an educator. He is a spokesperson. He is an eloquent spokesperson. But most importantly, he is committed to his fellow man, to improving the public health. 
I look forward to the debate. I hope our colleagues do participate in the debate. And I think that at the end of the day, hopefully, we will get to the truth and the kernels of truth that lie behind all the accusations and ultimately confirm Dr. David Satcher.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, advances in computer networking have led to some of the most significant developments of the last decade. We have all been touched one way or another by the Internet and the networking protocols that form the World Wide Web. Its presence is being felt in schools, businesses and homes across the country. Many people already come to rely on the Internet as their source for news and information. Now, electronic commerce is beginning to emerge as a significant source of network traffic, so it appears that more individuals are relying on the Internet for purchases as well. 
By any measure, the Internet is a success. It is a fast-paced living laboratory where every day brings new innovation and applications. The Internet's culture of rapid innovation stems from its days as a research vehicle sponsored by the Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency (DARPA). This original federal investment in university based research and development has grown to pay dividends to our country in the form of new technology, new jobs and economic growth. The Internet has also served as a case study in the proper role of the federal government in science and technology. Although the research was first sponsored by the Department of Defense, multiple agencies have come to play a significant role in the development and commercialization of the Internet. In particular, the National Science Foundation demonstrated how to successfully transition the management of an operational system, the Internet, from the public to the private sector. 
Today's Internet is a flexible, robust network, but already some of its limits have been reached. There are fascinating applications running in the laboratory that simply cannot be run on the Internet as it is today. Recently, I had a first hand look at a prime example: the virtual reality `Immersion Desk' collaboration. As a physician, I found it fascinating to take a guided tour of a human ear, seeing its structure in three dimensions, and able to interact with the guide and the structure in real time. It was immediately obvious to me the educational benefits that will come from putting similar devices in the hands of our nation's teachers and students. However, until the Internet's infrastructure limitations have been overcome, these applications will remain outside the reach of those who can benefit the most. 
Some of the limits that now impede advanced applications can be overcome through a straightforward application of existing technology, but there is an entire class of problems that requires new approaches. I believe that our nation's research and development enterprise holds the key. That is why I rise today to offer the `Next Generation Internet Research Act of 1998.' This legislation funds the agencies that are 
involved in creating advanced computer networking technology that will make tomorrow's Internet faster, more versatile, more affordable, and more accessible than today. The agencies funded by this legislation: The Department of Defense (DOD), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of Energy (DoE), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), each have a role to play in moving forward the state of the art in computer networking and network applications. The NGI program will provide grants to our universities and national laboratories to perform the research that will surmount these technical challenges and create a network that is 100 to 1000 times faster than the current Internet. 
Today, many that are located in rural areas of the country such as portions of eastern Tennessee, find that high speed access to the Internet is too expensive and difficult to obtain. Researchers from select states enjoy access to high bandwidth Internet connections at costs that are sometimes one-eighth the rate of their rural colleagues. This legislation acknowledges this geographical penalty and encourages networking researchers to look at this problem as a research challenge. Emphasis must be placed on finding new technology that permits high speed information access without leaving large sections of the country behind. 
Mr. President, I believe that the passage of this legislation will continue the tradition of prudent and successful federal investment in science and technology. The Internet truly is a success story. One that could not have been written without federal support. One that has already paid for itself through the creation of jobs and technology for Americans. The last chapter of the Internet success story is far from being written, and with this legislation, we are helping to ensure that the Internet will reach its potential to provide greater educational and economic benefits to the country. I ask for support in passing this key legislative initiative.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to support both the intent and to underscore the importance of this bill, the Bond-Frist-Gregg bill, which does address the issue of human cloning. The purpose of this bill is very straightforward, and that is to prohibit human cloning while at the same time protecting very important scientific research. 
This bill does prohibit human cloning, a topic which has captured the imagination of not only the American people but really the world over the past year after the successful experiment by Ian Wilmut, the Scottish scientist who successfully cloned `Dolly,' an adult sheep, using a new technique, a technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer. Public sentiment in response immediately registered, and I think appropriately so, opposition to the application of this specific technique to human beings. Fears that the `Dolly' experiment might lead to asexual human reproduction nearly drowned out pleas from the scientific community to protect legitimate cloning research at the cellular and animal level. 
Congress responded to the public fear by enacting a ban on the Federal funding for any human cloning research at the embryo level, and the President soon after issued an Executive order forbidding implantation of a cloned human embryo with the use of Federal funds. 
Scientists in the private sector have been left unregulated, but most research societies, appropriately I believe, adopted a voluntary moratorium on the use of somatic cell technology for the purpose of human cloning. 
Since no imminent threat of human clones at the time was perceived, the issue took a back seat to the more visible items before the Congress and the country, such as balancing the Federal budget. With the exception of an occasional television show, movie or news report, cloning pretty much faded from the mental radar screen of most Americans. But then not too long ago Dr. Seed gave new life to the whole human cloning debate when he announced in a public way his intention to use the Wilmut technique to create a cloned human individual. 
At that time it very quickly became apparent to virtually everyone that without Federal legislation human cloning could, and many feel would, occur in the private sector without due consideration to the ethical, social, theological and medical implications of this new and unproved technique. 
Our collective instinct that human individuals should not now be cloned has its roots in the most basic feelings we have about human nature. We know that an individual is more than the sum of individual body parts, more than the sum of the various organs, and we know instinctively that the human spirit, no matter how hard we try or how good the science is, cannot be replicated. The science of somatic cell nuclear transfer is still today imperfect. Wilmut's technique can be dangerous, we know, to the cloned child. In addition, we have no idea about the long-term effects of asexual reproduction on the human gene pool or on the psychosocial structures of our world. 
Quite simply, we are not prepared for a human `Dolly' experiment. And our inability to respond adequately to the moral, the ethical and the theological implications of this technology has highlighted a serious weakness in the fabric of our social structure. In too many instances we have allowed ourselves to separate scientific progress from those ethical conversations. We no longer can divorce the two. Dr. Seed and others have forced us to confront our deficits and to fashion timely answers to the timeless question: `Is there a line that should not be crossed even for scientific or other gain, and if so, where is it?' I have used that line in this Chamber before. It is from a Washington Post editorial in October of 1994: `Is there a line that should not be crossed even for scientific or other gain, and if so, where is it?' 
The debate on this particular bill, and others that address the issue of cloning, will have to center around that question, where is that line? 
I have a research background. I am a research scientist. I am a transplant physician. I am committed to the public welfare through that public service of medicine and science. From that background, I personally would use four principles that I think must, in my view, be a part of any legislation as we embark on 
prohibiting human cloning. First, legislation must differentiate between human cloning on the one hand and animal, cellular and molecular and plant cloning on the other. It is that human dimension we must address and address very specifically in order not to halt the progress of science in those other fields. 
The second principle. The legislation must be crafted very specifically with surgical precision, with laser-like precision, narrowly, yes, so that we will avoid inadvertently banning other nontargeted research, research that is critically important to improving health care for the current generation as well as that next generation, important research that we must protect in terms of stem cell research, in vitro fertilization, our search for cures of juvenile diabetes, our attack on prevention and cure of cancer. 
The third principle that I would encourage my colleagues to adopt as we embark upon this banning of human cloning is that the legislation must prevent the specific technique of somatic cell nuclear transfer, the specific technique, because of its potential to facilitate the mass production of cloned human embryos that could be created solely for research and ultimately destroyed. 
Fourth, the legislation must include the creation of a new permanent bipartisan commission that is representative of the American people, representative of science, representative of our ethical thinking, representative of theology, so that we can more adequately address in a sophisticated, mature way, consistent with the science and ethical thinking of today, the many issues that are going to face us in this arena of bioethics, this rapidly oncoming onslaught of science, and very good science as we look to the future. Science is critically important as we learn better to address the ravages of disease. 
Two temptations threaten both science and ethics in the current environment. On the one hand, we have the pressure on legislators, often unfamiliar with the specifics of scientific issues, to rush out and draft laws that could hamper important research efforts if we are not very careful. And on the other hand, almost in parallel, is this tendency on the part of some scientists to say, no, we don't need that type of intervention, that type of oversight of ethics, of laws. Thus we have science and we have ethics that are almost lost in this political morass and the public meanwhile stays outside, all too often frightened, uninvolved, and unengaged. 
This cloning debate, I think, maybe for the first time in the history of this body, forces us to address what is inevitable as we look to the future, and that is a rapid-fire, one-after-another onslaught of new scientific technological innovation that has to be assimilated into our ethical-social fabric. 
Thus, this bioethics commission is important to consider these future innovations as they come forward. Right now there are no fewer than six legislative proposals that are either on the table or soon to be on the table on this issue of banning human cloning. These bills range from a sweeping prohibition of all types of cloning to really some very symbolic bans. The National Bioethics Advisory Commission, the commission that was appointed by and that reports to President Clinton, did a good job of trying to assimilate the information on the cloning under their very short, 90-day deadline last year. But they, as hard as they tried, were unable to substantively address the ethical issues surrounding human cloning. 
The commission cited at the time that they had inadequate time to tackle these difficult ethical issues in the context of our pluralistic society, and they focused primarily on scientific concerns, as well as the less abstract issue of safety--a really proscribed area of safety, saying that the technique today is not safe or has not been proven to be safe. And then they appealed, to us, as Americans--to take this to the public square, take this out to the people around America and talk to them and look for the sort of leadership that we need on forming a national policy on human cloning. 
In an effort to follow up on the recommendations of the National Bioethics Commission, the Senate Labor Committee's Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, which I chair, on June 17, 1997, held a hearing. That hearing was entitled `Ethics and Theology: A Continuation of the National Discussion on Human Cloning.' And we heard outstanding testimony on all sides of the issue, from Christian, Islamic and Jewish traditions and from philosophers and theologians, all well schooled in biomedical ethics. We launched a much broader public debate with questions about the nature of human individuality, about family, about social structure. However, the time has now shown that both a Presidential commission and the U.S. Congress are really inadequate forums to fully address the diversity, the richness, the fabric of these bioethical issues and their importance as we look to the future. 
I, therefore, today, through our legislation, propose creation of a new, permanent, independent national bioethics commission, representative of the public at large, with the combined participation of experts in law, ethics, theology, medicine, social science, philosophy, coupled with interested members of the public. It is my hope that this public commission, in an environment where it can capture the diversity of our society today, will forge a new path for our country in the field of bioethics, in considering new techniques and new innovation; that they will enable us to have an informed, ongoing, thoughtful, scientific debate in the public square, without fear or politics driving our decisions. 
In this proposal the majority and minority leaders of Congress would appoint members of the panel, but no current Member of Congress or administration political appointee would participate during his or her term of office. Individuals would serve for 3 years. There would be 24 such members, six subcommittees looking at the various fields that I have mentioned. Each and every citizen should have an opportunity to participate in these ongoing bioethical debates. 
I anticipate that some may question the role of theology in a public policy debate. Certainly the President's advisory commission found that their considerations were incomplete without examining the religious mores of our culture. Indeed, our Founding Fathers also recognized that public policy could not be formulated in a theological vacuum. While they forbade the establishment of a state religion, they simultaneously affirmed the rights of God-fearing people to make their voices heard in the public arena. Today, and throughout history, religion has been a primary source of the beliefs governing these decisions for men and women of all races, of all creeds. 
While these four principles that I outlined earlier start as the basic foundation, we do need to reach out and receive the input of others as we embark upon consideration of this piece of legislation. With these four principles it is my hope that we can build a bipartisan coalition of support for a ban on human cloning. 
I do call upon my colleagues in the scientific community to step forward and participate in the ongoing debate in good faith. We have much to gain from your expertise, and the public has much to gain from your ongoing work. 
In recent days, many in the biotechnology community have argued that the mass production of cloned human embryos for research purposes is vital to their research efforts. I appeal to them this afternoon to take one step back and recognize that this 
legislation does not prohibit the vast majority of all current embryo and stem cell research, and acknowledge that there are serious ethical dilemmas associated with churning out human embryos as if they were products on an assembly line. 
Let us have no more hedging about what is and what is not an embryo. Biologically it is clear. Proponents of embryo research have always been quite open that they are seeking to do embryo research because the embryo is biologically unique. So I say to those in the research community, this legislation does not threaten your ongoing embryo research. It does not limit your ability to experiment with stem cells, with gene therapy, with in vitro fertilization. Help us stop Dr. Seed dead in his tracks. Keep this issue focused on human cloning and join our efforts to create a new commission to deal with these issues on an ongoing basis. 
The Washington Post, in 1994 said:  
The creation of human embryos specifically for research that will destroy them is unconscionable. . .. Viewed from one angle this issue can be made to yield endless complexities. What about the suffering of individuals and infertile couples who might be helped by embryo research? What about the status of the brand new embryo? But before you get to these questions [the Post says] there is a simpler one. 
It is the question I read a few minutes ago at the beginning of my statement and I will read it again. It is: 
Is there a line that should not be crossed, even for scientific or other gain, and if so, where is it? 
As the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine has said in the past: 
Knowledge, although important, may be less important to a decent society than the way it is obtained. 
This is where the debate will be over the next several days. I believe that an honest ban on human cloning must begin at the level of the activation of the embryo, not later at some point, at the time of implantation. Is the Federal Government capable of preventing a woman from implanting an embryo derived from her own genetic makeup into her own womb? Is it wise to perfect our cloning techniques on embryos when we forbid their implantation? Yes, I think we need to start the ban at the time of the activation of the embryo. 
In closing, it is clearly vital that our public debate and reflection on scientific developments keep pace with and even anticipate and prepare us for this, really, rush of new scientific knowledge that is coming toward us each and every day. The moral and ethical dilemmas that are inherent in the cloning of human beings may well be our greatest test to date. We don't simply seek knowledge, but we seek the wisdom to apply that knowledge. As with each of those mind-boggling advances of the last century, we know that there is the potential both for good and evil. Our task as legislators is to reflect the public trust, to define the role of the Federal Government in harnessing this technology for the good. Our task as citizens is to exercise responsible stewardship of the precious gift of life. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, 
In recent years, I have often voiced concern that medical technology is moving at an unprecedented pace, leaving the rest of society ill-prepared to cope with the increasingly complex moral and ethical dilemmas that follow in the wake of new inventions. We must never attempt to divorce scientific progress from ethical considerations. We must instead fashion timely answers to the timeless question `Is there a line that should not be crossed even for scientific or other gain, and if so, where is it?' (Washington Post editorial, Oct. 2, 1994) 
The recent furor over Dolly the cloned sheep, and Dr. Seed's subsequent announcement that he intended to clone a human being through the same technique, has highlighted the necessity of an independent, balanced forum to address the ethical implications of new technological capabilities. Two temptations threaten both science and ethics in the current milieu. There is pressure on legislators (often unfamiliar with scientific issues) to rush to draft laws that could hamper important research efforts. There is a parallel tendency on the part of academic scientists to resist any input from law or ethics into their research. Thus, science and ethics are lost in the political morass, while the public often remains uninvolved and frightened. The example of the cloning debate provides ample evidence of this tendency. 
There are no fewer than six legislative proposals to address cloning on the horizon, ranging from sweeping prohibitions to largely symbolic bans. The National Bioethics Advisory Commission (a commission appointed entirely by President Clinton) did a good job of trying to assimilate the information on cloning under their ninety day deadline last year, but they were unable to substantively address the ethical issues surrounding human cloning. The Commission cited inadequate time to tackle difficult ethical issues in the context of our pluralistic society, and primarily focused on scientific concerns as well as the less abstract issue of safety. They then appealed to each American citizen to step to the plate and exercise moral leadership in forming a national policy on human cloning. 
In an effort to follow up on the Commission's recommendations, the Senate labor Committee's Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, which I chair, held a hearing June 17, 1997, entitled `Ethics and Theology: A Continuation of the National Discussion on Human Cloning.' We heard testimony on all sides of the issue, from the Christian, Islamic, and Jewish traditions, and from philosophers well-schooled in biomedical ethics. We launched a broader public debate with questions about the nature of human individuality, family, and social structure. 
However, time has shown that both a Presidential Commission, and the United States Congress are inadequate and inappropriate forums for bioethical issues of intricacy and importance. I am therefore proposing to establish a new independent National Bioethics Commission, representative of the public at large, with combined participation of experts in law, science, theology, medicine, social science, and philosophy/ethics with interested members of the public. 
It is my hope that this Commission will forge a new path for our country in the field of bioethics. That they will enable us to have an informed, thoughtful, scientific debate in the public square without fear or politics driving our decisions. The Majority and Minority Leaders of Congress would appoint members of the panel, but no current Member of Congress or Administration political appointee would be allowed to participate during their term of office. We simply must depoliticize these discussions while simultaneously broadening input from the general public. Each and every citizen should have the opportunity to contribute to these great debates. 
I anticipate that some may question the role of theology in a public policy debate. Certainly the President's advisory commission found that their considerations were incomplete without examining the religious mores of our culture. Our founding fathers also recognized that public policy could not be formulated in a theological vacuum. While they forbade the establishment of a state religion, they simultaneously affirmed the rights of God-fearing people to make their voices heard in the public arena. Today, and throughout history, religion has been a primary source of the beliefs governing these decisions for men and women of all races and creeds. 
So it is vital that our public debate and reflection on scientific developments keep pace, and even anticipate and prepare for new scientific knowledge. The moral and ethical dilemmas inherent in the cloning of human beings may well be our greatest test to date. We do not simply seek knowledge, but the wisdom to apply that knowledge. As with each of the mind boggling scientific advances of the last century, we know that there is the potential for both good and evil in this technology. Our task as legislators is to define the role of the federal government in harnessing this technology for good. Our task as citizens is to exercise responsible stewardship of the precious gift of life. May this Commission enable us to fulfill our trust.

Mr. FRIST. 
Mr. President--I rise today, along with my colleague Senator Dorgan from North Dakota, to introduce the Aviation Medical Assistance Act of 1998. 
Thirty years ago the first battery powered portable defibrillator was approved for use. A defibrillator is a medical device that electrically converts an abnormal heart rhythm to a normal rhythm. It can and does save lives. The time between the onset of abnormal rhythm and the application of electrical defibrillatory current is critical. If the time of first defibrillation is between five and six minutes after the onset of abnormal rhythm, the patient survival rate is greater than 40 percent. 
One clear example is that of Graeme Seiber of Tennessee. As my colleagues may recall on September 14, 1995, Mr. Seiber went into full cardiac arrest as he stepped off an elevator in the Dirksen building, and collapsed in the corridor near my Senate office. 
After heroic actions by members of Senator Chafee's staff, I performed CPR on Mr. Seiber and when the Capitol Physician's Emergency Response Team arrived, I was able to insert a tube directly into Mr. Seiber's lungs to aid the flow of oxygen. But, most importantly, the team had a portable defibrillator that I used to shock his heart back into a normal rhythm. A team of emergency medical technicians arrived shortly thereafter, and Mr. Seiber was taken to George Washington University Hospital by ambulance. 
Because of the quick action of those involved and the use of a portable defibrillator, Graeme Seiber is alive today as one of a very small percentage of patients who actually survive sudden cardiac arrest. 
But that was in the United States Senate, which has a competent medical team that responds quickly with the proper medical equipment, like a defibrillator. What would have happened to Mr. Seiber if he suffered cardiac arrest in a setting in which medical care and a defibrillator was not readily available. 
This past May, my friend, colleague and fellow Tennessean, Representative Jimmy Duncan held a hearing before the House Subcommittee on Aviation, which he chairs, on the quality of medical kits used by the airlines. On November 6, 1997 Representative Duncan introduced the Aviation Medical Assistance Act to address concerns that arose from the hearing. 
The Aviation Medical Assistance Act of 1997 directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to reevaluate regulations regarding the medical equipment and flight attendant training for commercial airlines. 
To address the lack of information regarding fatalities on aircraft, the airlines would be required to make an effort to report monthly to the Administrator of the FAA over the course of a year regarding deaths on aircrafts. 
The bill also addresses the critical issue of liability arising from individuals assisting in an in-flight medical emergency. The bill declares that the individual rendering aid shall not be liable when attempting to provide medical assistance, except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct. 
Finally, the bill requires the FAA Administrator to decide whether or not to require automatic external defibrillators on aircraft and in airports. To their credit, two major airlines, Delta Airlines and American Airlines have already initiated a plan to equip their entire fleet with defibrillators and upgrade their medical equipment. 
It is critical that individuals who suffer cardiac arrest or other medical emergencies receive quick and proper attention to increase their odds of survival. It is my hope that this legislation will improve emergency medical care for all in-flight emergencies. I would like to thank Congressman Duncan for his leadership in the House of Representatives on this important issue. I am also grateful to Senator Dorgan for partnering with me on this potentially lifesaving legislation. I am proud to introduce the companion legislation in the Senate.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of the resolution before us today to express the Sense of the Senate that the Federal commitment to biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health is one of our highest priorities in fiscal year 1999. This resolution states that Congress should increase the NIH budget by $2 billion next year. 
I would like to commend my colleague, Senator Specter, for his leadership in bringing this resolution forward today to ensure our commitment to biomedical research. I was an original cosponsor with Senator Mack of similar legislation, Senate Resolution 15, introduced on the first day of the 105th Congress. The `Biomedical Research Commitment Resolution of 1997,' expressed the Sense of the Senate that the NIH budget should be doubled over the next five years. The resolution before us today puts us one step closer to achieving that goal. 
I have struggled with the effort to balance the budget and preserve a strong federal role in biomedical research during times of fiscal restraint. As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, it will be my goal to increase the NIH budget within the context of the overall budget agreement reached by Congress last year. 
Historically, Congress has demonstrated strong support for increased funding for the important work of the National Institutes of Health. The scientific and medical breakthroughs supported by the National Institutes of Health in the last 50 years have improved vastly our capacity to prevent, diagnose, and treat human disease. As a heart and lung transplant surgeon, I know that biomedical research is fundamentally important in our battle against disease. As Americans, we have the benefit of one of the finest health care systems in the world, and it is vital that we continue to invest in our research efforts to maintain this health care system. 
As chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety with jurisdiction over the NIH, I believe that one of the federal government's primary duties is to ensure our investment in long-term biomedical research as a public good. The commitment to this investment allows us to reap many benefits in improving the quality of life for our citizens. It is in this spirit that I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the passage of this resolution in recognition that the future of our nation's health is dependent on our strong investment in biomedical research.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President. I am pleased to join the Chairman of the Employment and Training Subcommittee, Senator DeWine and the Chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee Senator Jeffords in introducing the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998. I am grateful for their strong leadership in drafting this important legislation. 
The vocational rehabilitation program was begun in 1921 to help disabled war veterans obtain rehabilitation and employment assistance. Today it is a major source of employment assistance for many individuals with disabilities, including individuals with severe disabilities. Vocational rehabilitation programs, although operated by State vocational rehabilitation agencies are located throughout a State. These programs help about a million individuals with disabilities a year, about 20 percent of whom enter the competitive labor market within 12 months. The average cost per person aided is about $2,500. 
The Tennessee Vocational Rehabilitation Program provides one example of what can happen when the focus of an agency is clear--getting people with disabilities jobs. In 1996, this program in my State served 26,032 individuals with disabilities of which 81 percent were severely disabled. Of the individuals served 5,820 were successfully employed with 90.4 percent of them working in the competitive labor market. The annualized income of these 5,820 individuals, once they entered the work force increased from $8.732 million to $64.233 million. I am proud of this record, while realizing that more can and should be done. 
The main goal of the reauthorization, which has previously been discussed in detail today by Senators DeWine and Jeffords is to increase opportunities for individuals with disabilities to prepare for, secure, maintain, and regain employment. There is also a great effort to simplify access to vocational rehabilitation services, while reducing costs and increasing effectiveness through streamlining the administration of the vocational rehabilitation program. 
Also included in this reauthorization is the effort that I began as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Disability Policy in the 104th Congress, the linking of vocational rehabilitation programs to a new state system of work force development. The intention is to create a seamless system of increasing employment assistance for individuals with disabilities with a new state workforce system. The reauthorization of the Rehabilitation Act includes this important goal by linking vocational rehabilitation services to those that will be available under the Workforce Investment Partnership Act of 1997. 
I would like to acknowledge the bipartisan effort brought forth to build the consensus that is evident by this bill. I am pleased to see the tradition of bipartisanship corporation on disability policy issues continued through this effort. I would especially like to recognize Aaron Grau with Senator DeWine, and Dr. Patricia Morrissey with Senator Jeffords for their hard work and dedication which has made legislation a reality. 
I am confident that the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 will take this seventy-seven year old program into the next century as a strong and integral part of providing opportunities for individuals with disabilities to prepare for, secure, maintain, and regain employment.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as a physician I have long advocated maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I'm always amazed when individuals prove that exercise and eating right are simple requirements for remaining healthy and staying young at heart. The Gallatin American Legion Post 17 Softball team is just such a group that is having fun staying healthy and exercising regularly. 
This is no ordinary softball team, these ladies are sixty-years of age and older. This special team is comprised of women from all over middle Tennessee. The team was formed in 1994. They practice each Monday in Gallatin and in the winter they keep up their stamina by using the Gallatin Sports Complex for their weekly softball practices. That same year they participated in the State tournament and won. Since then they are proud to be a force to reckon with on the Senior's Softball circuit. 
This past spring the team traveled to Tucson, Arizona to participate in the International Senior Olympic Games. The competition drew more than 12,000 seniors over sixty-years-old from all over the world who competed in a variety of athletic events. The Gallatin American Legion Post 17 Softball team, with 13 players and two coaches, faced competition from nine teams across the United States and Canada. These ladies played hard and their dedication and determination paid off when they came home with the gold medal. They won each of the six games in which they played and outscored their Olympic competitors 122-10. 
Since winning the International Olympics gold medal these women have not rested on their laurels. They're back on the field practicing and playing the game. Because of the increase in interest in women's softball for seniors, leagues have cropped up across the country, and they gather for yearly tournaments. The ladies of Gallatin American Legion Post 17 maintain their busy schedule with practices and games to defend their international title. 
This newly developed enthusiasm for senior athletic groups is truly inspiring. These women serve as role models for younger generations and encourage participation from other seniors. They are living examples of the happiness that seniors can find in exercising and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I want to congratulate the Gallatin American Legion Post 17 Softball team not only for winning the gold medal at the International Senior Citizen's Olympics but for also winning in the game of life. These ladies are active and healthy, taking advantage of their older years rather than letting old age take care of them. I wish them the best of luck in the future.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President. I would like to congratulate WATO radio in Oak Ridge, Tennessee for 50 years of radio broadcasting excellence. WATO got its start in 1948 when it was commissioned by the Department of Energy (DOE), which in those days was known as the Atomic Energy Commission. 
WATO was the first radio station established on a military reservation. It was created as a service to the growing community that resulted with the establishment of the DOE Oak Ridge Reservation in the early 1940's. Over the years, WATO has kept Oak Ridgers in touch with the DOE and other government related entities. The station has also made the community an important part of their programing, through its coverage of local events. Whether it be educational activities, athletic events or providing the community with important service announcements, WATO is very much involved in the Oak Ridge community.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in support of House Joint Resolution 95, a measure introduced by my friend, Representative Ed Bryant of the Seventh District of Tennessee. This legislation gives congressional approval to the Chickasaw Trail Economic Development Compact. This partnership is an interstate compact created by agreement of the Mississippi and Tennessee State Legislatures to promote joint economic development and interstate cooperation in a rural, undeveloped area of Fayette County, TN, and Marshall County, MS. 
The plan creates the Chickasaw Authority, which will conduct a study of the feasibility of establishing an industrial park in the area. If this study produces a positive recommendation, Mississippi and Tennessee would then negotiate a new compact implementing the details to establish a 4,000- to 5,000-acre industrial park. Such a facility would capitalize on the strengths that lie on both sides of the State line and attract new investment and employment opportunities. The proximity of the park to metro Memphis would build on the already strong commercial activity in Southwest Tennessee and North Mississippi. To my knowledge, this type of cooperation between States has never been attempted. 
Mr. President, I am proud to add my name to the unanimous support of the members of the Tennessee and Mississippi congressional delegations. it is my hope that this project will bring economic development and jobs by attracting new sophisticated high-technology industries to the area. I would like to thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, for his assistance in bringing this measure before the Senate, and I would also like to thank Senator Thompson and Senator Cochran for their support for this initiative. I yield the floor.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as a Senator, I am afforded a unique opportunity to see a broad cross section of our Nation. From that perspective, I have had a chance to reflect upon why our country continues to be the envy of the world. Some might say that we are blessed with abundant natural resources. That is true enough, but in the final analysis, it is the American people that have made, and will continue to make, this country great. 
We are a nation drawn from diverse backgrounds and ideas. Still, there is a thread that unites us. Our forefathers, who came to this land to build a new life, created in turn a nation of builders. We build homes, we build businesses and factories, but most of all we build futures; we build hope. And, as a people, we rise to meet a challenge. At no time was that more apparent than during World War II. That crisis forced our Nation to make drastic sacrifices in order to survive. The legacy of those choices has driven our economy and our policies ever since. It is one of those legacies, the Federal investment in science and technology, that concerns me today. 
Science and technology have shaped our world. It is very easy to see the big things: putting a man on the moon, breakthroughs in genetic research, and the burgeoning world of the Internet. In today's world technology surrounds us: the computer that makes our cars run, lets us talk on the telephone, runs the stoplights, runs the grocery store checkout, and controls the microwave. Our world runs on technology and the American Federal investment in research and development has played a significant part in creating it. Much of our economy runs on technology as well. One-third to one-half of all U.S. economic growth is the result of technical progress. Technology contributes to the creation of new goods and services, new jobs and new capital. It is the principal driving force behind the long-term economic growth and increased standards of living of most of the world's modern industrial societies. 
The history of the last five decades has shown us that there is a Federal role in the creation and nurturing of science and technology. But the last three decades have shown us something else: fiscal reality. The simple truth is that we just don't have enough money to do everything we'd like. It took some time for us to realize that and by the time we did, we found ourselves in a fiscal situation that is only now being addressed. As a result, discretionary spending is under immense fiscal pressure. 
One only has to look back over the last 30 years to illustrate this trend. In 1965, mandatory spending--entitlements and interest on the debt--accounted for 30 percent of our budget, while 70 percent was discretionary. That meant that 70 percent of the budget could be used for roads, education, medical research, parks, and national defense. Today, just 30 years later, the ratio of discretionary to mandatory spending has reversed. Sixty-seven percent of our budget is spent on mandatory programs, leaving 33 percent of our budget for discretionary spending. Current estimates paint an even grimmer future. By 2012, mandatory spending, the combination of interest and entitlement programs, will consume all taxpayer revenues, leaving nothing for parks, education, roads, or the Federal investment in science and technology. Clearly we as a nation, cannot afford to let this happen. 
We have both a long-term problem--addressing the ever increasing level of mandatory spending--and a near-term challenge--apportioning a dwindling amount of discretionary funding. This confluence of increased dependency on technology and decreased fiscal flexibility has created a problem of national significance. Not all deserving programs can be funded. Not all authorized programs can be fully implemented. The luxury of fully funding programs across the board has passed. We must set priorities. By using a set of first or guiding principles, we can consistently ask the right questions about each competing technology program. The answers will help us focus on a particular program's effectiveness and appropriateness for Federal research and development funding. This is the information needed to make the hard choices about which programs deserve support and which do not. Through the application of these First Principles, we can ensure that the limited resources the Federal Government has for science and technology are invested wisely. 
There are four First Principles: 
First, good science. Our Federal research and development programs must be focused, peer and merit reviewed, and not duplicative; the program must solve the right problem, in the right way. 
Second, fiscal accountability. We must exercise oversight to ensure that programs funded with scarce Federal dollars are managed well. We cannot tolerate the waste of money by inefficient management techniques, by government agencies, by contractors, or by Congress itself. A move to multi-year budgeting is a step in the right direction. It will work to provide more stable funding levels and give Congress the opportunity to exercise its much needed oversight responsibility. 
Third, measurable results. We need to make sure that Government programs achieve their goals. We need to make sure that as we craft legislation that affects science and technology, it includes a process which allows us to gauge the program's effectiveness. As we undertake this, we must be careful to select the correct criteria. We cannot get caught up in the trap of measuring the effectiveness of a research and development program by passing judgment on individual research projects. 
Fourth, the Government should be viewed as the funder of last resort. Government programs should not displace private investment, whether from corporations or venture capitalists. It is not the Federal Government's role to invest in technology that has matured enough to make it to the marketplace. When the Government provides funding for any technology investment program, it must take reasonable steps to ensure that the potential benefits derived from the program will accrue broadly and not, for instance, to a single company. 
Accompanying the four First Principles, are four corollaries: 
First, flow of technology. This year's Science, Technology and Space Subcommittee 
hearing have provided ample proof that the process of creating technology involves many steps. The present Federal research and development structure reinforces the increasingly artificial distinctions across the spectrum of research and development activities. The result is a set of discrete programs which each support a narrow phase of research and development and are not coordinated with one another. The Government should maximize its investment by encouraging the progression of a technology from the earliest stages of research up to commercialization, through funding agencies and vehicles appropriate for each stage. This creates a flow of technology, subject to merit at each stage, so that promising technology is not lost in a bureaucratic maze. 
Second, excellence in the American research infrastructure. Federal investment in research and development programs must foster a close relationship between research and education. Investment in research at the university level creates more than simply world class research. It creates world class researchers as well. The Federal strategy must continue to reflect this commitment to a strong research infrastructure. We must find ways to extend the excellence of our university system to primary and secondary educational institutions. 
Third, commitment to a broad range of research initiatives. An increasingly common theme has emerged from the Science, Technology and Space Subcommittee hearings this year: Revolutionary innovation is taking place at the overlap of research disciplines. We must continue to encourage this by providing opportunities for interdisciplinary projects and fostering collaboration across fields of research. 
Fourth, partnerships among industry, universities, and Federal laboratories. Each has special talents and abilities that complement the other. Our Federal dollar is wisely spent facilitating the creation of partnerships, creating a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. 
The principles and corollaries that I have outlined form a framework that can be used to guide the creation of new, federally funded research and development programs and to validate existing ones. An objective framework derived from First Principles is a powerful method to elevate the debate on technology initiatives. It increases our ability to focus on the important issues, and decreases the likelihood that we will get sidetracked on politically charged technicalities. It also serves as a mechanism to ensure that Federal research and development programs are consistent and effective. 
The four principles and four corollaries serve different purposes: The First Principles help us evaluate an implementation of a research and development program. 
First, good science. 
Second, fiscal accountability. 
Third, measurable results. 
Fourth, Government as funder of last resort. 
The corollaries help us establish a consistent set of national goals--the vision of an overall research and development program. 
First, creation of a flow of technology. 
Second, excellence in the American research infrastructure. 
Third, commitment to a broad range of research initiatives. 
Fourth, partnerships among industry, university, and federal laboratories. 
Mr. President, Congress continues to face a monumental budgetary challenge. Despite our accomplishment this year of passing the first balanced budget since 1969, we have yet to face the most daunting challenge: bringing entitlements under control at a time of huge demographic shifts toward increasing numbers of recipients. Even as we work toward this difficult goal, we cannot lose sight of the near-term management challenge in making the most of our limited discretionary funds. The Federal investment in research and development has paid handsome dividends in raising our standard of living. It is an investment we cannot afford to pass up.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, 3 years of hard work, which was begun by Senator Nancy Kassebaum, have resulted in the passage of the conference report to the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 in the Senate today. This legislation represents the first major, comprehensive reform effort since the initial amendments outlining regulation for drugs in 1962 and for medical devices in 1976. This major reform will help improve the FDA by strengthening its efficiency, accountability, and its ability to safeguard the public health. 
There are several provisions contained in this bill that constitute significant reform and improvements to increase the efficiency of product review. For example, this legislation gives FDA authority to increase its access to scientific and technical expertise outside the Agency by allowing interagency collaboration with Federal agencies such as the NIH and CDC, and with the National Academy of Sciences. Also, the bill gives FDA the explicit authority to contract with outside reviewers and expand its current third party medical device review pilot program. 
To help alleviate the confusion and frustration that many applicants feel when working with the FDA, the bill will require the FDA to codify evidence requirements for new drug and medical device application submissions and encourages improved communication between the agency and industry. And after 60 years, the FDA will be made more accountable by giving it a mission statement and requiring the FDA to develop a plan of action to meet its requirements under law. The bill will also reauthorize for 5 years the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, known as PDUFA, which has been tremendously successful in improving and speeding the review of much needed pharmaceutical products. 
Most importantly, the bill Congress sends to the President will help patients. Individuals with a serious life-threatening disease or condition will have access to a new clinical trial database providing information on investigational therapies. Patients will benefit from the expansion of the fast-track drug approval process for new drugs intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions built on the existing program for AIDS and cancer drugs. And, patients that have no other alternative but to try an unapproved investigational product will have access to investigational therapies and medical devices. 
The bill also includes a provision that will allow reprints of scientifically, peer-reviewed medical journal articles and medical textbooks about off-label uses of FDA-approved drugs and devices to be shared with physicians and other health care practitioners. This provision will help get life-saving information to doctors, so they can be better informed when making decisions about how to treat their patients. 
As a physician, I have used off-label uses to treat my patients in the past and understand its tremendous importance to the patient. Over 90 percent of treatments for cancer patients are off-label and the American Medical Association has estimated that between 40 percent and 60 percent of all prescriptions are for off-label uses of prescription drugs. I would like to acknowledge the tremendous work on this provision during the last few years by my friend, Senator Connie Mack and Mark Smith of his staff. 
There are a number of people who worked hard to insure passage of this reform effort. I would like to thank Senator Jeffords, the chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, for leading the bipartisan effort on FDA Reform in the Senate. I also acknowledge the leadership of Senator Coats, who has done significant work on provisions affecting medical devices in the bill. I also thank Senators Gregg, DeWine, Dodd, Milkulski, Kennedy and Harkin and their staffs for their hard work in conference. I would like to thank our House colleagues and their staffs who worked with us in conference and I especially recognize the able leadership of the chairman of the House Commerce Committee Representative Tom Bliley and the ranking member John Dingell. I would also like to acknowledge and thank Secretary Donna Shalala and the FDA for working with us to help modernize and improve the FDA. 
In particular, I would like to thank Jay Hawkins, Mark Powden, and Sean Donahue of Senator Jeffords' staff, Vince Ventimiglia of Senator Coats' staff, and Kimberly Spaulding of Senator Gregg's staff who were critical to the development of the bill. I thank them for their dedication and tireless effort on this important bill. 
I especially want to thank the tireless work and outstanding leadership of Sue Ramthun, my staff director for health affairs, who has been so instrumental in passage of this bill. 
I believe we have made a step in the right direction that will improve patient care and that this bill begins the debate on the long-term investment necessary to move the agency forward in areas such as regulatory research, professional development, and collaborative efforts between Government and academia, and I hope to continue working with my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to further improve the FDA in the following years.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to defend two projects the President of the United States chose to veto in the military construction appropriations bill. The President claimed that three criteria had to be met for an item to be cut. First, the item was not requested in the President's fiscal year 1998 budget; second, it would not substantially improve the quality of life of military service members and their families; and third, architectural and engineering design of the project has not started, making it unlikely funds can be used for construction in fiscal year 1998. Only the first criterion was, in fact met in the two cases I rise to support. 
The first project the President struck was a tactical equipment shop at Ft. Campbell. The $9.9 million project would provide a vehicle maintenance shop, storage for a forward support battalion, and a combat support hospital. The project replaces a 55-year-old building that was constructed in 1942 as a temporary structure to last until the end of World War II. This project was, please note, fully designed, and therefore did not meet the President's third criterion. 
This facility is Ft. Campbell's No. 1 priority mission support project. The structure is literally falling down around its occupants and is ridiculously expensive to maintain. The Army wastes tens of thousands of dollars on Band-Aid repair jobs every year just to keep the structure barely functional. 
The old structures have significant environmental problems: No oil/water separators, no sumps for battery acid, and the buildings contain asbestos and lead-based paint. In addition to the environmental issues, the structures have old faulty wiring that caused a fire in October 1991. Also, there is no eye wash area or vehicle exhaust system. 
The new structure would support the 101st Airborne, whose operational deployment requirements have increased 300 to 400 percent to support Operations Other Than WAr. In 1995 alone, the Clinton Pentagon spent $6.6 billion in Operations Other Than War in places like Bosnia, Haiti, and Somalia. Combined, the cost of both of the Tennessee projects vetoed by the President are about the same as one day's spending at that rate. 
Ironically, according to the President's formula for cuts, if this facility were an arts and crafts center, it would have been classified as a `quality of life' project sale from cuts. Of course, the building's current state of disrepair is a `quality of life' issue to the young Army troop who is spending 8 to 12 hours a day working in the facility. 
The other Tennessee project canceled by the President was an atmospheric air dryer facility at Arnold Air Force Base. This $9.9 million project would construct an air dryer facility to replace the antiquated facility currently used. The new facility would support the mission of the propulsion wind tunnel facility used to test several new weapon systems, including the F-22 and joint strike fighter. 
Mr. President, both of these projects are vital to military readiness and national security. It is my hope that my colleagues will take a close look at the projects in this legislation and cast a vote for this critical legislation. We must not allow our forces to decline further into a hollow state reminiscent of the late 1970's.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure which will help preserve one of our greatest national treasures and maintain one of the most significant contributors to the economy of east Tennessee. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is by far our Nation's most visited national park, both because of its striking beauty, wildlife, and recreational opportunities, and for the fact that it is within a day's drive of half of the population of the United States. 
I have often escaped to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park for hiking, camping, and enjoying the great outdoors with my three sons. I have witnessed the splendor of the turning leaves in the fall, and the glory and renewal that springtime brings to the Smokies. Spending time in the Smokies allows my family and millions of other families to reconnect with nature and to refocus on the fundamental strengths of what really holds us together as a family. 
While the Great Smoky Mountains National Park plays such a valuable role in the lives of so many American families, it is also a park that strains under the burdens of heavy use. Infrastructure and services struggle to meet demands which the larger and less-visited parks can more easily attain. To compound the problems associated with heavy use and popularity, the park is prohibited from collecting an entrance fee of any kind. It is the only national park with such a prohibition, thus limiting its access to valuable, internally generated resources which supplement the budgets of other parks. The result is that the Smokies has great difficulty in meeting the infrastructure and maintenance needs generated by its 9 million yearly visitors. 
In the 104th Congress we began a program which allowed individual parks to keep for their internal use up to 80 percent of the user fees collected above and beyond the level of fees collected in 1994. My bill will allow the park to retain 100 percent of that amount. While this change is modest, it is one way to begin to address the deficit in which the Smokies operates every year, and assist in sustaining the very attractions which serve to make it our most popular national park. 
In 1910, Teddy Roosevelt said, `A nation behaves well if it treats its natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the next generation increased, and not impaired, in value.' Roosevelt was the first proponent of what has clearly become a fundamental tenet of the preservation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Mr. President, we owe it to the future generations of Americans to allow this invaluable national treasure to benefit from its own popularity and accessibility and to keep more of the revenues from its fees. We can thus help ensure that it will continue to offer the services and facilities so many millions of families enjoy and will help guard one of our Nation's most precious legacies.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill to authorize appropriations for the Technology Administration [TA] of the Department of Commerce for fiscal year 1998 and 1999. This bill funds activities in the National Institutes of Standards and Technology [NIST]. 
I am keenly aware of my responsibilities to the American people for ensuring that the people's money is spent wisely. I have a responsibility to exercise prudent fiscal management over programs that cost taxpayers millions of dollars each year. Each program must be examined, and wasteful, ineffective programs must be changed or eliminated. I also have a responsibility to make appropriate long term investments that will help Americans create the technology and wealth of tomorrow. I view both of these duties as part of the principle of `wise stewardship'. The TA legislation represents a challenging application of wise stewardship. This bill covers some of the most productive and necessary areas of governments, as well as a few of the most controversial. 
There is no question that the work done by NIST's Standards Laboratory is essential to U.S. commerce. These laboratories house of the best scientific minds in the world. A perfect example is the award of the 1997 Nobel Prize for Science to Dr. William Phillips in the area of low temperature physics. His accomplishment, as well as the achievements of the world class scientific cadre at NIST are reminders of the necessity for investment in the Standards Laboratory, the people most of all, but the buildings and infrastructure as well. This legislation provides for continued investment into this research and those services 
The reauthorization bill contains a provision to add accountability and controls to the new Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Technology [EPSCoT] program. Modeled after National Science Foundation's successful and effective EPSoR program, the goal of EPSCoT is to increase the technological competitiveness of these States that have historically received less Federal research and development funds than the majority of the States. While I believe that the aims of this program are good, we cannot afford to put this or any other Federal grant program on automatic pilot. Our legislation contains a graduations criteria, that moves a State out of the program when that State has become competitive. The bill contains a provision that mandates periodic evaluation of this program. Using this data we can tell if and when the program ceases to be effective. If that happens we have the information needed to see if the program can be fixed, or should be terminated. 
This legislation contains provisions for two programs that have been particularly contentious: the Advanced Technology Program [ATP], and the manufacturing Extension Program [MEP]. Both are technology enhancement programs designed with the intent of increasing the ability of U.S. firms to compete in the global marketplace. 
Under existing law each MEP center is funded for a maximum of 6 years. This legislation removes the hard and fast sunset provision and replaces it with a 2-year renewal cycle. Each center must win renewal, and with it eligibility for Federal funds by receiving a satisfactory grade from this new biennial review. If the center is not fulfilling its expectation for assistance of manufacturing technology, then it will fail its review and will not be able to receive Federal funding. 
The Advanced Technology Program has been improved under this legislation. Large companies will no longer be able to participate as single applicants. They must partner with one or more small businesses in order to be eligible to apply for an ATP grant. This provision maximizes the benefit of this program by encouraging the transfer of technology and expertise from large businesses to the most dynamic section of our economy--small business. The legislation also takes steps to ensure that ATP does not displace private venture capital. finally, the bill takes an important step to continued evaluation and possible evolution of the program. It instructs the Department of Commerce to commission the National Academy of Sciences to study the effectiveness of the Advanced Technology Program. In addition the study will investigate alternative methods for the Federal Government to help keep U.S. businesses competitive. 
Finally, the TA NIST reauthorization bill creates a new educational resource for the country. There has never been a time in our country's history when science and technology has been more important. It is playing an increasingly critical role in our economy, and most of all to our economic future. It is all too clear that our children are not well enough prepared to take their places as part of the world's scientific leaders. As the recent NAEP and TIMSS science results show, there is a gap between our children's science abilities and those from other countries. In this bill, we have created the Teacher Science and Technology Enhancement Institute Program to help bridge that gap. The program is structured to afford primary and secondary educators the chance to become reacquainted with science. Armed with fresh experiences, the teachers will be better equipped to excite our children about technology and scientific inquiry. This is an investment that we cannot afford to pass up. 
I believe that this legislation embodies the concept of wise stewardship. The bill reflects input that we have received from my colleagues in the Senate, the House and the administration. More importantly, we have heard from constituents from my own State of Tennessee, as well as businesses, professional groups and academia from around the country. I am sure that the result will not please everyone. I believe, however, that it represents a necessary step in the constant evolution of these Federal programs. I take my congressional oversight obligations extremely seriously. Creating responsible, fair, timely authorizing legislation is a key part of that obligation. I believe that this legislation meets these requirements. I hope you will join me in honoring our obligation to the American people by supporting this legislation.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President. It is not everyday that we hear about the heroic pursuits of firefighters across the Nation even though many risk their lives daily to protect our communities and homes. Firefighter Anthony Glover is one of those heros and his efforts to save the life of a fellow firefighter certainly deserve special recognition. 
Last May, the Nashville Fire Department's Engine Company No. 9 responded to a multi-alarm fire. Upon arrival it was very clear that the conditions of the blaze were advanced, quickly deteriorating the burning building. There to do their job, Firefighter Glover and Capt. Terry Secrest entered the building to better access the source of the fire. Little did the firemen know that the building was slowly collapsing around them. 
Before reaching the source of the fire, Captain Secrest's face piece became disconnected from his oxygen source, leaving the captain exposed to severe conditions that would surely end his life. Without hesitation, Firefighter Anthony Glover removed his face piece; exposing himself to the unbearable conditions, in order to share his oxygen with Captain Secrest. This act of courage was just the beginning in a series of life threatening events. 
As the two firefighters were sharing the lone source of oxygen, super-heated gases ignited a blaze of fire, cutting the men off from their destination. A nearby exit from the flame engulfed building was also blocked. Captain Secrest, overcome by the extreme conditions, was unable to continue. Glover, at the end of his oxygen supply, proceeded to drag the captain 90 feet to safety with nothing to guide him in zero visibility and intense heat. Firefighter Glover navigated a maze of burning materials and blocked doorways before breaking through a charred wall and dragging the captain and himself to safety. 
Mr. President, Anthony Glover is a true hero. Firefighter Glover overcame panic, fear, and the instinct to save one's own self in order to save the life of a fellow firefighter, regardless of putting his own life in danger. Due to Firefighter Glover's heroic efforts, Captain Secrest survived the life threatening ordeal. Had it not been for Glovers selfless deed Captain Secrest would have suffered fatal injuries resulting in certain death. It is only fitting that he receive the Departmental Medal of Honor for this act of extraordinary heroism. I admire Firefighter Anthony Glover's courage and determination and wish him the best of luck.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, Friday, October 24, in my hometown of Nashville, TN, the National Association of Women Business Owners/Nashville Chapter and the Nashville Foundation for Women Business Owners will recognize the establishment of an exciting and worthwhile project--The Women's Resource Center. 
The first in Tennessee, the Women's Resource Center is designed to further enhance business opportunities for women, by providing technical assistance, training, and education. I am proud that Nashville is currently among the 10 fastest growing metropolitan areas for women-owned businesses, and this center will ensure continued economic growth and increase participation from women interested in founding and growing their own businesses. 
Like most visionary ideas, this one would not have happened without community support, and women who clearly saw the need for the center and rose to the occasion to make their dream come true. My congratulations go to all of the Nashville members of the Foundation for Women Business Owners and the National Association of Women Business Owners, and especially to local entrepreneurs who as `founding mothers' provided the initial capital to match funds from the Small Business Administration. 
When Alexis de Toqueville traveled this young Nation, he wrote, `If I were asked to what the singular prosperity and growing strength of the American people ought mainly to be attributed, I should reply--to the superiority of their women.' His words still ring true today, and the realization of the Women's Resource Center is further testimony to the superiority and the achievements of these outstanding women business owners in Nashville, TN. I am honored to serve as their U.S. Senator.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, when the Tennessee Valley Authority formed in 1933, the region suffered under the weight of economic despair and the unforgiving forces of nature. The great Depression and rural isolation served to keep much of the valley's population in poverty and without some of the basic tools to sustain even a marginal existence. The mighty Tennessee River and its tributaries, which have sustained life and commerce along their banks since prehistory, wreaked havoc on life and property as the unpredictable and uncontrollable floods rushed from the slopes of the southern Appalachians and Cumberland Plateau. Flooding and poor farming practices were of nearly epidemic proportions as loss of topsoil and low crop yields reached catastrophic levels. Access to electricity was both expensive and limited to only a few metropolitan areas, thus serving to even further widen the gap between the Tennessee Valley and the rest of the country as the already hamstrung national economy passed the region by. 
President Roosevelt designed the Tennessee Valley Authority as a unique Federal agency whose mission was defined by providing a range of essential services to the entire region rather than fulfilling a single, specific function nationwide. TVA undertook many duties that other Federal agencies were actively pursuing in other parts of the country, just as it does today, but TVA also undertook services which addressed the economic and natural problems unique to the Tennessee River watershed. TVA's charter was very broad and designed to give the agency leeway to address the region's interrelated needs of flood control, improved farming methods and conservation, rural electrification, and economic development as a single coordinating and executing body. 
TVA undertook ambitious conservation, economic development, flood control, and electrification projects. The Tennessee River was tamed and became more readily navigable; topsoil loss and declining agricultural productivity had been stopped or even reversed; isolated families received electricity in their homes and workplaces; and the economy was expanding. By the 1950's the Nation's economy was strong and growing, and the economic gap between the Tennessee Valley region and the Nation as a whole was narrowing. By the 1980's, that gap no longer existed. 
In a region that boasted a strong independent tradition and a general skepticism about the benefits of the Federal Government, the TVA had become viewed as more than just a benevolent hand providing economic opportunity and security to the depressed region, it became an integral part of the region's identity. In the minds of Tennesseans, TVA was credited with bringing the region out of poverty, depression, and existence at the mercy of nature. 
Since its inception, TVA's mission has evolved, and the organization today is very different than in 1933. In 1959 the TVA Act was amended to fully separate the U.S. Treasury from the rapidly expanding TVA power program, which had seen an initial round of growth associated with the national security activities in Oak Ridge during the Second World War, but had continued to expand its size and revenues for regional industrial and residential 
consumption. TVA power would no longer rely on the support of taxpayers nationwide, but was thereafter dependent on the ratepayers and lenders to provide all operation expenses. TVA's power program far eclipsed the other original missions of conservation, flood control, and navigation from which had been separated. Today, TVA is one of the largest electric utilities in the world, with a revenue stream in excess of $5 billion per year. 
That's an impressive growth, but it didn't come without associated problems--some of them very serious. In the 1960's and 1970's, TVA began an ambitious nuclear powerplant construction program, borrowing heavily from public and private sources. Like other utilities that invested in nuclear power, TVA overextended itself badly as the costs of construction and fueling the plants rose dramatically and the regulatory bar moved ever higher. TVA continued to go further into debt, and today its liability now exceeds a truly staggering $27 billion. 
TVA's benevolent role in the life of the region has also come into question. Decisions and behavior that many Tennesseans are now viewing as simply an extension of a grossly overgrown Federal bureaucracy in general, and a betrayal of the original benevolent mission envisioned for TVA in the formative act, served to end an era of trust between ratepayers and TVA. More worrisome, though, is that the errors in strategy and judgment have put the health, liability, and even the existence of TVA in jeopardy. 
At its root, I believe, is the fact that TVA was allowed to fundamentally change its mission and to begin operating as a self-financing electric utility without the necessary structural changes. While TVA power grew rapidly as consequence, it still maintained the management and corporate structure of its original Depression-era mission of conservation, flood control, navigation, and economic development. 
Yesterday, I introduced legislation to address those problems, and to make changes in the decisionmaking body of TVA that will more closely reflect its needs and the demands of the ratepayers and taxpayers. These are changes which, in truth, should have been incorporated into the TVA Act the day TVA became a self-financing corporation in 1959. 
Under my TVA Modernization Act, the board of directors will grow from three full-time members to nine part-time members, and each member must have corporate management or a strong strategic decisionmaking background. My bill also shortens the members' terms from the current 9 years to staggered 5-year terms. 
The expanded board would establish long-range goals and policies for TVA, as well as approve the annual budget and conduct public hearings on policies that have a major effect on ratepayers in the valley. The board will also determine electricity rates and ensure that independent audits of the corporation's management are conducted. 
But unlike the current board, the expanded board will not be involved in the day-to-day management of TVA. Instead, it will appoint an independent chief executive officer to manage the corporation--much like businesses of its size throughout the country have done for decades. 
While the President will retain the sole authority to appoint new board members, my bill will ensure that candidates have the business background necessary to take this $6 billion corporation into the 21st century and a new era of deregulation. By requiring that no more than five members come from a single party affiliation, it will also help ensure that the board never becomes politicized. Together with an independent CEO, we can help avoid the type of decisions and missteps that have saddled TVA with more than $27 billion in debt over the years. 
Once enacted, the bill would take effect on May 18, 1999--exactly 66 years after the original TVA Act took effect. Current board members whose terms don't expire until after 1999 may remain on the board as part-time members, along with the President's seven new appointees. Part-time board members will receive an annual stipend and per diem pay for their services, the total of which will not exceed $35,000 per year. And instead of having a Presidentially designated chairman of the board, members will elect their chairman. 
TVA has experienced enormous growth over the years, from a Depression-era conservation and public works program to a multibillion-dollar electric utility. It's time we give TVA and ratepayers in the valley a management structure that's more responsive and stable and that can help this important agency face the upcoming dramatic changes in the electric utilities industry as effectively and efficiently as possible.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today is an historic day for it was 79 years ago on this date, October 8, 1918, that Sgt. Alvin C. York faced a battery of German soldiers alone in the Battle of the Argonne. Sergeant York's bravery during World War I captured the imagination of the world. Here at home, he was heralded as a true hero, complete with the largest ticker tape parade New York City had ever seen. President Wilson and General Pershing offered their personal thanks, and Sergeant York received this Nation's Medal of Honor. 
But home for Alvin York, despite his new found fame, was the hills of Tennessee in Fentress County. The values instilled in him by his family remained with him throughout his life, and he used his platform as a hero of the Tennessee hills to better the lives of his neighbors and friends. Sergeant York founded an industrial and agricultural school in Fentress County, built a church and Bible school, and when money ran short, he helped to pay the teachers' salaries himself. 
Today, 79 years later, we salute the memory of Alvin C. York and his heroic deeds as a young soldier far from home on the battlefield in France. Despite his great fame, home and family were far more important to him. His heroism extends far beyond the battlefield. For the values that he lived each and every day as a citizen of Fentress County, TN, are values for all of us to emulate in our daily lives. 
Mr. President, the Sergeant York Historical Association, of which I am proud to serve on the board of directors, is committed to keeping the memory of Sergeant York alive. I commend the association for its efforts to ensure that the York homeplace, his grist mill, his papers, and the history of World War I are not forgotten, but will live on for generations to visit, enjoy, and appreciate a piece of our Nation's fabric. 
Sergeant York was a World War I hero, but in truth, he is a hero for all time.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I recently had the opportunity to hold forums on education across my home State of Tennessee. I traveled to Nashville, Memphis, and Knoxville to listen to a variety of people with expertise in educational issues, such as teachers, students, principals, and school board members. These events were a wonderful opportunity for me to listen. While a variety of educational issues were explored at each of the forums, the need for an ample, qualified teaching force was a predominant theme at each forum. 
I would like to note that Tennessee's 1997 Teacher of the Year, Ms. Cathy Pihl, was both present at the Memphis forum on education and is here with us today. I am also pleased that Mr. Jon Hubble, Tennessee's 1997 Teacher of the Year finalist, is also here. Cathy is a fourth grade teacher at Kate Bond Elementary School in Memphis, TN, with 8 years of teaching experience. Jon, who has 10 years of teaching experience, teaches social studies to seventh and eighth grade students at Wright Middle School in Nashville, TN. I am delighted to have both of these outstanding teachers here with us today. We must encourage and enable more students to follow in Cathy and Jon's footsteps. 
In addition to what I heard in Tennessee about the need for qualified teachers, recent statistics highlight the need for a strong teaching force across the Nation. Elementary and secondary school enrollments are expected to reach an all-time high this fall--52.2 million students. Approximately 2 million more teachers will be needed for the next decade. 
The Teacher Investment Act, which I am introducing today, would allow State education agencies to award scholarships to students who are studying to become elementary and secondary school teachers. These scholarships would not need to be repaid provided the students meet certain criteria. 
Specifically, scholarships may go to both undergraduate and graduate students who are committed to becoming teachers. In addition, the individual must have demonstrated outstanding academic achievement in college and must commit to teaching for 2 years in an elementary or secondary school. 
Quite simply, we need more Cathy's and Jon's. One way to achieve this goal is to invest resources to prepare a new generation of teachers. In return, the scholarship recipients must invest at least 2 years in the teaching field. The Teacher Investment Act makes a serious commitment to both our future teachers and students. However, as we discuss our future teachers, I, again, would like to highlight the important achievements and contributions of two of today's teachers--Jon Hubble and Cathy Pihl, who represent Tennessee's teachers so well.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the authorization bill for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for fiscal years 1998 and 1999. I would like to thank the cosponsors of this bill, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Burns, and Senator Stevens, as well as others who support this bill, for their hard work and dedication to making this bill a possibility. 
NASA's unique mission of exploration, discovery, and innovation has preserved the U.S. role as both a leader in world aviation and as the preeminent spacefaring nation. It is NASA's mission to: Explore, use and enable the development of space for human enterprise; advance scientific knowledge and understanding of the Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe and use the environment of space for research; and research develop, verify and transfer advanced aeronautics, space and related technologies. 
This bill, which authorizes NASA for $13.6 billion in fiscal year 1998 and $13.8 billion in fiscal year 1999, provides for the continued development of the international space station, space shuttle operations and safety and performance upgrades, space science, life and micro gravity sciences and applications, the Mission to Planet Earth Program, aeronautics and space transportation technology, mission communications, academic programs, mission support, and the office of the inspector general. 
With this authorization the committee puts in place a sound plan under which NASA can provide assurances to the Congress that the cost and schedule difficulties of the international space station have been contained. In addition, the bill has been crafted to protect to the maximum extent possible the balance between manned and unmanned flight as well as the balance between development activities and science. 
Therefore, I, along with my cosponsors urge the Members of this body to support this bill and allow NASA to continue its mission of support for all space flight, for technological progress in aeronautics, and for space science.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the authorization bill for the U.S. Fire Administration for fiscal years 1998 and 1999. I would like to thank the cosponsors of this bill, Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, and Senator Rockefeller, for their hard work and dedication to making this bill a possibility. 
The mission of the U.S. Fire Administration is to enhance the Nation's fire prevention and control activities and thereby significantly reduce the Nation's loss of life from fire while also achieving a reduction in property loss and nonfatal injury due to fire. 
The bill, which authorizes the Fire Administration for $29.6 million in fiscal year 1998 and $30.5 million for fiscal year 1999, provides for collection, analysis, and dissemination of fire incidence and loss data; development and dissemination of public fire education materials; development and dissemination of better hazardous materials response information for first responders; and support for research and development for fire safety technologies. 
With this authorization, our local and State firefighters will continue to have assess to the training from the National Fire Academy necessary to allow them to better perform their jobs of saving lives and protecting property. 
Additionally, a number of amendments have been proposed to the legislation that established the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation. The Foundation was created by Congress in 1992 to assist their families. These proposed amendments offer some major changes to the structure of the Foundation. In order to allow for a more thorough evaluation of the issues surrounding these amendments, we plan to continue our review of these changes along with an examination of the Foundation's relationships with the U.S. Fire Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency next year. 
Therefore, I along with my cosponsors, urge the Members of this body to support this bill and allow the U.S. Fire Administration to continue the fine job it has been performing for so many years.

Mr. FRIST. It is a real pleasure for me to take a few moments and reflect on my interpretation of where we are today and the significance of the bill that is before us. 
It was 1938, not that long ago, that Congress passed the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. And at that time the primary mission was defined fairly clearly to be to protect the public health by safeguarding Americans from unsafe and ineffective products. 
Over the past 60 years, the FDA has truly done an excellent job on the whole in fulfilling this mission to make sure that food is safe and wholesome and that drugs and medical devices are safe and effective for treating disabilities and the diseases that have plagued us over the years. 
You can look back and cite numerous, numerous examples that recall the FDA's important role, their vigilance in protecting the American public from unsafe drugs. Think back to Thalidomide. We think back to the FDA's quick response to the Tylenol tampering case as evidence of the effectiveness that that very important Government entity plays that affects each of our lives in ways that many of us do not realize. 
But during this same period of time, the United States has been the most innovative nation in the world, particularly in the arena of medical research. I think back to my dad, who is 86 years of age, who practiced medicine for 55 years. I remember when I was a very young boy traveling with him as he would make house calls, and now to think how much things have changed over that period of time in terms of antibiotics, antiviral agents, vaccines, treatments for diseases that when I was a child were devastating to large populations. You look at hepatitis B, chicken pox, polio, many forms of cancer, the list goes on of what we can treat today. 
We have developed important new surgical procedures. As a surgeon who has been in the medical field for the past 20 years, I have had the real privilege to watch fields unfold that were nonexistent even when I was in medical school. I think of certain types of tissue transplants, lung transplants, which I was doing routinely before coming to the Senate, that 15 years ago were not done at all. 
I think of the new medical device implants like little stents we can now place in the coronary arteries which feed the heart, which were nonexistent 10 years ago; the artificial joints, the hips, the knees. 
Thanks to the new biomedical drugs and products, we have new protocols for treating everything from AIDS, where we demonstrated tremendous success in the last year, to the treatment of other diseases like cystic fibrosis. 
However, in recent decades the FDA, which has never had in writing a clear mission statement to guide its hand, has become too bureaucratic, too top heavy, with excessive regulation. I say this again out of tremendous respect for the FDA, having seen firsthand the tremendous successes of that agency. 
To address this problem the FDA, to its credit, has been very aggressive in undertaking a number of reforms internally that have reduced the regulatory burden on industry and have improved patient access to new therapies. 
However, it is clear that much, much more needs to be done. In the past, medical discoveries typically reached the patient in a relatively short period of time. Again, when my father first started the practice of medicine, it took an average of anywhere from 7 to 8 years for a new drug, a new pharmaceutical agent to pass through the entire discovery and approval process. Now, although in certain areas there has been tremendous improvement, it takes anywhere from 10 to 15 years to go through that discovery process and through that approval or disapproval process. Everybody agrees that is too long. Everybody agrees that you can have the same or improved standards if we streamline, if we coordinate, 
if we modernize the Food and Drug Administration. 
That is what this bill is about, not a lowering of standards, not putting devices or pharmaceutical agents out on the market that have not gone through that eye of the needle of disciplined, very high standards that we all expect of the Food and Drug Administration. 
Unfortunately, up-to-the-minute advances in medical science, advances that are occurring at increasing speed, are not making it to our marketplace as quickly as they should. Many times these advances are going overseas. 
Too often you see that a drug that is in this long pipeline, and we know it is a potential benefit, all of a sudden moves overseas. It moves overseas for trials, for ultimate approval too often. Many times the manufacturing of that drug or of that device also follows it overseas. 
I think the FDA regulatory structure simply has not kept pace with the rapid rate at which scientific discovery is being made. In too many cases, which I personally hear among investigators in the academic community and the private sector, the FDA has become a barrier, a barrier instead of a partner, to innovation and to access to medical therapies. It is that concept of dropping down the barrier and facilitating that partnership with very high standards that this bill achieves. 
I mentioned U.S. biomedical research moving overseas. The implications are significant. It is very hard to put a price tag on this in the short term. But if we drive our very best biomedical science, our very best biomedical research off our shores to other countries, over the long term it is to the detriment of our health care, to our quality of life, and to our economy. Our once almost impenetrable edge in a U.S. dominated market can be lost forever if we do not act responsibly now. 
I find my fellow doctors often travel to Europe to train, to study, to see, not the general foundation of medical knowledge of which we have the best in the world, evident by people from all over the world coming here to study medicine, but for innovative, breakthrough therapies. Too often today the therapies, the technologies, the research is moving overseas, and, therefore, even my colleagues go overseas to learn something that they should be learning right here in this country. 
In the future, as medical science moves away from the contemporary practice of just treating overt symptoms when somebody comes in with a complaint, an organ failure, to a medical field where we begin to fabricate organs, where we do transplants, where we diagnose and treat disease at the molecular level, at the genetic level, playing off the tremendous success we have seen in the human genome project, a project that I might add as an aside is coming in under budget and much quicker than we would have ever anticipated even 6 years ago, the possibilities for new drugs, new devices, new methods of patient treatment are virtually limitless. 
Thus, we need a structure to address these great breakthroughs, this great innovation, that is up to date, that is modernized, that is well organized, that is disciplined, that is coordinated. That is what this bill achieves. With the explosive growth in technology, the FDA needs to better use the considerable genius and talent of non-Government scientists and researchers. 
There is always a great fear when we approach this issue of so-called contracting out because people can paint the picture that only Government people, only Government scientists have the ethics, have the honesty, have the integrity to be able to make decisions, to be able to look at clinical data and say what is best, what is dangerous, what is a benefit to the patient. 
That is just not right. We have many good people in the private sector. In truth, because science is moving so fast and is so complicated, so intricate, it is almost absurd for us to expect that we can hire in the Federal Government all of the research scientists necessary to be able to conduct studies, look at studies, interpret data from the studies. Almost by necessity, because of the speed with which science is developing, we need to 
reach out and access many very, very good experts that are in the private sector. 
One of the greatest complaints against the FDA that I hear is a feeling that the FDA has not been willing to collaborate and partner with others in the private sector, it might be industry, might by academia, it might be the academies, it might be individual scientists. People come in and say, `You know, I sat down with the FDA,' but there is a real feeling of an adversarial relationship rather than a collegial relationship. 
We need to make fundamental changes in this regard at the FDA. We need to build upon the successes in protecting the American public by reenergizing the process. We need to revitalize the process of product approval, speeding approval where appropriate, meeting high standards, improving and enhancing communication between the FDA and the public it serves, nurturing, not stifling, research and innovation. And, yes, we need to draw upon the untapped scientific excellence outside the FDA, at all times remembering that the FDA has the final say as to whether or not to accept the conclusions from that partnering with outside individuals and agencies. 
The bill before us today, S. 830, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization and Accountability Act of 1997, does represent a bipartisan effort, including significant input from the Food and Drug Administration aimed at making the FDA more efficient. The bill was passed out of the Labor Committee on June 18 with a bipartisan vote, again, 14-4. On September 23, the Senate overwhelmingly approved the substitute amendment by Senator Jeffords. 
I want to take this opportunity to commend Senators Jeffords, Coats, Dodd, and Mikulski and my other colleagues on the Labor Committee, Senator Kennedy, all for their tireless efforts and commitment to modernizing the FDA. 
But to the American people I hope we have sent a signal that we can accomplish a very good bill, yes, a first step, but a very good bill in updating an organization, in updating a Federal agency which will affect the lives of every American in a positive way. 
I do urge my colleagues later today to support this bill. But I also ask that we all view this legislation and discussion as an ongoing commitment to improve the agency, not just a one-shot change in the agency, which we will put aside and come look at again in 10 years, but realize this needs to be an ongoing process with continued oversight. 
The Prescription Drug User Fee Act, commonly known as PDUFA, has been commented upon today. It has been one of the great successes in the relationship between the FDA, industry, and the American people. This bill is much more than just a reauthorization of PDUFA. It is also about improving the FDA and fostering, better communication and partnering with the private sector. 
I am a cosponsor of this bill because I believe it is a needed step in the right direction. We need to continue the debate, to look at both short and long-term investment of resources in order to move the agency forward in areas of regulatory research, professional development, collaboration between Government, academia and the private sector. I hope to continue working with my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to further improve FDA in the following years. 
The Senator from Massachusetts was going through a number of the items in the bill and talking about the work on both sides of the aisle in pulling together areas that were contentious initially. I want to thank him formally, and his staff, for working together on what I consider a very important aspect of this bill that has to do with dissemination of scientifically, peer-reviewed medical literature to my colleagues, to people in the health care profession, about the uses of drugs, both on-label and off-label. 
As a physician, I understand the need for this up-to-date sharing of more information than is currently allowed today. Off-label uses have been in the news recently, both in terms of pharmaceuticals, and we have talked a lot about it in terms of devices recently. 
I think it is very confusing to the American people what off-label use of medicines is. In truth, about 90-percent of all cancer therapies are off-label today. So if you have cancer, there is a 90 percent chance you will be receiving off-label medicine. When we say off-label, it doesn't mean the medicines are bad. Sometimes it means those are the most effective, and in cancer therapy, it does mean they are the most effective, up-to-date modern therapy to have if you want your cancer treated. The American Medical Association has estimated between 40 and 60 percent of all prescriptions are for off-label uses, and up around 50 to 60 percent for the pediatric population, which means if your child is sick today medical therapy is likely to be off-label. 
Why? It only makes sense. The FDA can't study every use for every drug in every combination of drug available. It is impossible to do today. 
I want to acknowledge the tremendous work by Senator Mack on this particular provision during the last few years. I have had the opportunity to work with him over the last 2 1/2 years on this specific provision of dissemination of information. I want to thank Senators Dodd, Wyden, and Boxer, and Senator Kennedy for his work in negotiating with us in order to allow the inclusion of this important provision which will be to the benefit of all Americans in S. 830. 
The bill before the Senate today will help meet the need for increased access to scientific and technical expertise that is currently lacking at the FDA. I touched upon this. It is that whole concept of interagency collaboration with Federal agencies and with the private sector. We will see more collaboration with the National Institutes of Health, more collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control, the National Academy of Sciences. 
The bill allows the FDA to contract with outside reviewers and expand its current third-party medical device review pilot program 
which has been very successful to date. Everyone agrees that it has been successful, which in turn will help conserve FDA resources, so that those resources can be used in other areas. Because the FDA always retains the final authority to approve or disapprove new drugs or medical devices reviewed by outside experts, the FDA always has the final authority, and it will not impede nor weaken the FDA's ability to safeguard the public health. To help alleviate the confusion and frustration that many feel today in working with the FDA, the bill codifies evidence requirements for new drug and medical device application submissions, it improves communication between the agency and industry. After almost 60 years, the FDA will be held and made accountable by giving it a specific mission statement and requiring the FDA to develop a plan of action to meet its requirements under law. 
Again, we talk a lot about the specific provisions of the bill. The bill as a whole, once it is passed, will be of benefit to every American, to every consumer, to every patient. Thanks to the bipartisan efforts of Senators Snowe, Feinstein, and Dodd, individuals with serious life-threatening disease will be able to access new clinical trial databases providing expedited access to investigational therapies. 
Imagine yourself being in a situation of having a disease which somebody says is not treatable, it is incurable. Where do you turn today? Nobody knows. There is no central repository, no database for sharing information of where the most up-to-date clinical trials exist. There will be after this bill is passed. 
This bill will also expand the fast-track drug approval process for new drugs intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. It puts a focus right on those conditions that we know people are dying from every day. Let's focus in that particular area, make sure we get potential drugs to market if they are safe, sooner than the 15 years that we are averaging over the last decade from beginning to the initial discovery to final placement on the market. The bill itself will provide access to investigational therapies for patients who have no other alternative but to try an unapproved investigational product. 
Consumers will also benefit from this bill. The Senator from New Hampshire talked earlier this morning about national uniformity. It is critically important. We have not talked much about that in terms of food and drugs over the last several days. The uniformity aspect of over-the-counter drugs, the uniformity there will have a huge impact. Again, touching people in all sorts of ways. It will keep prices down, it will provide the consumer with a unified and consistent information for self-medication. 
Another benefit to consumers, if the health claim information for food, published by the NIH or the CDC, Centers for Disease Control, or other Government, well-respected scientific bodies, will be allowed to appear on food labeling, giving the consumer accurate information, educating the consumer, empowering the consumer when they make their dietary choices. 
In closing, Mr. President, this bill is a good bill that will benefit all Americans now and into the future. Medical science, moving at skyrocketing speed, offers promise of not just longer, but healthier lives, a higher quality of life. In the not-too-distant future, medical science and medical technology will not just thwart the assaults of infectious agents, but will eliminate many of the ailments of modern life. 
The FDA must facilitate, not complicate, that endeavor. We need a new model for a new century. It is time to update the FDA. This bill accomplishes that reform, that modernization. It will give a starting point for a model that will facilitate, not stifle, the medical progress of mankind. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, thank you. 
Mr. President, the issue that we are facing in the next several minutes on which my colleagues will be voting appears very simple on the surface. Why would anybody oppose an amendment that really strikes at the heart of what so much of the FDA is about--that is, a medical label that is maybe false or misleading? 
So, on the surface it seems simple. But it really is not. The larger bill, the underlying bill, is about strengthening the FDA, and making sure that we fulfill that mission to the American people of having products, drugs, and devices that improve health and not huge barriers that push over the great new technological advancements that we see--push them off into the future so that we cannot benefit from the technology that is out there today. 
The amendment is unnecessary. The amendment we are going to be voting on right now is unnecessary, and a little bit worrisome because if it were to pass, there is a possibility that we hurt the system. In other words, we disallow improved devices which can benefit heart disease or lung disease, we put up barriers and push them off into the future. So if the amendment passes, it may be harmful. It clearly is unnecessary today. 
The bottom line is this. The Food and Drug Administration is required to deny premarket approval for a device if the proposed label is false or misleading--current law--and that is why it is unnecessary. 
To really understand the overall process, we talk about 510(k) and PMA, premarket approval. It is really pretty simple. You have a device today that goes through the FDA system that has all sorts of standards that have to be met in terms of safety, efficacy, and false and misleading labels. That device goes through that process, what is called the PMA, premarket approval of the device. Then with technology and science new devices, better devices are developed; for example, a stint in the heart after a heart attack. Over time you improve the stint. That is the great thing about science today. That improved device may be almost exactly like the earlier version of that device. The FDA has to make a decision. Does it go through a process which says they are so similar that there is no reason to make it go through all the other standards or is it different enough it has to go through all the initial requirements and jump through the hoops and standards, and the FDA has to make that decision. Premarket approval initially, an improvement on that device or a new device, is it similar enough. Now, the words are used, is it substantially equivalent to the initial device itself. FDA has to make that decision. 
What we really have not talked very much about is how they make that decision. It is written in the current law. We do not do anything about current law today, whether or not this new version is `substantially equivalent.' Those are the words. 
What is the requirement? What is the current law? They are substantially equivalent if, No. 1, the new device has the same intended use as the earlier device and--and--it has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device. 
Now, that is a pretty good standard because the idea is, if you get a little stint that you put in the heart and it is improved, it works better, same principles, technologically equivalent, same intended use, then you go through this process of the 510(k). 
Now, the amendment we are going to be voting on says we have to put it back again through the false or misleading label requirement. Remember, this improved device going through this process has already met the criteria of false and misleading labeling when it was in the PMA, the initial approval. That is very important to understand because we all are against anything in terms of labeling that is false or misleading. It is very important to understand the process. 
So what we are debating right now is not whether a label is false or misleading but whether the FDA will have the ability to compel a manufacturer to produce clinical data to prove safety and efficacy for uses that are not included on the label. This brings me to the worrisome part of this amendment. Again, I am very comfortable that the FDA has standards today to make sure that the labeling is honest, is truthful. The worrisome thing is about just what if the FDA came in and said that this device, which is medically equivalent to an earlier device, technologically improved but the equivalent device, what if the FDA says, `No, let's make people go back and jump through all the initial hoops once again.' 
We already know for a device that we are not meeting device approval or disapproval over the time required in statutes. Already it takes months and years to go through the approval 
process. So with every improvement, when it is substantially equivalent to the earlier device, if we take all those improvements, make them meet all these new criteria again, what are we going to do? We are going to push off the great advancements today to save lives, to improve the quality of life to some time in the future where we and maybe even our children cannot benefit from that device. 
Now, a key question that I think we all have is, if a device is determined by the FDA to be safe and effective for the labeled use, should the FDA--for the labeled use that has been approved --should the FDA be able to force a manufacturer to produce a clinical device that is safe and effective for other uses, other uses. Remember, it is approved for what is on the label. I would answer no. We do not do that for pharmaceuticals today. We do not do it for drugs today. Should we do it for devices? I say no. 
My real fear is that when the FDA reaches outside of the proposed labeling, it is going to require a very subjective decision in determining what goes through those initial PMA, premarket criteria. 
Finally, let me also step back and look at the enforcement procedures that the FDA already has. My colleagues make it sound as if the FDA is unable to protect the public health by keeping unsafe products off the market. In fact, the FDA today has the enforcement authority which allows the agency to remove devices that endanger public health from use and availability immediately, even if the device is on the market and the manufacturer's intended use for a device changes over time. 
Any device which the FDA has, and I quote, `a reason to believe is misbranded or adulterated in any way' can be detained today under law. FDA has a long list of remedies to protect consumers against persons who violate device laws including criminal prosecution, injunctions, civil seizures, and civil penalties. 
Claims were made earlier by some of my colleagues that manufacturers will market and advertise for uses other than those approved by the FDA. That is illegal today. 
Under the proposed bill--not the amendment, the underlying proposed bill--it is illegal. Again, let me say claims have been made over the course of the morning by some of my colleagues that manufacturers will market and advertise for uses other than those approved by the FDA. That is illegal. The Reed amendment does not change the fact that manufacturers cannot do this today, and it does not change the fact that the FDA has enforcement authority today. 
With that, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Again, I think it is unnecessary and worrisome in the sense that it would raise the barriers sufficiently in an unnecessary way for approval of devices that are substantially equivalent to devices that already have jumped through the hoops. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 9 minutes. 
Mr. President, I rise today to respond to my colleague from Iowa with regard to an amendment to the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] reform bill, to establish a new national center for complementary and alternative medicine at the National Institutes of Health [NIH]. 
Again, remember the debate today and the past several days, and maybe through tomorrow, is on the FDA. Yet, we have introduced an amendment on another agency--the NIH. I oppose the offering of this proposal as an amendment to the FDA bill for that very reason. 
Comments have been made earlier about the importance of complementary and alternative medicine to the public and to this country, the importance of science, and the importance of peer review--all of which I support. I have been in the field of medicine, in a broad sense, for the last 20 years. I have been involved in many medical fields, including a great part of which has been designated as alternative therapies--at least initially, because when I first started doing lung transplants, very few had been done in the history of this country before. Therefore, I, as a scientist, a medical professional, and a U.S. Senator, do feel that alternative medicine and complementary medicine is vitally important to the health and the well-being of Americans and people throughout the world. 
What I do oppose, however, is dealing with this issue of elevating an office to the level of a center when most of our colleagues do not even know what a center in the NIH really means. What are the responsibilities of a center? What are the authorities? What is the difference between an office and a center and an institute? As I talk to my colleagues, they do not know. Why? Because we have not addressed the issue in the appropriate environment--that is, through the committee structure. 
I am the chairman of the Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, which oversees the reauthorization of the NIH. We are, right now, looking at the reauthorization of the NIH. We have held two hearings in the past examining how you set biomedical and medical research priorities. It is a process where we have people come in and testify, and we 
discuss and debate back and forth. This amendment, as proposed by the Senator from Iowa, has not been taken through that process. It is being brought to the floor on a bill that does not have anything to do with the NIH, but rather the FDA bill. Therefore, I do believe it is not germane. 
I believe we should not be placing NIH authorizing legislation on an FDA bill. Rather, the more appropriate process would be to take it through the committee structure. I should also add, for the benefit of my colleagues, most of whom have not addressed this issue at all because it has not been through the committee process, that no legislative bill to establish a center of alternative medicine has been introduced into the Senate. Therefore, a bill has not been referred to the appropriate committee, it has not been vetted, it has not had hearings. There has been no formal debate. This would create a huge center within the NIH without that debate. Therefore, I object to bypassing this process, again, with a tremendous amount of respect for alternative medicine. 
My colleague from Iowa is a senior member of the subcommittee, and he and I have had the discussion that we do need to look at the appropriate role for alternative medicine at the NIH. We have scheduled a hearing in early October. It has been mentioned on the floor of the Senate that one of the panels should address the issue of alternative medicine. 
We have a 4-year history with the Office of Alternative Medicine. Let's debate and look at the results of that history. Let's see the results of peer review and see what advances have been made. 
The issue of whether to elevate an office to a center--again, as I talked to my colleagues over the last few weeks about taking an office at the NIH and elevating it to a center--is one that I think we need to discuss, but not today on the FDA bill, not over the course of a few minutes, but look at it through the appropriate hearing process. What does it mean to elevate an office to center status? What is a center at the NIH? I hope my colleagues ask themselves right now, do I really know what a center at the NIH is? Most will say no. The role of the current Office of Alternative Medicine, the office--as outlined by the Senator from Iowa, my colleague, who basically defined what the office is --is to coordinate and foster the conduct and support of alternative medicine research at the NIH. Right now, the office provides a central focus for a research area that is germane to all NIH components. In other words, the office can work with all the various institutes. 
I understand that the majority of complementary and alternative research is performed and supported by those 24 centers and institutes and divisions within the NIH, and it is integrated within the scientific research portfolio of each of those institutes. My colleague is arguing--and he may be right, and that is why we need to discuss it--that we must consider alternative medicine being a center in and of itself. But that would mean that the scientists and researchers who are responsible for broad areas of science may not have the opportunity to integrate alternative medicine into their respective research portfolios as they do today. It needs to be discussed. It needs to be debated in the appropriate forum. 
I recognize that the Senator from Iowa has concerns about whether the current approach is working or not. Again, I look forward, through our reauthorizing committee, to the Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, on which he serves, to address this very issue. 
I do know that when you elevate an entity like an office to an institute or to center status, the scientific potential of the field should be sufficiently demonstrated so that the new institute or center can support a thriving intramural and extramural program. Are we at that point today? I do not know. I daresay that most of my colleagues have not studied this specific issue yet. 
I will have to say that as I have reached out to people, many others in the scientific community have raised concerns about establishing a new center at the NIH. Let me read to you a portion of a letter sent to me from the Association of the American Medical Colleges expressing their concerns: 
This is the AAMC, Association of the American Medical Colleges:  
Any change in the organizational structure of the NIH of this magnitude raises significant scientific and administrative questions. . . . 
Further, the AAMC believes all members of the research community should have the opportunity to address these issues in a full and public manner during a hearing conducted by the subcommittee.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, raising the Office of Alternative Medicine to a center at NIH greatly increases its statutory authority. Has the field of alternative medicine demonstrated that track record to date? Again, let's review these issues in the committee process. The Office of Alternative Medicine today clearly does not have the organizational structure or the necessary budget to support this proposal--creating a national center for complementary and alternative medicine would require setting up a whole new administrative structure and a whole new research infrastructure to support this activity. 
Are we ready for that today? Possibly. 
Let's ask the scientists around the country. Let's have alternative medicine researchers come forward and testify. Let's ask the National Institutes of Health. Before we go out and create another center, which again is a new entity, we need to look at the proposal about its administration, and about how it will be paid for. 
Again, the watchwords today are `consolidation and coordination,' not proliferation. 
Mr. President, I would like to reserve the remaining minute of my time.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in closing, to go right to the heart of the matter, to increase and elevate the alternative medicine from an office to a center needs to be addressed, but not in this forum. To establish a center means you give it grantmaking authority, establish an advisory council, and you instruct the center to study the integration of alternative medicine, establish a new data system, establish research centers, all of which is something that is not just moving toward peer review. 
We will address it in the future--hopefully actually in a panel 2 or 3 weeks from now, in early October.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the nomination for the position of U.S. Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health to be made by the President of the United States today, which will be sent to Congress today for consideration. 
Nearly 4 months ago, I, the only physician in the U.S. Senate, publicly called for the immediate nomination of a Surgeon General--specifically, one who could rise above partisanship, rise above the political fray to be a reasoned and nonpartisan spokesman for public health. The reason was very simple, and I outlined it at that time, and that is that the position of Surgeon General is one of recognition--a recognized authority not just in this country, but throughout the world. Second, it is a leadership position, leadership that can offer a clear, concise, consistent message. Third, I briefly made a point at that time of the advantages of actually merging into this position of Surgeon General that position of Assistant Secretary for Health. 
For the past year, I have served as chairman of the Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety within the Senate Labor Committee. This particular subcommittee oversees the statutory jurisdiction of the Public Health Service. The Surgeon General oversees the administration of the eight agencies of the Public Health Service, and the Surgeon General serves as the public's doctor, the Nation's doctor, the Nation's physician, in advising the Secretary of Health and Human Services. It is in this role that I feel even more strongly that we need a Surgeon General to provide that clear, that loud, that visible, that understandable voice to promote the health and the safety of our citizens. 
Like most Americans of my generation, I vividly remember that very famous, well-known--and it's actually referred back to a lot today--Surgeon General's report back in 1964 warning of the dangers of cigarettes. Well, over 30 years ago now, we still point back to that single instance, that label, that stepping forth as a benchmark in warning our children today, and others, about the dangers of smoking. 
In the 1980's, Dr. C. Everett Koop woke America up to something that at that time was terribly misunderstood, and that was the emerging AIDS crisis. He spoke with candor and realism that helped the American people, helped people who saw him on television, who saw him in person, who read his writings, separate fact from fiction about what at that time was a very mystical, misunderstood disease. 
Just last summer, the Surgeon General's office issued a significant report demonstrating that moderate physical activity does indeed reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and some cancers. All of these reports were issued with no political agenda in mind--only the well-intentioned health of the Nation being the focus. We inevitably still face lingering public health problems, and we can only think about and imagine the new public health challenges that will face us--the current challenges of AIDS, emerging infectious diseases--and, again, who knows 3 years from now what new virus, bacteria, or resistance to bacteria will be a threat to each of our children? There are issues like foodborne illnesses, substance abuse, tobacco use by children, alcoholism. 
We need to use the same approach today that we have used in the past. To do so, I think it can be best accomplished by having a high-profile, experienced official who speaks with authority and can educate all of us, the public, about the important link between illness and personal behavior. Past experience shows that the uniformed position of the U.S. Surgeon General, with the right person in that position, can educate the Nation on these key public health issues. During Surgeon General Koop's tenure, by educating the public on the dangers of smoking, adult tobacco use decreased 7 percent. More recently, we have witnessed, unfortunately, increased drug and tobacco usage among our youth over the past years. Is it coincidental that during this same period the Surgeon General position has been vacant? 
I think we as legislators, as trustees of the public, in many ways have an obligation, a responsibility, to appoint a Surgeon General and to do it as expeditiously as possible, so that we can direct our attention to improving the public health. 
Now, clearly, tough problems, whether it is smoking or alcoholism or foodborne illnesses, a Surgeon General is not going to be able to fix them alone. But what he or she can do is be that one voice. We all know how important it is to have a simple message, a straightforward message, a concise message, a persistent message given by one voice--that voice being the Surgeon General. 
Dr. Koop I think summarized the position very well. He said that the Surgeon General is a position `* * * high calling with an obligation to interpret health and medical facts for the public.' 
I like the way Dr. Koop expressed it because, first of all, that is a calling, and in many ways public service can be a thankless job. So it really is a calling. But the obligation is one that the nominees must take very seriously; and, that is to interpret the health and medical facts for the public. We know that there is a tremendous amount written today, with the health advances, with the new discoveries. We just simply need to look at the new genes being discovered today, the human gene projects. But when a person looks at the medical literature, how can they interpret it? The Surgeon General can look at the reports, can assimilate the data, and help boil that down into a simple, crystal-clear message which can improve and affect the health of every American. 
Dr. David Satcher today is being forwarded to the Senate as the nominee for the position of U.S. Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health. It will arrive in Congress today. 
As a result, the Senate is asked to consider this nomination and to eventually vote as to whether or not to confirm Dr. Satcher for these positions. I hope that my colleagues will consider this nomination based on his qualifications and his ability--again, pushing partisanship and politics aside. 
Dr. Satcher is a family physician. He is an accomplished researcher and educator, and he has a very long truly distinguished record in promoting public health. I understand his goal is to improve the health of our Nation based on science, which is the essential role of the Surgeon General's office. 
The confirmation process is, as all of us in this body have seen, a fascinating one as we subject our nominees to interrogation. But it is critical that we interrogate in the right way--touch on the right issues, looking at the substance. It is very clear that we will not--and I as a physician very likely will not--agree with Dr. Satcher on every particular issue and every particular policy. But what I am confident of, in knowing Dr. Satcher, is that debate, that discussion, will be based on rigorous and disciplined science--not on politics, and not on rhetoric. That is what this position deserves, and that is what the American people deserve. 
Looking out for this Nation's public health, both domestically and abroad, is truly a daunting role. Simply the way I define it is that is the public spokesperson for health for the United States of America. But I am confident that Dr. Satcher will reclaim the integrity surrounding that position that has historically been associated with that position of Surgeon General. 
The sort of questions that we need to look at as Dr. Satcher goes through the Senate confirmation process are things like: Does this man have the commitment? Does he have the intelligence? Does he have the training, the honesty, and integrity to be the chief spokesperson for Americans on matters concerning public health? And I also would like to add--in no small part because I know Dr. Satcher is so strong here--it is critical that this person be able to articulate his views with clarity, with simplicity, and with dignity. 
We have before us a man with a long record of demonstrated public service. He currently serves as Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. In that role over the last several years he has demonstrated those very qualities that I mentioned are important in this confirmation process. He has been a strong manager. He has been an excellent spokesperson for public health. He has been a man of scientific integrity. 
As a member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, I am committed to the confirmation process and take very seriously the responsibility of voting on this nominee. I approach this with a very open mind and will continue to scrutinize everything that comes before the committee as information is being made available to the committee by the administration. 
I have the one advantage, in that Dr. Satcher spent approximately 11 years in Nashville, TN, where I am from. I have been able to witness firsthand his accomplishments, and have had a chance to go back and look at many of his other distinguished qualifications. 
I look forward to hearing his articulation of his goals, his statements, and the testimonials of others about him as we go through this confirmation process. This is a public process. It should be a public process. 
I look forward to meeting with Dr. Satcher personally next week to discuss with him the specifics of his plans as the next Surgeon General. 
As I mentioned, Dr. Satcher lived in Nashville. I consider him a Tennessean from my hometown for about 11 years where he ran a very prominent historically black medical college--the Meharry Medical School. 
Dr. Satcher has a knowledge of population-based medicine, epidemiology, family practice, and a broad understanding of our health care system. He is widely respected by his peers in our community of Tennessee, in Nashville, and across this country.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, if I just look at these letters from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Dr. Harry Jacobson in one sentence describes very well what his peers feel about Dr. Satcher. 
I quote from that letter.  
We believe Dr. Satcher is well qualified to fill these two positions where his medical knowledge, executive experience, and very real eloquence on behalf of the Nation's health make him uniquely suited. 
From the Tennessee Medical Association, talking about his tenure at Meharry--remember, he was there for 11 years--Dr. Benton Adkins, who is President of the Tennessee Medical Association, writes: 
During his tenure at Meharry, he presented a strong voice in the Nashville community as a public health advocate. I am especially pleased to commend him to you for consideration in light of his stellar leadership, unparalleled history of community service, and sense of mission in the public health sector. 
In the third letter, Mr. Samuel Howard, chairman of Phoenix Healthcare Corp., who had known him well through working together at Meharry, says: 
Dr. Satcher is a physician-scholar with a strong public health focus. 
Those are just samplings of the sort of recommendations by his associates. 
I urge my colleagues to focus on Dr. David Satcher's qualifications to hold the two positions of U.S. Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health. As I mentioned, he is a family physician. He respects the role of the family within the community. He is an accomplished scientist and researcher. He has a Ph.D. as well as a medical degree. His Ph.D. is in cytogenetics--he allows science to drive decisionmaking, not politics. He is a proven public health leader--an experienced public health leader--having served as Director, where he currently serves, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA, which is that Health and Human Service agency responsible for promoting health and preventing disease, injury, and premature death, with 11 major branches and worldwide responsibilities. 
Mr. President, in closing, as a physician, I will have to say that ultimately much of my feeling comes back to putting faith in the trust, which is a very vital part of the doctor-patient relationship. I look at this very similarly. The Surgeon General is the people's doctor. And, to be truly effective, Dr. Satcher must earn and maintain the public's trust on health issues. Trust I think will be a large part of this nomination. It was the main reason, if we look at failures, I think that occurred in the past as related to this position. 
From everything that I know of Dr. Satcher, he not only has the ability to be a reasoned scientific voice but he has the ability to win the trust of the American people. 
I am fortunate to have known Dr. Satcher in his capacity as physician, as a president of a medical school, and as the head of one of our great public health agencies. 
I will work with my colleagues in the U.S. Senate in this nomination process, and I urge their full, fair, and expeditious consideration of Dr. Satcher's nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I am in wholehearted agreement with the intent of the amendment before us, and I commend my colleague from Iowa for his sincere attempt to address the crucial issue of youth smoking. However, I remain unconvinced that FDA control and management of a youth antismoking initiative will solve the problem. Let me be very clear, I support a Federal role in restricting teen smoking and in funding a youth antismoking initiative. However, a cursory review of our Nation's history shows that the States have the primary jurisdiction over enforcement over youth smoking laws, just as they do with laws relating to underage consumption of alcohol. 
In the aftermath of the tobacco settlement negotiations, our Nation's attention is focused, as never before, on the problem of teen smoking. We have an unprecedented bipartisan commitment to addressing this problem at all levels of government. Currently, seven committees in the Senate alone are tackling the complex issues raised by the settlement. In my opinion, we do the children of America is disservice by thinking we absolve ourselves of responsibility by simply delegating this job to Federal bureaucrats. We have a golden opportunity to put these financial resources to work, and bring about long-overdue solutions. I am not a politician by trade or training, and I find that sometimes that works to my advantage. I haven't been in Washington long enough to lose my appreciation for the truism that the best solutions are often found at home. 
Let's talk about some of the initiatives the Federal Government is already funding to prevent youth smoking. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has an Office on Smoking and Health [OSH] which conducts scientific research, communicates health information to the public, and coordinates action with other Federal agencies, State health departments, and other organizations. Their programs include the Smoke Free Kids & Soccer campaign, which collaborates with the U.S. women's national soccer team to promote smoke-free lifestyles among teenage girls. The OSH budget is $21.4 million. 
At the National Institutes of Health, the National Cancer Institute funds the American Stop Smoking Intervention Study research program in collaboration with the American Cancer Society and State and local health departments and other organizations to develop comprehensive tobacco control programs in 17 States. NCI also administers investigator initiated research projects in smoking cessation and education, funded at $94.9 million. The National Institute of Drug Abuse funds research on smoking and nicotine dependency. 
The Health Resources and Services Administration provides funding for antismoking education through its health professions education and nurse training programs. The Maternal and Child Health Block Grant funds health services to mothers and children, including antismoking education. 
And let us not forget, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration provides discretionary funding for community-based demonstration projects for the prevention and early intervention of alcohol and drug abuse, including tobacco use. Also, SAMHSA is already implementing the Synar amendment, which requires States to enforce laws prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to individuals under age 18. States must conduct random unannounced inspections of retail outlets, and develop a strategy for achieving an inspection failure rate of less than 20 percent. States that don't comply with these requirements may lose their block grants funds, and I would like to point out that these funds may not now be used for enforcement activities. 
Now, Madam President, I've named a few Federal antismoking efforts, but there are actually over 17, in different departments and agencies. The settlement which has been negotiated between industry, plaintiffs, the attorneys general, and the public health community has been referred to no fewer than seven Senate committees. I think it's time for a little common sense. The FDA, while they have done many wonderful things, have too often demonstrated a tendency to rely on centralized, heavyhanded bureaucracy rather than practical solutions. Let's proceed with hearings in the Senate, and let's examine the best possible avenues for administration of these funds. Most of all, let us not lose sight of the goal of our public health efforts. 
The issue is reducing teen consumption of cigarette smoke. At every level of government, local, State, and Federal, and in every part of our communities, we must commit to do this ourselves. We cannot simply look the other way when a child with a cigarette walks by. Convenience store owners cannot ignore the law, and profit from our children's poor decisions, and legislators cannot allow campaign finances to cloud their judgment on this issue. 
We know that one very effective tool is a consistently enforced requirement that retail outlets care young people. This is primarily a task for local law enforcement. Any Federal agency that Congress authorizes to police retail outlets will in the final analysis turn to local agencies to conduct the compliance checks. As we seek to partner with governments at home, we can and should build in Federal compliance standard for States who refuse to cooperate. Together, we can put some teeth into the laxly enforced statutes already on the books. 
Let me add that I think we should have some concern for what could happen if we stray too far from the obvious connection between personal responsibility and health. Personal responsibility is the key to good health. As a physician, I urged everyone of my patients and my constituents to stop smoking if they had started, and more importantly not to start. There is a clear link between smoking and many types of cancer and other diseases. As a heart and lung transplant surgeon, I have seen firsthand the harmful effects of smoking. I have held tar-laden lungs in my hand and removed malfunctioning hearts from failing bodies. As the father of three sons, whom I relentlessly urge not to smoke, I agree with columnist James Glassman that `Kids shouldn't smoke; parents, taxes, and laws should deter them.' But before we entrust $29 million of taxpayers hard-earned money to the Food and Drug Administration, let's make sure that this is the wisest use of our resources.

Mr. FRIST. I rise to commend my colleagues, Senators Wellstone and McCain, for their excellent leadership on this issue and their commitment to improving the lives of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. 
I would like to recognize at this time the important efforts of all of the advocacy groups who have done such a wonderful job in educating people broadly, increasing the awareness about the devastation of this disease, and the continued need for research, and to the causes and to the treatments and to the eventual cure of Parkinson's disease. It is in large part due to these efforts, this broad effort at the grassroots level across this country that there has been increased focus on Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's research at the National Institutes of Health. 
I want to reiterate and support the words of my colleague from Indiana who has expressed some concern with regard to the process of how these decisions are made and are brought forward, and thus our amendment which he has put forward. As chair of the subcommittee on public health and safety that has jurisdiction over the majority of the public health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, I must state today, because I believe we should not be placing authorizing legislation on an appropriations bill but should rather be considering this particular bill within the overall NIH reauthorization process. 
I, along with my fellow committee members, Senators Jeffords and Coats, have discussed at length the critical role our public health agencies play in improving the health and well being of American citizens. We have a strong commitment to push forward authorization legislation for each of the National Institutes of Health's vital programs, but we have to do this in a systematic way through a coherent process, one in which we would be able to give thoughtful review and comparative review to the programs that we establish. 
Thus, although I am very supportive of increasing funding in support for Parkinson's research, my preference very clearly would have been to work with my colleague and to include this bill within our overall NIH reauthorization bill that would address the various concerns. 
I also want to reiterate what my colleague from Indiana has said, that we have to be very careful because once again we are falling into this risky area of establishing a precedent that once again we take a disease either of the week or of the month or of the year or in reflection or in response to a very strong advocacy group and react to that individual disease without consideration of this larger process. 
Every week people come to my office with multiple voices requesting more funds to be allocated to research in a variety of diseases. It might be heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease or pancreatic disease or neurological research. Again, each comes forward making a very strong case. As a physician, and as one who is empathetic and who has treated many of these diseases, my initial response is to say we should increase funding, and if we do increase funding we will find a cure, better treatment or relieve suffering. 
The problem is that is exactly the way the system works today. I am concerned that if we continue to appropriate as we are today, disease by disease, we are sending an inaccurate or wrong message to our patient groups. Therefore, we come in today with this amendment, to have a comprehensive study of talking, of discussing exactly how these decisions of prioritization, of research, should be made. 
As a physician and as a researcher, I understand the many, many complex factors that must be considered in determining the priorities for research and the enormous difficulty that exists in making decisions of heart disease versus lung disease versus renal disease versus pancreatic disease versus Parkinson's disease. Indeed, each of us in this Chamber, if you came and asked us, would have different priorities based on our own personal circumstances, who we know who has come to see us, who in our family has suffered from a particular disease, and then we are asked to turn around and vote on particular pieces of legislation to be supported by the available research dollars. 
My fellow members of the Senate Labor Committee and I have discussed the issue of the priority-setting process within the NIH in two hearings, one on May 1 and the other on July 24. In those hearings we engaged the various committee members in the dialog about the process at the National Institutes of Health regarding funding allocation decisions and what should be the appropriate congressional role in directing Federal biomedical research dollars. Our committee members have expressed concern, as again so well articulated by the Senator from Indiana, that Congress should take caution in micromanaging biomedical research by establishing legislative mandates for specific areas of research without a thorough comparative review of other diseases, of other interests. 
We have to be honest with ourselves that there is genuine disagreement among various constituencies about how NIH funds should be distributed among the various institutes and agencies at the NIH. Indeed, there has been much discussion over the need for increased Parkinson's research, and I recognize that disputes have taken place regarding over what the exact amount of research dollars currently spent on Parkinson's disease should be. 
As legislators, we have a responsibility, an obligation to the American people to assess the overall strategy, the overall system, the overall process of prioritizing our research dollars. We must do that to ensure the public trust in the decisionmaking process as the NIH addresses the health needs of the Nation. 
However, we must ensure that we are funding the best scientific opportunities through the appropriate process. I believe we all have the same goal, to use our resources in the very best way possible to reduce the burden of illness and human suffering. Our challenge is to figure out the system, the process, the path for best achieving that goal. I believe the best way to answer these questions is to ensure that the process at the NIH is working, that the public has a vote in that process. 
The amendment we are offering today supports a study to be undertaken by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science to conduct a comprehensive independent study of the policies and the processes used by the NIH to determine how they allocate funds for biomedical research. The study will look at those factors or criteria that are used to determine funding allocations for disease research, the process by which these research funding decisions are made, the mechanisms for public input into the priority-setting process, to make sure we hear from the public, and lastly, the impact of the statutory directives on research funding decisions. 
The report of the study will set forth the findings and the recommendations and the conclusions of the Institute of Medicine for improvements in this process, and the Institute of Medicine will submit the report to both the Senate and the House authorizing committee and Appropriations Committees within 6 months. 
I believe this is the best way to address this challenge of prioritizing research. It is my goal that we ensure that the process and the policies at the NIH appropriately address funding allocation and research decisions. The scientific community is equipped to help set the Nation's research priorities. 
In conclusion, I again want to state my preference on the underlying amendment would have been to work with my colleagues in the Senate within the overall NIH reauthorization process to resolve the various issues rather than legislating on the appropriations bill today. However, I do support the underlying bill to support the increase in Parkinson's research, and I urge my colleagues to support our amendment to initiate this comprehensive independent study of NIH policies and processes for making funding decisions in the future. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today represents an enormous accomplishment for me and for the Republican Party. The budget agreement now before us is the culmination of years of hard work and concerted effort. I want to especially commend Chairmen Domenici and Roth for their hard work and diligence. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with Chairman Domenici on the Senate Budget Committee and commend him for his extraordinary efforts to broker this agreement. My staff affectionately calls him `the legislative warrior' and I agree. He has fought a major battle for the Republican Party and the American people this year--a battle to balance our Federal budget and to eliminate our Federal deficit. 
Three years ago, as I campaigned across the State of Tennessee, I listened to the concerns of the people that I met and I made some promises to them. These men and women were concerned about the amount of money they were able to bring home after Uncle Sam had taken his share. They were outraged by a government that was unable to live within its means. They were worried about their retirement and the continued existence of Medicare and Social Security. 
I promised the people of Tennessee that we would do something about these concerns. I promised them that we would give them tax relief, so that they would be able to keep more of what they make and decide for themselves how to spend, save, or invest their hard-earned money. I promised them that we would pass a balanced budget--the first since 1969--and eliminate our Federal deficit. And I promised them that we would protect, preserve, and strengthen Medicare and Social Security to ensure that these programs would still be around for their children and their children's children. 
I am proud to be able to return to Tennessee and tell my friends, relatives, and neighbors that we have made good on two of these promises and have taken the first steps toward fulfilling the third. The bills that we will pass over the next couple of days will give hard-working Americans the largest tax cut that they have seen in 16 years--over $90 billion. This tax relief will benefit Americans of all ages and in all tax brackets. We have included tax credits for children and for education and capital gains and estate relief. Almost 80 percent of these benefits go to families earning less than $75,000 a year. 
Over 43 million parents will owe $500 per child less in taxes. Taxpaying students and nearly 5 million parents of kids in college will owe $1,500 less per student in taxes as a result of the college tuition credit. 
Last year, 2.4 million Tennesseans filed tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service. Over the last 16 years, these taxpayers have not seen one tax reduction--only increases. As the cost of raising a family and sending kids to college has become increasingly expensive, the value 
of the personal exemption has dropped dramatically. In 1948, the average American family paid about 3 percent of its total income to the Federal Government in taxes. Today, that family is paying closer to 25 percent. 
The Federal Government claims approximately 19 percent of every paycheck that an employee in Knoxville, TN who makes $22,000 a year takes home. That $22,000 figure doesn't mean much to her--she sees only $17,820--and that's before State and local taxes take their bite. The time has certainly come to give these hard-working people some much-needed tax relief. 
In addition to the $500 per child tax credit and the $1,500 college tuition tax credit, the tax package will cut the capital gains tax rate from 28 to 20 percent for the highest bracket and from 15 to 10 for the lowest. It will raise the exemption for taxable estates and family-owned businesses and farms. And it will expand the options for individual retirement accounts. 
Despite the belief that a capital gains tax cut is only for the rich, in 1995, more than 226,000 Tennesseans paid capital gains taxes to the tune of $2.65 million. More than half of these--160,786 to be exact--had incomes of $75,000 or less. And 40,000 of those who paid tax on capital gains actually had an income of less than $15,000. 
This budget package will also balance the budget by 2002 and restore fiscal responsibility to our Federal Government. For years, Republicans have called for a balanced budget and an end to the reckless spending for which Washington to famous--or rather infamous. A balanced budget will lower interest rates, and generate higher economic growth--including more jobs and lower inflation. An article in this week's Washington Post touted that the `Deficit Effort Really is `a Big Deal'.' Benjamin Friedman, a Harvard University economist, noted: 
For every dollar that the government doesn't have to borrow, there's an extra 50 cents invested in new plant and equipment by American businesses. And experience shows that investment eventually raises profits, wages and the U.S. standard of living. 
The challenge before us now is to keep the Federal budget in balance--and I am committed to ensuring that we do that. 
The third promise was one to protect Medicare and Social Security. We have made a first step toward strengthening Medicare by cutting $115 billion to health care providers and extending the life of the Medicare trust fund for 10 years. But I remain deeply disappointed that the Senate-passed provisions that would have enacted structural changes in the Medicare Program were excluded from this conference agreement. I have spoken many times about the need for entitlement reform. And unfortunately, this budget does nothing to address it. If we do nothing, entitlement spending and interest on the national debt will consume all Federal revenues by 2012--leaving not a single dollar for important Government priorities like roads, education, national defense, and medical research. 
The Medicare trust fund will become insolvent in 10 years. Real, structural reforms are absolutely necessary to preserve Medicare for our children and our children's children. In 2010, the cash flow of the Social Security trust fund turns negative and by 2029, the Social Security trust fund will be bankrupt. This must be the next priority of the U.S. Senate. 
For years, our focus has been to balance the budget. Today, we have achieved that goal. I join with my colleagues to congratulate the Congress and the White House on working together, in a bipartisan fashion, to bring real fiscal responsibility back to Washington. 
But we must look ahead to tomorrow and pay close attention to the impending fiscal disaster that lies ahead if we do not make some hard choices to reform our entitlement spending. Today, 200,000 Americans turn 65 every year. By 2011, 1.5 million Americans will turn 65 every year. Today, 3.3 workers pay for the benefits that every retiree receives from Medicare and Social Security. By 2025, there will be only two workers to pay for each beneficiary. It is clear that something must be done. 
Mr. President, I am delighted that we have made a considerable downpayment on our promises to the American people with this budget package and I look forward to the challenges ahead.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to address a critical issue that we, as a nation, must face--the fear of discrimination in health insurance practices based on our increasing ability to gather genetic information about ourselves and our families. 
The tremendous advances in genetics research spawned by the Human Genome project are opening the door to a greater understanding of the underlying causes of human disease. The revolution in genetics is giving hope to millions of Americans that we will see eventual treatments, and ultimately cures, for some of the most devastating genetic diseases. Yet, our ability to predict what diseases individuals may be at risk for in the future has caused great concern that this powerful information--the information we all carry in our genes--may be used against us. 
I am deeply troubled when I hear from the Tennessee Breast Cancer Coalition that genetic counselors are facing women every day who are afraid of the consequences of genetic testing. Women are avoiding genetic testing due to concerns about loss of health insurance coverage for themselves or their families--even though a genetic test might reveal that a woman is not at high risk and therefore allow her to make more informed health care choices. 
As a physician and researcher, I am particularly concerned that the fear of discrimination will prevent individuals from participating in research studies or taking advantage of new genetic technologies to improve their medical care. 
Scientific advances hold the promise of higher quality medical care, yet only Federal legislation can reassure the public that learning this information is safe. I was encouraged by President Clinton's recent press conference on genetic discrimination, July 14, 1997 which assisted in elevating this issue to the public's attention. While I am currently not a cosponsor of any specific legislative proposal, I am committed to developing a bipartisan legislative solution. I look forward to working with Senator Jeffords and my fellow colleagues on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee--as well as Senators Mack, Snowe, Domenici, and the many other Members who have been dedicated to this issue. 
In my role as chairman of the Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, I strongly support the intent of legislation which would prohibit discrimination in health insurance against healthy individuals and their families based on their genetic information. We all carry genetic mutations that may place us at risk for future disease--therefore we are all at risk for discrimination. If I receive a genetic test which shows I am at risk for cancer, diabetes, or heart disease, should this predictive information be used against me or my family? Particularly when I am currently healthy and, in fact, may never develop the illness? I think the American public has answered quite clearly, `no.' 
As a physician I believe in preventive medicine to avert illness for patients. Similarly, as a policymaker, I believe in `preventive legislation' in this case--to avert widespread discrimination by stepping in now--before genetic information is used in certain health insurance practices and before genetic technologies are used in routine medical practice. 
Finally, I believe that, in order to fully address genetic discrimination, we must tackle comprehensive legislation on the confidentiality of medical records--legislation that encompasses all of our health information. We must examine who should have access to sensitive health information and to whom it should be disclosed. As this important debate continues in the 105th Congress, I am committed to ensuring that we craft legislation that protects patient confidentiality, fosters medical research, and maintains a dynamic health care system. 
Only with these measures can we ensure that knowledge about our genetic heritage will be used to improve our health--and not force us to hide in fear that this information will cause us harm. 
I encourage my Senate colleagues to join me in examining these issues and moving forward in the coming months on these critical pieces of legislation.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to reaffirm my support for the 1998-1999 Reauthorization of the Earthquake Hazard Reduction Act of 1977. 
I think we can all agree that the goal of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program is a prime example of the proper role for government. In this bill we are calling for continued effort in the areas of public education, fundamental earth science research, development of better materials and building practices, and other activities that reduce the risk to life and property. 
This bill contains a provision that builds upon the national seismic network, improving its capability and forming the basis for a real-time seismic hazard warning system. A real-time warning system has the potential to save lives by alerting people outside the immediate area of an impending seismic shock. Advance warning can be critical in preventing injury by giving communities time to curtail high risk activities such as high-speed rail transportation, as well as shutoff of selected gas, electrical and water feeders to the effected area. This is pivotal in limiting the collateral damage caused after an earthquake by fire. 
As we have all seen by the devastation in Northridge, CA, the consequences of an earthquake are simply too important for a region to be lulled into a false sense of safety. This point was brought home to me when I heard that an earthquake had struck Chattanooga. Certainly, not by any means, a large event, but a reminder, that the threat of earthquakes occur throughout the Nation. 
We have also included an important provision which underscores our commitment to education. This bill would let NSF create and disseminate earth science educational materials in a way that permits easy access by educators and the general public. Acknowledging that FEMA and NSF have both done an outstanding job in creating educational material, we are looking for continued cooperation of all the agencies, one of the hallmarks of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program [NEHRP]. 
To speed the process of moving this important legislation forward, I offer a technical amendment which brings the funding authority for USGS to the same level reflected in the House of Representatives version of this bill. The adoption of this amendment should reduce the time it will take for this important legislation to become law. 
Mr. President, I believe that the passage of this legislation will continue of the good work that these four agencies have been undertaking--work that saves property, but most importantly, saves American lives.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the issue of a bill which I am very hopeful will be considered shortly, and that is the Food and Drug Administration Modernization and Accountability Act of 1997. I came to the floor expecting, as we all had anticipated, that this bill would be considered today in the bipartisan spirit that has, in many ways, been reflected by working together over the past 2 years on a bill that will modernize the FDA, will strengthen the FDA and will, what I guess I care most about, improve patient care for the thousands, for the hundreds of thousands of people who will benefit from having speedier access to effective drugs, to effective therapies, to effective devices. 
I am very excited about the bill, yet I am very disappointed now that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have presented a situation where this bill cannot be considered today. 
I am hopeful that over the course of today we will be able to reach some sort of agreement. I had thought we had reached that agreement, but obviously we have not, much to my disappointment and, I think, to the detriment of the United States and all those people who could benefit from having a strengthened FDA. 
A comment was made earlier that the bill has not really been considered by a number of people. Again, that is a bit disappointing. The bill before us today really represents over 2 years of work conducted in committee and with people off of the committee that we just heard our distinguished chairman mention--2 years of work with one objective; that is, to modernize the Food and Drug Administration. I do want to emphasize the bipartisanship in committee, in the Human Resources Committee. 
This bill was considered, was marked up, and the bill, with a 14 to 4 vote, passed out of committee to be taken to the floor. Throughout this process, our distinguished chairman, who we just heard from on the floor, has worked with the minority staff, with the minority Senators as well as the majority. Both Senator Jeffords and the majority, and Senator Kennedy and the minority on the committee have negotiated in good faith to move forward. 
During the months--and really this has gone on for months, in effect, for 2 years as we debated and discussed a very similar bill--but during the months leading up to committee passage--again, it has gone through the committee with a vote of 14 to 4--and continuing up to today, there have been a series of meetings between the FDA, between industry, between the administration and the committee staff, all gathered together in a bipartisan spirit, legislative and executive branch, working together to clarify provisions, to outline and to resolve those concerns between the various parties. And with a bill that is this major, that will impact every single American both in the current generation and in the next generation, it takes that working together, negotiating across the table, listening to everybody's concerns. 
I am delighted--up at least, I thought, until 15 or 20 minutes ago--that those provisions had been discussed, that the debate had been outlined with negotiations and compromise carried out to where we have a very strong bill that will benefit all Americans. 
The chairman of the committee, through which this passed again with a strong bipartisan vote, pointed out the importance of passing FDA reform over the next 6 to 7 days, or I guess the remaining 5 days now, when he referred to the expiring authorization of what is called PDUFA. This is favored. 
The reauthorization, which is expiring--the authorization is expiring--the reauthorization is supported by the FDA, it is supported by the U.S. Congress, it is supported by the administration, and it is supported by industry. This law has been a great success. It must and will be extended for another 5 years. It is an integral part of the FDA reform and modernization bill that I hope will be introduced this week. 
If in some way this aspect of the bill is blocked, despite the fact that both sides--that all sides--want it to move forward, there is the potential that as many as 600 FDA reviewers that are employed because of PDUFA, which speeds up, which accelerates the approval process to get drugs out to the American people, could be at jeopardy. That must be addressed this week. Furthermore, patients awaiting the drugs that will be approved at an expedited rate of PDUFA will wait and wait and wait if this is not continued.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to speak to a specific aspect of the bill that reflects, I think, the bipartisan spirit, the working together to the benefit of individual patients or future patients, to the benefit of children today, of hard-working men and women across this country. It has to do with the whole topic of dissemination of scientific medical information. This aspect of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization and Accountability Act of 1997 is a very important one, but one that has been contentious in many ways and in many people's minds has been the most contentious part of the FDA bill. 
It all stems back to legislation that was introduced by my distinguished colleague from Florida, Mr. Mack, and myself 2 years ago. It focuses on the fundamental aspect which is so important to the practice of medicine today, to the delivery of care today, and that is to allow a free flow of good, accurate information that can be used to benefit people who need health care and health care services. It focuses on the dissemination of scientific medical peer-reviewed information to physicians and other health care providers. 
As I said, this is an important aspect of the bill which I hope will be introduced. It will result in more scientific information on uses of FDA-approved drugs in an off-label or extra-label manner. Again, these are products that have already been approved by the FDA, but they are used very commonly in fields such as pediatric medicine, the practice of delivering care to children today while they are in the hospital, used very commonly in the treatment of cancer therapy. As much as 90 percent of all of the uses of drugs in oncology or the treatment of cancer are used in what is called an off-label or extra-label manner. 
These provisions, which are a part of the underlying bill, represent a lot of hard work, as was implied by the distinguished chairman, a lot of bipartisan support which has been demonstrated especially over the last 2 months but really over the last 6 months. 
Specifically, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Senator Mack, who I mentioned, Senator Dodd, Senator Wyden and Senator Boxer, all of whom have remained throughout committed to this issue and have demonstrated real leadership in their bipartisan working together to come up with a piece of legislation that will be to the benefit of all Americans. I, too, want to express my appreciation to Secretary Shalala for her willingness to work, along with Senator Kennedy, on what had been considered, as I mentioned, one of the most contentious issues initially of FDA reform. Now we have a bipartisan consensus agreement among all parties in this body with the FDA and with the administration. 
The information dissemination provisions do represent a compromise, a balanced compromise, but they really ultimately respect the importance of physicians receiving up-to-date, independently derived scientific information, as well, at the same time to pursue, when possible, getting those prescribed uses ultimately approved on the label by the FDA. Thus, we have to address the dissemination of information. But what we have come to by these very careful, balanced negotiations is this linkage to actually improving and reforming the supplemental application process. The goal among almost all of us is to get as many of these uses today on the label. 
Now, what does off-label mean? Off-label scares people. As a physician, as someone in my thoracic oncology practice, as someone who routinely every week treated cancer patients, I have some responsibility to define for my colleagues what off-label means. Off-label scares people. Is it somebody going in some secret closet and pulling out a medicine and using it? No, it is not. That is why extra-label is probably a better term. But right now off-label is something that we in the medical profession understand is used routinely in the pediatric population and, as mentioned earlier, for inpatient hospitalization. Probably 50 percent of all pediatric drugs prescribed are off-label. So it is not a term to be scared of or to fear. 
In off-label use, it is simply the use of a drug which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in a way that has not yet specifically been indicated on the label. It might be using that drug in a combination with other drugs for an intended benefit. It might be a different dosage of that drug. It really comes down to the standpoint that the halflife of medical knowledge is moving quickly. We all know that. 
We know how fast science is moving, how fast medical information is changing. That change is skyrocketing and accelerating over time. Clearly, you have an FDA which, and appropriately to some extent, has to be very careful, has to rely on large clinical trials, and has not been as good historically in the past as we would like for it to be in terms of approving over time. That FDA cannot approve every single use of every single drug in the field of health and science which is moving at skyrocketing speed, accelerating speed. 
An example, aspirin, has been used off-label for years to prevent heart attacks. People generally know today taking a baby aspirin today or an aspirin every other day is effective in preventing heart attacks in certain populations. But right now, if you read on the label, there are certain limitations as to the use of aspirin. It is not specified that aspirin can be used prophylactically to prevent heart attacks today. 
Another example which reflects the importance of off-label or extra-label use in a world where science is moving very quickly is that of the use of tetracycline. When I was in medical school, even 10 years ago, the whole theory of ulcer disease was based on a component of acid. Acid clearly plays a very important role, but what we did not know--in fact when I first heard it myself when I was a resident, I said, `No way; impossible.' But what was figured out is that antibiotics can help cure ulcers because the etiology of ulcer disease, of certain types of ulcer disease, is based on a bacterium. 
Well, we know that today. Yet tetracycline and the use of tetracycline, a very common antibiotic which is used for many other reasons, does not have an on-label use for the treatment of ulcers. Yet there are thousands of people right now taking tetracycline to treat their ulcer disease--that is an extra- 
label use, an off-label use--under the law, of course. With 90 percent of my oncology patients using off-label-use drugs, with 50 percent of my pediatric patients using off-label drugs, with tetracycline, physicians are allowed legally, of course, to use and prescribe drugs for off-label uses. 
In addition to being a thoracic oncologist--and I will have to add that I was codirector of the thoracic, which is chest, oncology cancer treatment; and lung cancer is the No. 1 cause of cancer death in women today--that for the medical treatment of thoracic cancers, of lung cancer, well over 95 percent of the treatment is off-label today. 
In my field of heart and lung transplant surgery, many of my patients are alive today, of the hundreds of patients whom I have transplanted, because of the off-label uses of FDA-approved drugs. Then, in my routine heart surgery practice, where I have put hundreds of mechanical valves in patients over the last several years, there is another great advantage of off-label drugs. 
About 40 years ago, the first mechanical heart valves were put in to replace defective valves scarred by rheumatic heart disease. These mechanical valves are replaced routinely. This started in the early 1960's, about 40 years ago. But it was not until March 31, 1994, just 3 years ago, that the off-label use of Coumadin, the blood thinner which all these patients are on and have been on for the last 35 years, that it was ultimately approved for on-label use, according to FDA. 
It has been clear in the literature and among my colleagues that Coumadin, this blood thinner, is not only important, but lifesaving for those who have received medical valves. So dissemination of information is important. It is important for physicians to be able to have the latest information, to have the free flow of information. Why? In order to best treat, using the latest techniques and the most effective therapy, the patients who come through their door that they treat in the hospital. Dissemination of information, with appropriate balance and disclosure, will allow sharing of this type of information with physicians and with other people who can take advantage of it. 
Let me just close with one further explanation about why it is important. We are talking about this information going to people who are trained to consider this information. Right now, there are barriers there, which means if I were a physician practicing in rural Tennessee, I am not likely to be going to Vanderbilt or the local academic health center and participating in conferences every week. If I am in rural Tennessee, where do I get my information? I get it from what I learned in medical school, but there is a problem with that because we already said the half-life of medical knowledge is shorter and shorter, with the great discoveries that we have today. I am most likely to read medical journals. Yes, there are many, many journals that it is important for me to read to keep in touch with. I could search the Internet. But to be honest with you, your typical physician is so busy today delivering care, it is very unlikely that they are going to sit down at a computer terminal in rural Tennessee and go to the Internet and get information. 
In fact, last year, in testimony before the Labor Committee, Dr. Lindberg at the National Library of Medicine testified before the committee, and explained how vast this literature is out there. He was talking about MEDLINE, which is the primary medical database that is used, in which all of the peer-reviewed journals are placed on this computerized data base. He explained the challenge that physicians have today in the following way:  
MEDLINE contains more than 8 million articles from 1966 to the present. It grows by some 400,000 records annually. If a conscientious doctor were to read two medical articles before retiring every night, he would have fallen 550 years behind in his reading at the end of the first year. 
Now, in medicine, where one's health and one's life is in the hands of the physician, I don't see how people can argue about free and appropriate dissemination of information to best benefit that patient, to take care of you as an individual. Yet, there are barriers there. We, probably unintentionally, over time, have created barriers that now we need to take down, to allow the appropriate and balanced dissemination of information to be to the benefit of that physician who is going to be seeing my colleagues, their children and their spouses in the future. More information, I feel, is better, as long as it's balanced, peer-reviewed, and safeguards are built in to make sure that it is not used for promotion. 
Mr. President, I will yield the floor soon. This is an issue that I really want to just underscore this day because it represents bipartisanship, working together with the distinguished colleagues on both sides of the aisle. It started from a bill that was introduced in the Senate by the Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack], and myself. It has been greatly improved. How? By sitting around the table with the administration, with the FDA, with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to the point that we, when we pass the overall bill, will be able to improve the health care of individuals across this country. 
I feel this is one of the most important aspects of this bill. Again, I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together so that we can bring up the underlying bill and pass it to the benefit of all Americans. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FRIST. Again, I would like to commend the chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee for the outstanding work he has done in shepherding through the committee and now, hopefully, later today bring to the floor an act which will modernize and strengthen the FDA and will be to the real benefit of all Americans to make sure that health care services are given in an expeditious way to the American people. 
As I mentioned in my earlier comments in the Chamber, a central aspect of health care today is the dissemination of information to physicians, to health care providers so that both will know, understand and have access to and be able to use appropriately that information to serve their patients, the so-called off-label or extra-label provisions I introduced this morning, and I want to share once again my delight in the fact that in a bipartisan way, working with Senators Kennedy, Wyden, Boxer, Mack, myself, and the distinguished chairman, we have come together and worked with the administration and the FDA to address this very important issue of dissemination of information. 
As I mentioned, off-label uses are really prominent in health care today. The American Medical Association estimates the off-label or extra-label use of drugs that have already been approved by the FDA to be in the range of 40 percent to 60 percent of all prescriptions. Of all prescriptions written today, 40 to 60 percent are estimated by the American Medical Association to be off-label, and there have been very few problems associated with this off-label appropriate use. In treating hospitalized children, it has been estimated that over 70 percent of the drugs are prescribed to be off-label, and that can vary anywhere from 60 to as high as 90 percent, and for diseases such as cancer the figure can be as high as 90 percent. 
As a lung cancer surgeon--I mentioned earlier the treatment of lung cancer today--the medical treatment of lung cancer involves well over 80, more in the range of 90, percent of all medical treatment being off-label. And that is that the drugs already approved by the FDA are used either in a dosage or 
in a combination with other drugs that have not yet been approved or studied through the FDA process. That can be improved in lots of ways and that is part of the underlying bill, to strengthen the FDA by making the approval process more efficient. People ask me frequently, why aren't all uses of drugs, if they are really effective, if they are really valuable, if they really improve patient care, why aren't they on the label? 
A goal of all of us, I think, is to get as many on the label as possible. But in answering that question, I first cite the American Medical Association's Council on Scientific Affairs, which met this spring to consider all of these issues and to make recommendations regarding information dissemination and what we call the supplemental approval process; that is, a drug has been approved for a specific indication at a specific dose and if it is discovered through medical science that a different dose or another medication is in order, why can't you get that in a supplemental way on the label. The AMA's Council on Scientific Affairs, in explaining why there are currently so many medically accepted, commonly used, unlabeled uses of FDA-approved drugs, states: 
The simple answer is that FDA-approved labeling does not necessarily reflect current medical practice. 
In their comments, they go on to explain that manufacturers may not seek FDA approval for all useful indications for a whole range, a whole host of reasons, including: 
The expense of regulatory compliance may be greater than the eventual revenues expected--e.g. if patent protection for the drug product has expired or if the patient population protected by the new use is very small. 
The point is, if you have a drug in your pharmaceutical company and you know it is good, yet it will benefit very few people in a population and you know it is going to cost you millions and millions of dollars and years and years of trying to put through these clinical trials, what incentive do you have when the benefit is to such a few number of patients out there? Thus, we need to lower that barrier, make the supplemental approval process for these extra-label or off-label uses easier, lower that barrier. 
Patent protection. Once a manufacturer has invested a lot of money and time in clinical trials and meeting the regulatory requirements of the Food and Drug Administration, they are protected for a period of time through the patent, but once the patent expires, what then is their incentive to go out and get this off-label use put on the label when they have to go through so many hoops, through what all of us know is an inefficient process today? 
The good news is that the underlying bill addresses the supplemental process. It links off-label use or dissemination of information about off-label use to a future application. 
Now, the supplemental process--and what I am even more excited or equally excited about is it makes that supplemental process more efficient, with more incentives for the manufacturers to seek what is called a supplemental new drug application. 
Going back to the AMA's Council on Scientific Affairs, they say: 
A sponsor also may not seek FDA approval because of difficulties in conducting controlled clinical trials. ([For example,] for ethical reasons, or due to the inability to recruit patients). 
`Finally,' and again I am quoting them: 
. . . even when a sponsor does elect to seek approval for a new indication, the regulatory approval process for the required [Supplemental New Drug Application] is expensive and may proceed very slowly. 
In fact, they continue to explain a little bit later, that the past review performance for SNDA's, Supplemental New Drug Applications, is  
. . . unexpected because the SNDA should be much simpler to review than the original [New Drug Application], and suggests the FDA gave much lower priority to reviews of SNDAs. 
The point is, we need to improve the underlying supplemental new drug application process and this bill does that as well. I am very hopeful that this bill can be brought to the floor because you can see the number of good things that are in this bill that will speed and make more efficient the overall approval process with safeguards built in that will protect the American people from dangerous drugs, the unnecessary side effects of drugs or devices. 
The underlying bill, again pointing to the real advantages of getting this bill to the floor, includes additional incentives for manufacturers to seek supplemental labeling, including added exclusivity for those seeking pediatric labeling. Again, encouraging--and we know, if you look back historically, we as a nation have not done very well, in terms of aiming labeling for the pediatric population, a place where these drugs are so critical, are so crucial for our children, my children, your children. We need to do better there and this bill addresses that. 
Also, the underlying bill requires that the FDA publish performance standards for the prompt review of supplemental applications. It requires the FDA issue final guidance to clarify the requirements and facilitate the submission of data to support the approval of the supplemental application. And it requires the FDA to designate someone in each FDA center who will be responsible for encouraging review of supplemental applications and who will work with sponsors to facilitate the development of--and to gather the data to support--these supplemental new drug applications. Moreover, the Secretary, as specified in the bill, will foster a collaboration between the Food and Drug Administration and the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, and the professional medical societies and the professional scientific societies, and others to identify published and unpublished studies that could support a SNDA, a supplemental new drug application. The point is to improve that communication, that working together. Finally, in the bill, the Secretary is required to encourage sponsors to submit SNDA's or conduct further research based on all of these studies. 
Again, this drives home the point that the underlying value of this bill dictates that it be brought forward to the floor, that it be debated, that it ultimately be passed and taken to the American people--all of these provisions which I cited--to improve the FDA's commitment to the SNDA process, to improve the agency's communication with manufacturers regarding the requirements for SNDA's, and the requirements that in most cases the manufacturers submit approved clinical trial protocols and commit to filing a SNDA before disseminating scientific information about off-label uses--all will improve the number of supplemental indications pursued by manufacturers. 
To be certain of the impact of all of these provisions, the dissemination provisions sunset after a completion of a study by the Institute of Medicine to review the scientific issues presented by this particular section, including whether the information provided to health care practitioners by both the manufacturer and by the Secretary is useful, the quality of such information, and the impact of dissemination of information on research in the area of new uses, indications, or dosages. Again, special emphasis in the bill is placed on rare diseases and is placed on pediatric indications. 
Indeed, limiting information dissemination to off-label uses undergoing the research necessary to get it on label has been a real subject of negotiation and compromise in this bipartisan discussion with the FDA and the administration and representatives from Congress. However, the point is that we have done that. It is now ready to be brought to the floor, to be talked about among all of our colleagues if they so wish. Those negotiations and those compromises have been carried out. It is time now to bring that to the floor. We have worked to accommodate many other concerns of our fellow colleagues in the U.S. Senate, concerns among the FDA and other organizations. The provisions outlined in the amendment have changed a great deal from the original bill that was proposed by Senator Mack and myself during the 104th Congress, and it makes it a better bill, a stronger bill, one that I think will benefit all Americans. 
In general, in the bill, manufacturers will be allowed to share peer-reviewed medical journal articles and medical textbooks about off-label uses with health care practitioners 
only if they have made that commitment to file for a supplemental new drug application within 6 months, or if the manufacturer submits the clinical trial protocol and the schedule for collecting the information for this new drug application, this supplemental new drug application. If those criteria are met, manufacturers will be allowed to share peer-reviewed medical journal articles and medical textbooks. 
I have to comment on peer review because it is important. That means the types of materials that are submitted, that a manufacturer may submit to a physician--remember the physician already has 4 years of medical school, several years of residency, is trained to at least read that peer-reviewed article. If that peer-reviewed article is sent, that dissemination of information will facilitate, I believe, the overall care of patients--broadly. 
In addition, the FDA will review whatever proposed information is to be sent out by a manufacturer to a physician. They will have 60 days to review that peer-reviewed article or that chapter out of a textbook. The manufacturer--and it is spelled out in the bill--must list the use, the indications--the indication, or the dosage provisions that are not on the label. The manufacturer must also disclose any financial interest. The manufacturer must also submit a bibliography of previous articles on the drug or the device. And, then, after all that submission, if the Secretary determines that more information is needed, she may require the manufacturer to disseminate other information in order to present an objective view. In other words, we are not allowing manufacturers to send out articles which have any sort of bias or conflict of interest. These are peer-reviewed articles with safeguards built in to make sure that there is not an undue bias. 
The safeguards against abuse also ensure that the information is accurate; it is unbiased when it is presented to that practitioner. Manufacturers must inform the Secretary of any new developments about the off-label use, whether those developments are positive or whether they are negative. And, in turn, the Secretary may require that new information be disseminated to health care practitioners who previously received information on a new use. This really should go a long way to ensure that health care practitioner--the person who is in rural Tennessee--is fully informed, with peer-reviewed articles, cleared of any conflicts of interest, with the FDA having had 60 days to make sure that balance is there. 
There are a number of benefits to this amendment. Patients will gain from better and safer health care because their physician will be more knowledgeable about potential treatments. That is the most important thing for a physician. Again, as I am in this body I want to keep coming back, again and again, to what is important to physicians and to our health care system. It is simply one thing and that is the patient; that the patient has access to the very best health care, the very best device to treat their cancer, to treat their underlying heart disease, to provide the patient with the very best possible care. 
There will be a number of charges, and there have been in the past, about this freedom of information, allowing dissemination of extra-label information. One is--and we heard it last year and we built into the process, I think, very strong provisions to prevent this--but critics would say if you allow people to use drugs and devices off-label--remember, that's the standard of care right now--but if you allow information to be disseminated by a manufacturer, then what incentive does that manufacturer have to go out and jump the hurdles of a SNDA, the supplemental new drug application process? 
Pharmaceutical companies are going to be committed to completing a SNDA in this bill. They have a greater incentive to continue research and clinical trials on their projects. The additional benefits of receiving approval for new indications include product reimbursement. Frequently you are not reimbursed for a medicine unless it is FDA approved. The incentive to get that approval is there if we have an appropriate barrier. Another is less product liability. Many people believe if it is on the label and you use that drug, that gives you some protection from product liability and therefore these manufacturers have an incentive to get that supplemental new drug application approved. Also, active promotion of the product for the new use. 
I also heard in the debate last year before the committee this whole idea of what peer review is. It is misunderstood by people broadly, but the concept of peer review is that I, as an investigator, submit my data and my studies to the experts in the world who are not necessarily--who are not, in fact--at my institution, not a part of my research team. They are objective. There is no conflict of interest. They review the study, they review the protocol, they review how the study was carried out, and decide is this good science or is this bad science. And that is what peer review is. Typically, journals that are peer-reviewed have objective boards that look at this data and either put on their stamp of approval--they don't necessarily have to agree with everything, but they have to say 
it is good science and the study was conducted in an ethical and peer-reviewed manner. 
So peer review is important. We have worked, again in a bipartisan way, in this bill, with the American Medical Association's Council on Scientific Affairs to agree on the definition of a quality peer-reviewed journal article in order to ensure that high scientific standards are guaranteed; if a manufacturer sends out an article, it has been peer reviewed. And we spell out in the bill that manufacturers will only be allowed to send out peer-reviewed articles from medical journals listed in the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine's Index Medicus. These medical journals must have an independent editorial board, they must use experts in the subject of the article, and must have a publicly stated conflict of interest policy. Again, building in, as much as possible, the concept of educated scientifically objective peer review. 
Last, manufacturers will not be allowed to advertise the product. They will not be allowed to make oral presentations. They will not be allowed to send free samples to health care practitioners. In other words, sending a health care practitioner, a physician, an independently derived, scientifically significant peer-reviewed journal article is not promotion. As a physician, I know, reading a peer-reviewed article--you see a lot of peer-reviewed articles--does not necessarily change my prescribing habits. As a physician, I am trained through medical school and residency and my years of practice to assimilate that information, reject what I don't agree with or what I don't think is good science and use, if I think it is in the best interests of my patient, what is suggested. 
In closing, let me simply say that I am disappointed that an objection has been made to bringing to the floor the large bill that will strengthen the FDA. It is important that we do so. It is important that we extend PDUFA, which is the approval process supported by the private sector, working hand in hand with the public sector, which has been of such huge benefit to patients. We should do so because we will be able to get better, improved therapies for the treatment of cancer, pediatric diseases, blood-borne diseases, to the American people in a more expeditious way, and that translates into saving lives. 
We need to bring this bill to the floor now. We have bipartisan support. We have debated it. It was approved in a bipartisan way through the Labor and Human Resources Committee. If we do so, we will be doing a great service to the American people. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Thomas Bros. Grass, Ltd., being named Entrepreneur of the Year by the Dallas Business Journal. Thomas Bros. began in the 1970's, with 10 acres of undeveloped land and a dream. E.A. Thomas and his four sons Ike, Mark, Mike, and Emory, took those 10 acres and started a small business with the desire to produce a wide variety of quality sod for golf courses, athletic fields, and residential properties. Over the years, that small sod farm has blossomed into a successful 2,000-acre family-owned business, with sod operations in three States. 
While their headquarters are located in Texas, Thomas Bros. has two sod farms in my home State of Tennessee. The farms in Taft and Nashville have not only strengthened the economies of these communities, they have brought with them the Thomas family spirit of teamwork and community well-being. Not only are they well established as experts in sod production and installation, they have achieved a reputation for quality and efficient service. That reputation makes them standouts in their field, and has earned the family work in major arenas throughout the country, like the Cotton Bowl in Dallas and the Kansas City Chiefs football club. 
Mr. President, Thomas Bros.' team approach and home grown commitment to customer satisfaction has certainly benefited the State of Tennessee and is worthy of this recognition as Entrepreneur of the Year. I congratulate them and wish them continued success in future endeavors.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the underlying amendment briefly, the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas with regard to his efforts to really hone NIST's Advanced Technology Program to serve the public, the amendment to the Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary appropriations bill. 
I do wish to thank my colleague, the Senator from Kansas, for his efforts to accomplish what we all want to do, and that is to have NIST's ATP serve in the best way possible the public, using taxpayer dollars. And I, too, am very optimistic and feel very confident that this can be done, yet I want to rise and speak against the amendment and stress that the approach is different than what I would like to take and therefore explain it. 
I am chairman of the Commerce Science, Technology and Space Subcommittee, the committee through which the reauthorization and the authorization for this ATP takes place. That subcommittee right now is looking at all of the information in a very systematic way to see how we best can evolve that program to provide absolutely the best return on our Nation's investment. 
I feel strongly that the proper place to effect such changes should be in a more comprehensive approach rather than a shotgun approach, and that is through the committee structure, through the committee that is charged with the reauthorization of NIST's ATP, and that is what we are doing. 
Just last week an excellent report was released by the Commerce Department. It is a 60-day report. It put forth recommendations, four reform efforts in place, suggestions, recommendations--conducted by the Commerce Department. And I dare say I bet there has not been a Senator in the room who has read through that report released just last week. 
I think the report is a good first step. We need to go much further than that, but I would rather do that on an authorizing bill rather than having it tagged on an appropriations bill in more of a shotgun fashion. 
Our subcommittee is right now working on a reauthorization bill that addresses the longstanding concerns which people have with the Advanced Technology Program so that it can be become a really more effective vehicle for stimulating innovation in this country, and that is what we want to do, stimulate innovation. 
I welcome the input to our subcommittee of all interested parties, including my colleagues from the Commerce Committee and the Senator from Kansas, who is also on the Commerce Committee, in order to craft this more comprehensive legislation. Therefore, I rise to express my opposition to this particular amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas and hope that we will begin the opportunity through the appropriate authorizing subcommittee to effect real change, more comprehensive change where we can consider all of the available data in order to accomplish the necessary change in the NIST's Advanced Technology Program through this reauthorization process. I hope my colleagues will join me in opposition to this amendment, recognizing that we will be addressing all of these issues through the appropriate reauthorizing committee, that of science, technology and space. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National Center for Bioengineering Research Act of 1997. Bioengineering is where medical need and technical capability meet to increase our capacity to diagnose and treat disease; to enhance the quality of life of millions of people with chronic conditions; to save millions of dollars in health care costs; and to generate billions of dollars for our economy. Medical devices alone is a $40 billion-a-year industry. 
Bioengineering is an interdisciplinary field that applies physical, chemical, and mathematical sciences and engineering principles to the study of biology, medicine, behavior, and health. It advances knowledge from the molecular to the organ systems level, and develops new and novel biologics, materials, processes, implant, devices, and informatics approaches for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, for patient rehabilitation, and for improving health. 
Although the term `bioengineering' may not be commonplace, many of the major medical advances from bioengineering are very familiar, including the heart-lung machine, kidney dialysis, total hip joint replacements, heart pacemakers, artificial hearts, prosthetics, and diagnostic medical imaging. Other advances are right around the corner, including implantable insulin pumps with biosensors that detect exactly when and how much insulin is needed; and regeneration of tissue, cartilage, and even organs, instead of transplantation--which brings with it the risk of rejection, major trauma to the patient, and one of the highest costs in our entire health care system. As a heart-lung transplant surgeon, I know first hand about the life-saving contributions made by all of these bioengineering developments. We need as many new achievements like this as we can produce. 
In spite of such spectacular achievements, however, the field of bioengineering suffers from fragmentation and a lack of coordination that could impede and delay future advances in the field. This fragmentation was recognized as early as 1967, when an international conference called for better coordination in bioengineering research. 
In 1995, at the request of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, the NIH submitted a report, `Support for Bioengineering Research.' This report was remarkably consistent with a number of previous studies over the last 30 years that stressed the need for: a centralized focus for extramural bioengineering research at NIH; a strong intramural bioengineering program at NIH; and increased coordination of bioengineering activities within NIH and among other Federal agencies. 
This legislation seeks to implement those recommendations and is designed to enhance the state of and improve the coordination of bioengineering research conducted within NIH and throughout the Federal Government. This bill calls for the establishment of a National Center for Bioengineering Research within the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute at NIH. The mission of the Center is to: 
First, enhance the state of bioengineering research within NIH; 
Second, promote collaborative research projects among NIH institutes and across Federal agencies; 
Third, enhance communication among bioengineering investigators within Federal agencies and with private sector entities; and 
Fourth, educate the Congress and the public on the critical importance of bioengineering to both the health and the economy of the Nation. 
This legislation does not create a new institute within NIH. The Center would have no grantmaking authority. New funding would be allocated to institutes to support basic research projects in bioengineering through the standard peer review process. 
This legislation is introduced today as a stand-alone bill. But I expect it to be included in the reauthorization bill for the National Institutes of Health which, as Chair of the Public Health and Safety Subcommittee of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, I intend to move forward during the first session of the 105th Congress.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to bring my colleagues' attention to an issue affecting American jobs and national security issues. The Department of Defense uses approximately 500,000 pounds of carbonizable rayon fiber per year in its many missile programs as a solid rocket fuel. The sole domestic supplier of carbonizable rayon fiber is the North American Corporation in Elizabethton, Tennessee. 
It is my fear that if the Department of Defense does not plan for the long-term viability of its domestic supplier of carbonizable rayon the North American Corp. will simply go out of business and put 400 people out of work.

If the North American Corp. goes out of business it is my understanding that the Department of Defense would be forced to depend on less reliable foreign suppliers, probably in Mexico or Asia. Further, it is my understanding that there is a lengthy and expensive process to qualify new suppliers that can take at least 3 years and possibly cost millions of dollars.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today, I rise to pay tribute to Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president and chief executive officer of the American Medical Association from 1990 until 1996. 
Dr. Todd was a dynamic leader and advocate for physicians and patients throughout the country. His advice and example were invaluable to lawmakers in Washington and to his peers throughout the Nation. 
He steered the AMA through a time of stress and change in American medicine, and made great strides in preparing the AMA to lead the medical profession into the next century. But, more than anything, Dr. Todd loved his profession. He called medicine `the most demanding, regarding, and enjoyable profession there could possibly be.' 
One of Dr. Todd's many accomplishments included guiding the American Medical Association through the implementation of a dramatic revision in the Medicare payment system. His efforts changed the old `reasonable and customary fee' basis to a system that takes into account the resources that doctors bring to their profession, including education, and training. 
Dr. Todd worked aggressively with a coalition of companies providing professional liability insurance for physicians, on ways to curb the escalating cost of malpractice insurance. He was deeply involved in drafting the guidelines for the practice of various medical specialties to reduce the number of errors committed by doctors. 
As executive vice president, Dr. Todd also oversaw preparations for the establishment of the National Patient Safety Foundation. Its chief mission is to protect patients by identifying and correcting errors in medical systems, notably in the hospital system. 
The physicians and patients of America alike have lost a friend and champion. We will miss Dr. Todd's spirit, integrity, and love for medicine. 
Born in 1931, Dr. Todd graduated cum laude from Harvard College and Harvard Medical School. He interned and served his residency in surgery at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City, becoming chief resident in 1963. He was a Diplomate of the American Board of Surgery and a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons. He was in private practice many years in New Jersey. 
Dr. Todd, who retired in 1996 after 6 yeas as executive vice-president, was first elected a member of the board of trustees in 1980. He became senior deputy executive vice president in 1985, and was named executive vice president in 1990. 
Dr. Todd is survived by his wife, Marjorie Patricia Thorn Todd, and his son, Kendall Scott Todd.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this amendment, submitted on behalf of Senators Conrad, Sessions, Abraham, and myself evolves from a simple principle, that is, once we balance the budget, which we will do by 2002, let us keep it in balance thereafter. The amendment has two key provisions. No. 1, establishes a 60-vote point of order against any bill or resolution that will increase the deficit in the year 2002 or any year thereafter, and, No. 2, requires the President to submit a balanced budget every year in 2002 and thereafter. 
The amendment does provide exceptions in the event of war or recession. The amendment is consistent with the bipartisan balanced budget agreement. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an important balanced budget enforcement amendment that I will offer on behalf of myself, Senators Conrad, Abraham, and Sessions, tomorrow morning. 
This amendment evolves from a very simple principle, and that is, once we get a balanced budget, that it stays balanced well into the future. 
This amendment, based on existing enforcement mechanisms, has two key provisions: 
First, it establishes a 60-vote point of order in the Senate against any bill that provides or would cause a deficit in the year 2002 or in any year thereafter. 
Second, it requires that the President submit a balanced budget in the year 2002 and every year thereafter. To retain appropriate flexibility, this amendment suspends this point of order in times of war or in times of recession. This exact same exception is provided for in the existing enforcement mechanisms under the current law. 
This amendment is also--I should add, because I think this is important as we bring forth amendments tomorrow--consistent with the bipartisan budget agreement. 
The text of the bipartisan budget agreement specifically states that `agreed upon budget levels are shown on the tables included in this agreement.' Under the long-range summary table in the agreement, the agreement shows a budget surplus of $1 billion in the year 2002 and $34 billion in the year 2007. This means that we are projecting a balanced budget in 5 years and in 10 years. My amendment will strengthen our ability to abide by this agreement and keep spending under control in the future. 
In the bipartisan budget agreement, the Congress, the President, Republicans and Democrats, joined together to balance the budget in the year 2002. But I believe that everyone would agree that we don't just want to balance the budget in just that 1 year, 2002, but we want to maintain balance every year thereafter. That includes the years 2003, 2005, 2010, 2020. 
We must keep focusing on our long-term budget picture for one very important reason: to prepare for the baby boomers' retirement which is just over a decade away. We know that the budget agreement does not go far enough in addressing this long-term challenge. 
In fairness, the authors of the agreement never claimed that it does. But as we approach this new demographic era that all of us know is sitting out there just about a decade away, we must be acutely aware of the situation. In fact, we know that right now, 200,000 Americans will turn 65 this year. But in 15 years, in 14 years, in fact, by the year 2011, 1.5 million Americans will turn 65 just that year and that trend will continue over the next two decades. 
Simultaneously, as the elderly population is increasing, the number of younger workers who are working to support that elderly population is decreasing. In fact, today, there are 4.9 workers supporting every single retiree's benefits, that is today, that includes Social Security and Medicare. But in the year 2030, there will only be 2.8 workers supporting the benefits of a single retiree. 
This dramatic demographic shift will bring significant economic, political, social and cultural changes that will transform our society. If we continued on our current spending course, entitlements--that is our automatic spending programs--coupled with interest on the debt would consume all revenues in just 15 years, leaving not a single dollar left over for roads, for infrastructure, for medical science, for the national parks, for medical research and for defense of the country. I believe our balanced budget agreement will help ease this demographic pressure, but much more work lies ahead. We must begin sooner, rather than later, to deal with these problems fairly and effectively. This amendment addresses that problem. 
It will keep pressure on Congress and the President to confront these inevitable challenges, this inevitable demographic shift. To those not familiar with the Federal budget process, this amendment will create a procedural hurdle, called a point of order, to prevent the Senate from considering bills that will increase the deficit. If a Senator raises this point of order, it will take a three-fifths vote of the Senate, that is 60 votes, to waive the point of order and pass the legislation, rather than the normal 51-vote majority. 
After we have all worked so hard and so long to rein in spending, we should not allow the deficit to balloon out of control once again after that year, 2002. It is imperative that we preserve this achievement and restrict Congress' ability to overspend taxpayer dollars. We will offer this amendment tomorrow morning and, at that time, I will urge all of my colleagues to support this important amendment which addresses the inevitable demographic changes. I yield the floor.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my colleague from Delaware, Senator Roth. As chairman of the Finance Committee, I commend him for guiding this budget process through the committee with overwhelming bipartisan support and bringing these issues before the full Senate in a timely manner. 
The legislation before us, establishes a new Medicare Payment Review Commission to replace the Physician Payment Review Commission [PPRC] and the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission [ProPAC]. The Medicare Payment Review Commission is required to submit an annual report to Congress containing an examination of issues affecting the Medicare Program. The commission will review, and make recommendations to Congress concerning payment policies under both the Medicare Choice program and Medicare fee-for-service. 
I have heard criticism that the Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA] does not keep up with the latest medical supply products, even if they prove to be cost-effective. HCFA has stated its intent to become a more prudent purchaser. Indeed, that goal requires analysis of both the cost and quality of various products and requires constant review of medical developments. 
I understand that the new Medicare Payment Review Commission will have broad authority and should include the ability to review and make recommendations on procurement reimbursement and reform issues, including the effect, impact and cost implications of competitive bidding, flexible purchasing and inherent reasonableness on the provision of a full range of effective medical products and services to Medicare beneficiaries. 
Mr. President, I simply ask my colleague if that is correct?

Mr. FRIST. I would like to take a moment to clarify the intended meaning of the changes in State allotments for disproportionate share hospital [DSH] payments as they impact States that have received waivers to adopt managed care programs statewide, using DSH funds to help finance expanded care to the uninsured. Two such States are Tennessee, which initiated the TennCare program in January 1994, and Hawaii, which has operated the QUEST program since mid-1994. 
In these cases, the States combine their DSH allotment and their regular Medicaid dollars to fund capitation payments to managed care providers who are responsible for service not only to existing Medicaid-eligible recipients but to a substantial portion if not most of the children and adults who would not otherwise qualify for Medicaid but who do not have coverage under other insurance programs. Direct DSH payments to hospitals have been essentially eliminated, because the hospitals and other providers receive payments to cover care to the uninsured through the waiver program, either from managed care providers or, in the case of some hospitals, from the State under supplementary pools. 
The committee's legislation provides that DSH payments relating to services to persons eligible under the State's Medicaid plan must be made directly to hospitals after October 1, 1997, even where the individuals entitled to the service are enrolled in managed care plans, and cannot be used to determine prepaid capitation payments under the State plan that relate to those services. That provision does not by its terms apply to States operating under waivers where the DSH funds are used to fund a broader range of services to the uninsured. I would like your confirmation of this understanding, for it would be inconsistent with the TennCare and QUEST programs to apply the new provision to them. 
I also seek your concurrence that the adjustments to State DSH allocations are not intended to impact on the funds available to these waiver States to operate their programs. Both Tennessee and Hawaii no longer use their DSH allotments for DSH payments. As a result, CBO's estimates showed no impact on those States of the committee's provision adjusting DSH allotments and payments. That is entirely appropriate, for these States are subject to limitations on their Medicaid funding by reason of the budget terms of their waiver. Moreover, they no longer make DSH payments as we have come to know them, but instead have developed more efficient means of delivering health services and have extended them to a broader segment of the population. 
Can the chairman confirm my understanding of these two DSH-related points?

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in support of America's small businesses and in recognition of the 34th annual Small Business Week. As a member of the Small Business Committee, I understand that small business is truly the engine of economic growth in America. Ninety percent of all U.S. businesses have less than 20 employees and 99 percent have fewer than 500 employees. These small businesses employ more than half of our Nation's workforce and create a large majority of our new jobs. In fact, 40 percent of our Nation's goods and services are produced by small businesses--making America's entrepreneurs the world's third greatest economic power, trailing only the production of the entire United States economy and Japan. 
We celebrate Small Business Week every year to recognize those people on the front lines of our economy. I would like to take a moment to specifically recognize Tennessee's 1997 Small Business Person of the Year--Bob Pap--the president of the Accurate Automation Corp. in Chattanooga. Accurate Automation is an aerospace/computer systems company doing research and development in hypersonic aircraft design and the emerging technology of neural networks. Accurate Automation began in 1988 as a two-person company located in a 450-square-foot office. Today, it has 33 employees, 5 consultants, and a 13,000-square-foot office facility. Bob Pap's corporation is a great example of how hard work and ingenuity can lead to small business success. 
The work of a small business owner never ends. Therefore, Congress should not stop working for small business after Small Business Week. We must reduce or eliminate the restrictive taxes, unfunded mandates, and burdensome regulations plaguing small businesses. Many Federal bureaucrats and lawmakers do not understand that small businesses do not have the money and personnel to cope with regulatory paperwork. They do not understand that small firms lack a corporate legal department to guide them through a maze of regulatory compliance. And, most importantly, they do not understand that each new tax, mandate, and regulation stifles business expansion, job creation, and economic growth. 
Fortunately, Congress is taking action to foster a healthier environment for entrepreneurs. Reducing the capital gains tax rate is vital to creating jobs and expanding economic growth. Through high capital gains rates the Federal Government penalizes people who take risks and invest their hard-earned income in homes, savings accounts, mutual funds, small and large businesses, or family farms. In addition, this high tax rate threatens American leadership in the global marketplace. The United States has the highest capital gains rate of any major industrialized nation in the world. We cannot expect to remain competitive if we are not on a level playing field with other countries. Lowering the capital gains rate is essential to maintaining a strong economy and supporting the cause of America's small business men and women. 
The bipartisan balanced budget agreement cuts the capital gains tax rate for individuals in the 15-percent tax bracket to 10 percent and for individuals in the 28-percent bracket to 20 percent. It also provides for the exclusion of gain on the sale of a home and indexing for inflation. 
Estate tax reform is also a high priority. Confiscatory estate tax rates are extremely detrimental to small businesses. They depress national savings, discourage entrepreneurial risk, and limit economic growth. Too often, family farms and small businesses are forced out of business after the death of a key family member because the family cannot afford to pay the estate tax. We need to make sure that there is an incentive for entrepreneurs to start small businesses and that there is a way for these small businesses to flourish after an important family member dies. The bipartisan balanced budget agreement also includes a phased-in increase in the unified estate tax credit equivalent to $1 million and inflation indexing. 
While capital gains and estate tax relief have been a major focus of our tax agenda, there are other important small business issues that deserve attention. One of those issues is electronic tax filing. Under a 1993 law, small businesses were required to submit their Federal tax payments electronically beginning this July. However, due to inadequate education and implementation by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), more than 1 million small businesses were very confused about how to transition to the new system, concerned about the possibility of fines and penalties, and frustrated overall with the mandatory nature of this new requirement. Fortunately, relief is on the way. I voted for the supplemental appropriations bill that included an extension of the electronic tax filing deadline from July 1, 1997 to the end of this tax year, December 31, 1997. And the President has already signed this provision into law. 
On another tax issue, I have cosponsored S. 460, the Home-Based Business Fairness Act of 1997. Home-based businesses are one of the fastest growing 
sectors of the economy. There are currently more than 14 million individuals earning income from out of their own homes. As owners of a majority of home-based businesses, women, in particular, have enjoyed astonishing success in this area. There are currently eight million women-owned U.S. businesses which produce $2.3 trillion in sales. Women-owned businesses employ one quarter of all U.S. workers. In light of these trends, we need to open more opportunities for home-based and other entrepreneurial ventures to start, grow, and create jobs. 
The Home-Based Business Fairness Act targets three particular areas. First, it provides 100 percent deductibility for self-employed health insurance costs. Large corporations are currently allowed to deduct the health insurance costs of all of their employees. This bill will allow the self-employed to take advantage of full deductibility as well. A fair and competitive business environment is impossible as long as large corporations have this unfair advantage. 
Second, the Home-Based Business Fairness Act will restore the home-office deduction and make it available to all business owners who perform their essential administrative and management functions only in their homes. This portion of the bill will clarify the ambiguities resulting from the 1993 Supreme Court decision, Commissioner v. Soliman. This decision required the customers of a home business to physically visit the home office and the business owners income to be generated within the home office itself in order to qualify for a deduction. This bill would expand and clarify the home-office deduction by allowing those who perform their services outside the home to benefit from the deduction as long as they use their home for all billing and recordkeeping activities. 
Third, S. 460 clarifies the independent contractor definition. Under current law, small businesses and the self-employed must rely on a complicated and ambiguous 20 point test of IRS guidelines to determine how to classify their workers and what taxes must be paid. The IRS can penalize firms who use self-employed contractors and force them to pay retroactive taxes and fines if they disagree with the worker's classification as an independent contractor. The Home-Based Business Fairness Act will establish a general safe harbor to provide more certainty in determining the independent contractor status and protect against retroactive reclassifications, fines, and penalties. 
On the regulatory front, I have cosponsored the Mandates Information Act of 1997 to help reduce the burden on America's economy of Congressional mandates. In the past, Congress has often acted without adequate information concerning the costs of private sector mandates. These costs are borne by consumers in the form of higher prices and reduced availability of goods; workers, in the form of lower wages, reduced benefits, and fewer job opportunities; and small businesses, in the form of hiring disincentives and stunted growth. 
The Mandates Information Act contains two key provisions to prevent imposition of new mandates on the private sector. First, it establishes an additional procedural hurdle, or shame vote, against any bill containing private sector mandates exceeding $100 million a year. Second, it directs the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to prepare a small business impact statement to inform Members of Congress about a bill's effects on consumer costs, worker wages, and the availability of goods and services. I believe this initiative will help stop the spread of mandates at their source--allowing small businesses to take risks and create new jobs without the added pressure of unfunded Washington requirements. 
Mr. President, during Small Business Week and every week, Congress needs to listen to the men and women who are running Main Street businesses. Today, I speak for only a few minutes to honor the small business owners and employees who spend hours every day trying to fulfill their American dreams. I want to let them know that their elected officials are making some progress on their agenda, but we still have a long way to go. I urge my colleagues not to rest in our efforts to support American free enterprise.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the 1998-99 Reauthorization of the Earthquake Hazard Reduction Act of 1977. This piece of legislation reauthorizes the agencies that are working to reduce earthquake hazards throughout the Nation. These four agencies: The Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], which serves as the lead agency, the U.S. Geological Survey [USGS], National Science Foundation [NSF], and National Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST], each play a critical role in this important mission. 
This bill continues the funding for agency activities including research, hazard assessment, and public education, and moves these activities forward. It also builds upon the national seismic network, improving its capability, and forming the basis for a real-time seismic hazard warning system. A real-time warning system has the potential for saving lives by alerting people outside the immediate area of an impending seismic shock. Advance warning can be critical in preventing injury in many sectors of modern life, such as high-speed trail transportation. 
This reauthorization has an important provision which underscores our commitment to education. This bill would let NSF create and disseminate Earth science educational materials in a way that permits easy access by educators and the general public. Acknowledging that FEMA and NSF have both done an outstanding job in creating educational material, we are looking for continued cooperation of all the agencies, one of the hallmarks of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program [NEHRP]. 
Mr. President, I believe that the passage of this legislation will continue of the good work that these four agencies have been undertaking--work that saves property, but most importantly, saves American lives.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor the Deputy Surgeon General and Acting Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service [USPHS], Rear Adm. Audrey F. Manley, as she retires upon completion of more than 20 years of faithful service to our Nation on July 1, 1997. 
Upon her retirement Rear Admiral Manley will be leaving both the positions of Deputy Surgeon General, which she has held since February 1994, and Acting Surgeon General, which she has held concurrently since January 1995. She has served in each of these capacities with dedication and distinction as a principal Federal health advisor to the Nation on public health matters; advisor to the Assistant Secretary for Health on policy matters pertaining to the USPHS; and leader for approximately 6,200 active duty members of the Commissioned Corps of the USPHS. 
Rear Admiral Manley, a native of Jackson, MS, graduated from Spelman College in Atlanta, GA. She received her medical education at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, TN, and was awarded a master of public health degree from Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health. Her training includes an internship at St. Mary Mercy Hospital in Gary, IN, a residency at Cook County Children's Hospital in Chicago, IL, and various fellowship, research, and teaching experiences. She has also held positions on the faculties of several medical schools. 
Rear Admiral Manley became a member of the Commissioned Corps in 1976. Included among her many assignments are Director of Genetic Services, Bureau of Maternal and Child Health, Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning, Evaluation, and Legislation, and Associate Administrator for Clinical Affairs, Health Resources and Services Administration [HRSA]. In 1987, she was appointed Director of the National Health Service Corps, a HRSA component that furnishes primary health care providers to medically underserved communities throughout the country. In 1989, Rear Admiral Manley became the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health, working with the Assistant Secretary in providing leadership and support across the full spectrum of PHS policy and operational issues. She assisted in directing the eight agencies of the USPHS with a combined budget of $22 billion and 45,000 employees. She was designated Acting Assistant Secretary for Health from January 1993 to July 1993. In July 1993, prior to assuming her current responsibilities, Rear Admiral Manley was named Deputy Assistant Secretary for Intergovernmental Affairs, where she was responsible for 10 PHS Regional Offices and the Office of Emergency Preparedness. In this role she was the principal PHS officer responsible for coordinating the USPHS response to Hurricanes Andrew and Inikki, and Typhoon Omar; the Mississippi flood of 1993; the Los Angeles civil unrest (1991) and the Northridge earthquake of 1994. 
Rear Admiral Manley's awards as a member of the Commissioned Corps include the PHS Meritorious Service Medal, the PHS Commendation Medal, the PHS Unit Commendation Award, the Surgeon General's Exemplary Service Medal, the PHS Distinguished Service Medal, and the Hildrus Poindexter Award. She has also received numerous honors and awards from a wide variety of outside organizations. 
Mr. President, Rear Admiral Manley has truly been a great credit to the Commissioned Corps and the Public Health Service throughout her career. I know that my colleagues are personally aware of her dedicated service to her country, especially during the 2-years plus in which she provided critical leadership as the Nation's Acting Surgeon General. It gives me great pleasure to recognize Rear Adm. Audrey F. Manley and, along with my colleagues, to wish her a fond farewell as she concludes a distinguished career in the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service and assumes duties as the next president of Spelman College.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to today to recognize Macon County--a beautiful county in my home state of Tennessee. 
The people of Macon County are hard and prosperous workers who have never lost touch with their core community values, even as they have responded to our ever changing times. For instance, with their deep roots in tobacco farming, Macon County farmers have had to adapt to rapid changes in agriculture and agribusiness. For many, that has meant expanding to grow alternative crops--like sweet peppers--to remain competitive throughout the Nation. 
Other residents have recognized the value of the area's natural beauty, and the county's tourism has grown as a result. Places like Union Camp Waterfall, Winding Stairs natural rock formation and Red Boiling Springs draw many visitors from Tennessee and throughout the country. 
Every year Macon countians celebrate those values, the success of their community and the common bond they share in many different ways. Whether it's their award-winning county fairs or the perfect balance they have achieved between the county's unique natural features, residents of Macon County can take pride in their work and in themselves. 
Mr. President, the citizens of Macon County are hardworking, forward-thinking individuals dedicated not only to the growth and success of their community, but also to the growth and success of their community spirit. I salute them all.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, vitamin supplements containing the B vitamin folic acid, have been proven to prevent common and disabling birth defects, including spina bifida and anencephaly, if taken daily before and in the early days after conception. This vitamin could prevent six to nine cases of these birth defects per day, saving $245 million per year in the United States. 
On June 10, 1997, the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation released a new nationwide survey which shows that while more American women of childbearing age have heard of folic acid, the proportion of women actually taking a multivitamin on a daily basis remains low. Only 32 percent of women ages 18 to 45 take a daily multivitamin containing folic acid. 
Awareness of folic acid jumped 14 percentages points over the 2-year period, from 52 percent of women in 1995 to 66 percent in 1997. However, women under age 25 are the least likely to consume vitamins daily, with only 23 percent reporting that they do so, and this age group accounts for 39 percent of all births in the United States. It is because of these statistics that I encourage my colleagues to vote for S. 419, the Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1997. 
This legislation would establish a national birth defects surveillance, research, and prevention system. This system would include research projects for the prevention of neural tube defects, one-half of which could be prevented if women of child bearing age consumed a small amount of folic acid daily. In addition, this legislation would set up public education programs to teach more women about the importance of folic acid to the health of their children. 
And so together with the March of Dimes I encourage my colleagues to pass this important legislation.

While I acknowledge the legislation's shortcomings, I support the overall agreement because it is a step in the right direction for our country. 
Before I begin, I want to commend Senator Domenici and the other negotiators for their tireless and unwavering commitment to reaching this agreement. Their leadership serves the American people well. 
Today, this bipartisan balanced budget resolution fulfills a series of promises that we made to the American people. We promised to pass a balanced budget by 2002--reflecting our commitment to economic growth, fiscal responsibility, and the simple principle that our Government should live within its means. Today, the plan before us will achieve that goal. We promised to strengthen Medicare--reflecting our commitment to the health care of senior citizens. Today, the plan before us will extend the solvency of Medicare's part A hospital insurance trust fund for 10 years and make structural reforms that will preserve the program in the future. 
We promised tax relief to help families and promote economic growth--reflecting our belief that the American people, rather than the Federal Government, should make decisions about how to spend, save, or invest their hard-earned income. Today, the agreement before us includes $250 billion in permanent tax cuts over 10 years including a $500-per-child tax credit, capital gains relief, death tax reform, expanded individual retirement accounts [IRA's], and education tax incentives. For every $1 in new spending, we cut taxes $3.50. 
We also promised to reduce the size and scope of the Federal Government. Today, the agreement before us reduces total Government spending $320 billion over 5 years and more than $1 trillion over 10 years. That's savings of $1,200 over 5 years and $3,800 over 10 years for each man, woman, and child in America. In fact, for every new $1 added to this budget, we reduce spending $15. 
In constructing this budget, we promised to reject gimmicks and rosy economic scenarios in our assumptions. Unlike the President's past two budgets, the agreement before us does not include mechanisms that automatically and arbitrarily impose one-time spending cuts or tax increases to eliminate budget shortfalls. It is also based on the conservative economic assumptions of the Congressional Budget Office [CBO], which forecasts economic growth even more conservatively than most private economists at about 2.1 percent annually over the next 5 years. We chose these assumptions so we could err on the side of caution. 
However, even the most conservative assumptions involve a considerable degree of uncertainty. Forecasting the performance of a multi-trillion-dollar economy is far from an exact science. I believe we have done the best we could with the information we have available. But if the agreement does not produce the expected results due to unforeseen circumstances, I will not be discouraged as long as we maintain our focus on a balanced budget and fiscal responsibility. 
Finally, we promised to reject rhetoric and partisan rancor to work together--Republicans and Democrats alike--to achieve results for the American people. In this spirit, we have worked to accommodate the President's priorities, and he has worked to accommodate ours. Today, the agreement before us is the product of countless hours of negotiations between a Democratic President and a Republican Congress. I hope we can continue working in a bipartisan manner. 
Mr. President, I cannot express my support without also outlining my concerns in four particular areas. First, this agreement does not adequately restrain long-term entitlement spending growth to prepare for the Baby Boomers' retirement just over a decade away. In fairness, the authors of this agreement do not claim that it does. But as we approach this new demographic era, we must be acutely aware of this situation. 
Today, 200,000 Americans turn 65 every year. By 2011, 1.5 million Americans will turn 65 every year, a trend that will continue for 20 years. As the elderly population increases, our younger working population will shrink. Today, there are 4.9 workers paying for every retiree's benefits in programs like Social Security and Medicare. In 2030, when we will have many more retirees to support, there will only be 2.8 workers to support each beneficiary. 
This dramatic demographic shift will bring significant economic, political, social, and cultural changes that will transform our society. If we continued on our current spending course, entitlements--our automatic spending programs--and 
interest on the debt would consume all federal revenues in just 15 years--leaving not a single dollar for roads, education, national parks, medical research, defense, or other basic government functions. I believe this agreement will help ease this demographic pressure, but more work lies ahead. We must begin sooner rather than later to deal with these problems fairly and effectively. 
This week, I joined with Senator Kerrey in offering a Sense of the Senate amendment on the need for entitlement reform. Specifically, it encouraged Congress and the President to work to enact structural reforms in entitlement spending in 1997 and beyond which sufficiently restrain the growth of mandatory spending in order to keep the budget in balance over the long term, extend the solvency of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and to avoid crowding out funding for basic government functions, and that every effort should be made to hold mandatory spending to no more than 70 percent of the Federal budget. I am pleased that the Senate adopted this amendment unanimously. While a Sense of the Senate amendment is not binding, I believe it will help lay the foundation for more substantive reforms in the future. 
Medicare is my second concern. As the second largest entitlement in the budget serving more than 38 million seniors, Medicare will have a profound impact on our long-term fiscal health. When we consider that the average two-earner couple receives $117,000 more in benefits than they paid in taxes and premiums and factor in that Medicare is projected to be bankrupt before the baby boomers retire, we see the urgent nature of this problem. While I am encouraged by the bipartisan attempt to modestly restrain Medicare growth, we must redouble our efforts to save and strengthen this vital program through true structural reform. 
In addition to the demographic pressures outlined earlier, Medicare also faces the challenge of delivering 21st century health care through a bureaucratic 1960's delivery system. Clearly, piecing together fair and balanced policy options that achieve the required $115 billion in savings should not be our only goal. Working within the framework of this budget agreement, Congress should adopt structural reforms that tailor the program specifically to seniors' needs. 
These reforms should give beneficiaries more choices among competing health plans--similar to the ChoiceCare proposal introduced by Senator Gregg and my Provider Sponsored Organizations [PSO] bill--while retaining the current fee-for-service option for any senior who wants it. With these options, seniors could choose a plan that covers prescription drugs, a benefit not available under the current program. We also need to educate our young people about the benefits of long-term-care insurance. By changing the structural dynamics of the system, we truly can prepare Medicare for the challenges that await us. 
My third concern involves our investment in research and development. Advances in technology have been responsible for one-third to one-half of our long-term economic growth through improved capital and labor productivity and the creation of new products and services. Despite this important relationship, our Federal investment in research and development has been falling as a percent of our gross national product [GNP] compared to other advanced nations. Unfortunately, this budget agreement does not reverse this troubling trend. 
While some research and development investments such as the National Institutes of Health [NIH] and the National Science Foundation [NSF] are protected, many others are cut. Total Federal research and development funding could fall up to 14 percent over the next 5 years. As a percentage of GNP, it will have dropped more than 30 percent from 1994 to 2002. As a research scientist and chairman of the Commerce Science, Technology, and Space Subcommittee, I believe that underfunding research and development risks our national security and our economic competitiveness. If this trend continues, we will be retreating from investments with a proven record of returns that have made us healthier, wealthier, more productive, and more secure than almost any civilization in world history. 
Finally, my fourth concern is education. Time after time in this Chamber, we have stressed the importance of a balanced budget to our children. With a balanced budget, they can leave the deficit spending of the past behind and look forward to a future of better economic opportunities. To take advantage of these opportunities, our children will need a quality education. I am pleased that education is a priority in this agreement. However, we are not targeting our resources where they are needed most--elementary and secondary education. 
In the President's budget, about 85 percent of the new education spending and tax initiatives are directed toward higher education. This budget agreement is structured in a similar way. These facts are troubling when you consider that only 28 percent of fourth graders are proficient in reading, only 21 percent of eighth graders are proficient in math, and about 30 percent of college freshman must take remedial coursework. 
Our higher education institutions are the envy of the world, but without a stronger K-12 education system, this academic superstructure rests on a foundation of quicksand. I am concerned that our academic success will not last if we do not 
target our resources where there is the greatest need and greatest potential. Ultimately, we should consider targeting at least 50 percent of new education resources toward elementary and secondary education in the future. I urge my colleagues to focus more on this problem. 
Mr. President, as I have mentioned, my vote today is not the final solution to our budget problems. My vote today is merely a down payment on a long-term commitment to my constituents in Tennessee and to all Americans--a commitment to fiscal responsibility. 
The issues raised by this agreement will not disappear if this resolution passes. In fact, we will debate them again and again this year as we implement the agreement in the appropriations and reconciliation process. However, we can build on the momentum of this agreement to recommit ourselves to the discipline and diligence necessary to free our children from debt and unlock the doors of economic opportunity for our future. I look forward to meeting this challenge.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of the amendment before us just introduced by the Senator from Florida which expresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal commitment to biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health is one of the highest priorities in this year's budget resolution. This amendment very simply states that Congress should double the appropriations for the National Institutes of Health over the next 5 years and, in the fiscal year 1998, increase NIH funding by $2 billion. 
I would like to commend my colleague, the Senator from Florida, Senator Mack, for his leadership in bringing this amendment forward today to ensure our commitment short term and long term to biomedical research. I was an original cosponsor with Senator Mack of similar legislation, Senate Resolution 15, introduced on the first day of the 105th Congress, the Biomedical Research Commitment Resolution of 1997, which demonstrated collectively our commitment to increasing biomedical research substantially over the next 5 years. 
I rise as a member of the Senate Budget Committee who has struggled with the effort to balance the budget which we will achieve by the year 2002 and at the same time preserve a strong role, a vital role, a critical role, in biomedical research during the times of obvious fiscal restraint. Historically, Congress has in many ways over the years demonstrated a continued strong support of increased funding for the important work that we all know occurs at the National Institutes of Health. 
The scientific and medical breakthroughs supported by the NIH in the last 50 years have vastly improved our capacity to prevent disease, to diagnose disease, and treat human disease. I contrast my status as a heart and lung transplant surgeon to my father, a family physician who practiced medicine for 50 years, when he started, he carried around most of the knowledge that he needed at that time to treat somebody in his head and most of his tools in a simple black bag. How far we have come because of our commitment to invest in biomedical research. 
As a heart and lung transplant surgeon, I have had the opportunity to see firsthand the great advances which have revolutionized the way we think about disease. As Americans, we benefit every day from the highest quality of health care in the world. And it is vital--it is vital--that we continue to invest for the long term as well as the short term in our research efforts to maintain this high quality. 
The research supported by the NIH has resulted in numerous medical advances. A whole new industry in the postwar period has sprung up that supports and encourages research. For the first time in this postwar period we have had mortality rates more affected by chronic disease than infectious disease. 
I want to speak, as I see the Senator from New Mexico here on the floor, about the Human Genome Project and what we have seen. We are poised today to move into a whole new era that we couldn't have imagined 10 years ago where it is critical that we continue to maintain that investment to see these potential cures, these new ways to make a diagnosis come to fruition. 
The Human Genome Project is an international effort, historic effort, with the goal of understanding and deciphering the human genetic code. The project has achieved already hugely important milestones in our understanding of the molecular basis of disease 
and the crucial role that our genes play in how we function and how disease is caused. This past year we have witnessed the mapping of chromosomal locations for genes related to, as referred to earlier, an inherited aspect of Parkinson's disease as well as a hereditary form of prostate cancer, which was just mentioned by the Senator from New York. The tools of this Human Genome Project have led to the isolation of a gene responsible for hereditary hemochromatosis, an iron in our metabolism disorder which causes multiple organ failure which we didn't understand historically. 
These advances in genetics research are opening the door to our understanding of the causes of disease and giving hope to millions of Americans suffering from genetic disorders. We will see these treatments and we will see these cures for some of the most devastating diseases. 
Again, I have to recognize the Senator from New Mexico, because it is he who deservedly has the title of the father of the Human Genome Project, for his wisdom in launching this project in the United States of America--the very person who has spent all day today and yesterday and will be tomorrow leading us into a balanced budget by the year 2002. The Human Genome Project is a success story for Federal investment in biomedical research. 
In closing, the Human Genome Project is just one example of the many success stories from the National Institutes of Health. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, as a scientist, as someone who has seen, firsthand at the bedside, people die, and who has sat at the bedside of those whom we can have a cure for if we make that investment today, I stress the importance of our continued commitment to this investment so that we can reap these benefits. 
In this spirit, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support passage of this amendment in recognition that the future of our Nation's health and the future of the health of our children is dependent upon our strong investment in biomedical research today. 
Mr. President, I yield my time.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise briefly to make several comments and to review a little bit some of the myth that has surrounded the debate on our attempts to ban a brutal procedure, a procedure called the partial-birth abortion. 
It has been fascinating to watch where we started really about 2 years ago in the evolution of learning about this procedure, recognizing that it is performed, recognizing that it is as close to infanticide as one can possibly get in our civilization today, and to track the misinformation, the organized misinformation campaigns that have been carried out, instigated by a number of parties that have made it all the way to the Presidency of the United States of America--a misinformation campaign that I think and I hope was the reason he vetoed this ban that is so supportive in a bipartisan way by Congress, and that is clearly supported by the American people. 
I give the President the benefit of the doubt because I had the opportunity--I will refer back to it shortly, some of the statements he made in his press conference and the people he brought forward. But since that time--I guess that is what I am excited about--people have come forward and said, even the people who are providing this information, it was a misinformation campaign. People said they lied through their teeth in giving that information to the American people. 
But, in spite of all that, the truth has finally bubbled to the surface. It has bubbled to the surface on the floor of the U.S. Senate and in the House of Representatives, but also throughout the media. Discussions have taken place in hospitals. Discussions have taken place among the organized medical groups. We all recognize that whether it is ACOG, the group of obstetricians and gynecologists, or the American Medical Association, which represents all physicians, that none of these organizations really speak for everybody. But when you put it altogether--and it has been put together, mixed up, dissected and looked at--gradually it is beginning to crystallize in a very clear way. And I think it is worth talking about a little bit on the floor of the U.S. Senate once again. 
On a momentous occasion yesterday, after 2 years of looking at the issue, the American Medical Association essentially said that restricting this procedure is something that should be done by the American people and by the U.S. Congress. Again, this is after a lot of debate, a lot of discussion, and a lot of examination of the facts within the medical community, with the American people, by ethicists and by religious communities. There is a mass movement to ban this brutal procedure which offends the sensibilities of every American, everybody in our civilization today. This procedure, when described, offends their sensibilities. 
I mentioned the American Medical Association. Again, the American Medical Association, the largest physician group in the country, issued a letter yesterday that said really--let me refer to the letter. This is the letter in its entirety. It was written to Senator Santorum, who, obviously, has done a wonderful job, an outstanding job, in helping America understand what the significance of this ban is. 
I will go through the letter. The key sentence is the last sentence. It basically says, `Thank you, for the opportunity'--remember, this is from John Seward, from the American Medical Association, representing their conclusions. 
It says: `Thank you for the opportunity to work with you towards restricting a procedure we all agree is not good medicine.' 
I guess a sentence like that does lead me to question how the President of the United States could continually, every day, hide behind a threat of a veto talking about the health of women, because for health of women we have to look at the American Medical Association, which represents obstetricians, gynecologists, family practitioners, internists, cancer specialists, heart disease--all of these groups of people focus on their No. 1 goal, which is to promote the health of this Nation, the health of individuals. 
Then to have the President stand up and hide behind this veiled threat of a veto having to do with health is a juxtaposition which I don't understand. I hope the President, after we deliver this bill to him, will recognize what health of individuals really is. I am talking about health, not just of the infant, who, in fact, is being sacrificed in this procedure, but also the health of the mother. It requires support of this ban. 
The letter says: 
Dear Senator Santorum: The American Medical Association is writing to support H.R. 1122, `The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997,' as amended * * * the AMA has supported such legislation * * * 
They go on in the first paragraph to say: 
Although our general policy is to oppose legislation criminalizing medical practice or procedure, the AMA has supported such legislation where the procedure was narrowly defined and not medically indicated. 
Narrowly defined, which this ban is. 
There was an attempt last week to take this very narrow ban, carefully proscribed--protections for the mother, protections clearly for the child, protections for the medical profession. An attempt was made last week to push that aside with a much broader issue that needs to be continually debated. But now we are back on the narrow definition. 
The AMA says it is not medically indicated, not medically indicated, not just for the baby but for the mother. It is not medically indicated, according to the American Medical Association, the largest organization representing more physicians than anyone in the United States of America. 
The second paragraph outlines the three principles that, after much discussion and much debate within the AMA, were agreed to: 
First, the bill would allow a legitimate exception where the life of the mother was endangered, thereby preserving the physician's judgment to take any medically necessary steps to save the life of the mother. 
For the life of the mother, any steps can be taken, spelled out very clearly in the bill: 
Second, the bill would clearly define the prohibited procedure so that it is clear on the face of the legislation what act is to be banned. 
The attempt was made last week to ban all abortions, and that needs to be debated. But this bans a very specific procedure--a procedure, I might add, that is performed quite frequently around the country but tends to be performed in abortion clinics, many times outside of peer review of other physicians, very rarely in the hospital where you have nurses around to ask questions, and when you have other physicians around or hospital administrators asking, `What is the ethics of a procedure that so brutally sacrifices an infant upon three-fourths completion of delivery?' 
No, these are performed with relatively high frequency, when you are talking about hundreds or thousands of infants that are, in fact, murdered. But they are being performed outside the peer review and, I would say, the ethics of the medical profession. 
In the letter from the American Medical Association endorsing the bill, supporting the ban, it said:  
Finally, the bill would give any accused physician the right to have his or her conduct reviewed by the State Medical Board before a criminal trial commenced. In this manner, the bill would provide a formal role for valuable medical peer determination in any enforcement proceeding. 
I think this is important to say because as a physician I have to admit before coming to the Senate the idea that this body or the Congress would pass a law to tell me what I could or could not do in terms of what I thought was in the best interest of my patient bothered me, not this particular ban but just the idea of having somebody in Washington, DC, inside the beltway telling me how to practice medicine and then making something a criminal procedure. 
It is easier as a physician to say, no, I don't want any part of anything like that, and I think that is what we were hearing from some of the medical community, a fear that they would be thrown in jail for doing what they think is right for the patient, and they didn't want this to be set as a precedent. I think this letter and the bill shows that, no, that is not what is being done. Basically, we are banning a very specific procedure that is on the fringe, and you are going to have the opportunity for peer review to know what is accepted medical practice even in the event you are accused in this manner. 
Then the letter goes on. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have another 5 minutes.

Mr. FRIST. Then the final sentence, again which really summarizes it, and that is why I started with it: `Thank you for the opportunity of working with you toward restricting a procedure we all agree is not good medicine.' 
I am proud that as Americans we have not lost our ability to discern what is right from what is wrong, and despite the vim of the well-worn rhetoric that we have heard broadly in the media and on the floor in the past, we now have listened to our hearts and we know that nothing can justify a procedure such as this one that is a mere 3 inches--a mere 3 inches--from criminal infanticide. 
Several myths. Myth No. 1. Partial-birth abortion is necessary to preserve the health of the mother. It has been used again and again. The President of the United States continued to use it yesterday; I am sure he will say something about it today until this bill is delivered to him. 
December 13, 1996. President Clinton described a hypothetical situation where without a partial-birth abortion a woman could not--and I use quotations here--`preserve the ability to have further children.' He said that he would not, using his words again, `tell her that I am signing a law which will prevent her from having another child. I am not going to do it,' said the President. 
That is heart wrenching. When you see just that clip, we tend to empathsize with what the President is saying. But the bottom line is partial-birth abortion is never ever necessary to preserve the health of a woman. The College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has issued a statement that said they `could identify no circumstance under which this procedure would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of the mother.' There are always--always--other procedures that will preserve the health of the mother. 
The AMA task force convened on this issue also concluded, `There does not appear to be any identified situation in which intact D&X is the only appropriate procedure to induce abortion.' 
Thus, even if there are health reasons--and health is defined very, very broadly--even if there are health reasons, there are other safer procedures for the mother. 
Myth No. 2. It goes like this. The D&X procedure, partial-birth abortion, is a rare and difficult medical procedure. It is usually performed only in extreme cases to save the life of the woman or in cases of severe fetal abnormalities. 
Well, again, it is just not true. If we look to what Ronald Fitzsimmons said, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, Mr. Fitzsimmons, I think, has shown amazing integrity in coming forward when he said that he admits he--I am using his words--lied through his teeth when he said partial-birth abortion was rarely used or only on women whose lives were in danger. 
In a recent American Medical News article he explained that he could not justify lying to the American people any longer saying--and remember, he was an advocate; he opposed the ban initially. He said, `They are primarily done on healthy women and healthy fetuses, and it makes you feel like a dirty little abortionist with a dirty little secret.' 
It is no longer a secret. It is no longer a secret. We have talked about it in the Chamber. The media understands it. The American people understand it. It is time to ban this procedure. 
Dr. James McMahon, another partial-birth abortion practitioner, testified before Congress that 80 percent of the partial-birth abortions he performed were for purely elective reasons--purely elective reasons. The examples he gave: nine 
babies because they had a little cleft lip, which can be easily repaired today. Many others, at least 39, he said, were aborted because of the psychological and emotional health of the mother, despite the advanced gestational age and health of the child. 
So we can see that if you use a health exception, you have a huge door through which you can drive a truck and continue to perform this procedure. If you throw in a so-called health exception, as good as it sounds, it really goes back to what Doe versus Bolton in 1973, the Supreme Court case defined as health. They defined health to include `all factors--physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age--relative to the well-being of the patient.' 
That is the big door through which, if you are an abortionist, if you do not follow the ethics of the American Medical Association or the medical profession today, you can continue to do this brutal, inhumane procedure by saying, oh, it is for the health of the mother. The mother is a bit down in the dumps because she feels like this baby must be sacrificed, and therefore I can certify and say that is the health of the mother. 
Again, in Doe versus Bolton, the law of the land, the Supreme Court case in 1973 included `all factors--physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age--relative to the well-being of the patient.' People in the abortion industry understand that there are many late-term abortions for social reasons as well as health reasons. It is recognized; people know it. 
A 1993 National Abortion Federation internal memorandum said, `There are many reasons why women have later abortions,' and they include, `Lack of money or health insurance, social psychological crisis, lack of knowledge about human reproduction.' 
So when you see legislation in the Chamber allowing this procedure or even putting in amendments or supposing it should be allowed for health of the mother, just recognize, if that is the case, that anybody--anybody--can continue doing this procedure at the same rate as they do today by providing this huge loophole, which again sounds like it is not a loophole but in practice is a huge loophole. One last myth. 
Mr. President, can I ask for another 5 minutes?

Mr. FRIST. One last myth goes like this. This procedure could possibly be the best procedure in a woman's situation for her health. In other words, now people realize and they didn't really a month ago or 6 months ago, and the President may not realize it today, there are a range of procedures when, for example, it is life of the mother. But there are some people who would say this is the best procedure. 
Let me just say that as a physician, as one who has taken an oath to take care of that individual who comes into the office, who comes into the room, to preserve the life and the health of every patient, I find this very discomforting. I have talked to obstetricians. We have had the quotations in the Chamber. We have consulted many. They have basically told us that this is not the best procedure, that there are other alternative procedures if there is the indication, for example, of life of the mother. Many practitioners had never heard of it. The people in Tennessee, the high-risk obstetricians whom I have talked to across the State of Tennessee, they have not performed this procedure and many have not heard of this procedure. 
Remember, this procedure was fashioned, described--in fact, the only article in the literature that we can really find describing it so it can be presented among other people is from Dr. Haskell, who is not an obstetrician. He is not a board certified obstetrician but, rather, a family-practice medical doctor. These procedures are being performed but not endorsed, not the procedure. Nothing from the obstetrics and gynecologic association has come out and said we support this procedure. 
Now, when people say, well, it could be the best or it could not be the best, that is that noncommittal approach that some physicians have taken. And why? Because there is this great fear that big brother Government, the Federal Government is going to come down and jump into that doctor-patient relationship and tell us what we can or cannot do. That is the fear physicians have. Remember, this bill takes one brutal, unaccepted procedure in the medical profession and bans it. 
Let me just recap and then I will close, Mr. President. We have a brutal, basically repulsive procedure that is specifically designed to kill a living infant outside the birth canal except for the head, specifically designed to kill a living infant outside of the birth canal with only the head remaining inside. The leading providers of women's obstetrical and gynecological services condemn it. They recommend that it not be used. They refuse to endorse it. They highlight its risks for the mother and say that there are other safe and equally effective alternatives available. 
I guess I can understand some of the reasons why those 
practitioners, or a few of them, urge us not to ban it. They say it would be violating the sanctity of the physician-patient relationship. Mr. President, as a physician, as one who has taken the same oath to preserve the health and the life of others, and I also say as a father, I submit that any provider who performs this partial-birth abortion procedure has already violated that sanctity, that sanctity of the physician-patient relationship. The AMA, in essence, has said that when they say they appreciate the opportunity to work with us toward restricting a procedure which all agree is not good medicine. Partial-birth abortions cannot and should not be categorized with other medical procedures. They should not be allowed in a civilized country. 
With the reintroduction of the partial-birth abortion ban legislation in the Senate, we have the opportunity right now to right a wrong. Now, once again, the American people are calling upon us to listen not to our political advisers, not to listen to the various interest groups that come forward but to listen to our conscience. It is going to take moral courage to stop propaganda which is going to continue to come forward. It is going to take moral courage to make sure that good information makes it all the way to the President of the United States when he has to decide whether or not to veto this piece of good legislation. But we all, including the President, have at our disposal today the information with which to do the right thing. 
So for the sake of women, and I think women especially, for the sake of their children, and really for the sake of our society, our society as a future civilization, we must put a stop once and for all to partial-birth abortion. I support the ban and urge all of my colleagues today, when we vote in several hours, to support the ban, and I urge the President not to veto this very good piece of legislation.  
Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself approximately 10 minutes. 
Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Feinstein-Boxer substitute amendment in large part because the substitute amendment fails to address what is the underlying bill on the floor; that is, to ban the partial-birth abortion procedure, a procedure that we all recognize to be one that is brutal, that is unnecessary, and that is repulsive to our civilization today. 
I feel that is what we need to ban, that specific procedure which has been described on this floor again and again in detail, that is shocking to us each time we hear it, as well as shocking to America. 
The Feinstein-Boxer amendment shifts the focus away from that procedure which we are attempting to ban and to prohibit, and enters another area, another region, that I think needs to be debated. I appreciate the fact that Members on both sides of the aisle say that debate deserves our attention and our discussion. But the problems I have using this as a substitution amendment is twofold. 
No. 1, the substitution amendment really does--this is my opinion--nothing to decrease the number of abortions that are being performed in this country. I will come back to that and explain why. 
No. 2, to use it as a substitution, I think, we cannot do, and, therefore, I oppose the amendment, because it still allows the underlying procedure of the partial-birth abortion, which, again, graphically has been described as a fetus, a viable fetus, with otherwise normal life to be delivered shortly, be delivered partially, and then killed. It is still allowed under the Feinstein-Boxer substitution amendment. 
I will speak to the first point, because a lot of people will assume that the Feinstein-Boxer substitution amendment encompasses a much broader bill, and I think that is the way it is intended. 
Let me go back to the amendment as written. This is the Feinstein-Boxer amendment. `It shall be unlawful for a physician knowingly to perform an abortion after the fetus has become viable.' 
I agree with that and wholeheartedly support that, and I agree with the sponsors. I think the majority of people in this body think that is good, that that is the right direction. But where I have a very significant problem, and a problem that has not been talked very much about on the floor but I think that we must address if we are to consider this amendment in its entirety, is the exception clause. The exception law says what I just said--it does not apply if, in the medical judgment of the attending physician, the abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the woman. 
Again, I think most of us would agree with that wholeheartedly. But concerning the part of the exception that says, `or to avert serious adverse health consequences to the woman.' 
Again, let me say my sensitivities to the health consequences are as strong as everyone. I have taken a Hippocratic oath where I am totally dedicated as a physician to the health of the patient before me. 
But, from the practical standpoint, `serious adverse health consequences' is a huge exception that people will drive through to potentially perform more abortions than we see today. On the surface, it sounds so right, but, in truth, when you say `health consequences,' to lay people it may seem something else. But it is also such a loophole, such an exception, that people can take advantage of it. There are people out there who do. 
Yesterday, I cited on the floor Dr. McMahon of California, who is deceased, but who testified before committees in this body that he performed 39 abortions for depression; a mother's depression. Does that depression mean that she felt bad for a few days, or a few weeks and, therefore, this fetus was killed; this viable fetus who would otherwise be alive today was killed? I cited 9 cases where the infant's cleft lip was cited to be the indication and, therefore, yes. A mother could say that, `I am depressed because my child will have a cleft lip.' 
But does that justify killing an otherwise viable fetus? The whole issue of health is complicated. I have gone back to my colleagues again and again saying, can you give me a good definition of health that we could write down, that we could put in statute and that people would agree with? 
Well, we all turn back to Doe versus Bolton and the definition of health as defined by Doe versus Bolton in 1973 in the Supreme Court decision, and there health is defined as `all factors, physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age, relevant to the well-being of the patient.' 
As a physician, those are the sort of factors that you have to consider when you are talking to a patient--their overall well-being. But does it justify killing a viable fetus, a fetus that by definition of viability is alive, once taken out at that point in time, if taken out of the womb, will survive, will live? You are saying that some of these factors, the overall well-being, the psychological factors at that point in time, can be used to justify killing that otherwise viable fetus. I say no, and most people say `no'. Yet we know, and it has been cited in the Chamber, that people use that definition of health to perform, in the third trimester, procedures broadly--abortions, including a specific procedure we should outlaw under all conditions, the partial-birth abortion procedure. 
What I have done is really gone back to talk to my colleagues to ask them, and I have asked them point blank, is there a time when it is necessary to destroy a viable fetus--remember, a viable fetus. And the definition I looked up in my old Steadman's Medical Dictionary, the classic dictionary that we use as physicians. `Viable' is defined as `denoting a fetus sufficiently developed to live outside the uterus.' A viable fetus, the fetus that is taken out of the womb at that point in time is alive, is a baby, will grow up to live a full life. 
Thus, are there really any situations where we can kill that otherwise viable fetus, full of life? And you say, well, life of the mother. There is general agreement that that may be--may be--may be a consideration. That is put in the statute. But what about health consequences, adverse health consequences which have been defined in Doe versus Bolton to use the emotional factors and psychological factors? It says in here that an individual physician determines whether or not those health consequences are adverse or not. 
Well, that goes all over, all over the field. As a physician who deals in end-of-life issues myself, I transplant hearts, so an adverse health condition to me might mean something very different than to a cardiologist who does not do heart surgery or transplant hearts. The same is true of physicians. Adverse health consequence is going to vary from physician to physician. 
We have seen in a report, as I have said, Dr. McMahan in California doing 39 abortions for depression itself--again, depression. Is that treatable? Would it have been gone in 1 week or 2 weeks? Or that cleft lip, which is disturbing--it would be disturbing to many of us as parents--is that justification for allowing an exception in an amendment to abort fetuses in that third trimester, or viable fetuses? That viability, I think, is a good definition in many ways because, remember, that child would live just taken out of the womb. Why kill a viable fetus under any situation? It really seems that this amendment should rise or fall on this whole concept of serious adverse health consequences.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 more minutes. 
While that may sound reasonable to some, it misses the point. In the case when the life or health of a mother is in jeopardy and her fetus has reached a chance of survival outside the womb-- 
As an aside, that is viability-- (currently 24 weeks), physicians can deliver that child by either cesarean section or induction of labor without compromising the mother. 
Dr. Frank Boehm, the Nashville Tennessean May 13, 1997. 
Adverse health consequences, a huge door, a huge door that the medical profession is not going to agree on from one person to another. 
Well, what this amendment, unfortunately, does, by putting this exception in there, it says that, no, you do not do abortions after the fetus has become viable except under adverse health conditions, which means, as a physician, if you say there is an adverse health condition, go do the abortion, go kill a viable fetus, an individual who by definition will grow up and live a full life, a viable fetus. 
Mr. President, let me just go back and say I oppose the amendment on substance itself, but even that aside, I would argue that it does not do what the intent of the underlying bill does, and that is to outlaw a brutal and unnecessary, a malicious procedure which destroys life, and that is the partial-birth abortion procedure. It should be banned. 
I yield the floor. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. FRIST. I rise in opposition to the Daschle amendment. I also want to congratulate him because I know he worked very, very, very hard with people around the country to fashion an amendment that would, as narrowly as possible, define `health,' which I really think this debate is balanced on, `health of the mother.' 
He has done his very, very best. But what he has tried is impossible. It has not been done in this bill. And I think it probably cannot be done, defining the `health of the mother' in such a narrow, narrow fashion. 
His proposal is a substitution bill and, thus, that means he would put aside what the underlying bill does, and that is to ban the partial-birth abortion procedure, a procedure that we all know is brutal, that is vicious, that is a fringe procedure and that destroys life. We have heard very little today that this is not a vicious, brutal procedure. 
Thus, I think the Daschle amendment attempts to shift the focus away from the underlying bill that is banning this vicious procedure, and I think it is not going to be accepted tonight. I urge opposition and voting against it because I think, even if you look at the substance of it, it does nothing--it does nothing--to decrease the number of abortions in this country. And I will come back and cite why. 
No. 2, his bill, an amendment which is a substitution amendment, would still allow this vicious procedure to be performed if certain criteria are met. 
This procedure should be outlawed. It should be banned. Again, we have seen the graphs and we have seen the charts. 
Let me refer to the paper `Dilation and Extraction for Late Second Trimester Abortion' by Martin Haskell, presented at the National Abortion Federation, Risk Management Seminar, September 13, 1992. This describes the procedure in medical terms, not with charts, not with cartoons and not with all the other figures. Basically, we have gone through it before. This is a medical paper. But it says: 
When the instrument appears on the sonogram screen, the surgeon is able to open and close its jaws to firmly and reliably grasp a lower extremity. The surgeon then applies firm traction to the instrument causing an inversion of the fetus . . . and pulls the extremity into the vagina. . . . 
With a lower extremity in the vagina, the surgeon uses his fingers to deliver the opposite lower extremity, then the torso, the shoulders and the upper extremities. . . . 
At this point, the right-handed surgeon slides the fingers of the left hand along the back of the fetus and `hooks' the shoulders of the fetus with the index and ring fingers (palm down). . . . 
While maintaining this tension, lifting the cervix and applying traction to the shoulders with the fingers of the left hand, the surgeon takes a pair of blunt, curved Metzenbaum scissors in the right hand. He carefully advances the tip, curved down, along the spine and under his middle finger until he feels it contact the base of the skull under the tip of his middle finger. 
Reassessing the proper placement of the closed scissors tip and safe elevation of the cervix, the surgeon then forces the scissors into the base of the skull or into the foramen magnum. Having safely entered the skull, he spreads the scissors to enlarge the opening. 
The surgeon removes the scissors and introduces a suction catheter into this hole and evacuates the skull contents. With the catheter still in place, he applies traction to the fetus, removing it completely from the patient. 
This is not somebody's description of the procedure.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the American Medical Association has afforded to me a statement, because a number of people on both sides have mentioned the board of trustees report. The Senator from Louisiana just quoted it. Let me say that the trustee report that people have been referring to has not been approved, has not been approved by the American Medical Association. 
It is OK for people to cite it, I would think, but it does not become AMA policy until it is approved by the house of delegates. And it has not yet been approved. It has not been sent to the house of delegates yet. 
No. 2, it has been suggested that the AMA supports one side or the other. It was suggested earlier that the AMA is for the Daschle amendment. I quote the AMA in a press release released about 30 minutes ago. `The report,'--meaning the board of trustees report--`does not directly address any pending legislation regarding `partial-birth abortion.' The AMA does not support any legislative proposals at this time.' So I think we need to make that very clear. 
So the substitution bill--amendment really--addresses a whole different issue, not the procedure that we are here to ban, this vicious procedure. 
But let us look at the piece of legislation that the Democratic leader has introduced. This is a real problem, a real fundamental problem. I do say this as a physician, as somebody who spent 4 years in medical school, somebody who is board trained. I have my boards in general surgery. We are talking about surgical procedures. I spent about 14 years in trauma centers. When we talk about trauma, we talk about the heart and pulmonary hypertension and we talk about other related diseases. 
So I want to comment, with that as my background. And I have delivered babies. I am not an obstetrician, but I do want people to know I know a little bit about the medical literature. I want to comment on my view as a U.S. Senator, but also as a physician. 
Basically, this bill says that: It shall be unlawful for a physician knowingly to perform an abortion after the fetus has become viable unless the physician certifies that the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life--I think most people agree with everything so far--or risk grievous injury to her physical health. That is the problem. `Grievous injury' is not a medical term. It is not even accepted as a medical term. It is not in the medical dictionary. It is a term that was crafted, I think, by the Democratic leader to try to allay people's feelings. 
It defines `grievous injury' as `a severely debilitating disease.' Well, again that sounds pretty good, but I can tell you what is a severely debilitating disease to one physician is not going to be the same to another. To me, in heart disease, a severely debilitating disease is when a patient is going to die in 3 months. 
To other physicians, a severely debilitating disease would be maybe some heart attack. To me, that is not severely debilitating. But another physician thinks a heart attack is severely debilitating. Why? Because I am a heart transplant surgeon. The people I see are all, without intervention, going to die shortly. 
My point is that `severely debilitating disease' depends on who the person is, who the physician is, what his or her experiences are. 
Depression. Is that a severely debilitating disease? 
Remember, 39 cases--Dr. McMahon in California has been cited earlier. There were 39 cases in which he did the procedure called or referred to as a partial-birth abortion. In 39 cases he did it for depression--he did it for depression. Is that a severely debilitating disease or is that a physical disease? 
I can tell you today that if somebody is depressed, it is going to affect them physically. It might affect their heart rate. It is going to affect their attitude. They may not have any appetite. You cannot separate mental health from physical health, especially in a bill or statute like this. I cannot do it as a physician. I will guarantee you, other physicians cannot. 
So to throw physical health in there to attempt to narrow this down does not work. It just does not work. We know that physical health influences mental health and mental health influences physical health. We do know that abortions are performed today for depression, for emotional reasons. And this bill has a huge loophole by this definition of `grievous injury' meaning `severely debilitating disease.' 
The only other definition of `grievous injury' in this amendment is `impairment specifically caused by the pregnancy.' 
I have done five heart transplants on cardiomyopathy, postcardiomyopathy people who I have transplanted. Those five women are alive. Their children are alive. Did their pregnancy cause the cardiomyopathy or the bad pumping heart that I had to replace? I do not know if it caused it or not, was associated with it. But it says for `grievous 
injury,' `a severely debilitating disease or impairment specifically caused by the pregnancy.' I have taken hearts out of people that I guess one could say was caused by the pregnancy. They had normal children. But I am a little hesitant to allow this loophole as well. 
It comes down to supporting, I think, this whole big loophole. We know that in Doe versus Bolton in 1973, health is defined as `all factors: physical, emotional, psychological, mental, the women's age relevant to the well-being of the patient.' And that is the problem. The health can be anything you want it to be. It can be emotional health, physical health, mental health. And it is really hard to separate out the two. In fact, I would say it is impossible as a physician to separate physical from mental health. It is impossible to do. 
I am a trauma surgeon. I am a heart surgeon, lung surgeon. I have my boards in cardiothoracic surgery and general surgery. But I am not an obstetrician. So I simply called my expert friends around and asked them a very specific question. Point blank, is there ever a time when it is necessary to destroy a viable fetus? Remember, a viable fetus is one that, at the point in time when you took it out of the womb, would live, would grow up, have a job, have a family. Do you ever destroy that opportunity? Is it ever necessary for the health of the mother, physical or otherwise, ever necessary for emotional reasons or financial reasons or social reasons, which all can be called health, but necessary for her physical health? And the answer--the answer--is a resounding `No.' 
So, while I support the Democratic leader's attempt to narrow the definition, it cannot be done. It is not done in this amendment, and I would contend that it cannot be done.

Mr. FRIST. This letter from Dr. Koop is dated May 13, 1997. It is a letter to me. It says the following: 
Dear Bill: 
It is never necessary to destroy a viable fetus in order to preserve the health of the mother. Although I can't think of an example, if it were deemed beneficial for the mother to be without the fetus, it could be delivered by induction or C section. Abortion is truly more traumatic than either and exposes the mother to future problems with an incompetent cervix, miscarriage, and infertility. 
Sincerely yours, C. Everett Koop. 
The first sentence: `It is never necessary to destroy a viable fetus in order to preserve the health of the mother.' 
That is from Dr. Koop. 
Steadman's Dictionary, the dictionary we use to define `viable fetus' denotes a fetus that is `sufficiently developed to live outside the uterus.' 
As a physician, I have tried to think of a circumstance where you can justify destroying that viable fetus. I cannot. Not only do we have alternatives, which we have--the delivery of a normal child. 
So I asked a number of people, and my colleagues have said, no, they cannot think of a circumstance. So it seems to me to be pretty simple. When you have a viable fetus, once it is removed from the womb or leaves the womb, do you kill it? Do you allow it to progress to delivery? Or do you allow the pregnancy to continue throughout the entire 9 months? Remember, it is a viable child. 
So, Mr. President, I think we see, as we step back, that we have an underlying bill that is brutal, vicious, that we need to ban--and that is the partial-birth abortion. The attempt today has been made to put that bill aside, put in a bill which basically cannot define the health of the mother, that leaves a huge loophole that I contend might even increase the number of abortions, because once you put in writing what this loophole is, everybody is going to say that the health of the mother is debilitating, is grievous. And once that is certified by a physician, all of a sudden you do the procedure. You can even do a partial-birth abortion, this vicious procedure, if you meet that certification criteria laid out in the bill. 
Mr. President, I feel strongly--feel strongly--that we must defeat the Daschle proposal, that it does not address the underlying issue. I urge all of my colleagues to support and continue to support the ban on the partial-birth abortion.

Mr. FRIST. Thank you, Mr. President. 
In closing, I simply also urge opposition to the Daschle amendment and support for the underlying bill to ban partial-birth abortion. 
The Daschle amendment, although well-intended and with a good, strong effort to narrow the definition of health of the mother, simply does not accomplish what it intends. The bill tries to close the loophole. It is a loophole in the sense that there are many people, unfortunately, who exploit the definition of health of a mother to their benefit, to perform abortions very late, second trimester, third trimester. Unfortunately, there are people like that. We have heard about them. We have described their cases. Some of them exploit the loophole of health of the mother to use the partial-birth-abortion procedure. 
I have argued that the Daschle amendment does not outlaw, does not ban, the partial-birth abortion. And if the criteria are met in his bill, people will still be performing the partial-birth procedure. 
Second, the bill, although it tries to narrow the definition, fails. Why? Because you can't separate physical health from mental health, from emotional health. That is why you can't define health of the mother so narrowly. 
Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to deliver babies as a physician, as a resident in training. It is a miraculous process. It is a beautiful process to see and help deliver that child, to come into the real world. Many of us as fathers have participated in that process. 
Remember, we are talking about banning a procedure that at one point in time in this miraculous, this beautiful process is said to be OK, but 1 second later, 3 inches later, we call it murder. 
It is a procedure that is brutal, inhumane, and deeply offensive to our sensibilities as human beings. It must and should be banned.

Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I rise today to speak on the issue of partial-birth abortions. We know that public opinion on abortion is deeply divided, and reasoned debate too often degenerates into the shouted distortions of polarized parties. As elected leaders, we have a responsibility to resist the temptation of knee-jerk politics and carefully sift the facts from among the chaff of many fictions. 
Americans, pro-life and pro-choice, Democrat and Republican, have united in opposition to partial-birth abortions because this issue transcends the politics of abortion. As a society, we have been shocked to realize we have allowed doctors to perform a procedure that is a mere 3 inches from infanticide. The nature of this brutal procedure has so shocked us that many pro-choice Americans fear that women and their circumstances will be forgotten in a backlash. 
Fear has driven many activists to turn to deception for a defense. Understandable possibly, but unfortunate. As a physician, I know that women's health will never be served in the long term by myth and by deceit. Therefore, as we debate this procedure this afternoon, this evening, and tomorrow, I appeal to my colleagues to represent the facts accurately. Again and again, we have had to come to the floor to address the fallacies perpetuated by the opponents of the ban. 
As a case in point, I would like to read an excerpt to illustrate the first myth, the myth that we have heard again and again, and the myth is that partial-birth abortion is necessary to preserve the health of the mother. 
This myth really has been used as the primary objection, to the ban on partial-birth abortion. President Clinton has cited the absence of a health exception as his primary reason for carrying out the veto of the ban last year. In an Associated Press interview on December 13, 1996, President Clinton described a hypothetical situation where, without a partial-birth abortion, a woman could not `preserve the ability to have further children.' He said that he would not `tell her that I am signing a law which will prevent her from having another child. I am not going to do it.' 
The scenario described by President Clinton is heart wrenching, and is something that people listen to. It grabs their attention. But his claim about partial-birth abortion is entirely fictional. Partial-birth abortion is never necessary to preserve the health of a woman. 
The College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recently issued a statement admitting that their select panel on partial-birth abortion `could identify no circumstances under which this procedure would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of the mother.' 
Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed into Record the entire statement of policy.

Mr. FRIST. Madam President, in addition, the AMA task force entitled `The Report of the Board of Trustees,' convened on this very issue, concluded that `There does not appear to be any identified situation in which intact D&X'--their attempt to coin a phrase the procedure we call partial birth abortion--`is the only appropriate procedure to induce abortion,' and they admitted that `ethical concerns have been raised about intact D&X.' 
Madam President, I will read the second myth. It comes directly from a Planned Parenthood press release. It says: `The D&X abortion is a rare and difficult medical procedure. It is usually performed in the most extreme cases to save the life of the woman or in cases of severe fetal abnormalities.' 
That is taken from Allen Rosenfeld, dean of the Columbia School of Public Health, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, press release of June 15, 1995. 
This simply is not true. I direct my colleagues' attention to the recent admissions of Ronald Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers. Mr. Fitzsimmons has shown amazing integrity and courage by stepping forward and really coming clean on this misinformation campaign surrounding this bill. While he himself opposes and is very adamant when he speaks to all of us that he opposes the ban on philosophical reasons, he admits that he `lied through his teeth' when he said that partial-birth abortion was used rarely and only on women whose lives were in danger or whose fetuses were damaged. 
He said he just went out there to `spout the party line.' In a recent American Medical News article in March of 1997, he explained that he could no longer justify lying to the American people, saying, `You know they're primarily done on healthy women and healthy fetuses, and it makes you feel like a dirty little abortionist with a dirty little secret.' 
I admire him for his integrity in coming forth. 
Let me quote another partial-birth practitioner, Dr. James McMahon. He aborted nine babies simply because they had a cleft lip. Many others, at least 39, were aborted because of the psychological and emotional health of the mother, despite the advanced gestational age and health of the child. Another practitioner, Dr. Martin Haskell claims that 80 percent of the partial-birth abortions he performed were for `purely elective' reasons. 
So, in summary, we can categorically dismiss claims that the procedure is necessary for the health of the mother and that most of these babies are severely deformed. 
Women always have safe and effective alternatives to partial-birth abortion in any trimester. The Washington Post put it this way: `It is possible--and maybe even likely--that the majority of these abortions are performed on normal fetuses, not on fetuses suffering genetic or developmental abnormalities. Furthermore, in most cases where the procedure is used, the physical health of the woman * * * is not in jeopardy.' 
That is from the Washington Post of September 17, 1996. 
I submit that part of the confusion on this issue is due to the deliberate manipulation of the collective sympathy that we all have when we talk about the health of the mother. When the President of the United States defends his veto of the partial-birth abortion ban on the grounds that he wants to protect women's health, most people assume that he is talking about women's physical health. I imagine that most Americans would actually be surprised to learn that babies in the late second and early third trimesters may be legally aborted for reasons other than the life and/or the physical health of the mother. What the President does not tell you is that under Doe versus Bolton, a 1973 Supreme Court case, health is defined to include `all factors--physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and a woman's age--relevant to the well-being of the patient.' 
A broad definition of health. 
People in the abortion industry understand that there are many late-term abortions performed for social reasons as well as health 
reasons. A 1993 National Abortion Federation internal memorandum acknowledged, `There are many reasons why women have later abortions,' and they include `lack of money or health insurance, social-psychological crises, lack of knowledge about human reproduction, et cetera.' So when you see legislation come to the floor of the U.S. Senate to allow late-term abortions if the mother's health is at risk, just remember how health is being defined--so broadly that you can drive a truck through it. 
Unfortunately, opponents of the bill don't stop there. You will hear a third carefully crafted myth that goes something like this. 
This procedure, if not wildly accepted, could possibly be the best procedure in a particular woman's situation. 
As a physician, I have a sworn commitment to preserve the life and health of every single patient. So I have taken the liberty of calling and checking with people around the country, checking with key obstetricians and abortion providers all across this Nation. From the outset, I will admit that it has been difficult for me to imagine how a procedure that is not taught in residency programs where obstetricians are trained--it is not taught today; it is not referenced in our peer review journals, which is really the substance, the literature through which we teach each other, and share information; it is not in peer review journals--it is a little bit hard for me to understand how people could argue that this is the best procedure available. Really until the recent controversy, many practitioners who you talk to had never heard of this particular procedure. 
On the other hand, a lot of my medical colleagues--they rightly fear the Government coming in and trying to control everything that they do in their practice--have said that this procedure could be the best alternative in a given situation. They have not endorsed it. They have not listed specific medical indications for the procedure, and they have not even recommended that it be used in most circumstances, but they have said--again, with this great fear that the Federal Government will come in and control everything that they do--that the physician should retain the right to use this procedure if a circumstance should hypothetically arise in which an individual might think it is the best option. 
But when questioned about this very specific issue, the ACOG president of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Dr. Fredric Frigoletto, maintains that, `There are no data to say that one of the procedures is safer than the other.' When asked why the statement then said that the procedure `may be the best' in some cases, Dr. Frigoletto answered, `or it may not be.' 
That interview is from the American Medical News, March 3, 1997. 
Moreover, Dr. Warren Hern, author of the textbook Abortion Practice, the Nation's really most widely used textbook on abortion procedures and abortion standards, said, `I have very serious reservations about this procedure * * * You really can't defend it * * * I would dispute any statement that this is the safest procedure to use.' 
Dr. Hern specializes in late-term abortions. 
Incidentally, Madam President, I would like to note that it is difficult from a medical perspective to categorically describe late-term surgical abortions as the best option. In the first place, medical, nonsurgical, late-term abortion methods are generally regarded as superior to surgical methods. 
Second, the National Abortion Federation concedes that at this point in time residents may not receive enough training in abortion to `be truly competent.' 
Third, Dr. Haskell who, is considered to be one, if not the creator, of the creators of the procedure we are talking about, specifically acknowledged in his paper that a disadvantage of the partial-birth procedure was that it requires a `high degree of surgical skill.' 
So let me just recap briefly. You have a brutal, basically 
repulsive procedure designed to kill a living infant outside of the birth canal--except for the head. Leading providers of women's obstetrical and gynecological services condemn it. They recommend it not be used. They refuse to endorse it. They highlight its risks, and say that there are other safe and effective alternatives available. But for political reasons--and I understand the politics involved--they urge us not to ban it because that would be violating the sanctity of the physician-patient relationship. 
Madam President, as a physician and as a father, I submit that any provider who performs a partial-birth abortion has already violated that sanctity of the physician-patient relationship. 
Another myth: Medical procedures should never, under any circumstances, be criminalized. 
It is a myth that I thought about. I would like to defer to this matter to the American Medical Association which concedes that there are circumstances where Government intervention, even in the form of criminalization of specific medical procedures, is appropriate. 
I am quoting now from the letter of AMA Executive Vice President P. John Seward, M.D., to Representative Cardin: He says:  
AMA's generic policy calls for opposition to the criminalization of medical procedures and practices. Therefore, on the surface, it would seem obvious for the AMA to oppose this bill. However, our policy cannot be applied without context. For example, the AMA has a strong ethical and policy position against . . . the practice some have called `physician-assisted suicide' and we have opposed efforts to legalize such activities even though current law could be considered the criminalization of a medical procedure. 
The context in the case of partial-birth abortion, as in the case of physician-assisted suicide, is the time-honored Hippocratic principle, `First do no harm.' An additional component of the context is the reality that this procedure is not endorsed by the medical academy, and is made unnecessary by other widely used, safe and effective options. 
Those of us in this room have followed this debate for 2 years now, some for much longer. From day one, there has been a pattern of manipulation, deception, misinformation, and coverup; even at the risk of harming women's health. 
There is one final myth that has been perpetuated, and then I will yield the floor. 
Those of us in opposition to the partial-birth abortion have had to dispel the notion--actually dangerous to women's health--that their babies would be killed if they took anesthesia for any reason during pregnancy. 
Let me quote again from some pro-choice literature trying to appease women's fears about partial-birth abortion by asserting that the baby is already dead when the doctor plunges the scissors into the back of the baby's head. 
`The fetus dies of an overdose of anesthesia given to the mother intravenously.' 
That is from a Planned Parenthood fact sheet. 
No. 2. `Neurological fetal demise is induced, either before the procedure begins or early on in the procedure, by the steps taken to prepare the woman for surgery.' 
That is from the National Abortion Federation news release July 1995. It is simply not true. I will turn to the president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists who personally came to Capitol Hill to refute this argument, and he basically, in testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that intravenous anesthesia would not kill the baby. He said: 
`In my medical judgment, it would be necessary in order to achieve neurological demise of the fetus in a partial-birth abortion to anesthetize the mother to such a degree as to place her own health in serious jeopardy.' 
Now, in closing, we have heard many eloquent statements today, and we will likely hear them tomorrow, in defense of this brutal and inhumane procedure, but in the words of the great poet Milton, `All is false and hollow.' Despite the preponderance of evidence, we are compelled to again listen to arguments designed solely to `make the worse appear the better reason,' and we must continue to address deceptions designed to `perplex and dash' honest counsel. There is no excuse at this stage of the game for not knowing the truth, the absolute truth. There is no room--no room any longer to pretend that this procedure is necessary for the health of the mother or that it might be the best. It is time, as Mr. Fitzsimmons so plainly put it, for `the [abortion] movement to back away from the spins and half truths.' 
Partial-birth abortions cannot and should not be categorized with other medical procedures or even other abortions. They should not be allowed in a civilized country. With the reintroduction of the partial-birth abortion ban legislation in the Senate, we have the opportunity to right now to right a wrong, and now once again the American people are calling on us to listen not to political advisers, not to radical interest groups--but to our conscience. It will take moral courage to put a stop to the propaganda, but we all have the means at our disposal to do the right thing. For the sake of women, for the sake of their children, and for the sake of our future as a society, we must put a stop once and for all to partial-birth abortion. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong opposition, as well, to this amendment before the Senate, put forth by the Senator from Washington, an amendment which would instruct local education agencies to set out their own policy, a potentially very different policy, in disciplining students with disabilities. In short, under his amendment, each school district potentially would have its own distinct policy in disciplining disabled children, and with 16,000 school districts, the potential for conflicting policies is very real, and I am afraid this would be a turnback to the pre-1975 era before IDEA. 
Is this a double standard? I say `no.' Clearly, we have outlined a process whereby students, if there is a manifestation of a disability, would go down one process, and if a discipline problem was not a manifestation of a disability, that student would be treated just like everyone else. 
I think this is fair. This is equitable. Remember, if behavior is not a result of that disability, all students are treated the same in this bill. If behavior is secondary to a disability, there is a very clear process, which is outlined in detail. Yes, it does take several pages to outline that, but it sets up a balance between the school, between school boards, between parents, and between children. 
Senator Gorton claims this amendment is about local control, and I feel that it will be used, I am afraid, to turn back the hands of the clock to the pre-1975 conditions where we know that children with disabilities were excluded from the opportunity to receive a free and appropriate public education. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, not just because, as has been pointed out, it will kill our overall bipartisan effort that we brought forward, but that it would, in fact, turn back the clock and lead, potentially, to discrimination that children with disabilities faced before IDEA was enacted 22 years ago.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this amendment would require a court before awarding attorney fees to prevailing parents to do an analysis of the impact of the award on the local school district. The point is that the court already has the discretion to assess the impact of an award on a school district. Thus, this is 
unnecessary. Awarding fees today is at the court's discretion. This amendment would actually require a formal cost analysis, an additional bureaucratic burden on a school district. It is unnecessary. It is covered in the underlying bill. I urge opposition to the amendment.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise very briefly to say that this bill is about education. This bill is about children. Today we have seen a real victory for the over 40 million individuals with disabilities in this country, but especially the 5 million children, individuals with disabilities, who will benefit--who will benefit--from this modernized, updated Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. 
The bipartisan vote of 98-1 shows the Republicans and Democrats are working together, have worked together, and will continue to work together to ensure that individuals with disabilities have the same opportunities that every other American has to achieve the utmost potential for themselves. It was a bicameral bill. I am delighted the House passed it, the exact same bill, just 2 days ago. 
I want to thank people from my staff, including Sue Swenson, Dave Egnor, Robert Stodden, Dave Larson, Pat Morrissey, Bob Silverstein, and Tom Irvin from the minority staff who helped me so much over the last 2 years, and once again, I thank Dave Hoppe, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Harkin for their leadership, for their experience, and their wisdom in passing this bill today. It is a victory for education, a victory for children, a victory for all Americans.

Mr. FRIST. I thank the Chair. 
The amendment that I wish to talk to is the amendment on discipline which would instruct local education agencies to set their own policy in disciplining disabled students. In short, each school district could then have its own distinct policy defined for itself in how to discipline children with and without disabilities. I oppose such an amendment. 
A statement was made that the underlying bill is leading us in the wrong direction and that this amendment would set us back in the right direction, at least in that one area of discipline. I disagree. 
In the statement, the case was cited that there were two schoolchildren sitting together, one with a disability and one without a disability, and that they both should be treated exactly the same. 
I would argue that that is difficult to do. Let me give two brief examples where I find it hard to have a different process other than the one spelled out by Senator Jeffords and as spelled out in the definitions. And, yes, it is several pages long because it takes that sort of detail when we are dealing with the issue of individuals with disabilities. 
Let us say that one of the people in these chairs has a syndrome called Tourette's syndrome. That individual who would be sitting in that chair could learn just as well as the other individual, could take advantage of the education just as well as that other individual. If that individual has a disability, a disability called Tourette's syndrome where, with everything else hooked up in a normal way, there is one little cross-connection in one little tiny part of the brain that causes that individual, while they are sitting there studying and learning with the same capacity as everybody else, with the potential to be as successful an individual as anybody else, for some reason we do not understand--as a physician, I do not understand, scientists do not understand yet; hopefully, we will change that--that individual all of a sudden blurts out something that does not relate to anything at all. 
Should that person have the same process for disciplining as the individual next to him? Some people would say yes. I would say no, that some attention needs to be paid that that is a manifestation. And, yes, we spell it out in the bill. What if we did not? What would we go back to--22, 24 years ago where that student would be thrown out of the classroom and thrown out of 
school through no fault of their own when they can learn just as well as anybody else? I say no, the process needs to be different. And it is spelled out in detail as the Senator from Vermont has read from the bill earlier--a different process. You can call that a double standard, I guess, because people will react to that and say, no, double standards are wrong. I call it a different process and for a very good reason. If you go back 25 years, you see why. 
Or let us say there is another student. Let us call him Tom. Let us put him in the fourth grade. Let us say he can learn well, he has the potential to be everything that one would wish his son to be in the future, yet Tom has a severe developmental disability. Say he is an individual with mental retardation. I do not know exactly what that means, but most people understand generally what I am talking about. And let us say somebody comes up to Tom in the fourth grade--and we all know bullies like this. This is the reality. This is the reality of the classroom today. A bully comes up and says, we are going to get Tom; let's give Tom this little toy gun. `Tom, this is a little toy gun.' In truth, this is not a toy gun. In truth, that bully brought it from home, put it in his pocket, and he knows how to get Tom and he gives it to Tom. And Tom says it looks like a toy gun. As a father, I can't tell the difference between toy guns and real guns. I look at them closely. Tom looks at it and says, yes, and I appreciate the gift, and so he puts it in his locker. Now the principal or teacher comes forward and opens the locker and finds what Tom thinks is a toy gun. Remember, Tom can learn just as well as anybody else, can benefit from an education. Should the process be to throw him out of school when it probably is a manifestation of his disability? And so, yes, you can call it a double standard. I call it a process, a very specific process where we do have to spell out manifestation and, yes, it takes more than six lines on one page to do that. 
It is not quite so simple, and I would argue that with two people sitting in the same room, if one of them has a manifestation of a disability, we need--and not just we but people across all 16,000 school districts--to have a process, a fair and equitable way, to discipline that individual. 
Senator Harkin mentioned that 2 years ago I held a hearing, and it was really the first hearing I held as chairman of the Subcommittee on Disability Policy. It was about the original enactment and what led to that enactment. I was looking at those hearings, and it was really powerful. I encourage my colleagues to go back and look at that 20-year history, what led up to it. It was very clear that IDEA, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, was enacted to establish a consistent policy, not what Senator Gorton's amendment would do, have 16,000 school districts each with their own policy to handle the sort of situation, but it was enacted to establish a consistent policy that people could read and understand for States and school districts to comply with. With what? The equal protection clause under the 14th amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 
We hear the words `unfunded mandate' and `mandated.' We passed IDEA. Unfunded, yes. I will not argue with that. A mandate? This goes back to a civil rights issue as defined by the Supreme Court decision after IDEA was enacted. The Supreme Court, under Smith v. Robinson, recognized IDEA as `a civil rights statute that aids States in complying with the equal protection clause under the 14th amendment.' Again, it was very clear to me in those hearings 2 years ago as we went back and looked at the decisions, two landmark decisions that Senator Harkin talked about yesterday, in 1972 which established the constitutional rights--not a mandate, the constitutional rights--for individuals with disabilities to receive a free, appropriate public education. 
So now what we want to do is turn back to allow 16,000--it may be 15,000, it may be 17,000--individual school districts to try to go through this definition to really throw aside what we have learned over the last 20 years, which we have modernized 
through our current bill, to go back and allow 16,000 school districts to reinvent the wheel, to try to learn once again what we have learned over the last 20 years--potentially 16,000 separate policies. 
Talk about lawsuits. We have had many people comment on attorneys and attorney's fees and how difficult it is. Talk about lawsuits with 16,000 different policies. I can see somebody moving from Davidson County where I live to Williamson County only because, as parents of a child with disabilities, they think that the discipline requirements might be fairer. I think lawsuits will explode. Our bill provides one set of rules, an update, defining, yes, manifestation and, yes, discipline if it is not a manifestation in a very clear way, with discretion for school districts, with protection for children. 
The whole manifestation issue I do not think we need go into now. The Senator from Vermont went through it in pretty much detail. But let me just point out again for weapons or drugs--and it has been expanded to cover weapons, possession and use or distribution of illegal drugs--if it is not a manifestation of that disability, the school would discipline that student just as they would a nondisabled student who engaged in such behavior. There is nothing exceptional about that. If it was a manifestation, very clearly--so all 16,000 school districts can understand this civil rights issue--how to discipline that student in an orderly way that parents understand, the individuals with disabilities understand, the principals understand. For all other behavior subject to disciplinary action, again, if it is not a manifestation, that is, other than weapons and other than drugs, again, students are treated just as those without disabilities. If it is a manifestation, again, it is spelled out in IDEA. 
I just close and simply say that all major educational organizations do support this bill. It is not perfect. We sat around the table night after night and day after day bringing people together. It is not perfect. But they say support this bill. Why support this bill? Because this bill as clearly defined is the way that we can improve the treatment of individuals with disabilities in discipline. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of the passage of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997, commonly known as IDEA. 
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is a civil rights law that ensures that children with disabilities have access to a free appropriate public education. The 22-year-old law has been a tremendous success. 
During the 104th Congress I had the opportunity--in fact, the privilege--to serve as chairman of the Subcommittee on Disability Policy. In that capacity, I worked on a bipartisan basis, especially with my friend Senator Harkin, in establishing a commonsense approach to the reauthorization of this vital critical law. Unfortunately, as you heard earlier on the floor, time ran out before we could fully achieve the broad widespread consensus that we set out for, and, thus, IDEA is before the Senate today. 
Throughout the last Congress we elected to keep the high ground and use our efforts to work together on a bipartisan basis to establish the consensus that we have achieved today. Yet, I am pleased to say it has become the foundation of the bill that is on the floor. I am glad to see that all of those efforts on behalf of so many people over the last Congress are reaching fruition. 
I especially want to thank Senator Harkin for the leadership that he showed and has shown on this issue through this Congress, through the past Congress, and throughout his tenure in the U.S. Congress. 
I also want to thank his staff, Bobby Silerstien and Tom Irvin. I recognize and thank my former staff director of the Subcommittee on Disability Policy, Dr. Patricia Morrissey, and the staff of this subcommittee, which at that time included David Egnor, Sue Swenson, and Dr. Robert Stodden, for their tireless efforts really day and night during the 104th Congress. 
I also want to thank David Larson, who worked diligently on the Subcommittee on Disability Policy in the last Congress and has remained on my staff to advise me on disability policy issues. 
We have heard, and will continue to hear over the course of today and tomorrow, about the efforts that have gone on in this Congress--really historic efforts--to achieve a bipartisan consensus working with the House and the Senate to put together and to fashion a bill that is on the floor today. I know from experience over the last Congress how difficult and how hard it is to achieve this commonsense consensus approach. And, thus, I think we will hear both today and tomorrow that there will be amendments that come to the floor that we very much support in substance, in spirit, but which may be just enough to set off the very delicate balance that we have in the bill that has been brought forward. 
I want to salute all of the members and the staffs who have spent the days and nights reaching this agreement: David Hoppe has been mentioned repeatedly for his wisdom, for his judgment, and for his commonsense approach, and, on top of all that, his courage and patience in this effort. I also want to thank my colleagues, Senators Lott, Jeffords, Coats, Kennedy, and Harkin once again for their efforts in this process, and, of course, Senator Jeffords who worked on the original passage over 22 years ago. And it is really fitting that the chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee be present and providing the key leadership in amending it 22 years later. 
These amendments reflect the reality, the recognition that our Nation's schools are moving past that initial challenge of providing access to educate children with disabilities to a new step in that process to educate children with disabilities so that they can become productive and independent citizens. The IDEA amendments of 1997 will help the Nation's schools succeed in that effort. 
Twenty-two years ago, before IDEA, a newborn with a disability had little hope of receiving help during the critical early years of development; children with disabilities who went to school were segregated in buildings away from their siblings and peers, and many young people with disabilities were destined to spend their lives in institutions. Young people with less-obvious disabilities, like learning disabilities and attention deficit disorder, were denied access to public education because they were considered too disruptive or unruly. These children tended to grow up on the streets and at home with no consistent access to an appropriate education. 
Today, infants and toddlers with disabilities receive early intervention services; many children with disabilities attend school together with children without disabilities, and many young people with disabilities learn study skills, life skills, and work skills that will allow them to be more independent and productive adults. 
Children without disabilities are learning first-hand that disability is a natural part of the human experience, and they are benefiting from individualized education techniques and strategies developed by the Nation's special educators. 
Children with disabilities are now much more likely to be valued members of school communities, and the Nation can look forward to a day when the children with disabilities currently in school will be productive members of our community. As a nation, we have come to see our citizens with disabilities as contributing members of society, not as victims to be pitied. As a nation, we have begun to see that those of us who happen to have disabilities also have gifts to share, and are active participants in American society who must have opportunities to learn. 
While there is no doubt that the Nation is accomplishing its goals to provide a free, appropriate public education to children with disabilities, many, many challenges remain. We have made an effort to deal with them in the amendments, the IDEA Amendments of 1997 that we now have before us. 
IDEA was originally enacted by that 94th Congress as a set of consistent rules to help States provide equal access to a free, appropriate public education to children with disabilities. But, over the years, that initial need to provide those consistent guidelines to States has sometimes become misinterpreted as a license to write burdensome compliance requirements. In addition, it has become clear that new guidelines on procedural safeguards are needed. 
The IDEA Amendments of 1997 address these issues. These amendments give educators the flexibility and the tools they need to achieve results and ease the paperwork burden that has kept teachers from spending the maximum amount of time teaching. By shifting the emphasis of IDEA from simply providing access to schools to helping schools help children with disabilities achieve true educational results, we are able to reduce many of the burdensome administrative requirements currently imposed on States and local school districts. The amendments do that. 
The IDEA Amendments of 1997 streamline planning and implementation requirements for local school districts as well as States. In assessment and classification, these amendments would allow schools to shift emphasis from generating data, data dictated by bureaucratic needs, to gathering relevant information that is really needed to teach a child. These amendments also give schools and school boards more control over how they use special purpose funds to provide training and research and information dissemination. We want to encourage every school in America to create programs that best serve the needs of all of their students, with and without disabilities. 
The IDEA Amendments of 1997 clarify that the general education curriculum and standards, the standards associated with that curriculum, should be used to teach children with disabilities and to assess their educational process. Educators at the local and State levels will use indicators of student progress that allow them to focus on quality of educational programming and track the progress of children with disabilities in meaningful ways along with the progress of other children. 
In an effort to reduce confrontation and costly litigation, the IDEA Amendments of 1997 require States to offer a system of voluntary schools mediation to parents who have a dispute over children's education. 
The amendments also address the serious issue of disciplining children with disabilities who break school rules that apply to all children. By providing fair and balanced guidelines to help schools discipline students with disabilities, the IDEA amendments will ensure that all children in our public schools are given the opportunity to learn in a safe environment. 
By preserving the right of children with disabilities to a free, appropriate public education and by providing school districts with new degrees of procedural, fiscal, and administrative flexibility, and by promoting the consideration of children with disabilities in actions to reform schools and make them accountable for student progress, IDEA will remain a viable, useful law that will provide guidance well into the next century. 
In closing, we must remember that, no matter how careful we are in this Chamber to adopt good Federal policy, no matter how diligent each doctor and teacher and parent is across out Nation, the world is and always will be unpredictable. Children with disabilities will always be born. Children will develop disabilities through injury or disease. Their disabilities will almost always take their families completely by surprise. We may be certain that our own families and our own friends will be touched by disability, through we will not know when or how. 
The great power of IDEA, reinforced and preserved by these amendments, is that it brings people with disabilities into the heart of our communities and our schools, where we learn that disability does not divide us, but binds us to each other. 
When we take the time to know children with disabilities and their needs, we learn a great deal. From families who have children with disabilities, we learn that even though everyday life may pose great challenges, nothing interferes with the love a parent feels for a child. From the excellent teachers who work with children with disabilities, we learn that even though teaching such a child may stretch one's abilities, it can be the most rewarding experience in a teacher's career, often renewing their faith in their own skills and in the system that supports them. From the children who attend school together, we learn that children with disabilities can be valued friends whose hopes and dreams are respected and nurtured on an equal basis with those of their peers. 
As I mentioned earlier, and as we have heard in the Chamber, the bill as it stands is built on a very delicate consensus achieved over the course of more than 2 years of hard work, culminating in what I feel will be a historic effort in the next several days in Congress. We all know how difficult consensus agreements are and how difficult they are to maintain over time. There is always a group that is going to be a bit unhappy, a bit dissatisfied with what they had to give up to reach this consensus, while at the same time those groups tend to forget a little bit what they received in exchange, and they begin to feel maybe they can push a little bit harder and get a little bit more. They forget that the other side also is not entirely satisfied. 
To my colleagues who have not yet decided which way to vote on this bill or as amendments come to the floor, I ask all of you simply to look at what really does hang in the balance: the first real changes in IDEA in more than 22 years; substantial new relief for schools; new tools for teachers; and a new focus on achieving results for children with disabilities. I hope all of my colleagues will step beyond the last-minute clamor for changes or adding additional amendments and even to really look beyond what may be the unhappiness of a few people that I am sure will arise over the next day or so. Instead, we need to look to those goals and to the needs of the Nation. And I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this very important package of amendments and bring this important law into the next century. 
Mr. President, before stepping down, let me simply comment briefly on the amendment which was just introduced by my colleague, Senator Gregg. I think he and the subsequent Senators who came to the floor to speak have outlined the history behind funding for IDEA, and therefore I will not recount that. The funding today is currently at about $4 billion for fiscal year 1997, which, as has been pointed out, is an increase of about $700 million from the previous year. And again, I extend my thanks and my appreciation to my colleagues, including Senator Lott and Senator Gregg, who were so instrumental in seeing that that $780 million was added. 
As has been pointed out, when IDEA was originally enacted, essentially a promise--I guess we can debate whether or not it is called a mandate or not, but a promise was made that the Federal Government would pay 40 percent of the cost of IDEA, and at that time 40 percent, I believe, was the estimate it would cost to provide services for a child with disabilities as opposed to a regular education student, and again, as we have heard, currently instead of paying 40 percent of the cost of IDEA, we, the Federal Government, the U.S. Congress, is paying about 8 percent--not 40 percent, 8 percent. Thus, we have fallen far short on our promises to the States. 
Senator Gregg worked through last year, the last Congress, and he continues today working very hard on this important issue. It is an issue that I think all of us can gather around, this increased funding, funding which was promised to assure a free, appropriate public education for individuals with disabilities. Senator Gregg, along with 20 other of our colleagues, including myself, sent a letter to President Clinton this past February requesting that the President work with us to increase funding for IDEA. I would love for some of the $35 billion that the President wishes to spend and has put forward as part of the current budget proposal be directed to this obligation--I would call it an obligation or a promise--that we made to our States in terms of funding IDEA. We have fallen far short. 
Senator Gregg is absolutely correct on the issue, and I look forward to working with him again on whatever vehicle possible to increasing funding for IDEA. I was, in fact, disappointed that this amendment--after all of our consensus working group effort, bringing people together in a bipartisan and a bicameral way, I would love to have seen this amendment as part of the final agreement, yet it was not part of that final agreement, and therefore I will support those who have spoken over the last few minutes who will end up opposing this amendment on this vehicle. I hope Senator Gregg will consider withdrawing the amendment, again recognizing that all of us support the substance and the intent of the amendment, but just that we are very, very concerned, after working together, establishing the bipartisan and, in effect, bicameral bill, this may upset that balance just enough where we would lose the entire bill. 
Again, I thank Senator Gregg for persistently and tenaciously addressing this underfunding by the Federal Government in promises it has previously made. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in introducing the PACE Provider Act of 1997. I am pleased to support this very worthy program, aimed at increasing community based long term care options for seniors which was initiated and pursued by Senator Dole over the past several years. 
This bill amends present law by increasing the number of high quality, comprehensive, community based services available to seniors who would otherwise be forced into nursing homes. 
Frail older people, particularly those 85 years and older are the fastest growing population group in this country and have multiple and complex chronic illnesses. More than 50 percent of this population require some assistance with activities of daily living. 
At the same time, the cost of caring for the frail elderly is skyrocketing. Many elderly and individuals with disabilities are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. These dual eligibles have multidimensional, interdependent, and chronic health care needs. They are at risk for nursing home placement and require acute and long-term care service integration if they are to remain at home. However, as currently structured, the Medicare and Medicaid Programs are not sufficiently coordinated to serve many of these complex health needs. In addition, these programs have traditionally favored institutional care rather than community based or home care. These problems result in duplication and fragmentation of services as well as increased health costs. 
In my own State of Tennessee, the home health industry has come under fire because of high Medicare utilization rates. This is partly because there are almost no Medicaid long term care options available to Tennesseans who want to stay at home. Consequently, nursing home care is the only option for frail elders unless they have enough money to pay privately for their care or if family members can afford to be the primary giver. Tennesseans should be able to choose from a broad array of community based long term care services and should not be limited to institutional care. 
So, if we are to control costs while providing high quality care to this vulnerable population, we must increase long term care opportunities and provide better coordination between Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement systems. 
PACE, Program for All-inclusive Care of the Elderly, is the only program which integrates acute and long term care service delivery and finance. Designed to help the at-risk elderly who need service integration, it represents a fundamental shift in the way needed health services are accessed. By using capitation mechanisms which pool funds from Medicare, Medicaid and private pay sources, this program joins medical services with established long term care services. Care is managed and coordinated by an interdisciplinary team that is responsible for service allocation decisions. 
As a result: duplicate services and ineffective treatments are eliminated; participants have access to the entire spectrum of acute and long-term care services, all provided and coordinated by a single organization; and enrollees are relieved of the burden of independently navigating the bewildering health-care maze. 
How well has it worked? The accomplishments of PACE include: controlled utilization of both outpatient and inpatient services; controlled utilization of specialist services; high consumer satisfaction; capitation rates which provide significant savings from per capita nursing home costs or community long term care costs; and ethnic and racial distributions of beneficiaries served which reflect the communities from which PACE draws its participants. 
Most importantly, PACE has been able to shift location of care from the inpatient acute care setting to the community setting. By integrating social and medical services through adult day health care, PACE has made it possible for frail elders to continue to live at home, not in a nursing care facility. 
Are there other alternatives? Medicare HMO's and Social HMO's have also attempted to control costs while providing access to high quality care. However, Medicare HMO's exclude long term care and typically do not serve many frail older persons on an ongoing basis. Social HMO's also limit the long term care benefits available to their members. These programs are important, but simply do not meet the needs of this particular population. PACE, on the other hand, serves frail elders exclusively and provide a continuum of care. It provides all acute and long term care services according to participant needs and without limits on benefits. 
Unfortunately, the number of persons enrolled in PACE nationally is minuscule compared with other managed care systems. States such as Tennessee are eager to 
participate. However, the number of participating sites has been capped under current legislation. 
The PACE Provider Act of 1997 increases the number of sites authorized to provide comprehensive, community-based services to frail, older adults from 15 to 40 with an additional 20 to be added each year; and affords regular provider status to existing sites. 
Specifically, the bill: 
Specifies that PACE sites be lower in cost than the alternative health care services available to PACE enrollees, a goal which has already been accomplished; includes quality of care safeguards; gives States the option of utilizing PACE programs based on their need for alternatives to long-term institutional care and the program's continuing cost-effectiveness; and allows for-profit entities to participate in PACE as a demonstration project. 
PACE services frail older people of diverse ethnic heritage and has operated successfully under different state and local environments. This program deserves expansion. 
The PACE Provider Act of 1997 does exactly that. It makes the PACE alternative available for the first time to many communities. It also allows more entities in the healthcare marketplace to participate in a new way of providing care for frail elders. PACE gives us a chance to contain costs while providing high quality care to one of our most vulnerable populations. 
The PACE program's integration of health and social services, its cost-effective, coordinated system of care delivery and its method of integrated financing have wide applicability and appeal. It is an exciting way to satisfying an urgent need and I wholeheartedly support it.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, a few weeks ago in Nashville, three armed teenage thugs struck the youngest member of my staff with a pistol, robbed, and terrorized him. All three have lengthy juvenile records. Two were convicted of armed robbery at age 14 and served time in a juvenile facility. Last month, over the vehement objection of the prosecutor, both were released early for good behavior. It took these juveniles less than a month to rearm and commit another violent crime. 
In Tennessee over the past 4 months, we have had a string of senseless murders which have left Tennesseans in a state of shock, fear, and confusion. One incident, for which arrests have been made, is the tragic story of the four members of the Lillelid family of east Tennessee. They were car-jacked at a rest stop on Interstate 81 and later found executed in a ditch, with multiple gunshot wounds to the head and chest. The mother, father, and 6-year-old daughter all died, while the 2-year-old son was shot twice, but survived. The police have arrested six people in connection to the murders--four adults and two juveniles--all are under 20 years of age. 
This pointless tragedy is just one of many recent stories which have riveted the attention of people across Tennessee. The death of Charlie Thoet as he was closing a restaurant just outside of Nashville in January; the murder of Steve Hampton and Sarah Jackson as they were opening another establishment in February; the triple homicide of Robert Santiago, Robert Allen Sewell, and Andrea Brown and the attempted murder of Jose Alfredo Romirez Gonzalez at a fast food restaurant in March; and the most recent incident, the murders of Michelle Mace and Angela Holmes at an ice cream shop just last week, have left many across Tennessee questioning our society and its lack of respect for human life. All of these victims were hard working people with families and friends, hopes and dreams whose lives were brought to an end in a brutal, violent, senseless fashion. 
Mr. President, I want to be very clear that in no way do I mean to suggest that all of these unsolved murders were caused by juveniles. However, the two cases first mentioned were cases with juvenile and very young adult offenders. And violent juvenile crime is growing across this country. From 1985 to 1994 arrest of juveniles for all serious violent offenses increased 75 percent; arrest for homicides increased 150 percent; and arrests of juveniles for weapon possession increased 103 percent. These statistics coupled with the fact that there will be a large increase in the number of juveniles early in the next century--by 2005 the number of males 14-17 will increase 
25 percent--means that we are about to face a crime epidemic the likes of which this country has never experienced. The Justice Department estimates that in the next 13 years juvenile arrests for violence crimes will more than double and juvenile arrests for murder will increase by 45 percent. 
So what do we do? Currently, less than 10 percent of juvenile offenders commit far greater than half of all juvenile crimes. Rather than adopt a shotgun approach, we need to focus our efforts to make it harder for this small portion of the population to continually commit crimes. In addition, it has been proven time and time again that adult repeat offenders often begin as juvenile repeat offenders and that the severity of the crimes only increase. We must interrupt the cycle of violence while the offender is still a juvenile. 
I believe that the most important step we can take is make sure that these young people understand that there are consequences for their actions. In Tennessee, usually a juvenile will have been convicted of three crimes before he or she is considered for juvenile detection. I think we all realize that if these kids are caught doing something 3 times then that means they have probably done it closer to 20 times. I believe that a vital element in deterring crime is the certainty of punishment for first and second offenses. Juvenile offenders must know for certain that they are responsible and will be held accountable for their actions. 
Criminals must also serve their entire sentence. If the teenagers, who attacked my staffer a few weeks ago, had served their full sentences, then that crime would never have happened. We do not have enough resources to capture and arrest every criminal several times. Once our police officers have put their lives on the line to catch a criminal, and our overworked, underpaid prosecutors have obtained a conviction, it is inexcusable for that criminal not to serve his or her full sentence. 
There are other steps we can take to make sure it is easier for law enforcement and the courts to send a strong message to juvenile offenders. Most Americans would probably be surprised to learn that in most areas juveniles are not fingerprinted and their record of violent crimes are not weighed at all in adult criminal proceedings. They may also not be aware that in most States there is a minimum age for a juvenile to be bound over to adult court. 
Crime, especially juvenile crime, is a problem for which our entire community must find the solution. Parents, teachers, law enforcement, judges, social services, and, yes, the business community as well, must play integral roles. I am very interested in a 
new project just getting underway in Memphis, TN, which will do just that. The Shelby County Tennessee Juvenile Offender Transition Program is an innovative new plan for a supervised, independent living center for juvenile offenders aimed at reducing recidivism and assisting youth to obtain the skills necessary to break the cycle of crime and to make the transition into a productive adulthood. The program includes education and vocational training requirements tailored to each participant, coupled with a highly structured mentoring program with area universities and a business sponsorship which includes part-time employment during the program with the prospect of employment after completion of the program or tuition reimbursement for continued education. The juveniles have to serve their entire sentence, but this program will give the juvenile court an alternative to sending these young people back to the neighborhoods and the problems where we know they will only get in trouble again and end up back in our courts and our prisons. It is not the solution to all of the problems we face with juvenile crime, but this is an innovative, new approach to assist some of our young people, those who we might be able to help, in making a positive change. The program calls on all aspects of our communities to find solutions and I believe that these efforts deserve our support. 
Mr. President, I believe that it is time to take a long hard look at the areas I have highlighted and consider long overdue reforms to the juvenile justice system. There is consensus on several issues from both Republican and Democrats, and therefore, I think it is time for the U.S. Senate to address this most pressing concern of the American people.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in 1995, my first year in the U.S. Senate, the Medicare Trustees told Congress that unless it took `prompt effective, and decisive action * * * Medicare will be dead in seven years.' 
Two years later, another Trustees' report has been delivered to Congress and we are even worse off. We still face the same tough choices. We must balance the budget, restore integrity to the Medicare trust fund, update the Medicare system and provide consumers with more choice--a cornerstone structural change that addresses the long-term viability of the Medicare program. 
In the 104th Congress, the U.S. Congress realized that the fundamental way to capture the dynamics of change in the health care system would be to modernize Medicare by opening it to a broader array of private health plans that would compete on the basis of quality and not just cost. 
President Clinton embraced this ideal as well by initiating a Medicare Choices demonstration and including provisions to expand choice, although I feel they are limited, in his February budget submission to the U.S. Congress. 
Therefore, Senator Rockefeller and I introduced S. 146, the Provider-Sponsored Organization Act of 1997. S. 146 expands the current Medicare risk contracting program to include PSO's, Provider Sponsored Organizations.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I take great pleasure today in introducing the Gift of Life Congressional Medal Act of 1997. With this legislation, which doesn't cost taxpayers a penny, Congress has the opportunity to recognize and encourage potential donors, and give hope to over 52,000 Americans who have end-stage disease. As a heart and lung transplant surgeon, I saw one in four of my patients die because of the lack of available donors. Public awareness simply has not kept up with the relatively new science of transplantation. As public servants, we need to do all we can to raise awareness about the gift of life. 
Under this bill, each donor or donor family will be eligible to receive a commemorative Congressional medal. It is not expected that all families, many of whom wish to remain anonymous, will take advantage of this opportunity. The program will be coordinated by the regional organ procurement organizations [OPO's] and managed by the entity administering the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Upon request of the family or individual, a public official will present the medal to the donor or the family. This creates a wonderful opportunity to honor those sharing life through donation and increase public awareness. Some researchers have estimated that it may be possible to increase the number of organ donations by 80 percent through incentive programs and public education. 
As several recent experiences have proved, any one of us, or any member of our families, could need a life saving transplant tomorrow. We would then be placed on a waiting list to anxiously await our turn, or our death. The number of people on the list has more than doubled sine 1990--and a new name is added to the list every 18 minutes. In my home State of Tennessee, 98 Tennesseans died while waiting last year, and more than 900 people are in need in a transplant. Nationally, because of a lack or organs, close to 4,000 individuals died who were on the list in 1996. 
However, the official waiting list reflects only those who have been lucky enough to make it into the medical care system and to pass the financial hurdles. If you include all those reaching end-stage disease, the number of people potentially needing organs or bone marrow, very likely over 120,000, becomes staggering. Only a small fraction of that number would ever receive transplants, even if they had adequate insurance. There simply are not enough organ and tissue donors, even to meet present demand. 
Federal policies surrounding the issue of organ transplantation are difficult. Whenever you deal with whether someone lives or dies, there are no easy answers. There are between 15,000 and 20,000 potential donors each year, yet inexcusably, there are only some 5,400 actual donors. That's why we need you to help us educate others about the facts surrounding tissue and organ donation. 
This year and last, Mr. President, there has been unprecedented cooperation, on both sides of the aisle, and a growing commitment to awaken public compassion on behalf of those who need organ transplants. It is my very great pleasure to introduce this bill on behalf of a group of Senators who have already contributed in extremely significant ways to the cause of organ transplantation. And we are proud to ask you to join us, in encouraging people to give life to others.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend, colleague, and senior Senator from Tennessee, Fred Thompson, to introduce the Fort Campbell Tax Fairness Act of 1997. 
We are introducing this legislation today to rectify a tax injustice imposed on Tennessee residents at Fort Campbell in northwest Tennessee. Fort Campbell, a 105,000-acre military installation that serves as America's premier power projection platform, straddles the border of Tennessee and Kentucky. Under current law, about 2,000 Tennesseans who work on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell are forced to pay income tax to Kentucky--even though they receive no benefits or services from the Kentucky State government. 
They cannot send their children to Kentucky public schools. In an emergency, these residents cannot use Kentucky fire, ambulance, and police services. Tennesseans who want to attend a Kentucky public university must pay out-of-State tuition. Tennesseans who want to hunt and fish in Kentucky must pay out-of-State rates for licenses. Most importantly, these Tennesseans who are paying Kentucky income taxes cannot vote in Kentucky elections. I consider this inherently unfair situation a case of `taxation without representation'--violating a fundamental principle of our American Revolution. 
Our bill, like its bipartisan companion in the House introduced by Representatives Ed Bryant and John Tanner, simply provides that Kentucky may not tax compensation paid to Tennessee Federal workers and contractors working on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell. I look forward to working with Senator Thompson and other members of the Tennessee delegation to enact this bill into law.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to address the legislation before us which would further codify and clarify existing Federal law, practice, and policy on the prohibition of the use of Federal funds, whether directly or indirectly, for physician-assisted suicide. This proposal has received broad bipartisan support within the Congress, within the administration, and in the medical community. 
This is an issue that supersedes the politics of the present, and cuts to the heart of our concept of respect for life. As a physician, I took an oath, like physicians for centuries before me, to `first do no harm.' While there are times when the best in medical technology and expertise cannot save or prolong life, we should never turn those tools into instruments to take life, and we must preserve the sacred trust between physician and patient. 
I am pleased that this bill is tightly focused and disciplined in its approach to this controversial issue. However, I am concerned that the most important issue may be obscured by this debate. Physicians have a responsibility to ensure that patients are both comfortable and comforted during their last precious days on Earth. As legislators responsible for policy decisions impacting the federally funded health care programs, we also have a responsibility. We must continue to look for ways to support efforts to provide palliative care, as well as to support efforts to educate physicians, patients, and families about end-of-life issues. 
We have made enormous progress in treating and managing illness at the end of life. Over the last 50 years, life expectancy has risen dramatically as we have learned to manage the complications of illnesses which were previously considered terminal. The issue of physician-assisted suicide is an indication of our need to focus on other ways of relieving suffering, while maintaining the dignity of the terminally ill and their families. 
While I do not believe that it is the role of the Government to intrude upon the relationship between a physician and patient, I do believe that policymakers have an obligation to create an environment which supports the quality of care in this country. Therefore, our votes in support of this bill must also be seen as our decision to take up a new challenge--that of finding new ways to facilitate the compassionate care of the dying.

Mr. FRIST. President, I rise today to speak out for Americans on tax day--April 15. On this day more than any other, every American is reminded how much government costs--not just in actual dollars but in time and energy spent filling out forms. 
Today, many of my colleagues have described the tax burden in many insightful and illustrative analogies. For example, we know that the average American will work until May 9--tax freedom day--just to pay his or her taxes. We know that the typical American family pays 38 percent of their income in Federal, State, and local taxes--a one-third increase over the past four decades. I commend my colleagues for bringing clarity and focus to an extremely complex debate. 
Today, I want to add to their comments. Putting statistics and anecdotes aside, every lawmaker should be asking three questions about tax revenue--not just on Tax Day but every day: Whose money is it? How much of it are we spending? and How are we spending it?

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of the underlying legislation, with one hesitation, and that is as it regards an amendment introduced by my colleague from Tennessee on behalf of both of us about 45 minutes ago. I do not want to rehash the various points that have been made thus far, but I would like to speak to the importance of that amendment, the purpose of which was to provide that the President shall not designate the Oak Ridge Reservation in the State of Tennessee as a site for construction of an interim storage facility. The Oak Ridge Reservation is best known initially for its history in the Manhattan project during the Second World War, but its evolution since that time has truly been amazing. 
I had the opportunity to be there 3 days ago with my distinguished colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, and we really had a good examination of the ongoing projects in Oak Ridge. Oak Ridge is not simply a semi-idle nuclear site nor a remnant of cold war strategic arms mission. But it is home now to our Nation's largest civilian national lab, a functioning weapons stockpile stewardship and management facility, and a variety of other user facilities for our national research and development effort. As a physician by training, it is poised as a particular interest to me, and is really on the edge of some exciting breakthroughs in the life sciences in genetic research. 
Oak Ridge simply would be an unwise location for storage of high-level waste from a purely environmental standpoint. I know earlier references were made in the debate talking about the fact that it had been recommended in the 1980's as a potential site, and that the courts struck that down. But I think it is very important to say that, even though those recommendations had been made in the 1980's, things are very different today, in addition to the fact that they were struck down. 
It would simply be an unwise location from an environmental standpoint. The area lies in a geological zone typified by what is called karst topography, which is distinguished by limestone bedrock with water flowing through caverns and underground rivers very close to the surface. 
The danger here is that clearly any seepage into the groundwater could potentially put into jeopardy the water supply of several States. 
The reason I was not in the Chamber 30 or 40 minutes ago is that I was chairing another hearing, and Dr. Arch Johnston, professor and director of research, center for Earthquake Research and Information at the University of Memphis, testified just an hour ago to the fact that in the 1980's, because of concerns of earthquakes in that area, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission undertook seismic studies, and over the course of that year they demonstrated that through that region of east Tennessee--and it is called the southern Appalachian seismic zone--there were earthquakes noted, but they were noted 2 miles deep and not on the surface. Dr. Johnston said that this is a problem in this zone of the southern Appalachian region, which includes Oak Ridge, because you cannot study it on the surface. Only two zones exceed its level of activity, according to Dr. Johnston, with 90 percent of this is in east Tennessee. 
I say all this because the purpose of this amendment, especially in light of this earlier recommendation in the 1980's, is to say that a level playing field would not be established because of the chance that people would look back to that study and put Oak Ridge back on the table, which was clearly inappropriate. 
We have the geological arguments, we have the environmental arguments, and I again will not go through the debate that was made by my colleagues--we had the argument of population. Several million people today live within a relatively short distance of Oak Ridge, and although that was not clearly true in 1942 when it was an locally isolated region, it today is within a metropolitan area of nearly a million people. 
Thus, in summary, my colleague from Tennessee, Senator Thompson, and myself have introduced this amendment, which says that the Oak Ridge reservation should not be considered as a site for the construction of an interim nuclear storage facility for environmental, geological, and population reasons. 
I thank you very much. I will urge support of the underlying bill if we can ultimately have this amendment attached.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Harold Hazelip for an outstanding career. Hazelip has served as president of Lipscomb University since 1986 with dedication and a proactive sense of leadership. This spring he will retire, and the students, faculty and staff at Lipscomb University will miss him greatly. But as they look back on his years of service, they will find that the legacy he leaves behind is a strong foundation for education and the community. 
Since 1986, Lipscomb University has seen many changes. Enrollment has reached record highs at the university and at David Lipscomb Campus School for kindergarten through high school. Fundraising efforts are more productive than at any time in the university's 104-year history and alumni are giving more back to their school. 
When Harold Hazelip took the helm, Lipscomb University was called David Lipscomb College. Through hard work and a clear vision Hazelip helped the school implement a masters degree program to become accredited as a university by the Southern Association of Colleges. In addition to a variety of new programs, Hazelip has also been able to recruit some of the best professors from across the country. Today, 83 percent of Lipscomb's faculty hold terminal degrees in their field, an increase from 63 percent when Hazelip started. 
During Hazelip's tenure, admissions standards were strengthened and the diversity of the student body increased. The campus grew, too, with the addition of a new library, a recreational gymnasium, and a campuswide fiber-optic network. Hazelip has eagerly combined technological innovation, student diversity, advanced education programs, and new instructional facilities to steer Lipscomb University toward a bright future. 
The most exciting legacy that Hazelip leaves behind is the growth and continued interest in mission work and youth ministry at Lipscomb University. This aspect of campus life is a true reflection of the dedication that Hazelip has for the university as well as his community. Harold Hazelip truly encompasses the ideals of community involvement and leadership. In today's tumultuous world, it is reassuring to see these ideals passed along. 
Mr. President, Harold Hazelip is not simply a university president, he is also a writer, a minister, a Chamber of Commerce member, and a leader in education. His commitment to each of these titles is reflected in the successes he has helped the people around him achieve. Hazelip's retirement from Lipscomb University challenges the university community to uphold the standards that he set and to move beyond those criterion to reach higher goals for the institution. Like any good teacher, Hazelip has given Lipscomb University the foundation to achieve success. It is now up to the university to build upon that foundation. Harold Hazelip has set Lipscomb University on the fast track to success, and I am confident that Lipscomb's future is very bright as a result. I thank Harold Hazelip for his dedication to education and his community, and I wish him well as he enters retirement.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the extraordinary lifestyle, security and standard of living Americans have enjoyed since the end of the Second World War is one of our most notable achievements in recent history. We are wealthier, healthier, and safer than any people before us. We have built an economy whose resilience, ingenuity, and potential are truly the envy of the world. We have become the standard by which all other nations are measured. The century in which we have survived economic collapse and two world wars only to become stronger bears our name, the `American Century.' 
This unparalleled achievement is not a product of chance or fate, luck or serendipity, or even good timing. It is the product of an extraordinary effort on the part of the American people and the institutions we have built and strengthened. It is the product of the American spirit and work ethic which, in our first 100 years, propelled us from the periphery of a colonial empire to an independent nation a continent wide. It has allowed us, in our second century, to defeat challenges under which other nations withered. 
Since the end of the Second World War, we have witnessed and enjoyed progress and growth unparalleled in our own history. That unparalleled progress is the product of a unique effort that helped us win the cold war and, among other notable achievements, put Americans on the moon. The effort is best described as a National Enterprise: a strong foundation built upon a shared responsibility and a common vision for our country's success. 
The common vision that helped define our National Enterprise was shared by three basic pillars of our society: our Government, our academic institutions, and our private industries. The cementing agent is a sense of singular mission, embodied largely, but not exclusively, in the cold war effort, our love of freedom, and our free markets. Its medium and fuel are an ingenious, compassionate, optimistic, hard working, and resolute people. 
The National Enterprise has now reached a crossroads, and we are facing one of the greatest but understated challenges of our history. With the advent of two historical trends, we face a challenge more daunting than any enemy: a potential loss of our own resolve. 
First, growing Federal entitlements have created a fiscal crisis in the Federal Government, with 28 consecutive years of deficit spending, a $5.3 trillion debt, and shrinking discretionary spending. The money we allocate to research and development faces increasing competition from other worthwhile endeavors such as environment, education, national parks, infrastructure, and defense. All are competing for a smaller and smaller slice of the Federal spending pie. 
Second, the end of the cold war era has left America with what some might call a diluted sense of mission or common interest. The National Enterprise cannot be defined in a single dimension, but for better or for worse, the cold war's unifying power and the birth of America as a superpower was the single greatest motive driving the Enterprise and the yardstick of its success. 
With the launch of Sputnik in 1957, we witnessed a technologically- advanced, symbolic challenge from our would-be enemy. It was the crack of the starter pistol in a race that would bear both frightening military capabilities and extraordinary peaceful dividends. For the first time, we were sobered in our celebration of post-war-era wealth and security and were challenged to push ourselves to the limit. The Sputnik era has ended, and with it has ended the series of punctuated events that presented a clear road map for our progress and cold war victory. What will be the new road map for our National Enterprise? 
I was heartened to hear the President recognize the importance of the National Enterprise during his State of the Union Address. Without his leadership, any efforts in Congress, industry or education are unlikely to be successful. However, the President addressed only broad themes and small remedies for a few specific problems. In the President's budget, funding for Federal research and development remains essentially unchanged in a gradual downward trend, with the prognosis for coming years being a point of great concern. The President's emphasis on education is also a positive initiative, but his proposals seem to disproportionately favor higher education over all other levels. The President has presented a budget which seems to recognize some of the problems, but does not clearly articulate the full spectrum of challenges before us. 
In addition to addressing the funding challenges that our National Enterprise faces, we must also embolden the Federal Government with a new understanding of mission and role within the 
Enterprise. This understanding is the critical difference between developing a strategy like the one that won the Cold War, and one that is simply a triage of federal spending programs. We must forge a sense of mission and seek a new understanding, for we may never have another Sputnik to awaken our schools, government and industries to the essence of the National Enterprise. 
The challenges of the coming century will be as great or greater than those we have met thus far, but we do have the benefit of learning from our past successes. We can base our inquiry and guide our decisions on a set of simple truths we have learned from that experience. These simple truths make the link between spending and results, and highlight the need to make those links as clear, as direct, and as strong as possible. 
Truth number one: research and development, science, and education bring advancements and innovation. 
Truth number two: innovation has been the basis of our competitive edge--peaceful and defensive--and of our extraordinary lifestyle; it is the cornucopia of modern America and the envy of the world. 
Truth number three: federal funding of research, and creating an environment that encourages private research and innovation, is the bedrock upon which the National Enterprise has been founded. 
These fruits of our labor are not obscure laboratory innovations, but integral parts of our lives and economy. The Internet, computer chips, satellites, super-sonic aircraft, higher education and research universities, and strong civilian and defense-related basic research are a few compelling examples. 
Therefore, the question is not whether federal research and development spending is the taproot of our innovation and economic growth--it clearly is. The questions we face are, What is the right formula for the federal government in this National Enterprise? What are the actual mechanisms by which that combination of spending and American ingenuity translate into advancements? And how do we make them as strong and as sharp as possible? 
We have some initial ideas here in Congress, but I do not believe this body as a whole is prepared to answer those questions--the most important of our time. But it is my sincere hope that we have begun this necessary dialogue. 
In our pursuit of these answers, we have a simple, yet profound, justification: research and development spending and strong science and technology are the essential base elements of our competitive edge, our standard of living, and our defense. To hone and preserve that edge, Congress must work closely with the traditional partners in this effort: universities, government agencies and their labs, and private industry. These partnerships have been a key to America s strength and their whole is seemingly greater than the sum of its respective parts. 
Along with several representatives of the national research, development and education effort in government, universities, and industry, several Senators of both parties have begun to explore the issues and open a dialogue addressing the questions of great national importance, as illustrated by the formation of the Senate's bipartisan Science and Technology Caucus. The full Senate understands the challenges of maintaining a vibrant National Enterprise, but the gravity of the challenge has not been fully articulated, even as we face greater competition from other countries and ever greater pressure on federal and private funding of all research and development. 
This venture will require understanding, sympathy, discipline and dedication. Already, the initial dialogue has realized some immediate success: it exposed common ground and initiated the critical dialogue. We have begun to identify issues and areas on which Congress can begin to pursue an agenda and strategy: 
Partnerships among industry, government, and universities are the strong basis of our preeminence in science and technology and in research and development, and are the essential whet stone of our competitive edge. We must find the best ways to shorten the time it takes to bring basic research to market, clinic, the armed forces, or industry. 
Education is the seed-corn of the advancements we enjoy. We must continue to cultivate human capital, for that seed-corn cannot be planted too early. To fail to provide our institutions of higher learning with qualified students will ultimately be the most damaging blow to the National Enterprise. It is a problem that cannot be corrected in a single budget or simply through new laws and higher federal spending levels. Today, nearly one-third of incoming American college students are compelled to enter remedial courses because they are ill-prepared for much of the basic curriculum. The erosion of standards and performance in our elementary and secondary school systems is an erosion of the basis of the National Enterprise itself and a threat to its very existence. 
Consistent and stable commitments to funding are essential for planning. Planning, in turn, is an essential ingredient in long term strategies and the ability for individuals, companies and institutions to commit to the long term and basic research. 
A commitment to basic research is the foundation upon which all other discoveries and technical advancements are dependent. Here, the federal role is particularly important. Universities and labs cannot realistically undertake such high-risk and long-term research on their own. And industries cannot necessarily commit to a venture that may not enjoy a market return during the lifetime of the company. 
Do not think I'm speaking of simply a more-informed and sophisticated triage. The overall budget projections on research and development spending are a point of great concern--some say a threat to our national security, our quality of life and our sharp competitive edge. 
In this delicate operation of redefining our National Enterprise, we must be extremely careful, for clean incisions are not easy, and the distinctions between excesses and successes are not always clear. We must note that in trying to solve our budget crisis, some of the issue have been muddled, where the fine distinctions between basic and applied research, and between research and development, are lost or misjudged. However, should we gain a new sense of mission and consensus of goals through dialogue, such distinctions become less and less difficult with time, and we can better focus the energies and money of the United States. 
We also face the danger that any such dialogue could be characterized politically and split by misconceptions of conservative versus liberal, of big government versus streamlined government, or even command economy versus the free market. We should be clear from the outset that this discussion is none of these, and it is certainly not a Republican versus Democrat issue, as the recent bipartisan efforts illustrate. 
We must be mindful that the dialogue must also focus on education and the creation of human capital to fuel and guide our National Enterprise. A National Enterprise with all financial means at its disposal is impotent and adrift without knowhow and wisdom. Our economy's resilience, ingenuity, and potential are sure to fade without an unwavering commitment to education. 
On these issues we must be prepared to deliberate, to make difficult decisions, and to lead. Congress must use its experience, knowledge and authority to move dialogue, keep it from folly, and define priorities and goals in the interests of the American people--a very tall order. 
We must begin to study these issues and join the effort, beginning with the appreciation that this dialogue is the extraordinary luxury of an accomplished, enterprising and open-minded people. As Chairman of the Science, Technology and Space Subcommittee, as a founding member of the Science and Technology Caucus, and as a medical scientist and physician, I will actively pursue this dialogue and seek answers to these critical questions. 
The Nation's approach to these challenges must be broadened in scope and increased in level of participation. It must move away from an annual piecemeal approach, confined to specific programs' and agencies' funding within our own appropriations process. It must also gain the level of honesty and earnestness realized during the Cold War Era and in the wake of Sputnik. This nascent dialogue and recent legislative initiatives are encouraging first steps, but the challenge must expand to include more of the Congress, the Administration and the public. 
Congress must answer the critical questions to determine the role of the federal government, and then see that our laws and spending reflect the correct answers and clearly define our national interests. We must set out to understand our mission and to define our goals. 
America cannot afford to wait for another Sputnik to shake us from our complacency and to define our interests for us. Congress has a great challenge ahead, and we must act now to restore and preserve our competitive edge and standard of living--so much depends on the decisions Congress makes and on the sincerity, depth, and sobriety of the dialogue.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, both Republican and Democrat--and especially Senator Domenici--in submitting this year's resolution to designate the week of October 19-25 as Character Counts Week. 
I believe it is important that we put character back into our vocabulary. The American people are crying out for virtue and values--character does count and it's essential that we focus our efforts in extending this message. 
The Character Counts movement, which emphasizes trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship, seeks to teach the core elements of good character to our Nation's young people. 
One of the most important things we can ever do for our children is to help them learn and understand the value of virtue and the importance of character. 
The Character Counts Coalition is gaining momentum across the country, and I am proud to be a part of that effort. 
I think it is clear from the reports every night on the news, that such a movement has never been more timely. I am proud that the citizens of my home State, Tennessee, have joined the call for character renewal. 
Last year, I spoke of the city of Greeneville, TN, which put together a character education program featuring 10 community virtues including self-respect, respect for others, perseverance, courtesy, fairness and justice, responsibility, honesty, kindness, self-discipline, and courage. Since then, Greeneville has extended its character education program from the city schools to the county school district, too. 
 Mr. President, I am proud that Hamblen County schools in Morristown, TN, have adopted the Character Counts Program with the leadership provided by their school superintendent, Ernest Walker. In addition, they have a local advisory board composed of parents and leaders involved with youth activities in their professional and volunteer capacities. 
Gary Chesney, a school board member has said `It's good for schools to reinforce the job parents do at home with their kids.' 
I had the opportunity to attend the kickoff event for the Sullivan County schools' Character Counts Program. Juvenile Court Judge, Steve Jones, helped initiate this effort and is an outstanding example of how one person can make a difference in a community. Judge Jones calls Character Counts `the ultimate prevention program.' 
In a way, the Character Counts movement--I believe--is an act of renewal. By welcoming our children into a world of shared values and ideals, we invite them to continue the task of preserving the principles we hold most dear. 
 Mr. President, Tennesseans have joined the national effort to save our children from the moral decay we see all around us because they recognize that the only way to preserve this great democracy--this system that requires so much from each of us--and our American way of life, is to instill virtue and moral fortitude in the next generation of Americans. 
This will not happen without our effort, and without the incredible leadership of movement like Character Counts. Again, I commend Senator Domenici, and all those who are working so hard, to make character count once again in the United States of America.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I especially want to commend my good friend, Senator Hatch, for his tireless dedication to passing this amendment. 
Mr. President, our Nation faces a critical choice about our economic future: Are we going to continue to shackle our children and grandchildren with debt or are we going to curtail the excessive spending habits of Washington? Passing the balanced budget amendment signals a choice for fiscal discipline, economic prosperity, and a better future for our children. 
Federal spending cannot continue indefinitely on its current course. If we continue on our current path, entitlements and interest on the debt will consume all Federal revenues by 2012--leaving not a single tax dollar for defense, education, medical research, national parks, and other important government functions. For 28 years, we have continued on this path. We cannot continue on it for the next 28. 
Today, the Federal debt stands at $5.3 trillion. Grasping the concept of a trillion dollars is difficult, but let me try. If you started a business in the year 1 and that business lost $1 million every day since then, you still would not have lost your first trillion dollars. Paying interest alone on America's debt costs taxpayers about $300 million a year. Thus, a child born today will pay more than $180,000 on the debt over his or her lifetime--just in interest. 
The balanced budget amendment will take a bold step toward reversing this trend by adding a simple rule to the Constitution, a rule followed by families when they draw up their own budgets and by businesses when they forecast their finances. This rule says, `total outlays in a particular year will not exceed total receipts in that year.' That is legalese for forcing Congress to live within its means. 
Some people have asked me why Congress and the President need to enshrine this rule in a document as important as the Constitution. Especially given today's new commitment to bipartisanship, some wonder why their lawmakers cannot agree to make the tough choices necessary to balance the budget. The simple answer is that Congress and the President need the amendment to guarantee fiscal discipline whether or not that political commitment to a balanced budget exists. We need the amendment to ensure the budget is balanced in 2002 and 2012 and 2022. 
Opponents of the amendment cite four objections. First, they claim we should exempt Social Security from budget calculations to protect seniors and preserve the program. However, exempting Social Security from the balanced budget amendment will not strengthen Social Security in any way, will not add a single year to the Social Security trust fund, and will make balancing the budget even more difficult. Simply moving Social Security off budget does not address the structural challenges the program will face when the baby boomers begin to retire. The President knows this. He cites Social Security as one of his reasons for opposing the amendment but does not exempt it in his own budget. The greatest threat to Social Security is not the balanced budget amendment; it is the unrestrained growth of debt that jeopardizes every single Federal program, especially Social Security because it is the largest. 
The second objection is that the amendment restricts our ability to run deficits in times of emergency or recession. Running deficits is, at times, unavoidable. But recent budget history shows that deficit spending has become the rule rather than the exception in Washington, a trend that is unacceptable to the American taxpayer. The first sentence of the amendment provides appropriate flexibility to permit deficits when a three-fifths majority of Congress deems it necessary. 
Third, opponents claim that the amendment risks judicial interference in budget decisions. In his State of the Union Address, the President himself cited his concern of `unwanted results such as judges halting Social Security checks.' The balanced budget amendment does not allocate power to the courts to decide budget and economic matters. Rather, it establishes a procedure to restrict Congress' budget authority--a supermajority vote to run deficits. 
Fourth, opponents say we should include an exemption for capital budgets. Capital investments are very important. Everyone knows that. However, as I discussed earlier, we will have no money for capital investments in just 15 years if we continue on our current budget course. As with Social Security, the debt is the greatest threat to these investments. 
Furthermore, if we created a separate capital budget, the process of defining `capital spending' could be abused--opening a huge loophole for deficit spending. We have seen this happen in the States. In New York City, for example, they declared the useful life of a school textbook to be 30 years, stretching out spending far beyond the book's actual existence. 
All of these arguments are a smoke screen that obscures the real issue at stake: constitutionally mandated fiscal discipline. 
If we can enact and sustain this discipline, the economic rewards are considerable. Looking back, if we had not run deficits the past two decades, the average American family's annual income would be $15,500 higher. Looking ahead, if we balance our budget now, we can increase per capita income by 26 percent over the next 20 years. 
Passing the balanced budget amendment represents the first step down this road to economic prosperity. With a fiscal discipline embedded in the Constitution, Congress will be forced to confront tough problems sooner--rather than pushing mountains of debt on to future generations to endure. 
I urge my colleagues to pass the balanced budget amendment.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the work of Nashville's own Capt. Giles Pride. Giles Pride has been a cornerstone to the success and service of the Nashville Fire Department for 52 years. At age 72, he is hanging up his fireman's hat and flame retardant jacket. 
Pride began his career at the young age of 19, when he said he was 21-years-old in order to meet the eligibility requirements for joining the fire department. He was given very little training, worked 12 hours a day, and was paid $150 a month. That was in 1944, and at his retirement he had served longer than any other full-time firefighter in the State of Tennessee. 
Over the years, Pride has seen many advancements in firefighting, from the introduction of more innovative equipment to new strategies for fighting certain types of fires. 
Mr. President, the work of a fireman is not always pleasant. Giles Pride has plenty of memories of comradery and friendship at Nashville's Fire Department. But he has also faced the hard reality of putting his life on the line every day to save the lives of others. Captain Pride has given 52 years of his life to the people of Nashville. 
Too many times we hear of fire taking and destroying the lives of its victims. Not often enough do we thank the firefighters, like Captain Pride, who bring safety and security to our communities. Today, Mr. President, I tip my hat to Capt. Giles Pride for a job well done, and I wish him all the best in the years to come.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the MediGap Portability Act of 1997. The importance of this legislation is best expressed by the many stories of individuals who have unsuccessfully tried to obtain adequate Medicare supplemental coverage. Therefore, I would like to share with you the experience of one of my constituents--Gary Purcell, a 60-year-old retired professor from the University of Tennessee. 
To say the least, Dr. Purcell's health status has been a challenge for him. Despite a history of multiple illnesses including lupus, hypertension, diabetes, severe heart and kidney disease, and recurrent life-threatening skin infections, this man kept working. Even after suffering a stroke, he kept working. Dr. Purcell fought to remain productive, but as his condition deteriorated, he was forced to retire on disability. He subsequently developed prostate cancer and recently suffered an amputation of the left leg. 
One day last fall, he received a letter saying he was eligible for Medicare due to disability. In fact, the situation was a little more complicated than that. Since he had not yet reached his 65th birthday, Dr. Purcell was actually being reassigned to Medicare, thus losing his private health insurance coverage. Due to the fact he is eligible for Medicare because of disability and not age, and because of preexisting medical conditions, Dr. Purcell could not obtain MediGap coverage and he had no other insurance options. As a result, he will incur high out-of-pocket costs to fill the many gaps in Medicare's coverage. Although Dr. Purcell will be eligible for supplemental coverage at age 65, 5 years from now, until then he will have to spend $500 per month or 25 percent of his income on medications to make up for what Medicare does not cover. 
Dr. Purcell explored other options--ways of obtaining less expensive drugs, but the bottom line is, he will still have to pay massive sums of money for his medications, money which he does not have. Unfortunately, his situation is not unique. Many seniors, as well as other individuals with disabilities, are suffering as well. 
How did this happen? What is the real issue? MediGap insurance policies offer coverage for Medicare's deductibles and coinsurance and pay for many services not covered by Medicare. However, for several reasons, the current MediGap laws do not always meet the needs of Medicare beneficiaries--especially individuals with disabilities. 
First, under current law, individuals with disabilities who qualify for full Medicare benefits before the age of 65 must wait to purchase MediGap coverage until they reach that age. At that time, they are given a 6-month period of open enrollment. This means that unlike the elderly, they cannot obtain MediGap insurance when they become eligible for Medicare. 
Second, even when obtainable, MediGap coverage may be limited. During the open enrollment period, insurers may not use a preexisting condition to refuse a policy for an individual. However, coverage for a specific preexisting condition can be delayed for up to 6 months. This is called underwriting. Even though alternative policies which do not use the underwriting process are available, they do not necessarily offer comparable coverage. Further, Federal law does not guarantee that these alternatives will continue in the future. Thus, individuals with disabilities on Medicare may not receive the same choices of MediGap plans as their senior counterparts. 
Third, such stringent requirements hinder the efforts of seniors who wish to try a Medicare managed care option. They are afraid of not being able to receive comparable supplemental coverage should they decide to return to the traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Accordingly, they do not take the risk of changing. This is perhaps one reason that enrollment in Medicare managed care lags far behind the rest of the population. We must encourage this transition if we are to slow the growth of Medicare costs. 
Fourth, those Medicare beneficiaries whose employer-provided wrap-around plans are reducing or dropping benefits after they become eligible for Medicare will have difficulties purchasing additional coverage. 
Finally, we must consider those who have enrolled in Medicare managed care plans which terminate contracts with Medicare or whom move outside the service area of their plan. In these circumstances, beneficiaries often need to return to the traditional Medicare program and may again wish to obtain supplemental coverage. 
To summarize, although our current policies may encourage many members of the aging population to obtain continuous coverage, they are deficient in encouraging the same for individuals with disabilities who are unable to obtain supplemental coverage even if they have had continuous insurance coverage. They also limit the choices of seniors who wish to switch plans or whose retiree plans terminate or limit coverage. The situation is simply unfair. 
Last fall, the President signed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (the `Kassebaum-Kennedy' bill) which addressed health insurance portability for the small group market. The Medigap Portability Act addresses similar issues for seniors and individuals with disabilities. 
First, seniors will now have more choices than were available before. They will be able to explore the managed care options now available, yet still return to their original Medigap plans if they change their minds. 
Second, if their retiree health plans terminate or substantially reduce benefits, seniors will still have access to supplemental health insurance without regard to previous health status. 
Finally, if their insurance plans should go out of business, seniors will still have Medigap options. 
In other words, it guarantees choice and security for senior citizens on Medicare. 
In addition, the bill guarantees access to the same coverage available to seniors for individuals with disabilities in three ways: 
First, it insures that anyone will be able to enroll in a Medigap plan of their choosing without discrimination during the first 6 months of their eligibility for full Medicare benefits, regardless of age. 
Second, the bill guarantees that the disabled will still have the same access to the array of Medigap choices that are available to seniors after the enrollment period ends, although restrictions may apply. 
And, third, individuals with disabilities who are currently enrolled in the Medicare program will have a one-time open enrollment period to guarantee their access to all Medigap plan options. 
Dr. Purcell is a responsible middle income American who fell through the safety net. He lost both rights and choices. In his own words, `I find it so frustrating that I had really planned for the retirement period and had tried to prepare myself as prudently as possible * * * Yet, I had no idea that my comprehensive coverage would cease after only 2 years. Even though I have always done my best to be a good worker and to provide for my family, the rug was pulled out from under me anyway. I feel so helpless.' 
Dr. Purcell went on to say, `I thought the issue through and tried to determine where I might have the most impact just as one person * * * I felt that my best option was to go to the people who represent me * * * in the national legislature.' 
Dr. Purcell and the 4 million other disabled Americans he represents have legitimate concerns. So do the 34 million senior citizens who are also affected by this issue. They are only asking for the same rights given to working Americans. They are coming to us, their elected representatives, for help. Mr. President, I challenge my colleagues and the insurance industry to respond to these beneficiaries. This bill will provide freedom of choice for seniors and individuals with disabilities. It is a step forward in our battle to improve health care access for all of our citizens and I give it my full support.

 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I introduce the Citizen Congress Act, a bill that ends many of the perks and privileges that separate Members of Congress from the American people. 
Our Founding Fathers envisioned a Congress of citizen legislators who would leave their families and communities for a short time to write legislation and then return home to live under the laws they helped to pass. Unfortunately, we have strayed far from that vision. A strong perception exists among the American people that elected officials in Washington have placed themselves above the laws and separated themselves from the public with perks and privileges. Enacting term limits would be the best way to re-create a citizen legislature, and I remain committed to passing a term limits amendment to the Constitution. In the meantime, reforming congressional pensions, pay, and perks offers an immediately achievable step toward making Congress more directly responsible and accountable to the American people. 
When I was elected to the U.S. Senate a little more than 2 years ago, voters placed their trust in me to help change the way the U.S. Congress does business. With passage of the Congressional Accountability Act and tough lobbying reform in the last Congress, we have begun serious, bipartisan reform efforts. But we cannot afford to stop there. 
Congressional perks and privileges are not limited to gifts from lobbyists and exemptions from certain laws. In fact, most people would be surprised--even shocked--to know that Members of Congress can receive free health care from military hospitals or that they receive automatic cost-of-living adjustments [COLA's] for their salaries and pensions. We must address these issues as well. To continue building confidence in our Government, we must continue building confidence in the people who serve there. 
Today, I join my colleague from Colorado, Senator Wayne Allard, in reintroducing a comprehensive congressional reform bill. The legislation, entitled the Citizen Congress Act, will help restore faith and trust in our Government by attacking the `10 Pillars of Perkdom.' The 10 Pillars include: 
Eliminating the taxpayer subsidy of congressional pensions. 
Eliminating automatic cost-of-living adjustments for congressional pensions. 
Eliminating automatic pay raises for Members of Congress. 
Requiring a rollcall vote for any pay raise. 
Requiring public disclosure of all Members' Federal retirement benefits. 
Banning personal use of officially accrued frequent flier miles. 
Banning taxpayer-financed mass mailings. 
Restricting use of military aircraft by Members of Congress. 
Prohibiting free treatment at military medical facilities. 
Banning special parking privileges at Washington-area airports. 
A companion bill, H.R. 436, was introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Mark Sanford. 
At a time when everyone is tightening their belts to balance the Federal budget and restore confidence in our Government, it is only right that Members of Congress eliminate the perks and privileges that are not necessary to conduct congressional business. The Citizen Congress Act launches the next stage of Government reform by focusing on the Members of Congress themselves. I encourage my colleagues to join me in passing this important legislation and bringing Congress another step closer to the American people.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, commonly known as IDEA, is a civil rights law that ensures that children with disabilities have access to a free appropriate public education. This 22-year-old law has been a great success. 
During the 104th Congress, I served as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Disability Policy. In that capacity, I worked extensively on a bipartisan, common sense approach to reauthorizing this vital law, but time ran out before the full Senate could vote on this comprehensive bill. 
Today, Senator Jeffords and I are picking up where we left off by introducing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997. The IDEA Amendments of 1997, which will serve as the starting point, is the very bill that I introduced last year and that was passed unanimously by the Labor and Human Resources Committee on March 21, 1996. 
We are introducing the IDEA Amendments of 1997 not because the law is failing, but because it is succeeding. 
These amendments reflect the recognition that our Nation's schools are moving past the initial challenge of how to educate children with disabilities to today's challenge of how to educate children with disabilities so that they may become productive, independent citizens. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 will help the Nation's schools succeed in that. 
Twenty-two years ago, before IDEA, a newborn with a disability had little hope of receiving help during the critical early years of development; children with disabilities who went to school were segregated in buildings away from their siblings and peers; and many young people with disabilities were destined to spend their lives in institutions. 
Young people with less-obvious disabilities, like learning disabilities and attention deficit disorder, were denied access to public education because they were considered too disruptive or unruly. These children tended to grow up on the streets and at home with no consistent access to an appropriate education. 
Today, infants and toddlers with disabilities receive early intervention services; many children with disabilities attend school together with children without disabilities; and many young people with disabilities learn study skills, life skills and work skills that will allow them to be more independent and productive adults. 
Children without disabilities are learning first hand that disability is a natural part of the human experience, and they are benefiting from individualized education techniques and strategies developed by the Nation's special educators. 
Children with disabilities are now much more likely to be valued members of school communities, and the Nation can look forward to a day when the children with disabilities currently in school will be productive members of our community. 
As a nation, we have come to see our citizens with disabilities as contributing members of society, not as victims to be pitied. 
As a nation, we have begun to see that those of us who happen to have disabilities also have gifts to share, and are active participants in American society who must have opportunities to learn. 
While there is no doubt that the Nation is accomplishing its goals to provide a free, appropriate public education to children with disabilities, many challenges remain, and we have made an effort to deal with them in the IDEA Amendments of 1997. 
IDEA was originally enacted by the 94th Congress as a set of consistent rules to help States provide equal access to a free appropriate public education to children with disabilities. But over the years, that initial need to provide consistent guidelines to the States has sometimes been misinterpreted as a license to write burdensome compliance requirements. 
The IDEA Amendments of 1997 address these problems. These amendments give educators the flexibility and the tools they need to achieve results and ease the paperwork burden that has kept teachers from spending the maximum time teaching. 
By shifting the emphasis of IDEA to helping schools help children with disabilities achieve educational results, we are able to reduce many of the most burdensome administrative requirements currently imposed on States and local school districts. 
The IDEA Amendments of 1997 streamline planning and implementation requirements for local school districts and States. In assessment and classification, these amendments would allow schools to shift emphasis from generating data dictated by bureaucratic needs to gathering relevant information that is needed to teach a child. 
These amendments also give schools and school boards more control over how they use special purpose funds to provide training, research and information dissemination. We want to encourage every school in America to create programs that best serve the needs of all of their students, with and without disabilities. 
The IDEA Amendments of 1997 clarify that the general education curriculum and standards associated with that curriculum should be used to teach children with disabilities and to assess their educational progress. 
Educators at both the local and State levels will use indicators of student progress that allow them to track the progress of children with disabilities in meaningful ways along with the progress of other children. 
In an effort to reduce confrontation and costly litigation, the IDEA Amendments of 1997 require States to offer mediation to parents who have a dispute over their child's education. The amendments also address the serious issue of disciplining children with disabilities who break school rules that apply to all children. 
By providing fair and balanced guidelines to help schools discipline students with disabilities, the amendments ensure that all children in our public schools are given the opportunity to learn in a safe environment. 
By preserving the right of children with disabilities to a free appropriate public education, by providing school districts with new degrees of procedural, fiscal, and administrative flexibility, and by promoting the consideration of children with disabilities in actions to reform schools and make them accountable for student progress, IDEA will remain a viable, useful law that will provide guidance well into the next century. 
The introduction of the Individual with Disabilities Education Amendments of 1997 today represents my continued commitment to the reauthorization of IDEA. I am pleased that the substantial work done on the reauthorization of IDEA during the last Congress will serve as a foundation for our efforts during this Congress. I recognize that there is still much debate to come, and much hard work to be done before we successfully strengthen and extend this vital law into the 21st century. I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle and the disability and education communities during the upcoming reauthorization effort. 
Together we have the opportunity to bring common sense improvements to IDEA, improving the law and opportunities for children with disabilities.

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, earlier today the President of the United States announced that in his budget, which will be released on February 6, that he would aim to achieve approximately $138 billion in savings in the Medicare program. He described this as a first gesture, which I think should be applauded because the President clearly recognized the importance of saving Medicare and strengthening it for future generations. 
The real issue is what policy lies behind that number of $138 billion in savings. And to make it a legitimate first step, a first step that really does start the debate in Medicare, we need to make sure that there is policy which does things like expand choice for senior citizens, give them the same options that most other people today have. The structural reform I think should include looking at some of the payment methodology, another element that relates to this choice in the structural reform. We have to accomplish this structural reform if we are going to truly strengthen the Medicare program and not just play with numbers. 
Again, we will be looking at a lot of numbers over the next several weeks. I, as a physician, will keep coming back to the importance of having true structural reform built into the program, both part A and part B, in the overall Medicare program so that we truly will strengthen the system and make sure it is there for not only the 38 million Americans today, senior citizens and individuals with disabilities, but is there 5 years from now, 10 years from now, 15, 20 years from now on into the future. 
I say all that to preface my reason for rising today, and that is to introduce a bill, the Provider Sponsored Organization Act of 1997, to be introduced along with my distinguished colleague from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller. This bill, I believe, offers one of those very important structural components which does expand choice for our senior citizens, which when injected into the Medicare system today will do something very important, and that is inject quality into the considerations of options and choices among Medicare recipients. I will explain this shortly. 
Provider sponsored organizations, or PSOs, are integrated health care delivery systems that are sponsored by local health care providers, physicians in hospitals at the local level. Their purpose is to deliver a full spectrum of health services. Very specifically, this bill establishes the Federal solvency requirements, the licensing requirements and those quality standards that PSOs, provider sponsored organizations, must meet in order to come to the table and participate in the Medicare Program. 
It was more than 20 years ago that Congress really stepped up to the plate and, I think, quite innovatively provided Federal guidance for the entry of a brand-new phenomenon, and that was of HMOs, health maintenance organizations. HMOs were established with the primary purpose of coordinating health care delivery in such a way that there could be competition and in some way control those skyrocketing costs that previously had been associated with the fee-for-service programs. What it did, it allowed a combining of the financing delivery system to the health care delivery system. 
Today Senator Rockefeller and I are proposing to level the playing field once again with our bill to allow PSOs, for the first time, to have access to the Medicare market. Our bill sets the national rules by which these locally-based networks of providers may compete head to head with the traditional managed care organizations. All of that is done with the hope that the providers, the physicians, the hospitals, the frontline people who are taking care of patients, will be able to more actively participate in coordinating the overall health care for Medicare beneficiaries. We trust that free and fair competition will give Medicare beneficiaries more choices and ultimately improve the cost, and as I will discuss shortly, the quality of the services they receive. 
All of us know that today's health care market in its broadest sense is in the midst of dynamic change. The cost of care does continue to rise rapidly. There are a growing number of Americans all across this country who are shifting from a traditional fee-for-service model to a managed-care model. Today's paper, the Washington Post, released new figures that show that 75 percent, three-quarters of all working Americans today, receive their health insurance benefits through some type of managed care. Unfortunately, I think, in many ways, the accompanying perception with this shift of managed care, although it is not always fair, has been that managed care companies focus almost entirely on cutting costs, and then only after costs are cut is the quality issue discussed. 
In addition, physicians who have to clear practice decisions through managed care organizations, and I can recall before coming to the U.S. Senate 3 years ago picking up the telephone and calling a bureaucrat or someone sitting 200, 300 and 400 miles away, to ask if I could discharge my patient, or 
if my patient met criteria for discharge, whether the hematic or blood count was appropriate, this intrusion is really resented by physicians, that health care delivery which really is in this country a pact, a relationship between a doctor and a patient. 
The mother-may-I mentality that has emerged has frustrated both parties and providers and led them to question who is in charge. Is it the physician, working with the patient, taking care, who knows that patient, who has been trained to take care of that patient, or is it a bureaucrat or somebody hundreds of miles away? 
On the other side of the coin, it is very clear that managed care has been very successful in forcing an out-of-date delivery system to be more accountable. This has had very important benefits for patients. That leads me to think of how outcomes, data and results are studied very carefully by most managed care organizations, driving us into the whole realm of quality assessment. That has been a huge contribution of managed care, as well as HMOs. Much of that would not have occurred without HMOs or managed care. 
Amidst all this change is a great deal of uncertainty. We have senior citizens who are scared to death to change anything, and that was reinforced in the recent campaigns where huge advertising campaigns were put on television, `Don't change anything.' Today, purchasers, consumers and providers are really forcing attention back to that issue of quality. As a physician, I find that very encouraging. 
People will still tell you today though, as you travel across Tennessee or our respective States, that their fear of managed care stems a great deal from the fact that they feel their physician is no longer in charge of their case, that somebody who is watching just the dollars and cents or some bureaucrat is now in charge of their care. 
Now, this has generated, and it really starts at a grassroots level, has generated a lot of proposals in the last several months, both at the State level and at the Federal level. That includes the ban on the gag rule clauses and various length-of-stay proposals after various procedures that are done in the hospital. 
America's largest health care payer today is the Federal Medicare Program. It has had difficulty, interestingly enough, in attracting seniors to managed care. The figure that I just mentioned, three-quarters of all people today being in managed care, contrasts with those senior citizens, all of whom are in Medicare. Only 11 percent, only 11 percent compared to 75 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are signed up to participate. It is very clear that our senior citizens have a great fear today of being herded into the traditional managed care plans where they have a fear they will not include the physician they choose or the hospital that they might choose. 
The outmoded blank check mentality, on the other hand, of fee-for-service system is not sustainable over time. It can be one of the choices, but it cannot be and will not be the only choice. Given that Medicare's own trustees have reported that the program is going to be bankrupt in 4 to 5 years, Medicare clearly has to find a way to have its growth slowed. 
Medicare beneficiaries who fear managed care may well feel much more secure knowing that they have the choice of a health care plan that is actually run by providers--doctors working with hospitals, and not just a business, not just a traditional insurance company. 
PSOs will help push the market to elevate the level of quality at all levels of plans of negotiation and delivery because of the direct involvement of physicians with hospitals, of the people who are actually delivering that care in every step of the process. Quality, all of a sudden, becomes the primary goal. Once at the negotiating table, you bring physicians into the room. 
Many see all of this as an `us-versus-them scenario.' In fact, neither group acts alone when funds are limited, whether care is paid for by a Government program, an employer, an insurer, an individual. Medicare providers and plan administrators simply must work together to increase the value of health care dollars. 
Before coming to the U.S. Senate, as one who used to negotiate, as a transplant surgeon and running a large transplant center I negotiated with managed care plans. Based on that negotiation, all too often quality was not the issue, really, at the table. People would come in and say, `I need a discount of 10 percent, of 15 percent or 20 percent.' What was missing at that table was someone--a group of providers, physicians with hospitals, working together--who would ask those questions about quality. Why do they ask the questions about quality? Because they are on the frontline. At the table we will bring physicians who are delivering that care to individuals. 
That to me is one of the most exciting things about this bill. It injects quality back into the marketplace. Is there any evidence today that senior citizens will respond to this alternative? This year the Health Care Financing Administration established the demonstration project called Medicare Choices. 
This pilot project is examining ways of expanding the choice of health care plan options available to Medicare beneficiaries. Included in this demonstration are a number of PSO's. Senator Mack recently shared with me his experience in Florida with this new demonstration project during its first 3 weeks of enrollment. A participating PSO in Orlando received 5,500 phone calls from interested beneficiaries in the first 5 days. They have already processed enrollment for 400 Medicare beneficiaries. They started out holding 13 informational seminars each week and had 600 attendees. They are now conducting 15 seminars a week with 700 attendees. In addition, the PSO staffs have been making home visits to those beneficiaries who are unable to come to the seminars, and as a result of those home visits, they are enrolling seven to nine individuals a day. The Orlando PSO has already enrolled another 400 beneficiaries just for February. So, yes, I think our senior citizens will respond to this new option, this new option that expands choice, when we bring physicians and hospitals through a PSO entity to the table. 
Clearly, we can make managed care options more attractive to America's seniors by allowing PSO's to participate in the Medicare program. What are the other advantages that provider-sponsored organizations offer? These groups offer many advantages. 
First, `one-stop shopping' for a coordinated package of health care services really saves time and the expense of negotiating with individual provider contracts. 
Second, because it is the providers who are coordinating care, clinical decisions and utilization reviews are conducted by the providers themselves and not by a faceless third party charged with conducting these reviews. 
Third, incentives to control costs are borne by the only group that can truly deliver systematic quality improvement and cost efficiency over the long run. Why? Because it is the providers who are monitoring that quality. It is the physicians and hospitals who are actually providing that care and, thus, they are in a position to best monitor that quality. 
Finally, PSO's simply tend to have much lower startup and administrative costs, making it easier for them to enter the market in those key areas that we need to look at, and that is the rural areas. These rural areas have a real risk of being underserved without this new entity, a PSO. 
What are the advantages of the PSO's--provider-sponsored organizations--for the country as a whole? The managed care industry has been able to change our paradigms about health care tremendously over the last 10 years. Health care is becoming less costly and more efficient. But now we have to come back to quality and inject quality back into the system and the effectiveness of that health care delivery. By bringing providers, the people delivering that care every day, to the table for the first time in Medicare, PSO's will create that opportunity. 
The PSO's are really in the health care business day in and day out. Remember, it is a group of physicians who, every day, are taking care of patients who we are bringing to the table for the first time. PSO's are in the health care business, not in the insurance business, and they are currently excluded from fair participation in the market by a system ill-suited to their needs. Let me give a couple of examples. 
Providers navigating the complex State licensure process for the first time are really at a significant disadvantage compared to the very large insurance companies and the large managed care plans. In a competitive marketplace, the timing of entry is critical. 
Even though PSO's do not take on the same level of insurance risk as other players, PSO's are now required to submit the same State-defined solvency tests and net worth requirements as HMO's. Since the law now only allows Medicare to contract with organizations that are licensed by the States as HMO's, many PSO's are forced to perform administrative contortions in order to serve Medicare patients--contortions that make them look like insurance companies, even though, in reality, they are not. 
How does the Provider Sponsored Organization Act develop solutions to the problem? 
First, it recognizes the potential for PSO's to serve beneficiaries by enabling them to contract directly with Medicare, thus expanding the range of choices available to each Medicare beneficiary. 
Second, it will provide Federal leadership to the States in fashioning a more nationally consistent, streamlined PSO approval process. 
However, with access must come accountability. This bill will also require PSO's to meet strict standards that ensure that they are able to take on the financial risks associated with delivering health care services for a set fee, but these are tailored to their primary role as providers, as physicians and hospitals; it will require collective accountability, where quality and cost are both measured by overall practice patterns across the entire PSO, not by case-by-case utilization review; 
finally, it will set a standard for quality assurance, a standard that will set the pace for the rest of the industry. 
This legislation--I need to be very clear about this--does not, in any way, eclipse other health care plans. Rather, it complements, adds to the existing menu of health care services. Qualified provider-sponsored organizations will challenge all health care organizations participating with Medicare to meet the goal of an integrated health system, a system which truly provides an environment with lower costs, better care, higher quality, and preserved relationships between caregivers and their patients. 
Mr. President, I send the bill to the desk and ask that it be referred to the appropriate committee.
