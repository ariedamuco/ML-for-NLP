Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as the 105th Congress comes to a close, I want to recognize some of the people without whom the Senate simply could not operate--the loyal staff who serve this institution day in and day out with great dedication and pride. 
The sacrifices staff make are largely unknown to most people outside the Senate, except perhaps their families. When most of us leave for home after a late night, the Official Reporters of Debates, the Parliamentarians, the Bill Clerks, often face several more hours in the office to finish up that day's legislative work. Staff often work around the clock to finalize important legislative measures, such as the omnibus appropriations bill we just passed. 
Anyone who understands the Senate understands the crucial role staff plays. Today, I want to thank all Senate staff for their service to the Senate and to the Nation. 
In particular, I want to mention some of the people who are responsible for the daily operations of the Senate. I begin by expressing my gratitude to the office of the Secretary of the Senate. Gary Sisco, Secretary of the Senate, is responsible for some of the most important activities in the Senate such as the Official Reporters of Debates, the Legislative and Bill Clerks, the Disbursing Office, the Information Systems and Computer Staff, the Senate Page School, the Historical Office and many other vital offices in the Senate. He has done a wonderful job of overseeing and improving the delivery and quality of services of those offices. I appreciate the professionalism and even-handedness he has exhibited throughout the 105th Congress. Gary is ably assisted by Jon Lynn Kerchner, Lura Nell Mitchell and Beth Collett. 
Gregory Casey, who will be leaving the Senate shortly, has demonstrated tireless dedication to the Senate in the execution of his many responsibilities as Sergeant at Arms of the Senate. I'm thankful he didn't have to arrest any of us during his tenure as Sergeant at Arms and I commend him for his excellent management of a very large and complex operation. We will miss Greg and wish him the very best in the challenges that lay ahead. The Sergeant at Arms has been supported by the capable assistance of the Deputy Sergeant at Arms Loretta Symms and Larry Harris, his Administrative Assistant. The Sergeant's office is also assisted by the work of Becky Daugherty, Laura Parker, Carol Kresge, Mallory McCaskill and Laura Rossi. 
I would like to give special thanks for the hard work and consummate professionalism of Jeri Thomson, the executive assistant for the minority, who has provided invaluable assistance to my Democratic colleagues and to me. 
I would also like to thank the staff of our Capitol Facilities office, directed by Roy Banks, who keep this building and our offices clean and are always available, often on very short notice, to provide logistical support for the numerous meetings and gatherings we hold in the Capitol. 
All Senators, I am sure, are grateful for the counsel and support they receive from the staff who work the Senate floor and cloakrooms. That assistance has become even more valuable to me since I became Democratic Leader. 
Our Democratic floor staff works under the excellent leadership of Marty Paone, the Secretary for the Minority. Under great pressure, often with little time and with little margin for error, Marty has time and again provided wise counsel to all Senate Democrats--and even Republican Senators, on occasion. Despite the pressures, Marty always finds time to respond to questions from Senators and staff alike--everything from the routine questions about timing of votes to the most complex analysis of parliamentary procedure. The rare combination of a sharp mind, even temperament, and in-depth experience make Marty one of the most valuable officers of the Senate, and I want to thank him and recognize him for that. In the Secretary's office, Marty is ably assisted by Sue Spatz and Nancy Iacomini. 
Day-to-day management of the floor operation is in the capable and energetic hands of Lula Davis, the Assistant Secretary to the Minority. Lula's ability to juggle multiple tasks--from negotiations over bills that we seek to clear by unanimous consent, to advising Senators and staff on legislative strategy, to acting as informal fashion adviser to many of my colleagues--demonstrates her tireless dedication to making things work around here. Marty and Lula are joined by Democratic Floor Assistants, Gary Myrick and Paul Brown, who have done a wonderful job helping to move legislation and protect Senators' interests. I am profoundly grateful for their dedication, their vigilance and their intellect. They are all ably assisted by Alice Aughtry. 
Our Democratic Cloakroom staff, Paul Cloutier, Brian Griffin, Brian Erwin and Tricia Engle also provide invaluable assistance in many aspects of our Senate life. Among other things, they field countless queries about what the Senate is doing and when votes will occur, including that age-old question, `Will there be any more roll call votes tonight?'. They help us stay on schedule and where we are supposed to be, all the while keeping track of the flurry of legislation that moves through here, and keeping most of us entertained. I salute them for their hard work and good humor and thank them for their assistance. 
It is no exaggeration to say that our ability to navigate the complexities of Senate rules and procedures would be impossible without the assistance of our Parliamentarians. Senate Parliamentarian Bob Dove, with the outstanding assistance of Senior Assistant Parliamentarian Alan Frumin, Assistant Parliamentarian Kevin Kayes, and Parliamentary Assistant Sally Goffinet, provides essential expertise and understanding of Senate procedure. 
Our growing C-SPAN audience has no doubt become familiar with the commanding voice of Legislative Clerk Scott Bates and his assistant David Tinsley; Bill Clerk Kathie Alvarez has also become a notable presence. Kathie is assisted in her duties as Bill Clerk by Mary Anne Clarkson and John Burnham. Our legislative and bill clerks deserve the thanks and respect of all Senators for their keen attention to detail and their patient professionalism. 
Journal Clerk William Lackey and his assistants Patrick Keating and Scott Sanborn; Enrolling Clerk Tom Lundregan and his assistant Charlene McDevitt; Executive Clerk David Marcos, 1st Assistant Executive Clerk, Michelle Haynes and assistants Ken Dean and Terry Sauvain; Daily Digest Editor Thomas Pellikaan, Assistant Editor Linda Sebold, and Staff Assistant Kimberly Longsworth, all have my gratitude for their long hours and hard work. 
I also would like to thank and commend again our official Reporters of Debates for their hard work: Chief Reporter Ronald Kavulick and Coordinator of the Congressional Record, Eileen Milton; Morning Business Editor Lee Brown and Assistant Editor John Merlino; Expert Transcribers Angela Gallacher, Alma Kristoffersen and Bernita Parker; and the Official Reporters of Debates: Jerald Linnell, Raleigh Milton, Joel Breitner, Mary Jane McCarthy, Paul Nelson, Katie-Jane Teel, and Patrick Renzi. 
I also want to thank our Senate Doorkeepers, directed by Myron Fleming and Krista Beal for the friendly and helpful attitude they bring to their jobs, often in the face of long and uncertain hours. Without their assistance and that of all of our Senate support staff, our work simply could not get done. 
Last, but certainly not least, Mr. President, I want to thank my own staff--in South Dakota and in Washington--and the staff of the Democratic Leadership Committees, whom I share with Senators Reid, Rockefeller, and Kerry. These bright, talented people are dedicated to the effort to serve the people of South Dakota and the Nation, as well as every Democratic Senator and their staffs. They do a tremendous job, and I owe each of them a debt of gratitude.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Erskine Bowles will soon leave his post as White House Chief of Staff. He will return to his beloved North Carolina. He returns to his family; his remarkable wife, Crandall, and his exceptional children, Sam, Annie and Bill. If you know Erskine Bowles, you know that his heart has never left them through all his time in Washington. His home and his family are the pride of his life. 
But as Erskine prepares to leave his post, he has a right to feel deeply proud of all he has accomplished here, as well. In so much of the progress made during President Clinton's Administration, you see the steady hand and clear vision of Erskine Bowles. 
He came to the Capital little known to most of us. He had no experience in the so-called `ways' of Washington. Yet before long, the President realized Erskine was the man for the toughest job in town. 
The President's confidence in this choice has been soundly ratified. Erskine leaves here a true friend to every one of us in the Democratic Caucus. He has earned the respect and admiration of Senators on both sides of the aisle. Most importantly, he has put the interests of the country ahead of the problems and politics of public life. By giving of himself--his time and his talents--millions of American families are better off today than they would have been had Erskine never come to Washington. 
Jobless men and women now support growing families. Those workers have higher wages. Those wages have helped fuel a roaring economy. Those families can afford to buy their own homes. Those parents can send their children to college. Those children can share in the promising future that Erskine Bowles helped build. 
Mr. President, earlier today, we passed a massive budget bill. Some have found fault with that bill in both substance and process. Some of that criticism is justified. But, I, for one, am relieved that during this unfortunate process, the country had Erskine Bowles negotiating the substance. Due in large part to Erskine Bowles, there will be 100,000 new, qualified teachers helping our children get the education they deserve. 
There is another important provision in the bill worth noting. For tucked in that $500 billion package, there is funding for the operations of the White House. And from the money dedicated to the salaries of the White House staff, Erskine Bowles takes one dollar a year. 
So as we send that bill to the President for his signature, I will take pride in its support for 100,000 teachers; in its protections for our environment; and for the emergency relief it will bring to our farm families. 
I will also support it for what it represents: Erskine Bowles' salary--probably the smartest single dollar this government has ever spent. 
On behalf of all my colleagues, we honor the service of Erskine Bowles, and wish him and his family the very best in the good days that lie ahead.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as we bring our legislative session to an end, it is appropriate that we pay tribute to an American leader, the outgoing Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus for the 105th Congress, and my friend, Xavier Becerra. 
Our Nation is fortunate to have an actively engaged Congressional Hispanic Caucus to ensure that more Americans have the opportunity to enjoy the rewards and responsibilities of American citizenship. Their efforts have succeeded in increasing educational opportunities for Hispanic Americans, promoting fairness in our judicial system, and protecting political participation vital to our democracy. Millions of people have benefited from effective leadership provided by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and in particular, by Mr. Becerra. 
Xavier Becerra was first elected to represent the 30th District of California in November 1992. In 1997, Representative Becerra was elected to serve as Chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Under his chairmanship, educational opportunities for Hispanic Americans have grown considerably: Hispanic Serving Institutions have received record-level funding, bilingual education programs once threatened have been strengthened, nearly $500 million has been allocated for the President's Latino Education Plan, and equal access to technology for students in rural and urban centers has been enhanced through the e-rate program. 
Chairman Becerra has demonstrated great leadership and distinguished himself as powerful legislative voice in pushing for a positive agenda that includes expanding health care, reducing the naturalization backlog at the INS, promoting fairness in our judicial system, ensuring a fair and accurate census, and protecting voting rights. 
It has been a privilege for the Democratic Caucus to work with Chairman Becerra and his fellow members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. I am going to miss the leadership of Chairman Xavier Becerra, but I look forward to his continuing friendship and to developing a strong working relationship with the next Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I was stunned and saddened to learn this morning of the death of Christopher Georges. 
For much of the last four years, Chris reported on Congress for the Wall Street Journal. He died yesterday from complications of lupus. 
He was not given much time in this world--only 33 years. But he used every minute he was given, and achieved a remarkable amount. 
He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University in 1987 with a degree in government. At Harvard, he was the executive editor of the Harvard Crimson and was named Harvard Journalist of the Year for 1986-87. 
He began his journalism career in 1987 as an intern with the Washington Post. He worked on the issues staff of the Dukakis for President campaign in 1987 and 1988. He returned to newspapers, as a clerk for the New York Times. From the Times, Chris moved to CNN's first special investigative unit. 
After CNN, he was named editor of Washington Monthly magazine. A story he wrote on investigative journalism for Washington Monthly was named one of the `10 Best of 1992' by the 1993 Forbes Media Guide. 
In 1994, he joined the staff of the Wall Street Journal in Washington covering politics, the budget and economic issues. He was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize last year for a series of stories he wrote examining the effects of the new welfare reform laws. 
It was during his time at the Journal that I got to know Chris. He was a brilliant and fair reporter. He understood public policy as well as anyone in this building. He also had a rare ability to see how what we do in this building affects people outside it. 
His stories on welfare reform were a case in point. For months, Chris practically lived at housing projects in the Washington area to see how the new laws affected four women as they struggled to make the transition from welfare to work. 
Chris loved everything about newspapering--the reporting, the storytelling. His abilities, and his fundamental sense of fairness, earned him the respect of people on both sides of the aisle. 
Chris was brilliant, funny, modest, gentle. He was also incredibly brave. 
Like many of us, I had no idea how sick Chris was, how savage and debilitating his disease was. He almost never spoke about it. I now know that Chris struggled with his disease for more than half his life, since he was 15 years old. 
A good friend of Chris's, Gene Sperling, director of the President's National Economic Council, first met Chris when he was 22. He said the first time they stayed up all night working on a project, Chris confided to Gene about his disease. 
Gene asked Chris what it meant to have lupus. Chris was quiet for a moment, then he said, `It means I could die young.' 
As a teenager, Chris had been a fierce wrestler. He was just as ferocious in his efforts to wrestle his disease into submission. He did not allow it to defeat him. 
Perhaps because he knew what it meant to suffer, Chris was an unusually compassionate man. He leaves behind an incredible number of friends. I want to extend my condolences to them. 
I also want to extend my prayers and heartfelt sympathy to Chris's parents, Mary and Jerry Georges of New York City; his sisters, Gigi Georges of Washington; Stephanie Georges Comfort and her husband Chris Comfort of Denver, Colorado and their daughter Katherine. 
In the last year of his life, Chris Georges got to do the kind of reporting he really wanted to do. It was smart and important, and it illuminated what we do here. Had he lived longer, I'm sure we would have seen more of it. 
I will miss reading Chris's stories. More than that, I will miss seeing him and talking to him. He was an extraordinary man.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the statement of managers contains language concerning the proposed HCFA rule that would defer to state law on the issue of physician supervision of nurse anesthetists. As I understand it, this is non-statutory language, and nothing in the bill would prohibit HCFA from moving forward with the publication of the final rule on this issue. I would like to ask my colleague from North Dakota, who is a member of the Committee on Appropriations, is that his understanding of the language as well?

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, then it would be correct that HCFA could base its final decision on data or information that is already available, rather than conducting any new studies. My concern here is to ensure that HCFA is neither discouraged from nor delayed in moving forward in publishing a final rule. It is my understanding that nothing in the report language of this year's Labor/HHS Appropriations bill would prevent HCFA from moving ahead and that any further review of data could follow HCFA's publication of a final rule.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as the 105th Congress comes to a close, I take this opportunity to express my appreciation, and I think the appreciation of all Members on our side of the aisle, and particularly the staff of the Democratic Policy Committee, to an individual who has dedicated 27 years to public service and the United States Senate. Marian Bertram, the personable and talented Chief Clerk of the Democratic Policy Committee, is leaving the Senate at the end of this year. 
Marian, who began her work at the Democratic Policy Committee in 1971, has served four Democratic Leaders--Mike Mansfield, Robert Byrd, George Mitchell and myself. She has an unparalleled knowledge of the legislative process. Since its inception and for many years thereafter, she had the major responsibility of reaching and writing one of the Committee's most popular publications, the Legislative Bulletin. Equally important, she has the vital and demanding responsibility for the production of Voting Records and vote analyses provided to all Democratic members. 
In addition to her legislative work, Marian assumed the job of Chief Clerk of the Policy Committee in 1989. Through her competence and dedication and command of every detail of the Committee's operation and budget, she makes a major contribution to the smooth running of the Policy Committee. 
Marian handles this broad range of responsibilities with professional skill, equanimity, and unfailing good humor. She will be dearly missed by her friends and colleagues in the Senate. 
All of us offer Marian our sincere thanks and every good wish for her continued success. Thank you, Marian Bertram.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Majority Leader for his comments, and I share the Senator's concern about the concentration of NIH funds. I, too, ask if next year we can't find more than $10 million for this program--$10 million that will be split among researchers in 24 states. 
I would also like to explain briefly why I believe IDeA ought to be funded at a much higher level. Mr. President, IDeA funds only merit-based, peer reviewed research that meets NIH research objectives. Let me state that another way: IDeA funds only good science, and it is in no way an earmarked program specific to a specific disease or disease-related issue. Researchers from the 24 IDeA states can submit proposals to any one of a number of existing NIH funding mechanisms, and those proposals are then peer-reviewed and funding decisions are made based on merit. 
Mr. President, I think the statistics the Majority Leader mentioned regarding the extreme geographic concentration of NIH research funds are eye-opening. I think many members of the Senate would be surprised to learn that nearly one-half of NIH extramural funds go to just five states, and that 24 IDeA states combined received just over 5% of NIH extramural funding in FY95. In fact, the Majority leader and I were joined by 24 of our colleagues in the Senate in sending a letter to the Subcommittee Chairman, Senator Specter, supporting $100 million for IDeA in FY99. 
To put that request in perspective, Mr. President, the final FY99 Labor, Health and Human Services and Education appropriation before us increases NIH funding by $2 billion. In other words, a $100 million IDeA program would have designated five percent of one year's increase for this program which funds competitive, peer-reviewed research in 24 states. The conferees did include $10 million for IDeA--an increase from the FY98 funding level of $5 million--and I thank Senator Specter for his support. Because this program is so important, I will continue to encourage the Chairman to increase IDeA funding next year and in the years that follow.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to report that, after years of waiting, families facing the tragedy of alcohol-related birth defects can finally expect a coordinated federal response to their needs. The Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect Prevention and Services Act, which has been included as part of S. 1754, the Health Professions Education Partnerships Act, will establish a national task force to address FAS and FAE, and a competitive grant program to fund prevention and intervention for affected children and their families. 
The Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect Prevention and Services Act was introduced as S. 1875 earlier this year and, with today's Senate passage, will be cleared for the President's signature. It is a modest measure, but its implications--in terms of children saved, families saved, and dollars saved--are dramatic. 
Alcohol-related birth defects, commonly known as Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effect (FAE), wreak havoc on the lives of affected children and their families. The neurological damage done by fetal exposure to alcohol is irreversible and extensive, undercutting normal intellectual capacity and emotional development. A child with FAS or FAE may be unable to think clearly, to discern right from wrong, to form relationships, to act responsibly, to live independently. 
The complicated and debilitating array of mental, physical, and behavioral problems associated with FAS and FAE can lead to continual use of medical, mental health, and social services--as well as difficulty learning basic skills and remaining in school, alarming rates of anti-social behavior and incarceration, and a heightened risk of alcohol and drug abuse. FAS is the leading cause of mental retardation in the United States. 
And it is 100 percent preventable. 
FAS is completely preventable, yet, each year in the United States, some 12,000 children are born with FAS. The rate of FAE may be 3 times that. Researchers believe these conditions are often missed--or misdiagnosed--so the actual number of victims is almost certainly higher. 
The incidence of FAS is nearly double that of Down's syndrome and almost 5 times that of spina bifida. In some Native American communities, one of every 100 children is diagnosed with FAS. 
It has been more than 30 years since researchers identified a direct link between maternal consumption of alcohol and serious birth defects. Yet, the rate of alcohol use among pregnant women has not declined, nor has the rate of alcohol-related birth defects. In fact, both are increasing over time. 
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported a sixfold increase in the percentage of babies with FAS born between 1980 and 1995. This increase is consistent with the CDC's finding that rates of alcohol use during pregnancy, especially the rates of `frequent drinking,' increased significantly between 1991 and 1995. These findings defy the Surgeon General's warning against drinking while pregnant as well as a strongly worded advisory issued in 1991 by the American Medical Association urging women to abstain from all alcohol during pregnancy. Clearly, we need to do more to discourage women from jeopardizing their children's future by drinking while pregnant. 
In addition to the tragic consequences for thousands of children and their families, these disturbing trends have a staggering fiscal impact. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the lifetime private and public cost of treating an individual with FAS at almost $1.4 million. The total cost in terms of health care and social services to treat all Americans with FAS was estimated at $2.7 billion in 1995. This is an extraordinary and unnecessary expense. 
We know FAS and FAE are not `minor' problems. They are prevalent; they are irreversible; they are devastating to the victim and his or her family; and they are a drain on societal resources. We know the word is not getting out--or maybe it's not getting through--that drinking alcohol during pregnancy is a tremendous and senseless risk. We know children with FAS and FAE and their families are not receiving appropriate services, and we are all paying the consequences. 
Given what we know about FAS and FAE, our governmental and societal response to date are clearly inadequate. With this legislation, we are finally strengthening that response. 
To the extent we can prevent FAS and FAE and help parents respond appropriately to the special needs of their children, we can reduce institutionalizations, incarcerations and the repeated use of medical, mental health and social services that otherwise may be inevitable. It makes fiscal sense, but, far more importantly, it is what we need to do for the children and families who suffer its impact. 
The legislation we are sending to the President will establish a national task force of parents, educators, researchers and representatives from relevant federal, state and local agencies. That task force will tell us how to raise awareness about FAS and FAE--how to prevent it and how to deliver the kinds of services that will enable children and adults with FAS and FAE, and their families, to cope with its devastating effects. 
A national task force with membership from outside of, as well as within, the federal government is our best bet if we want to take a realistic look at this problem and address it. The true experts on these conditions are the parents and professionals who deal with the cause and effects of these conditions day in and day out. If we want to respond appropriately, parents, teachers, social workers, and researchers should have a place at the table. A national task force will also provide the opportunity for communities to share best practices, preventing states that are newer to this problem from having to `reinvent the wheel.' 
In conjunction with the task force efforts, the Secretary will establish a competitive grants program. This $25 million program will provide the resources necessary to operationalize the task force recommendations by supporting education and public awareness, coordination between agencies that interact with affected individuals and their families, and applied research to identify effective prevention strategies and FAS/FAE services. 
Mr. President, responding to the tragedy of alcohol-related birth defects is an urgent cause. I'd like to thank the many concerned parents, researchers, educators, advocacy organizations and federal agencies for their invaluable input on this legislation. I am confident this initiative will deliver profound benefits to the Nation, and I am thrilled to see us moving toward its enactment.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to the outstanding achievements of a Nevadan who has dedicated himself to helping individuals who often lack the means to help themselves. Dana Taschner has achieved national recognition as a champion for victims of domestic violence and civil rights abuses. He is a 38 year-old lawyer from Reno who chooses cases that are relatively small-scale, but representative of many of the problems facing Americans. Time and again, Mr. Taschner has had the courage and initiative to take on cases that more prominent firms are hesitant to handle for political or monetary reasons. Dana Taschner truly brings honor to his profession. 
Mr. Taschner's devotion to fighting oppression recently earned him the American Bar Association's Lawyer of the Year award. He was chosen from a pool of approximately 245,000 other lawyers in North America, competing with litigators with much higher profiles and greater wealth. In 1993, Mr. Taschner took on the Los Angeles Police Department and succeeded in forcing them to change their policy regarding police officers who commit domestic violence. In this case, he represented 3 orphans whose father, an L.A. police officer, murdered their mother and then took his own life. Taschner was able to overcome his own painful childhood memories of domestic abuse and secure the orphans a settlement. He argued that the department should not have returned the officer's gun after he had beaten his wife and threatened to kill her. He also forced the department to treat these matters as criminal cases, rather than internal affairs. 
In this era of cynicism and self-promotion, I believe we must take steps to encourage and reward sincerity. Dana Taschner's unwavering dedication to his clients can be seen in his personal relationships with them, relationships that often outlive the outcome of the case. As an attorney myself, I have seen firsthand how much our country needs people in my field who care enough about their clients to commit themselves personally, as well as professionally. Many litigators find it much easier to take the cases that bring financial gain, rather than attempting to help the true victims of injustice. 
I am proud that his colleagues have lavished accolades upon Mr. Taschner, but I believe it is a much greater sign of his success that his clients put their faith in him. Dana Taschner, whose integrity and selfless devotion to fairness truly embody our American justice system, is a role model for us all.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Presiding Officer for his work in disposing of the conference report on S. 1260, the securities litigation legislation. I appreciate very much that at long last this legislation is now going to become law. This is a bill that is widely supported on both sides of the aisle. 
A number of Senators have had a lot of opportunities to take some responsibility for the fact that this passed. I want to cite one Senator, in particular, who deserves great credit. That is the Senator from California, Senator Boxer. She has been a persistent advocate and one who has been extraordinarily engaged in this matter now for some time. I talked with her again this morning because she was calling about the status of the legislation. I was able to report that it was my expectation we would be able to finish our consideration of the bill today, and thanks to the agreement we have been able to reach on both sides of the aisle with Senators who have been as involved as the Senator from Wyoming has, we have now reached this point. 
I congratulate all who have had a part to play in our success, and particularly the Senator from California, for her persistence, for her leadership, and the effort she has made to bring us to this point. 
I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on Saturday, I had a chance to talk about our good friend, Dale Bumpers. I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about four other friends who will be leaving us at the end of this Congress. 
Shortly after he left the White House, Calvin Coolidge was called on to fill out a standard form. After filling in his name and address, he came to a line marked `occupation.' He wrote `retired.' When he came to the next line, labeled `remarks,' he wrote `Glad of it.' I suspect that our colleagues who are retiring at the end of this Congress are also `glad of it'--at least in some small measure. But, in addition to relief, I hope they also feel a sense of pride--both for what they have accomplished here, and the dignity with which they have served. 
In a short time here, Dirk Kempthorne has made all of our lives a little better. Thanks in large part to him, the Safe Drinking Water Act is now the law. Senator Kempthorne has also reminded us of the importance of state and local involvement in our decisions. We will all miss him. 
I had the good fortune to travel with Senator Kempthorne to the Far East. As most of our colleagues know, as we travel we get to know one another even better. I know him and I admire him and I wish him well in his life after the Senate. I also applaud him for the nature with which he has continued to work with all of us. He has a very conciliatory, very thoughtful, a very civil way with which to deal with colleagues on issues. If we would all follow Dirk Kempthorne's example, in my view, we would be a lot better off in this body. His manner, his leadership, his character, his personality is one that we are going to miss greatly here in the U.S. Senate. 
We will also miss Dan Coats. With his thoughtful approach and uncompromising principles, Senator Coats has followed his heart above all else. And, as a result of his support of the Family and Medical Leave Act, millions of Americans are able to follow their hearts, too, and spend more time with their families when they need them most. 
When Senator Coats announced his retirement in 1996, he said, `I want to leave (politics) when I am young enough to contribute somewhere else * * * I want to leave when there is still a chance to follow God's leading to something new.' Wherever Senator Coats and Senator Kempthorne are led, we wish them both the best. I am confident that they will continue to contribute much to their country and to their fellow citizens. 
And we will surely miss our own 3 departing Senators. 
Dale Bumpers, Wendell Ford and John Glenn are 3 of the sturdiest pillars in this institution. They have much in common. They came here--all 3 of them--in 1974. For nearly a quarter-century, they have worked to restore Americans' faith in their government. 
Their names have been called with the roll of every important question of our time. And they have answered that call with integrity and dignity. 
They are sons of small town America who still believe in the values they learned back in Charlestown, Arkansas; Owensboro, Kentucky; and New Concord, Ohio. They are also modest men. 
Perhaps because they had already accomplished so much before they came to the Senate, they have never worried about grabbing headlines here. Instead, they have been content to work quietly, but diligently--often with colleagues from across the aisle--to solve problems as comprehensively as they can. They have been willing to take on the `nuts and bolts' work of the Senate--what John Glenn once called `the grunt work' of making the government run more efficiently. 
They were all elected to the Senate by wide margins, and re-elected by even wider margins. And they all would have been re-elected this year, I have no doubt, had they chosen to run again. 
What I will remember most about each of them, though, is not how much they are like each other they are, but how unlike anyone else they are. Each of them is an American original. 
As I said, I've already shared my thoughts about Dale Bumpers. No Senator has ever had more courage than Dale Bumpers. 
And no Senate Leader has ever had the benefit of a better teacher than Wendell Ford. 
No Leader has ever enjoyed such a loyal partnership as I have. No Leader has ever had a better friend and counselor. 
For the past 4 years, Senator Ford has been my right hand and much more. He is as skilled a political mind, and as warm a human being, as this Senate has ever known. 
Carved inside the drawer of the desk in which Wendell sits is the name of another Kentucky Senator, `the Great Compromisor,' Henry Clay. It is a fitting match. 
Like Henry Clay, Wendell Ford believes that compromise is honorable and necessary in a democracy. But he also understands that compromise is, as Clay said, `negotiated hurt.' 
I suspect that is why he has always preferred to try to work out disagreements behind the scenes. It allows both sides to bend, and still keep their dignity. 
In 1991, Wendell's quiet, bipartisan style convinced a Senator from across the aisle, Mark Hatfield, to join him in sponsoring the `Motor Voter' bill. Working together, they convinced the Senate to pass that legislation. To this day, it remains the most ambitious effort Congress has made since the Voting Rights Act to open up the voting booth to more Americans. 
Wendell Ford has served the Bluegrass State as a state senator, lieutenant governor, governor and United States Senator. His love for his fellow Kentuckians is obvious, and it is reciprocated. 
In his 1980 Senate race, Wendell Ford became the first opposed candidate in Kentucky history to carry all 120 counties. In 1992, he received the highest number of votes ever cast for any candidate in his state. 
Throughout his years in the Senate, Senator Ford has also been a tenacious fighter for the people of Kentucky. He has also been a leader on aviation issues, a determined foe of government waste and duplication, a champion of campaign finance reform, and--something we are especially grateful for on this side of the aisle--a tireless leader for the Democratic Party. 
He chaired the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee for three Congresses, from 1976 through 1982. And, in 1990, Democratic Senators elected him unanimously to be our party whip, our second-in-command, in the Senate--a position he still holds today. 
We will miss his raspy and unmistakable voice, his good humor and wise counsel. 
Finally, there is John Glenn. What can one say about John Glenn that has not already been said? 
In all these 24 years, as hard as he tried to blend in with the rest of us, as hard as he tried to be just a colleague among colleagues, it never quite worked, did it? 
I used to think that maybe I was the only one here who still felt awed in his presence. Two years ago, on a flight from China with John and a handful of other Senators and our spouses, I learned that wasn't so. 
During the flight, we were able to persuade John to recollect that incredible mission aboard Friendship 7, when he became the first American to orbit the Earth. He told us about losing all radio communication during re-entry, about having to guide his spacecraft manually during the most critical point in re-entry, about seeing pieces of his fiberglass heat panel bursting into flames and flying off his space capsule, knowing that at any moment, he could be incinerated. 
We all huddled around him with our eyes wide open. No one moved. No one said a word. 
Listening to him, I felt the same awe I had felt when I was 14 years old, sitting in a classroom in Aberdeen, South Dakota, watching TV accounts of that flight. Then I looked around me, and realized everyone else there was feeling the same thing. 
I saw that same sense of awe in other Senators' faces in June, when we had a dinner for John at the National Air and Space Museum. Before dinner, we were invited to have our photographs taken with John in front of the Friendship 7 capsule. I don't think I've ever seen so many Senators waiting so patiently for anything as we did for that one picture. 
A lot of people tend to think of two John Glenns: Colonel John Glenn, the astronaut-hero; and Senator John Glenn. The truth is, there is only John Glenn--the patriot. 
Love for his country is what sent John into space. It's what brought him to Washington, and compelled him to work so diligently all these years in the Senate. 
People who have been there say you see the world differently from space. You see the `big picture.' You see how small and interconnected our planet is. 
Perhaps it's because he came to the Senate with that perspective that John has fought so hard against nuclear proliferation and other weapons of mass destruction. 
Maybe because he'd had enough glamour and tickertape parades by the time he came here, John chose to immerse himself in some decidedly unglamorous causes. 
He immersed himself in the scientific and the technical. He looked at government with the eyes of an engineer, and tried to imagine ways it could work better and more efficiently. 
As early as 1978, he called for Congress to live by the same workplace rules it sets for everyone else. More recently, he spearheaded the overhaul of the federal government procurement system, enabling the government to buy products faster, and save money at the same time. 
In 1974, the year he was elected to the Senate, John Glenn carried all 88 counties in Ohio. In 1980, he was re-elected with the largest margin in his state's history. The last time he ran, in 1992, he became the first Ohio Senator ever to win 4 terms. 
As I said, I'm sure he would have been re-elected had he chosen to run again. But, as we all know, he has other plans. 
For 36 years, John Glenn has wanted to go back into space. On October 29, he will finally get his chance. At 77 years old, he will become the oldest human being ever to orbit the earth--by 16 years. 
Many of us will be in Houston to see John and his Discovery crew mates blast off. If history is any indication, I suspect we will be wide-eyed once again. 
In closing, let me say, Godspeed, John Glenn and Dale Bumpers, Wendell Ford, Dirk Kempthorne and Dan Coats. You have served this Senate well. You are all `Senators' Senators,' and we will miss you dearly.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the closing hours of the 105th Congress are fast approaching. I could not let this Congress end without coming to the Senate floor to address the tragedy in Kosovo. It is a human crisis of immense proportion, and it poses an increasing threat to the United States and the global community. 
The last several years have been marked by Yugoslavian President Milosevic's steady escalation of political repression and violence against the people of Kosovo. Acting at Milosevic's behest, Yugoslav forces have driven nearly 400,000 Kosovar Albanians from their homes. Fourteen thousand homes and 400 villages have been razed. Over 700 Kosovar Albanian men, women, and children have been killed. 
Within the last several weeks our newspapers have been filled with accounts of atrocities committed by Milosevic's units against scores of unarmed civilians. Among the list of crimes documented by international observers are politically motivated killings; massacres of women, children and elderly persons; torture; arbitrary arrest; detention without cause; denial of fair, public trial; and destruction of private homes. 
Further exacerbating this man-made crisis is the fact that winter is fast approaching, placing at peril the health and well being of tens of thousands of displaced persons who have managed to survive Milosevic's cruelties. 
After watching this recent string of atrocities, the international community was compelled to respond. On September 23, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution condemning the excessive use of force by Milosevic's thugs and demanding that he cease military actions against civilians, withdraw his security units, facilitate the safe return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes, permit unimpeded access of humanitarian organizations to the people of Kosovo, and engage in meaningful negotiations on Kosovo's final status. 
Diplomacy has been and should continue to be a major component of our response to this situation. But we must also acknowledge reality. The reality is that meaningful negotiations toward a settlement of Kosovo's status cannot take place in the current environment. Furthermore, words alone have never been enough to slow Milosevic and his henchmen. This was demonstrated to the world all too painfully in Bosnia. Despite numerous appeals from the international community to end his support for the war in Bosnia, Milosevic repeatedly turned a deaf ear, and the hostilities continued unabated. 
It was only after NATO carried out a series of airstrikes against military forces supported by Milosevic that a cease-fire became possible. 
The circumstances appear to be similar in Kosovo. And, if Milosevic fails to fully and immediately comply with the terms of the U.N. resolution, I believe the time has come for NATO to respond similarly. 
The United States and our NATO allies must be prepared to carry out airstrikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia if such action is determined to be the only means of enforcing the U.N. resolution. 
I say this for three reasons. First and foremost, continued repression, violence, and instability in Kosovo directly threaten the national security interests of the United States. Kosovo is a tinderbox in the heart of one of the most unstable and critical regions of the world. Balkan history has clearly demonstrated that a spark in this region can rapidly spread into a blaze that engulfs the world. We have already seen refugee outflows into Albania and Macedonia. Two NATO allies, Greece and Turkey, with their competing regional interests, could easily and quickly get enmeshed in this crisis if it continues and widens. 
Second, the credibility of NATO, still our most important alliance, hangs in the balance. For nearly 50 years, NATO has been the organization most responsible for keeping the peace in Europe. NATO had great success in the years after World War II and the Cold War. Its post-Cold War utility was proven earlier this decade in Bosnia. What NATO does in Kosovo will go a long way toward determining this crucial alliance's role in the 21st century. A strong, unified NATO is still the best insurance policy we have against large-scale conflict in Europe. 
Third, as the west's history with Milosevic in Bosnia proves, if words are to have the desired effect on his behavior, they must be backed up with a credible threat to use force. Indeed, our recent experience in Kosovo itself bears this out. In the past week or two, Milosevic has launched an effort to convince the world that he is fully complying with the requirements of the September 23 U.N. resolution. Not surprisingly, this behavior occurred precisely as the specter of NATO military action began to loom over him. In fact, there may only be one way to achieve peace in Kosovo without the use of force. NATO must demonstrate to Milosevic that it is prepared to use force to compel his compliance. This is precisely the policy toward which this Administration and our NATO allies appear to be moving. 
Mr. President, in offering my endorsement for this approach, let me be clear. If air operations and missile strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are necessary to force Milosevic to the negotiating table, the United States and our NATO allies should demonstrate that we are prepared to pursue that option. Certainly we should not give the Administration a blank check, but we must accept our responsibility as a world leader and acknowledge that stronger measures may be required. The Administration should continue to consult closely with Congress every step of the way as events unfold. 
Milosevic's atrocities have gone on too long. It's time for the United States to defend its national interests and help restore peace to this troubled region. It's time for the world to say no to the torture and slaughter of innocent civilians in Kosovo.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I don't think anyone could say it any better than that, and I appreciate the Presiding Officer's comments. They are certainly well spoken and very appropriate. I join my colleague from New Jersey in expressing feelings that are very hard to express in public. Senator Bumpers and I have some things in common. I am not as eloquent as he is, but I feel at times such as this probably as emotional. 
I love his sense of humor. I have used more Bumpers material in my public career than anybody else in this Chamber. I don't think this is his story, but I might as well start with it. There was a time when Senator Bumpers was at a dinner. We all go to these banquets over and over and over. We all drag our wives along. And they are so good to come with us so often. Betty was at this particular dinner with Senator Bumpers, sitting, as she always does, at his side supportive and smiling. 
The emcee introduced Senator Bumpers as one who is a model legislator, a model politician, a model spokesperson for Arkansas, just a model person all the way around. On the way home, Dale commented to Betty about what a wonderful introduction that was. They got home; Betty brought the dictionary to Dale, sitting now in his own study, and read to him the word `model,' as it is defined in Webster's. There it is defined as `a small replica of the real thing.' 
Senator Bumpers is a model in the truest sense of the word. In many respects I call him my model, for how he speaks, for what he stands for, for how he interacts with his colleagues, for how he represents his State, for all of the courageous positions he has taken. I don't know how you do better than that. I don't know who it was who once said, `If we are to see farther into the future, we must stand on the shoulders of giants.' Dale Bumpers is a giant. And it is upon his shoulders that we have stood many, many, many times to see into the future, as I have seen. He persuades us, he cajoles us, he humors us, he always enlightens us. 
As I heard Senator Domenici, the senior Senator from New Mexico, say earlier: `He does it in a way that is not in fashion perhaps, not in keeping with what the normal rules of the body are.' The normal rules are, you are supposed to stay at your desk. Not Senator Bumpers. Senator Bumpers has the longest cord in Senate history. I joked the other night, when we finally see Senator Bumpers depart, we are going to cut up his cord and give 10 feet to every Senator and save 10 more for the next. He goes up and down that aisle. 
Since, as we are prone to do in this body, we name things after our colleagues--I happen to be fortunate enough to reside in the Byrd suite--I am going to start referring to that as the Bumpers corridor. And I am pointing, for the record, to my left. For anybody who has served with Dale, I don't have to point at all. We all know what the Bumpers corridor is. 
So it is a bittersweet moment. We recognize the time comes for all of us to depart, to say goodbye. As others have noted, and I am sure more will note before the end of the session, we say goodbye not only to our dear, wonderful friend Dale, but to his wife Betty as well. There is no question, as we all know, he over-married. There is no question who the real force in the family is. There is no question who the visionary and the giant is. As Senator Bumpers so capably noted, there is no question who is beloved in the State of Arkansas. We will miss Betty Bumpers and her vision and her humor and all of her contributions. 
I asked my staff to put some thoughts together and I really want to share some of them because I think, for the record and for our colleagues and for those who may be watching, it is important to remember who it was we just have heard from. 
We heard from a Marine. We heard from a man who volunteered to serve during World War II. We heard from a person who grew up in a small town, Charleston, AR--I don't have a clue where it is--where he worked as a smalltown lawyer and taught Sunday school. He may not have been a Methodist preacher, but he was a Sunday school teacher. He told us about his decision, in 1970, to run for Governor. What he did not say is that he was one of eight candidates vying for the Democratic nomination. He did indicate that polls taken at the start of the race gave him a 1-percent approval rating. That is half of what it is right now. He sold a herd of Angus cattle for $95,000 to finance his TV ad campaign. You couldn't get that much for Angus cattle today. 
He finished the primary in second place, behind someone whose name we all know, Orville Faubus, whose race-baiting brand of politics still dominated much of Arkansas Democratic politics. He beat Orville Faubus in a runoff and went on to beat the incumbent Republican, Governor Winthrop Rockefeller, in a general election by a margin of 2 to 1. 
After being elected Governor, Dale Bumpers was asked by Tom Wicker, then a reporter for the New York Times, to explain how a man would come from obscurity to beat two living legends. He answered simply, `I tried to appeal to the best in people in my campaign.' And that is what he has done his entire public career; he has appealed to the best of people. 
As Governor, he worked aggressively and successfully to modernize the State government. He put a tremendous emphasis on improving education and expanding health services. Then, in 1973, with 1 year remaining in his term, he made the decision to challenge another living legend, William J. Fulbright, for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate. Senator Fulbright was, at that time, a 30-year incumbent Senator. It probably did not come as any surprise to people in Arkansas, but it must have to the Nation, because when all the votes were counted, Dale won that race too, 2 to 1. 
In the Senate, there is not a colleague in this Chamber who has not been affected by his eloquence and his reasoning on everything from arms control to the environment. He has been a champion for rural America. He has been a consistent advocate for fiscal discipline. In the 1980s he voted against the tax cuts, arguing that they would explode the Federal deficit. In the 1990s he took the tough votes needed to eliminate those deficits. 
He has been a tireless defender of the U.S. Constitution and the separation of powers it guarantees. He did not mention this, but he should have. In 1982 he was the only Senator from the Deep South to vote against a proposal stripping the Federal courts of their right to order school busing. He said at the time, while he opposed the use of busing to achieve racial balance, he opposed even more `this sinister and devious attack on the Constitution . . . [this] erosion of the only document that stands between the people and tyranny.' 
This past July, shortly before launching the last of his annual attempts to kill the international space station, Senator Bumpers told a reporter that he expected to lose again but he would try anyway because he thought it was the right thing to do. Then he added, `I probably lost as many battles as anybody who ever served in the U.S. Senate.' 
I want to tell my friend as he prepares to end his Senate career, if you did in fact lose more battles than someone else who may have served here, it is only because you chose tougher and more important battles. Even more than the outcome of your battles, you have earned your place in history for the dignity and the courage and the eloquence with which you have waged those battles. 
I remember, having just arrived--I was elected in 1986, sworn in in 1987--by the end of the year, in 1987, I had already decided who my man for President was. I remember the conversation as if it took place yesterday. I was reminded again, as our colleague spoke on the Senate floor, about his ambition. That was the ambition for many of us as well. He would have been the same kind of outstanding President that he has been the outstanding Governor and Senator we know today. That was not to be. But in the eyes of all of us, Dale Bumpers will always stand as the giant we knew, as the respected legislator we trust, and as the friend we love. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as we near the end of the 105th Congress, I would again like to voice my frustration about the fact that the United States Senate failed to consider and pass important legislation this year that could have greatly benefited the American people. Unfortunately, the highway leading to adjournment is littered with legislation that should have been considered, passed and enacted long ago, including efforts to prevent teen smoking, modernize our public schools, and increase the minimum wage. 
I am particularly disappointed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle prevented the United States Senate from considering managed care reform legislation. Yesterday, Senate Republicans even prevented us from proceeding to their own HMO reform bill. Time and again, the American people have said they want a comprehensive, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights. Toward that goal, several of my Democratic colleagues and I introduced the Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 1998. That legislation addressed a growing concern among the American people about the quality of care delivered by health maintenance organizations. Despite enormous public support for HMO reform, Democratic efforts to consider the Patients' Bill of Rights were stymied at every turn. 
For months, it has been my intention to offer an amendment to the HMO reform legislation regarding a serious deficiency in veterans' access to emergency health care. I was prepared to do so yesterday. Since the Senate was again precluded from debating managed care reform, however, I would like to call attention to this matter before the 105th Congress adjourns by introducing the Veterans' Access to Emergency Health Care Act of 1998 as a separate bill. I hope my colleagues will support this legislation when I introduce it again in the 106th Congress, when I am confident the United States Senate will finally have the opportunity to consider meaningful HMO reform legislation. 
The problem addressed in this bill stems from the fact that veterans who rely on the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for health care often do not receive reimbursement for emergency medical care they receive at non-VA facilities. According to the VA, veterans may only be reimbursed by the VA for emergency care at a non-VA facility that was not pre-authorized if all of the following criteria are met: 
First, care must have been rendered for a medical emergency of such nature that any delay would have been life-threatening; second, the VA or other federal facilities must not have been feasibly available; and, third, the treatment must have been rendered for a service-connected disability, a condition associated with a service-connected disability, or for any disability of a veteran who has a 100-percent service-connected disability. 
Many veterans who receive emergency health care at non-VA facilities are able to meet the first two criteria. Unless they are 100-percent disabled, however, they generally fail to meet the third criterion because they have suffered heart attacks or other medical emergencies that were unrelated to their service-connected disabilities. Considering the enormous costs associated with emergency health care, current law has been financially and emotionally devastating to countless veterans with limited income and no other health insurance. The bottom line is that veterans are forced to pay for emergency care out of their own pockets until they can be stabilized and transferred to VA facilities. 
During medical emergencies, veterans often do not have a say about whether they should be taken to a VA or non-VA medical center. Even when they specifically ask to be taken to a VA facility, emergency medical personnel often transport them to a nearby hospital instead because it is the closest facility. In many emergencies, that is the only sound medical decision to make. It is simply unfair to penalize veterans for receiving emergency medical care at non-VA facilities. Veterans were asked to make enormous sacrifices for this county, and we should not turn our backs on them during their time of need. 
There should be no misunderstanding. This is a widespread problem that affects countless veterans in South Dakota and throughout the country. I would like to cite just three examples of veterans being denied reimbursement for emergency care at non-VA facilities in western South Dakota. 
The first involves Edward Sanders, who is a World War II veteran from Custer, South Dakota. On March 6, 1994, Edward was taken to the hospital in Custer because he was suffering chest pains. He was monitored for several hours before a doctor at the hospital called the VA Medical Center in Hot Springs and indicated that Edward was in need of emergency services. Although Edward asked repeatedly to be taken to a VA facility, he was transported by ambulance to Rapid City Regional Hospital, where he underwent a cardiac catheterization and coronary artery bypass grafting. Because the emergency did not meet the criteria I mentioned previously, the VA did not reimburse Edward for the care he received at Rapid City Regional. His medical bills totaled more than $50,000. 
On May 17, 1997, John Lind suffered a heart attack while he was at work. John is a Vietnam veteran exposed to Agent Orange who served his country for 14 years until he was discharged in 1981. John lives in Rapid City, South Dakota, and he points out that he would have asked to be taken to the VA Medical Center in Fort Meade for care, but he was semi-unconscious, and emergency medical personnel transported him to Rapid City Regional. After 4 days in the non-VA facility, John incurred nearly $20,000 in medical bills. Although he filed a claim with the VA for reimbursement, he was turned down because the emergency was not related to his service-connected disability. 
Just over one month later, Delmer Paulson, a veteran from Quinn, South Dakota, suffered a heart attack on June 26, 1997. Since he had no other health care insurance, he asked to be taken to the VA Medical Center in Fort Meade. Again, despite his request, the emergency medical personnel transported him to Rapid City Regional. Even though Delmer was there for just over a day before being transferred to Fort Meade, he was charged with almost a $20,000 medical bill. Again, the VA refused to reimburse Delmer for the unauthorized medical care because the emergency did not meet VA criteria. 
The Veterans' Access to Emergency Health Care Act of 1998, which I am introducing today, would address this serious problem. It would authorize the VA to reimburse veterans enrolled in the VA health care system for the cost of emergency care or services received in non-VA facilities when there is `a serious threat to the life or health of a veteran.' Rep. Lane Evans has introduced identical legislation in House of Representatives. 
Although I am extremely disappointed that the United States Senate did not debate meaningful managed care reform legislation this year, I am hopeful the American people will continue to urge their elected representatives to pass a comprehensive, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights early next year. I am equally hopeful that any meaningful HMO reform legislation will address this serious deficiency in veterans' access to emergency health care. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that veterans receive the health care they deserve.

Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Vermont. 
I would clarify my comments by adding that the current Presiding Officer was not in the chair, nor was the current Parliamentarian. So it could have been an accident, and I will accept it as that, but I would hope that the Chair--not this particular Presiding Officer--but the Chair would always recognize the importance of following Senate rules. And Senate rules oblige the Chair to recognize either leader before any other Member. 
Mr. President, I wanted the opportunity to talk about why we raised HMO reform today and why it was important that we have a vote. We had the vote on almost a partisan basis--there were a couple of our Republican colleagues who joined us, but it was largely on a partisan basis. Once again, our efforts to bring forth a bill and a debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights failed. I am disappointed because this may be the last opportunity we have to consider this issue. 
We have considered a lot of items over the last couple of weeks. I have reported to the distinguished majority leader that I have heard from many of my Members on a daily basis why it is important to bring up HMO reform if we are going to bring up so many other issues. As the sponsor of the legislation, frankly, I feel much the same with regard to the priority this legislation should have. 
We have attempted to deal with H.R. 10, and I have supported that effort. We have successfully dealt with Internet tax, and I supported that. We dealt with bankruptcy, and, unfortunately, that bill will be vetoed in large measure because we weren't able to come to some successful conclusion in the negotiations, but I supported that. We had time for all of those measures. That our Senate colleagues do not have the time or are unwilling to provide the priority to this legislation speaks volumes about where their real priorities are. 
Democrats have said over and over again there is nothing more important than this legislation, that there is nothing more important on our agenda than passing a Patients' Bill of Rights this year. 
We have held hearings throughout the year. We introduced our bill in March, S. 1890. We attempted over the last 9 months, through myriad parliamentary procedures, to be able to come to some conclusion on this issue. We even proposed working overtime, a second shift, to be able to address a Patients' Bill of Rights in a meaningful way. We even offered the bill as an amendment. We have been thwarted in every single scenario that has presented itself to the Senate to date. 
Frankly, the priority that this legislation should have is probably as great a dividing line as there is between our Republican colleagues and Democratic Senators. Our Republican colleagues first urged insurers to `get out their wallets' and fight protections as though it were a war. 
In April, they voted against the sense-of-the-Senate resolution regarding patients' rights--a vote against access to specialists, against protection from drive-through mastectomies, against an end to the practice of medicine by insurance company bureaucrats. 
By July they had read polls and, frankly, I think they were concerned about the political implications of this issue. Then they introduced a bill, strikingly different from ours but using exactly the same title. The fact is there are now two bills entitled a Patients' Bill of Rights--one that is real and one that is not. Their bill is filled with loopholes that benefit the insurance industry. And today, once again, they have refused to debate the real issues and our real differences regarding this legislation. 
Passage of real patient protections should have been the highest priority of this session of Congress. We should have ended this session celebrating bipartisan cooperation on a bill of this import. 
Instead, our colleagues have thwarted us at every turn. They have ignored how real people get hurt. Over the past year, we have heard story after story of abuses that should have been addressed. 
We heard about a 6-month-old by the name of James Adams, who was burning with a 105-degree fever, and his HMO forced his parents to drive to an emergency room over an hour away, even though there was a hospital closer by. Young James suffered cardiac arrest, and lost his hands and feet. 
We also heard about forty-five-year-old Buddy Kuhl who died after his HMO denied and delayed heart surgery. He left a wife and two young children. We could go on with these tragedies that occur every day outside this chamber. 
The tragedy within this chamber is, with all of these stories and millions and millions of people abused every year, this Congress has ignored and thwarted every effort to address the problem. There is no explanation, no excuse, no way it can be explained away. 
One-hundred and eighty different groups, as disparate as they can be--from doctors and nurses organizations, to organizations representing consumers and workers, to the American Cancer Society--urged the Congress, in as strong terms as they could, to do something, resolve this problem, address it in a comprehensive way. Don't pass a sham bill. Don't say you passed something and falsely raise expectations. Don't talk about how serious the problem is and then not address it. 
We have lost an opportunity to address this issue. We have lost the opportunity to provide critical protections to those who need emergency care, to those who need access to specialists, and to those who have ongoing illnesses who recognize the abuses by HMOs and are increasingly frustrated with Congress' unwillingness to deal with this issue. These are the people who recognize the importance of access to the prescription drugs a doctor prescribes as necessary. They recognize the importance of access to clinical trials. They recognize that the protection against retaliation for doctors and nurses who advocate for patients is critical. They recognize that protection from insurance companies who interfere with a doctor's best judgment is necessary. 
With all the recognition of the problems that exist, with all that realization, we had an opportunity to work in a bipartisan way to resolve these matters. To leave the issue on the calendar, to leave that work undone is indeed a tragedy. 
I acknowledge that our prospects for passing something this year are not good. But I will state as unequivocally as I can that this will continue to be an issue until it is resolved. This will continue to be something we will force on the Senate agenda in whatever way we can--as an amendment, moving to a motion to proceed, finding ways to reach out to the millions of Americans who need our help this year and who will certainly need it next year. 
We must act responsibly. We must act comprehensively. I hope we do it sooner rather than later. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as the majority leader noted, this is a bittersweet time for many of us. We bid colleagues farewell and we recall the times we have had together. In some cases, we have worked together and shared friendships for many years. 
I have been asked to do something somewhat unusual tonight. I have been asked by the staff of our distinguished Senator from Kentucky, my dear friend, Senator Ford, to read a letter they have composed to him for the Congressional Record. 
I am delighted that Senator Ford is on the floor to hear this personally. 
So, as requested, I will read the letter, which was written by his staff. I know my own staff shares these feelings for Senator Ford. The letter is dated October 9, 1998. October 9, 1998. 
Dear Senator Ford: After several weeks of tributes, receptions, dinners and other special events in your honor, we're sure that a man of your humble nature is probably ready to have people quit making a fuss and let you leave town as unnoticed and as low-key as possible. 
However, these weeks have given us the opportunity to hear others tell you what we've also known all along: your legacy of serving our state, your labor of love on behalf of all Americans, and the unfailing kindness you've shown during your time in the United States Senate will never be forgotten. 
On top of just being a plain `ole good boss, you've also been a mentor, a teacher, and someone we could always look up to for guidance and support, no matter the situation. But most importantly, you've been a friend to all of us. 
You've given us the opportunity on a daily basis to personally witness the countless hours of hard work you put in on behalf of Kentuckians. We've seen you stay into the early morning hours here in the Senate during an all-night session, and then rush to catch an early morning plane for a commitment back home. We've seen you toil late into the night working on a conference committee, only to have you beat us into work the next morning with a smile and joke for everyone. 
These are some of the things your Kentucky constituents may never have known. But at the same time, we know they've benefitted greatly from your accomplishments on their behalf and your never-ending desire to see that all Kentuckians, no matter their station, have the tools and opportunities to lead successful and productive lives. 
As we've heard you say many times, it's been a good run. And we could not let today pass without letting you know how much it's meant for us to have had the opportunity to work with you, to learn from you, and have you as our favorite Senator. 
Sincerely, Your Staff.  
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today, with Senator Baucus, I introduce a bill intended to improve health care for Americans living in rural communities. The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1998 would help rural communities attract and retain health care providers and health plans, improve the viability of sole community hospitals, and make optimal use of the advances in medical technology available today. 
Delivering health care in rural America presents unique challenges--issues related to geography, lack of transportation, and reimbursement. With a relatively small population spread over a large area, and health care professionals in short supply, patients often must travel long distances to see a physician or get to a hospital. While these rural communities strive to improve access through telemedicine and recruitment efforts, they must also struggle to maintain what they have, to ensure that providers who leave their area are replaced, and to keep their hospitals' doors open. 
Rural communities have long had great difficulty recruiting and retaining health care providers to serve their needs. Despite great increases in the number of providers trained in this country over the past 30 years, rural communities have not shared equitably in the benefits of this expansion. Even though 20 percent of Americans live in non-metropolitan counties, only 11 percent of physicians practice in those counties, and that percentage has been falling for the last 25 years. Currently, 30 towns in South Dakota are looking for family physicians. 
Telemedicine is a promising tool to provide medical expertise to rural communities. Through telemedicine technology, rural patients can have access to specialists they would otherwise never encounter. The benefits of telemedicine extend to rural health professionals as well, providing them with technical expertise and interaction with peers that can make practicing in a rural area more attractive. Yet the potential of telemedicine has been limited by reimbursement issues and a number of other obstacles. 
In addition to problems with provider recruitment and limitations facing telemedicine, seniors in rural areas do not have the array of health plan options available in more urban areas due in part to a disparity in reimbursement. Although the Balanced Budget Act began to address the issue of low payment levels in rural areas, and has been successful to some degree, budgetary constraints have prevented the expected increase in rural areas. 
The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1998 is intended to address some of the basic challenges facing rural health care. It will not address every health problem facing rural America. It is, however, intended to take important steps to improve access, increase choice, and improve the quality of care provided in more isolated parts of the country. 
The bill addresses obstacles in current law to the recruitment and training of providers in rural areas. One provision in the bill ensures that new rules enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act, regarding reimbursement for medical residents, do not discriminate against areas that train residents in rural health clinics or other settings outside a hospital. 
The bill also helps medically underserved communities plan and be ready for the retirement of a physician. Current law effectively requires communities to actually lose a physician before they qualify for recruitment assistance to replace that doctor. Because recruitment is rarely less than a 6-month-long process, current policy places a community at risk of potentially having no physician available to them for long periods of time. This bill would provide communities with 12 months of lead time to secure recruitment assistance when they know a retirement or resignation is pending. 
The bill would enhance the economic viability of Sole Community Hospitals, often the only source of inpatient services that are reasonably available in a geographic area, by updating the base cost reporting period. 
The bill would ensure that health plans for Medicare beneficiaries who want to develop in rural counties get the increased reimbursement promised in the Balanced Budget Act, while maintaining budget neutrality. This provision is important to ensure that beneficiaries in rural areas begin to have some of the health plan choices available to urban seniors. 
The bill also places significant focus on the promise of telemedicine for rural areas and attempts to overcome some of the barriers that have limited its potential. The bill would expand reimbursement for telemedicine to all rural areas, not just those designated as health professional shortage areas. The bill also would allow reimbursement for services currently covered by Medicare in face-to-face interactions with health professionals. It also would make telemedicine more convenient, by allowing any health care practitioner to present a patient to a specialist on the other side of the video connection. 
Mr. President, providing health care in rural communities raises unique challenges that require targeted responses. Rural America deserves appropriate access to health care--access to providers, access to hospitals, access to quality care, and greater choice. The bill we introduce today takes important steps to achieve these ends.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I want to congratulate the National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA) as its 100th anniversary approaches. One of the Nation's leading membership organizations--representing some 30,000 independent pharmacies across the United States--NCPA will celebrate its 100th anniversary on October 17th. It is an honor to celebrate this landmark with NCPA and recognize professionals who truly exemplify high quality, patient-focused health care. 
Throughout its 100 years of service, NCPA has been a respected voice in the public policy arena--not only as a highly effective advocate for community pharmacists, but as the link to individual pharmacists with the demonstrated expertise and front-line experience required to help evaluate policy options. 
I'd like to take a few moments to recognize the enormous contributions of the men and women NCPA represents: local, community pharmacists. They play a critical role in our nation's health care delivery system through careful drug monitoring services, personalized service, coordination with other health providers and services, and community-oriented care. 
Each year, millions of Americans purchase prescription and non-prescription medications at their local pharmacy, where an on-site pharmacist can help them select the medication that is most appropriate and prevent harmful drug interactions. Pharmacists have the experience and expertise to help consumers face an intimidating array of medication options. They prevent the wasteful spending and pain and suffering associated with drug complications. 
Community pharmacists provide personalized care, and offer a friendly, neighborhood presence for individuals facing illness and disease. An NCPA membership survey shows that 98 percent of independent pharmacists counsel patients face-to-face on prescription medications and make recommendations on over-the-counter drugs and general health care issues, and 97 percent maintain patient profiles. As more drugs are offered through the mail and without the opportunity to meet personally with a pharmacist, community pharmacists provide reassurance and inspire the confidence of those they serve. 
Community pharmacists play a crucial role in local health care delivery systems, by coordinating with other health professionals, promoting public health, and educating consumers on pharmaceutical and health issues. Many independent pharmacists report meeting regularly with local physicians on drug therapy and pharmacy services. In addition, they educate and assist their customers with the management of ongoing and chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. 
Independent community pharmacies are primarily family businesses, and they have roots in America's communities. They are owned by civic leaders who are actively involved in a variety of community-oriented public health, civic, and volunteer projects. Many hold local elected or appointed offices. Public service and commitment to community are hallmarks of independent pharmacy. 
For all of these reasons, it is my pleasure to pay tribute to independent, community pharmacists and the organization that represents them. Through integrity, expertise and tenacity in the face of dramatic changes in our health care system, community pharmacists have inspired the confidence and trust of millions of Americans. Our Nation is truly well served by them.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, with my friend and colleague from South Dakota, Tim Johnson, legislation to make several common-sense changes to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. This bill removes an unintended and unjustified barrier blocking certain children from qualifying for the compensation program. It also makes the necessary changes to allow new drugs to be incorporated into the program, including the newly-approved rotavirus vaccine. 
The Vaccine Act dates back to 1986, when Congress determined that a no-fault alternative to the tort system would best accommodate the dual objectives of ensuring proper compensation to victims of vaccine injuries and fostering continued development and broad-scale availability of lifesaving vaccines. 
Through the Vaccine Act, children seriously injured by a childhood vaccine can receive compensation for medical care, custodial or residential care, lifetime lost earnings, pain and suffering, and emotional distress--benefits comparable to those awarded through the judicial tort system. 
Tragically, some children have been unfairly denied the right to petition for benefits under the program because they did not incur $1,000 or more in out-of-pocket medical expenses. 
At first glance, the eligibility requirement of at least $1,000 in out-of-pocket medical expenses may seem like a reasonable way of deterring individuals from petitioning for benefits if they lack a material claim to compensation. In reality, however, the absence of out-of-pocket health care expenses does not mean a child has not been seriously injured, nor does it suggest they have access to other sources for recoupment of the losses their injury has exacted. 
Many children, including the children of military personnel, Native American children covered by the Indian Health Service, children with Medicaid coverage, and children covered under employer-sponsored health plans with minimal cost-sharing requirements, do not have high out-of-pocket health care costs. 
While health insurance may remove the burden of high medical bills, it does not replace lost income or cover custodial and residential care. It cannot compensate for the toll these injuries have taken and will take on the lives of these children. Health care costs are just one component of the compensation for which a seriously injured child is eligible. 
I know of a Native American child in my own state who was profoundly injured after receiving a diptheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccination. Within hours of receiving the shot, this five-month-old child had a seizure and suffered severe brain damage because of the defective pertussis component of the shot. 
The doctors tell us that his disabilities will, throughout his lifetime, preclude this little boy from having a normal life. He will never live or work independently. But, because he receives health care from the Indian Health Service (IHS), he is not eligible for any benefits under the vaccine compensation program. Not only is this child barred from compensation for lost income and emotional trauma, he is denied financial support for his injury-related assisted living needs. 
Through legislation intended to foster continued improvements in public health, the federal government has obstructed this child's right to sue vaccine manufacturers. But the program's gate-keeping mechanism is off the mark. What we are saying--however unintentionally--to this particular child and others like him is: `Fend for yourself.' To deny this child the benefits available to other injured children is indefensible. 
The Vaccine Act contains other safeguards to prevent unjustified requests for compensation. For example, no benefits claim is accepted without a thorough review and significant medical proof of severe injury directly related to a childhood vaccination. The $1,000 threshold is unnecessary. 
Senator Johnson and I certainly are not alone in calling for the repeal of the $1,000 threshold. In fact, we are in very good company. The Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines voted unanimously to recommend elimination of the $1,000 threshold. 
I hope this Congress will seize the opportunity to reconcile the intended and actual standards of fairness by which the National Vaccine Compensation Program fulfills its role in the public health system. In so doing, we will make a tremendous difference in the lives of children in desperate need of our support. 
There is also a disconnect between the Act's intended consequences and its actual effect in regard to enrollment of new vaccines. Several vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and have met the standards established in the Vaccine Act are still not fully integrated into the program. 
There are currently several vaccines Congress has approved for taxation and inclusion in the Vaccine Compensation Program that, because of a technical error in the legislation, were not authorized as compensable. This bill will fully integrate those vaccines into the program, and it will ensure that all new vaccines will be automatically compensable once the tax is levied. 
In addition, it initiates the 75 cents-per-vaccination tax on the rotavirus vaccine, which will ensure compensation for recipients of that vaccine. The rotavirus vaccine was approved by the FDA in August of this year to protect against rotavirus gastroenteritis, which causes about 125 deaths and 50,000 hospitalizations per year among infants in the United States. Initiation of the excise tax will help protect the 4 million children who are expected to receive the vaccine annually. 
The changes proposed in this bill are not controversial. They are common-sense, and they are overdue. When Congress established the Vaccine Compensation Program, its intent was to protect the rights of victims without jeopardizing an invaluable weapon against childhood illnesses. The underpinning of this program is fairness, a standard that cannot be met until Congress makes these important changes.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that will help rural areas affected by severe population loss improve their economic conditions and create high-paying jobs. We are experiencing first-hand the challenge of retaining entire generations in many parts of rural South Dakota as the agricultural crisis deepens and fewer and fewer young people can find economically-rewarding opportunities that give them reason to stay. As a result, young people are being forced to leave the towns in which they grew up for better jobs in urban areas, causing a depressing loss of generational continuity and a foreboding sign for the future of these rural communities. 
Too often we forget that while the economic growth experienced in our urban areas is a necessary element of a sound national economy, the health and vitality of our rural areas are just as critical to our Nation's economic future, and to its character. If nothing is done to address the out-migration that is currently being experienced by our most rural communities, we will continue to jeopardize the future of rural America. 
That is why I am introducing legislation to provide these critical rural areas with the resources necessary to create the good jobs that will help young families remain active residents of the rural communities in which they choose to live. The Rural Recovery Act of 1998 would provide a minimum of $250,000 per year to counties and tribes with out-migration levels of fifteen percent or higher, per-capita income levels that are below the national average, and whose exterior borders are not adjacent to a metropolitan area. 
The legislation authorizes the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to set aside $50 million in Community Development Block Grant funding. The money, which is already included in the agency's budget, will be allocated on a formula basis to rural counties and tribes suffering from out migration and low per-capita income levels. 
County and tribal governments will be able to use this Federal funding to improve their industrial parks, purchase land for development, build affordable housing and develop economic recovery strategies. All of these important steps will help rural communities address their economic challenges and plan for stable long-term growth and development. 
While Federal agencies such as the United States Department of Agriculture's Office of Rural Development and the Economic Development Administration do provide aid for rural development purposes, there are no federal programs that provide a steady source of funding for rural areas most affected by severe out migration and low per-capita income. For these areas, the process of encouraging economic growth is arduous. I strongly believe the Rural Recovery Act of 1998 will provide the long term assistance required to aid the coordinated efforts of local community leaders as they begin economic recovery efforts that will ensure a bright future for rural America. 
In August, Senator Murkowski and I introduced legislation to provide assistance to rural communities that experience extremely high electric power rates. Today, I am pleased that he has agreed to join me in cosponsoring this legislation to assist rural areas with high out-migration and low per-capita incomes. It is important that Congress do whatever it can to assist these economically-challenged rural areas to remain vibrant participants in the American Dream. Senator Murkowski and I expect to combine these bills and introduce them as a single piece of legislation next year.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know that there is a vote at 3:15. I wanted the opportunity to address the conference report prior to that vote. 
Let me begin first by complimenting the distinguished Chair for the manner in which he has conducted himself in this debate, as he does with all debate. We may have deep differences of opinion on this particular issue, but in true form he has been a statesman and, I think, a model for all of us in the way he has conducted himself. As I say, I take issue with the bill but certainly not with the manager and the Chair of the committee. He has in so many cases done an outstanding job. 
Let me also applaud our distinguished ranking member. This will probably be the final bill that he manages. He knows how strongly I feel about him and the friendship that I have and feel toward him. He is one of the finest Members of the Senate who has ever served, in my opinion. We will miss him more than we can ever possibly express. It is with sadness that I acknowledge that this may be his last bill, but it is with a great deal of satisfaction in looking back over the past 12 years in my service with him that I share many fond memories and many extraordinary legislative success stories. 
The conference report that is before the Senate is one that I believe fails to recognize the extraordinary nature of the circumstances we find ourselves in in the agricultural industry across this country. People on both sides of the aisle acknowledge the seriousness of the crisis. They acknowledge the fact that prices continue to plummet. Many of my colleagues on the Democratic side have indicated that grain prices have already fallen at least 25 percent below the 1997 level. 
I have asked people in the media and around the country to imagine what would happen if Wall Street prices had fallen in 1 year by 25 percent. How many Wall Street Journal articles would we see? How many front page stories in the daily newspapers would we see if prices plummeted that far? Obviously, there would be tremendous national anxiety about those circumstances. 
That is exactly what has happened in agriculture. Prices have plummeted by more than 25 percent. There are some who believe that `business as usual' is acceptable here. I am not suggesting that our Republican colleagues have approached this matter with that in mind, but I do believe that there is a significant difference of opinion. Unfortunately, it does break partly along partisan lines in recognizing the depth of the problem and in dealing with it prior to the time we leave this year. 
Livestock producers today are losing somewhere between $100 and $150 per head. A number of States in the Midwest are likely to lose at least 20 percent of our farmers in the coming year, according to state secretaries of agriculture--these are not my figures, but the secretaries of agriculture in the upper Great Plains who are reporting to us that one out of every five farm and ranch families will probably be forced off their farm or ranch as a result of the circumstances we are facing today. In South Dakota, that means perhaps as many as 7,000 producers who will no longer have the livelihood they have right now. 
Nationwide, we expect an $11.4 billion reduction in farm income. That is over 20 percent. The sad thing is that the Department of Agriculture has just released new figures to suggest that there is no real hope in sight. The fact is, for at least the next 12 months we don't see circumstances improving. 
The last time the Congress was in a situation similar to this was the mid-eighties. At that time, we had a safety net; we had policy positions that allowed us the opportunity to respond more equitably. Some might argue that maybe we went too far. I don't know, what is too far? All I know is, during that critical timeframe, in 1986 dollars, we committed $26 billion to respond to the disaster. Now a lot of that was not decided in the Senate, because there was a safety net already in place. But it was so bad, we committed $26 billion in ways that would soften the blow and keep farmers and ranchers on the farm. It did. A lot of them dug out, got back in the black, and continued to be productive, tax-paying members of rural communities all across this country. 
What we are suggesting is, we can't afford $26 billion, we can't afford $20 billion, we can't afford half that amount, $13 billion. All we can probably commit to, given the array of needs that are out there and given our circumstances, is $7 billion. 
The secretaries of agriculture said, `That isn't enough, we need $9 billion,' and wrote in a letter to us just last week, `We need $9 billion, not $7 billion.' 
What do our Republican colleagues propose? Something less than four--over $3 billion, a fraction of what we did in 1986 when the circumstances were as bad as they are now. 
Mr. President, what we are saying is that given the fact that we could be out of session sine die--that is, without any real expectation of coming back before the next Congress--and recognizing that in the next Congress there is very little chance of being back in this position in January or February during the cold winter months, perhaps not even in March or April--it 
could be at least 6 months before we have a chance to really seriously consider this situation again. We are simply saying that we cannot commit only this meager amount of resources to a situation that, in many respects, is every bit as bad if not worse than in 1986. This cannot be the full extent of our response. That is what the President is saying. The President has reluctantly said that he will veto this legislation. He will either veto it today or tomorrow. It will be vetoed this week. 
So there is no doubt that we are going to be coming back and we are going to have to make a decision as a result of that veto about what we do. Our hope is that our colleagues can come to some resolution quickly. It appears that we are going to have to go through the veto to come back to the table. But, indeed, we will come back. 
So, Mr. President, that is where I believe we have found ourselves. We must, when we come back, negotiate a relief package that is based at least on several principles that I hope will enjoy broad, bipartisan support. First, we must have strong indemnity-related relief for farmers with no crop, and meaningful income relief for farmers with a crop at low prices. In other words, there are two categories of farmers who are in desperate condition today. In many cases in the South, we have a problem of farmers not having a crop. I know that is especially true in Louisiana, and I suspect it is true in other Southern States as well. In the Northeastern States, we have a problem of having a crop, but absolutely no prices. And so we have circumstances that vary, depending on the geographic area. Whatever it is we do, I hope we can agree that both circumstances have to be addressed. 
Secondly, income assistance must be linked to 1998 crop year production. We don't know what it is going to be in 1999. We are told it is not going to get any better. So we must focus on the 1998 crop year and target producers, not just anyone with an AMTA or Freedom to Farm contract, but all producers who otherwise will have no hope of finding the kind of financial security or relief that they need to get through these winter months. 
I hope, Mr. President, that we also could agree, on a bipartisan basis, that losses born by livestock producers who have never had a farm program, and for whom fair trade legislation is critical, could be dealt with successfully as well. There are two things that the Senate did in July that I hope, on a bipartisan basis, we could restore once we come back to the table. The first is country of origin meat labeling. I don't think there is anything that would help more, psychologically as well as financially, than to have the same requirement for meat that we have for virtually every other imported product--labeling. Our farmers and ranchers have said that they believe that, more than anything else, this would improve competition in the retail and wholesale marketplaces. If the American consumer knew what it was they were eating and where it was from, our farmers and ranchers agree almost unanimously that they would be in a much stronger and competitive position. 
The second is to do something that they talk about almost anywhere I go in the country, but especially in the Dakotas, and my home State of South Dakota in particular, and that is improve price transparency. Increase market reporting of prices paid for livestock, specifically by the big packers of formula contract prices. We all know what is happening right now. Secret contracts are being signed with no appreciation for what the market is. That has a devastating effect on the marketplace. Farmers are left in the dark. It would be like going to buy a car or a pickup, or any kind of product, and not knowing what the price was and not knowing what the comparable prices are in the industry and wondering, based upon your best judgment, whether you were getting a good deal or not. We would not do that were we buying a car. We could not do that if we were buying a house. Yet, every day our farmers and ranchers are expected to pit themselves against the big packers and try to guess, using some crystal ball that they don't have, what the market looks like out there. So they are given a price, and in a very short timeframe, they have to decide whether that is a good deal or not. They are losing $100 to $150 a head right now. So we know what kind of deals they are getting. 
We need price transparency. The Senate responded favorably to both of those proposals, but unfortunately they were dropped in conference. I am very hopeful that they can be restored. These are steps we can take immediately that will send a clear message that we understand the circumstances that livestock producers are in. And now is the time for us to deal with it, not next spring after we have lost tens of thousands of producers all over the country. 
Some of these matters that we have debated have a cost-related function. Mr. President, there is no cost to labeling, and there is no cost to mandatory price reporting. Keep in mind, we are suggesting that we would even settle, at least at this point, for a pilot study of those options. Let's analyze what happens when we have full price reporting. Let's analyze what happens when we have meat labeling. We are willing to sunset both of these in 2 to 3 years in an effort to evaluate whether or not they have worked. At least let's get started. I don't think that is too much to ask. 
So, Mr. President, that is why many of us have taken such a strong position on this conference report. Number one, it is our last shot at providing some meaningful economic assistance to agriculture, and, number two, it is an opportunity that we may not have again for 7 or 8 months. We can't wait that long. Our package--the proposal that we are hoping our colleagues would consider--is fair, and it is balanced among all regions suffering low prices and disaster. It is targeted to the people who need it; that is, producers of 1998 crops. It is fiscally responsible. Price relief is linked to the market price, and it addresses the real needs of agriculture. 
Mr. President, what time remains? Is time allocated to both sides?

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I see no other Democratic Senators on the floor, so I will use the remainder of the time. 
We believe that our proposal is also fiscally responsible. We link price relief to the market price, and we certainly recognize that it addresses the real problems that we are facing across the board in agriculture. I think our colleagues on the other side have failed to address the dual nature of the crisis --that is, loss of crops and loss of income. I believe they are failing to recognize the severity of the crisis. As I noted earlier, Mr. President, our Secretaries of Agriculture--the Association of State Departments of Agriculture--held an emergency conference last week to propose to us what they believe ought to be done. Frankly, they said both of our relief packages were inadequate. They said that even $7 billion was inadequate, and even all the policy changes we are recommending did not do what they felt was needed to address the level of need they see today. So if $7 billion and all of the policy changes we have recommended doesn't even cut it, $3.5 billion doesn't cut it, either. 
Over 150 Members of the House voted to send this bill back to conference. I hope that a large number of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will agree to send it back as well. We simply can't leave this Congress without providing essential disaster relief. 
We must not lose this opportunity. We have a true emergency--an emergency that I think jeopardizes farmers' and ranchers' survival in a myriad of ways, and the survival, frankly, of rural communities all across this country. The loss in income that we are seeing has already started to translate into lost farms and ranches. 
When I was home recently a friend told me that a banker he knows is going to be forced to foreclose on 35 farms in just one small community in South Dakota alone this winter. The banker is so disturbed by what he is experiencing that he has actually joined a community prayer group just to deal with the stress he is feeling. 
Another friend who is concerned about the impact that the depressed farm economy is having on communities generally, said that a local cleaning service has laid off all of its employees because they have had no business since the end of July. 
These stories and many, many more are unfolding across the country. As my colleagues have noted already during this debate, we simply cannot leave until we have successfully dealt with this matter. I hope that we can earnestly come to some closure, successfully recognizing the importance of this issue and dealing with it in as comprehensive a manner as is humanly possible. The stakes are too high. The ramifications of failure are too high. Our only real chance to address this matter now is with this legislation. 
Mr. President, I urge a `no' vote on the conference report. I will support the President's veto. More than enough Members of this Senate have indicated already that they will support the President's veto. When that happens, let's get back to work, and let's deal with this issue successfully. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to restore to the original owners and operators, the Blunt Reservoir lands in Sully County, South Dakota. The time has come for Congress finally to return these lands to those who owned them and worked them before they were acquired for the Oahe project. It is clear the lands will never be used for their intended purpose and it makes no sense for the Bureau of Reclamation to continue to manage them with the expectation that someday this project ever will be constructed. 
The history of this project has been one of contention and debate within South Dakota and the federal government. One of the promises made to South Dakota when the Pick-Sloan dams were authorized was that we would be compensated for hosting the dams with the development of abundant irrigation. The centerpiece of that promise was the Oahe Irrigation project, which was to have expanded the agricultural potential of central South Dakota. In anticipation of constructing the Oahe Irrigation project, the Bureau of Reclamation acquired about 25,000 acres of land in Sully County to be used as a reservoir to store water for the irrigation project and for a canal from Pierre to carry the water. Despite taking this initial step, the project became very controversial and, as a result, has never been built. Consequently, instead of constructing the Blunt Reservoir feature of the project, the Bureau of Reclamation has leased these lands to the original owners and operators on a preferential basis and to others on a non-preferential basis, while waiting to see if Congress and the Administration would ever provide the funding necessary to build the project. 
What has become clear during that time is that the Blunt Reservoir feature of the Oahe project never will be completed. It is senseless to continue to ask the Bureau of Reclamation to manage these lands. We should recognize this fact and take the steps necessary to return the lands to the county tax rolls by restoring them to their former owners and operators. 
Those who have sacrificed their lands to this ill-fated project should no longer be forced to live with the uncertainty of wondering if they will be forever renting the lands they once owned. One farmer whose family owned Blunt Reservoir land for four generations recently visited me in Washington and told me that under their current circumstances there is little incentive to invest in improving the land. Without the security of ownership, farmers feel more like hired hands than permanent stewards. At times like these, when the very act of farming is a precarious pursuit, we should pursue every means of providing stability to our producers. 
That is why today I am introducing legislation to deauthorize the Blunt Reservoir feature of the Oahe Irrigation Project in South Dakota, and to transfer to the South Dakota School and Public Lands Commission the preferentially-leased lands. The Commission, in turn, will be required to offer the lands for sale to the original landowners or operators, or their heirs. The legislation also will transfer to the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Department the lands associated with this project that are currently leased on a non-preferential basis. The Department will use the lands to help mitigate the wildlife habitat that was inundated by the Pick-Sloan project. 
Under my legislation, the preferential lessees will be able to purchase the Blunt Reservoir lands they currently are leasing for cash, at a 10% discount from the assessed value, or for a contract-for-deed at the full assessed value. The land also could be purchased with a contract-for-deed if the purchaser makes a down payment of 20% of the value of the land, and pays the balance over 30 years at 3% interest per year. Existing preferential lessees would have 10 years from the date of enactment to decide to purchase the lands, during which time they could continue to lease the lands from the School and Public Lands Commission at the current lease rates. Money gained from the sale of these lands by the School and Public Lands Commission will support education in South Dakota, which has been adversely affected by the replacement of property tax revenue with the perennially inadequate federal payments-in-lieu-of-taxes for these lands and for the Pick-Sloan project lands. It is my hope that in the near future, similar legislation can be developed for the lessees using the Pierre Canal lands that addresses their objectives to purchase the land and the objectives of those who hope to maintain the option of someday developing an irrigation project for the area.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with Senators Harkin, Cochran, and Thompson concerning the treatment of audiological services under the Federal Employee health Benefits Program, or FEHBP. 
According to the American Academy of Audiology, hearing loss affects approximately 28 million people in the United States today (about 1 out of every 10 people), and this number is growing as our population ages. 
This is a matter on which Senator Harkin and I, and also Senator Cochran, have worked for a number of years. It raises significant issues concerning the quality and cost-effectiveness of our hearing care and rehabilitation system, and indeed our entire health care system, and I hope this body soon will consider these issues fully. 
Section 8 of H.R. 1836 is intended to make clear that FEHBP plans can authorize direct services by, and direct reimbursement to audiologists and other licensed health professionals. I believe the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) should make it clear in their next call letter that audiology services provided directly by an audiologist can be covered.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in support of the conference report on the Higher Education Act. This bipartisan legislation takes important steps to lower interest rates on student loans, recruit and train new teachers, and strengthen and preserve the federal commitment to reducing the cost of obtaining a college education. I commend Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for their good work and cooperation on this bill. 
The importance of Higher Education Act cannot be understated. In our increasingly sophisticated economy, access to higher education can be the key to a brighter future for many young people. Our federal student aid programs, including Pell grants, student loans, campus-based aid and other programs have helped millions of students afford a college education. Through these programs, we provide $38 billion in financial assistance to more than 19.4 million students in postsecondary education institutions. 
The legislation we are sending to the President improves these programs in a number of important ways. The maximum Pell Grant is increased to $4,500 in 1999, stepping up to $5,800 by 2004. Interest rates on student loans are cut from 8.25 percent to 7.46 percent, reducing the total cost to students by $11 billion. Borrowers will also be able to consolidate and refinance their loan balances at the new rate for four months. In addition, the bill creates a new program to provide help to disadvantaged students to make sure they know about higher education opportunities and are in a position to take advantage of them. 
Other key aspects of this bill are provisions to improve teacher training and recruitment and to expand professional development opportunities for teachers. Grants will be available to develop partnerships between teaching colleges and school districts to improve teaching skills and integrate technology into the classroom. Support will also be available for partnerships that will recruit and train teachers willing to serve in high-need schools. We know that putting students in a classroom with a well-trained, qualified teacher is one of the most effective ways to help them achieve to the best of their abilities. 
I am particularly pleased that the new law will expand opportunities for distance learning. This will help many people --especially those in rural areas, those with disabilities, and nontraditional students--gain access to programs in which they otherwise might not be able to participate. 
The conference report retains a proposal, which I cosponsored, to encourage colleges to establish campus-based child care for low-income students. I also support provisions to help reduce binge-drinking on college campuses and reduce campus crime levels. 
Finally, I strongly support the provision creating a new grant program for Tribal Colleges and Universities. These institutions do a remarkable job of creating educational opportunities for Native Americans. They need and deserve federal support. I call on the Appropriations Committee to fund these programs so that Native American students can have access to a higher education to advance their own skills and help their communities address the many challenges that exist today in Indian country. 
I also would like to commend the conferees for their efforts to maintain a balance between the Family Federal Education Loan program and the Direct Loan program. There is strong evidence that a healthy competition between these two programs has strengthened both programs and ultimately been good for students, and I believe it is important that we work to maintain this balance. 
I am disappointed about several aspects of this bill. It is unfortunate that resources were not available to reduce costs further for students and to extend the period for loan consolidation beyond four months. 
I am also disappointed that Senator Wellstone's amendment, which would have enabled those receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families to attend post-secondary programs for 24 months and meet the work requirement, was not included in the final bill. I believe this proposal should be revisited because of the positive impact higher education degrees have been shown to exert on earnings, on access to health insurance, and on children's achievement levels, and because of the increased flexibility it offers for states. In South Dakota, access to higher education is particularly important on the reservations, where very few low-skill jobs are available. College degrees have empowered Native Americans to assume leadership and professional positions in their own tribes, and have enabled many to escape the path of poverty, lack of education and under-employment that traps too many living on the reservations. I appreciate the conference committee's willingness to give Senator Wellstone's proposal careful consideration, and I am hopeful that the awareness raised during this debate will eventually lead to expanded educational opportunities for low-income Americans struggling to become self-sufficient. 
Despite these reservations, Mr. President, I believe this is a good bill that will continue our efforts to lower the cost barriers to higher education. The Higher Education Act is a vital investment in our Nation's future. By enacting this legislation, we will help millions of young people gain skills and develop their talents, and help our Nation build a strong work force, develop our intellectual capital, and nurture the leaders of the next generation. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this very important piece of legislation.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just explain. 
I support this legislation, and I hope we can come to some resolution here. Obviously, this is an important bill that ought to be passed. The problem is that, once again, we are presented with an untenable circumstance. Colleagues on this side of the aisle, certainly through no fault of the distinguished Senator from Arizona, have been precluded, to date, from offering our Patients' Bill of Rights. We are running out of time. We are running out of vehicles. We are running out of opportunities for us to have the kind of debate that we all have asked for and expected to have by this day. 
Because we are again put into a difficult position of not knowing how we are going to resolve that outstanding question, recognizing that it is at least as important as this issue, in spite of the fact that I do support S. 442, we are compelled to object today. 
My hope is that at some point in the not-too-distant future we can resolve the issue of how we will debate the Patients' Bill of Rights, and we will then resolve our ability to bring up the request made by the Senator from Arizona. So I object at this time with the hope that we can find some resolution at some point soon.

Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, over the course of the past several months, I have come to the Senate floor on three occasions to discuss what I believe is the most important national security challenge we face today--reducing the risks associated with the spread and potential use of weapons of mass destruction. The depth and urgency of this challenge were dramatically illustrated in a recent article from Scientific American by Drs. Bruce Blair, Harold Feiveson, and Frank von Hippl. I am quoting from that article: 
[M]ilitary technicians at a handful of radar stations across northern Russia saw a troubling blip suddenly appear on their screens. A rocket, launched from somewhere off the coast of Norway, was rising rapidly through the night sky. Well aware that a single missile from a U.S. submarine plying those waters could scatter eight nuclear bombs over Moscow within 15 minutes, the radar operators immediately alerted their superiors. The message passed swiftly from Russian military authorities to the Russian President, who holding the electronic case that could order the firing of nuclear missiles in response, hurriedly conferred by telephone with his top advisors. For the first time ever, that nuclear briefcase was activated for emergency use. 
For a few tense minutes, the trajectory of the mysterious rocket remained unknown to the worried Russian officials. Anxiety mounted when the separation of multiple rocket stages created an impression of a possible attack by several missiles. But the radar crews continued to track their targets, and just a few minutes short of the procedural deadline to respond to an impending nuclear attack, senior military officers determined that the rocket was headed far out to sea and posed no threat to Russia. 
As I noted, this chilling excerpt was not taken from Tom Clancy's latest techno-thriller. It happened. The event described did not occur during the heart of the Cold War. It happened January 25, 1995. It was not an isolated incident. According to public sources, Russian nuclear missiles have automatically switched to launch mode several times. 
A look at the record since the January 25, 1995 incident demonstrates that, if anything, our concerns about Russia's early warning system, command and control system, and the morale of the people assigned to operate these systems, have only grown. That record is clear. No longer should anyone believe Russia's nuclear forces are exempt from the neglect and disarray that has been experienced by her conventional forces. A leading member of the Russian parliament, Lev Rokhlin, best summed up this deterioration: `[Russia's] strategic nuclear forces are headed for extinction. There are no means to maintain the forces.' The dramatic economic downturn in Russia's economic circumstances will only exacerbate this situation. Some may be tempted to take joy in this situation. They should not. As the event of January 25, 1995 reminds us, U.S. security is dependent on the reliability of Russia's strategic warning and launch control systems. 
Reasonable people can only ask the obvious question: with the Soviet Union dissolved and the cold war over for nearly seven years, how can the United States and Russia continue to be one bad call away from a nuclear disaster? 
It is precisely for this reason that last September I sent a letter to the Congressional Budget Office asking them to assess the budget and security consequences of a series of measures designed to reduce the spread of nuclear weapons and the likelihood that they will ever be used. On Friday I received preliminary results from CBO on one means to accomplish this objective--improving Russia's confidence that it is not under attack by providing it with a global awareness of missile launches. 
CBO reaches several conclusions in its report. First, there are a number of deficiencies in Russia's ground- and satellite-based early-warning systems. According to CBO, `Russia's early warning radars will not detect all missile attacks, especially missiles launched on shallow trajectories from submarines.' The situation is similar with respect to Russia's space-based platforms. Quoting CBO, `Russia's satellite-based early-warning system also has shortcomings . . . CBO has estimated that its [satellite] fleet currently provides coverage of the U.S. missile fields for less than 17 hours a day. Thus, Russia cannot depend on its fleet to detect a U.S. missile launch.' Second, CBO states that, `shortcomings in Russia's early-warning system can have a direct effect on the security of the United States.' Nothing demonstrates this reality better than the Norwegian missile launch. Third, there are a variety of options available to the United States and Russia to address deficiencies in Russia's early warning system. Although CBO rightly asserts that further study is required to ensure that U.S. security is enhanced, not compromised, CBO lays out 5 options for U.S. policymakers. I ask that all of my colleagues take a look at this excellent study. 
It must be noted at this point that during the recently concluded U.S.-Russia summit, just days before CBO released its analysis to me, the Administration and the Russians reached agreement to implement the first of CBO's 5 options--sharing early warning information on the launch of ballistic missiles and space launch vehicles. I commend the Administration for this initiative. I believe it is a small but useful step. However, it does not fully address the underlying weaknesses in Russia's early warning systems. The proposal will give the Russians access to some of our early warning data but does nothing to improve Russia's own ability to collect and assess this same information. 
Therefore, much more needs to be done, not only in the area of early warning but elsewhere, if we are to reduce the risk of the spread and use of weapons of mass destruction to an acceptable level. As I stand here today--nearly 8 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War--the United States and Russia still possess nearly 14,000 strategic nuclear weapons and tens of thousands of tactical nuclear weapons. Even more alarming, both sides keep the vast majority of their strategic weapons on a high level of alert, greatly increasing the likelihood of an unauthorized or accidental launch. 
Russia's current economic and fiscal woes only add to my sense of concern. Numerous press accounts point out that Russia's early warning sensors are aging and incomplete, its command and control system is deteriorating, and the morale of the personnel operating these systems is suffering as a result of lack of pay and difficult working conditions. The Washington Post ran an article just yesterday that illustrates how increasingly dire economic circumstances in Russia affect U.S. security. According to the Post, street protests are popping up all over Russia, including a town called Snezhinsk, home of a nuclear weapons laboratory where workers said they have not been paid for 5 months. 
I believe reducing the risks posed by weapons of mass destruction in Russia and elsewhere must be our number one national security objective in the post-Cold War era. In this regard, there are 3 initiatives the United States could take immediately that begin to address these risks: de-alerting a portion of the U.S. and Russian strategic and nuclear weapons, ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and pushing for much deeper reductions in nuclear weapons than currently contemplated in START II. 
However, these measures alone are not enough. We must vigorously pursue other possible avenues, many of which may lie outside the traditional arms control process. Therefore, I have asked the Congressional Budget Office to explore the budgetary and security implications of numerous other `non-traditional' proposals. I understand this work is nearing completion and hope to report back to the Senate on CBO's findings before we adjourn. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Administration in the next session of Congress to fully explore these proposals.

Let me explain, briefly. I share the majority leader's determination to complete work on this legislation. We need to get this bill done before the end of the session. The Senators from Maryland and at least the Democratic Senator from Virginia, as well as the Senators from Illinois, are still attempting to work through some problems relating to the legislation and their respective States. I am hopeful we can come to some successful conclusion in those discussions at an early date, but until that has been completely worked through, we will have to object. 
I hope that we continue to put the pressure on those who are interested, as we are, in coming to closure on this, to get it done soon.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleagues in support of this sense-of-the-Senate resolution that recognizes the rights of U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico to decide their political future. 
I publicly commend the distinguished Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from Florida for their outstanding leadership in bringing us to this point. Resolutions of this kind and legislation dealing with this particular issue have had a roller-coaster ride in this Congress. Were it not for the tremendous persistence of the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from Florida, we would not be here tonight. So I publicly express, on behalf of all of our colleagues, our thanks to them for their leadership, their persistence, and their diligence in bringing us to a point where we hope on a unanimous basis this resolution will at long last be adopted tonight. 
Very simply, the resolution states that the people of Puerto Rico should be given an opportunity to express their views on the political status of Puerto Rico through some form of plebiscite. President Kennedy once said, `The most precious and powerful right in the world is the right to vote in an American election.' 
The great Mexican patriot, Benito Juarez, once said that `democracy is the destiny of humanity.' In the case of Puerto Rico, democracy delayed is democracy denied. The destiny of Puerto Rico's political future should be in the hands of the people of Puerto Rico. Congress should pass legislation that provides the congressional framework to recognize and implement their decision. 
Our Nation is built on democratic principles of equality, opportunity and the right of self-determination. 
Yet, American citizens on the island of Puerto Rico lack the rights to express the basic tenet of democracy, a government chosen by the people. 
In the words of Thomas Jefferson, `That government is the strongest of which every man feels a part.' In regard to Puerto Rico, formal recognition of these democratic ideals is long-overdue. Since the end of the Spanish-American War 100 years ago, we have shared a social, economic, and political union with Puerto Rico. In 1917, Congress granted citizenship to Puerto Ricans. In 1952, the people of Puerto Rico took on local self-government. 
In 1963, President Kennedy called for self-determination for the people of Puerto Rico. 
More than a quarter of a century later, we are still debating the issue in the Senate as 4 million Americans are denied basic democratic rights. I hope we will all agree that this is simply unacceptable. 
The people of Puerto Rico have long demonstrated their patriotism to the United States. Tens of thousands have served in the American military. More than 1,200 Puerto Ricans have died in combat to preserve our democratic way of life. 
Mr. President, I support the right of self-determination for U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico. That is why I am a cosponsor of S. 472, the `United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act,' which provides a congressionally recognized framework for U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico to freely decide statehood, independence, or the continuance of the commonwealth under U.S. jurisdiction. 
As a first step, Congress should adopt this sense-of-the-Senate resolution this year in an effort to resolve the question of Puerto Rico's political status in a fair manner. 
We must ensure we provide full democratic rights for all American citizens, including those who live in Puerto Rico. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, is it my pleasure today to join my colleagues on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee in supporting S. 2286, the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Amendments of 1998. This important bill expands subsidies for snacks in after-school programs, establishes a research program for universal school breakfasts, and makes several administrative changes in the school food service programs, in the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program and in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP). I believe that we have developed a good bill that represents real progress for child nutrition and school food services and I am pleased it has received strong bipartisan support. 
I'd like to take a few moments to elaborate on a few aspects of the bill that are particularly important to South Dakotans and to all Americans. I am a cosponsor of the Schools for Achievement Act, which would give all children, regardless of income, access to a healthy, free breakfast. While we were unable to find consensus on a way to fund a universal breakfast program, S. 2286 establishes a multi-year free breakfast study. The study will be conducted at several sites, both rural and urban, and will rigorously evaluate impact of free breakfasts. The purpose of authorizing this study is to test whether providing breakfast at school helps children perform better scholastically and improves overall levels of child nutrition. I am confident the school breakfast project will justify consideration of the Schools for Achievement Act. 
For Congress to have access to the benefits of this study, however, we need to ensure that it will be funded. Funding for the school breakfast research project is uncertain in the House companion bill, because H.R. 3874 includes only authorizing language and relies on the Appropriations Committee to fund the project. As we all are aware, funds available to the Appropriations Committee have been greatly constrained by last year's Balanced Budget Agreement. If funding were unavailable, this research would be delayed, and the intentions of the authorizers would be undermined. We in the Senate have determined that this study should be conducted and have fully paid for it in the context of the Senate bill. I hope the conferees will agree to this position and agree to provide mandatory funding for this project. 
I would also like to acknowledge that this is a study only. Nothing in this provision would automatically lead to full implementation of a free breakfast program. Congress will need to revisit this issue to determine whether it would be in the best interest of the Nation to take such a step. I believe this is a prudent way to proceed. 
The liberalized administrative guidelines and expanded funding for after-school snacks are also welcome ideas in South Dakota, where our state government recently made a $700,000 commitment to promoting and increasing after-school care. I strongly support that effort, as well as efforts to improve access to after-school programs nationwide. The legislation before the Senate today is another small step toward better care for our nation's school-age children. 
Finally, I would like to reassert my support for the programs being reauthorized by this legislation. Federal nutrition programs have a long, successful, track record of providing food, establishing nutrition standards, and collecting health information that have had a dramatic impact on reducing hunger in our country. School lunches are served to 35 million children around the nation. Seven million children receive school breakfasts. Teachers, parents, child care providers and school cooks are educated on the importance of good nutrition and about the necessary components of a healthy diet. Homeless children are served, commodities are distributed, and thousands of school children receive milk. Given the demonstrated effect of improved nutrition on cognition and behavior, the impact of our investment in the nutritional needs of our nation has been profound. I commend the Committee's efforts and look forward to working with my colleagues to enact final legislation to renew these very important child nutrition programs before the year is over.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today Democrats in the Senate are introducing a bill--The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998, which builds on a legacy of success Senate Democrats have had in the area of anti-crime legislation. 
The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998 continues successful initiatives in the 1994 Crime Act, reforms the juvenile justice system, combats gang violence, cracks down on the sale and use of illegal drugs, ensures the rights of crime victims, and provides valuable tools to law enforcement officers as they battle international crime and terrorism. 
While this bill goes a long way to fight crime in our communities and protect our borders, today I want to speak about the horrific and tragic acts of violence that have occurred in no less than 14 of our nation's schools over the past 18 months, most recently as schools were preparing to close for summmer recess, less than 100 miles from our Nation's Capitol--in Richmond, Virginia--and how this bill targets this school-based violent crime. 
Over the past 18 months, 18 children and four adults have been killed as a result of school shootings. 
When is it going to stop? The nation had seen enough when two students in Jonesboro, Arkansas, ages 11 and 13, began shooting during a false fire alarm. Four girls and one teacher died on that terrible day in March. Since then, 8 more have fallen prey to these school killings. 
The number of students who have experienced a violent crime in school continues to rise, with a 23 percent increase between 1989 and 1995. 
Mr. President, if we are looking for reasons why our schools erupted in gunfire this year, we need only look at the annual survey released recently by the PRIDE organization, a respected non-profit group that works with young people and their families and communities to create drug-free and safe environments. Their annual PRIDE surveys have been used by 5,500 schools, the Office of National Drug Control Policy's Performance Measures of Effectiveness, and this Congress to monitor student drug use. 
The results of the latest PRIDE survey are appalling. Almost a million students--some as young as 10--carry guns to school. 
Even worse, half the students carrying guns are also carrying grudges--over half said they had threatened a teacher, and almost two-thirds had threatened to harm another student. 
What's more, these students are bringing other problems. 
Nearly two-thirds are monthly users of illicit drugs, such as cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine. According to Dr. Thomas J. Gleaton, one of the authors of the study, this means that, on average, for every classroom in every school building in America, one student showed up with a gun this year. Out of these students, two-thirds were using drugs regularly and carrying grudges. Add together this volatile mix of drugs, guns, and hostility, and the result is what we have seen this year. 
If you are not moved by the statistics, look at the shootings. Look at the horror visited on those school children in Rhode Island, Oregon, Washington, Arkansas, Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Look at Texas, or Mississippi, Missouri or California, or the tragic events last year in Alaska. This is a national plight afflicting all our communities. As leaders of our nation, we should all be saddened and discouraged by our lack of attention to this critical problem. 
How many more children must die before we face up to this crisis? 
How can we provide our children with hope for tomorrow if they fear for their life today? 
I can think of no other issue closer to the hearts and minds of the American people than the safety of our children. 
Mr. President, we know some things work to prevent youth violence, and we have included these measures in our bill. 
This bill will establish partnerships between schools and local law enforcement agencies to put specially trained community-oriented officers in schools. We know from the success of the COPS Program that a positive relationship between the community and law enforcement is critical to successful crime prevention. This approach will also benefit schools by providing additional protection and adult supervision to curb violence in schools. In addition, this bill creates a School Security Technology Center to serve as a national resource to local schools trying to make their schools as safe as possible for students. 
The PRIDE survey contained some hopeful news as well, Mr. President. While drug use is still dangerously high, this past school year, for the first time in seven years, the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs by young people decreased across the board. Students who were heavily involved in after-school activities were more than twice as likely to stay away from drugs than students who never participated in these activities. 
Mr. President, we should support after-school programs. Let's give our kids coaches and mentors now--and they won't need wardens and judges later. 
Our bill will protect children from becoming crime victims by providing additional funding for proven prevention programs in crime-prone areas and creating after school `safe havens' where children are protected from drugs, gangs and crime with activities including drug prevention education, academic tutoring, mentoring, and abstinence training. 
We recognized the importance of community involvement when we passed a bill that I joined my colleagues in introducing--the Drug-Free Communities Act. That bill recognized that the entire community must become involved to prevent the proliferation of drugs. 
This year, let's increase our support and encouragement for prevention programs that include parents and children, law enforcement and teachers, mentors and coaches. 
I wish the events of the last 18 months told a different story, but unfortunately it has become evident that some safeguards are needed. If you doubt that, look at what happened in Greensboro, North Carolina, just four months ago when Carlos Gilmer was accidentally shot and killed at his sixth birthday party after he and his four-year-old playmate found a loaded gun in a purse. 
No new crime bill program, by itself, will solve this problem of youth violence. But, we can do something. We know some things that work. 
How will we feel if there is another Jonesboro, or Springfield? How will we look at ourselves if we have not done everything in our power to prevent such a tragedy? Let us act now, so we won't have to face those questions. The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998 will go a long way to prevent future acts of school violence. 
There is much that divides our two parties. But the issue of our children's safety is--or should be--one area on which we can agree. We must protect our children from violence and prevent our children from becoming violent.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their eloquent comments and the contributions they have made to this debate all afternoon. I will be very brief, because I know that Senators wish to express themselves on this amendment, and we will accommodate that. 
There are two points I want to make. The first is that since the Senate has attempted to address this problem in July, the situation has worsened immeasurably. To the extent that we can measure it, it is simply important for all of us to understand that prices have fallen dramatically just in the last 6 weeks. 
For July, corn prices have fallen 28 percent. For wheat, since July, prices have fallen an additional 20 percent. For soybeans, an additional 20 percent, and that is just since July. The bottom has fallen out of the market. The situation continues to worsen. 
Mr. President, we have no choice but to take as immediate an action, as comprehensive an action as we possibly can to address this problem. Very simply, the second point is to simply address one last time what it is we attempt to do. 
The Senator from Iowa ably, again, articulated why we need to increase the cap on the marketing loan. That is No. 1. 
No. 2, so farmers aren't forced to move their grain onto the market, we give them the opportunity to store their grain on an emergency basis. Let me remind my colleagues, we are only talking about a 1-year authorization, first for the loan rate, and second for the storage. 
Third, we provide indemnity losses. The Senator from Louisiana is right and the senior Senator from Louisiana has expressed his concern to me about how this problem is spreading. Louisiana is hit even harder now than they were last July. So the indemnity proposal is absolutely essential if we are going to address the multiplicity of problems we have in agriculture nationally. 
The fourth is that we go back to the issue that we discussed earlier on mandatory price reporting. If we are ever going to change the livestock situation, we must get rid of the secret deals. We must make sure that they--that is livestock producers--have the same opportunities for open and fair competition as others. 
Mandatory price reporting will do that. 
And then finally, we believe that we need to make consistent in agriculture what we have done in every other commodity and industry for as long as I know, and that is, simply label the products when they are imported. We do it for every other product. We ought to do it for the food we eat. 
Mr. President, basically that is what we are proposing today, to address this problem in as comprehensive a way, recognizing that in both livestock and grain we have a serious problem. We cannot wait any longer. This issue must be addressed. This amendment does it. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Hispanic Heritage Month presents a unique opportunity to celebrate the history and achievements of nearly 30 million people of Hispanic descent living in the United States and Puerto Rico. Today, as we stand on the threshold of a new century, we look to the outstanding contributions of Hispanic Americans for inspiration and leadership. 
We should also acknowledge Puerto Rico's 100 years of Social, Political and Economic Union with the United States. I strongly support the right of self-determination for U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico. Citizens in Puerto Rico should have the opportunity to decide their political future, and have a right to political, social and economic equality. 
America has always drawn strength from the extraordinary diversity of its people. Throughout our nation's history, immigrants from around the world have been drawn to America's promise of hope, freedom, and opportunity. These newcomers have shared their cultural traditions and values, contributed to our nation's economy, strengthened our shared belief in democracy and helped create a more fair and just society. 
Earlier this year, the House of Representatives passed the `United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act,' H.R. 856. The Senate version, S. 472, provides a congressionally recognized framework for U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico to freely decide statehood, independence, or the continuance of the commonwealth under U.S. jurisdiction. 
Hispanic Heritage Month provides us with a unique opportunity to again raise the debate of the Puerto Rico plebiscite. I cannot think of a better time to push this issue forward. 
That is why I am joining today as a cosponsor of S. 472. This year, the Senate has an opportunity to grant the 3.8 million American citizens of Puerto Rico an opportunity to decide their own future. Such an election would be the first step in allowing these U.S. citizens an opportunity to exercise one of the most fundamental principles of a democracy--a government chosen by the people. 
In recognition of this historic opportunity, I am hopeful that my colleagues will join with me as cosponsors of S. 472, and that the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources will mark up the bill quickly.

Mr. Daschle. What I hope we might be able to do, perhaps, is to maybe run two tracks, get some debate and offer some of these amendments. We could maybe work out some short time agreements and have a good debate, rather than just putting the Senate in a quorum call, and then work simultaneously to see if [*S5304] we might not be able to address some of these concerns.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation on behalf of Valoris Carlson of Aberdeen, SD, and the handful of others like her whose lives have been terribly disrupted. This legislation will right a wrong that was not due to any error or deception on Valoris' part, but due to an administrative error by the Railroad Retirement Board [RRB]. In addition, the majority of the Board supports the amendment. 
In 1984 Valoris, as the divorced spouse of a deceased railroad employee, applied for a tier I survivor's annuity. The RRB failed to check if a lump sum withdrawal had previously been made on the account at the time of her former spouse's death--even though Valoris clearly stated on her application that there was a surviving widow. In fact, a lump sum payment had been made, but not identified. The RRB began paying Valoris $587 per month in 1984 and continued to pay her benefits for 11 years. In 1994 the RRB discovered that an error had been made over a decade ago. 
Subsequently, Valoris was told she was not eligible for the pension she was awarded in 1984. Had the RRB thoroughly reviewed their records, they would have seen that a lump-sum payment had been made on that account. Valoris, who was married for 26 years, lost her eligibility to the widow of the railroad worker who had been married to him for only 3 years. Valoris made an honest application for benefits. The RRB made an error, resulting in 11 years of `overpayments' to Valoris. 
These payments affected Valoris' planning for the future. Valoris planned her retirement on that modest sum of $587. Had she been told she was not eligible for benefits, she would have worked longer to build up her own Social Security benefits. Her railroad divorced widow's benefit has been her only steady income. She has picked up a few dollars here and there by renting out rooms in her home, but without her monthly benefit income, Valoris has had a terrible time struggling to make ends meet. 
The bill I am introducing today will address the errors made by the RRB that have disrupted the life of Valoris Carlson and others like her. The RRB advises that 15 other widows are similarly situated, and their pensions would also be restored by this bill. 
The bill, which was developed with technical assistance from the RRB, would allow the 16 women impacted by the RRB's administrative error to begin receiving their monthly benefits again. It requires them to repay the lump sum, but they are allowed to do so through a modest withholding from their monthly benefit. The RRB could waive the monthly withholding if it would cause excessive hardship for a widow. 
According to the RRB, the costs of this legislation would be negligible for scoring purposes. 
Mr. President, I will work to enact this legislation as quickly as possible to restore the benefits to those women who are now suffering as a result of the Government's mistakes. It has been four years since these women have lost their retirement income. There is no excuse for further delay in providing these Americans with benefits they were led to expect by the RRB.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as I listen to the debate on S. 1873, two observations come to my mind. First, it appears that a rigid adherence to ideology seems to be trumping the judgment of this nation's most senior military leaders. Second, advocates of S. 1873 apparently lack confidence in their own publicly stated position. They are insisting that the critical and costly decision about whether we deploy a national missile defense should be based on a single criterion--technological feasibility--a simplistic test that the bill's supporters are unwilling to use for any other federal program. 
The Senate should act as it did in May. We should oppose cloture and move on to the Patients' Bill of Rights, campaign finance reform, education, agricultural relief, and the environment--all issues of greater urgency for working families in this country. 
The proponents of this latest attempt to deploy ballistic missile defenses at all costs have entitled this bill the American Missile Protection Act. But let's be clear, enactment of this bill will provide precious little if any additional protection. If the Senate were to immediately adopt this bill, we would not be a single day closer to actually having a national missile defense. In fact, as stated by the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in recent letters to Congress, deployment of national missile defenses at this time is unnecessary, premature, and could effectively increase the nuclear threats this country faces. 
Quoting from S. 1873, `the United States should deploy as soon as is technologically possible an effective national missile defense system.' In the eyes of the sponsors of this bill, the only standard that must be met in deciding whether to deploy defenses is that they be technologically possible. 
Mr. President, I cannot find a clear definition of effective defenses in S. 1873. That troubles me greatly, though it apparently doesn't trouble the bill's supporters. They are strangely silent when it comes to establishing even the most minimal performance requirements for missile defenses. Many of these bill supporters are the same people who reject important domestic programs such as health care and school construction because they fail to meet their stringent--sometimes logically impossible--set of conditions. 
This irony is not lost on me, nor should it be lost on the rest of the Senate. As I noted in May when we last debated this bill, the attitude displayed by the proponents of S. 1873 is cavalier even by military spending standards. Some research by the Department of Defense shows that S. 1873 would make history. For the first time ever, we would be committing to deploy a weapons system before it had been developed, let alone thoroughly tested. 
An additional irony is that most experts believe that a rush to judgment on ballistic missile defenses will not necessarily lead to the deployment of the most effective system. According to General John Shalikashvili, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, `if the decision is made to deploy a national missile defense system in the near term, then the system fielded would provide a very limited capability. If deploying a system in the near term can be avoided, the Defense Department can continue to enhance the technology base and the commensurate capability of the missile defense system that could be fielded on a later deployment schedule.' 
In addition to its silence on the effectiveness issue, there is not a word in S. 1873 about the costs of this system. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the deployment of even a very limited system could cost tens of billions of dollars. And given that so much of the necessary technology remains unproven, history tells us the real cost could be much, much more. Despite the hefty price tag and the questionable technology, proponents of this bill essentially say, `the costs be damned, full speed ahead.' Yet when it comes to proven proposals to improve our nation's schools, increase the quality of health care, or enhance the environment, the first question out of the mouths of the proponents of S. 1873 is, `how much does it cost?' 
Mr. President, S. 1873 also says absolutely nothing about how a U.S. declaration that it plans to unilaterally deploy national missile defenses will affect existing and future arms control treaties. It should be clear to every one in this chamber that if the United States unilaterally abrogates the ABM Treaty, which is what S. 1873 states we will do, the Russians will effectively end a decades-long effort to reduce strategic nuclear weapons. They will back out of START I. They will not ratify START II. And they will not negotiate START III. In other words, a unilateral U.S. deployment of national missile defenses could end the prospect for reducing Russia's strategic nuclear arsenal from its current level of 9,000 weapons down to as few as 2,000. 
I find it hard to believe that many of my colleagues are willing to forego the opportunity to eliminate thousands of Russian nuclear weapons today in exchange for the possibility that we might some day be able to deploy a system that can intercept a few missiles. This is much too steep a price to pay for a course of action that at present is unproven, unaffordable, and unnecessary. 
Supporters of S. 1873 have argued that the Senate should reconsider its position on this issue as a result of three major developments since May--the nuclear weapons tests in India and Pakistan, the Rumsfeld Commission report on the threat posed by ballistic missiles, and North Korea's test of a medium-range ballistic missile. In reality, none of these events suggests we should go forward with premature deployment of national missile defenses. The tests of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan as well as the larger issue of proliferation of nuclear weapons can best and most directly be addressed by swift consideration and ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Adoption of S. 1873 does not directly address this situation and will, in fact, lead to more, not less, nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, the majority side of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has not seen fit to conduct a single hearing on this issue, let alone report out this treaty for consideration by the full Senate. 
As for the remaining two events, I commend to all members of the Senate an excellent letter from General Shelton, this nation's most senior military leader. General Shelton and the rest of the service chiefs take issue with the Rumsfeld Commission's findings and reaffirm their support for the Clinton Administration's current missile defense policy and deployment readiness program. As for the recent Korea missile test, although the letter was written prior to the test, the Chairman's conclusions were explicitly based on the assumption that North Korea would continue the development and testing of their missile program. Quoting General Shelton, the North Korean missile program, `has been predicted and considered in the current examination.' 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to reflect on the advice of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and vote against cloture on S. 1873.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the hour is again upon us, as it was last night. I suggested last night that we move to a second shift, that at approximately 7 o'clock every night we take up legislation our Republican colleagues say we don't have time for during the day. 
I am very disappointed, once again, that our Republican colleagues have objected to doing that. There is absolutely no reason why, with less than 6 weeks left in the session, we leave this Chamber at 10 minutes to 7. There is no reason for that. How many businesses would survive with an incredible amount of production in front of them if they were to say: We are going to take off work early, we are not going to work a second shift, we are not going to work as if we are in a state of emergency, we are going to treat the situation as business as usual? 
Mr. President, that is what we are doing with the schedule right now. It is remarkable to me that with little time left in the session, our Republican colleagues are content to go home and in a sense tell the American people: Look, we don't have time to consider your problems. We don't have time to consider the importance of HMO reform or to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. We don't care; we are going home. 
Mr. President, that ought not be the message we send the American people. So that is why we have suggested working a second shift. That is why we have suggested coming to the Senate floor at this hour each evening to pick up where we left off the night before, to recognize that we will never be able to address this and other serious problems unless we are willing to stay here and do our work. We have worked hard to bring the Senate to the point of passing a meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights. More than 170 organizations wait for us to act tonight. Millions and millions of people who have high expectations about the possibility of realistically dealing with this problem wait for us to act tonight. 
I am disappointed, disappointed, No. 1, that our Republican colleagues again would rather go home than do their work, disappointed that legislation which has now passed in the House languishes in the Senate without any hope of passing unless we stay here tonight or tomorrow night or the next night. And I am disappointed by what it means in terms of the real prospects for accomplishment, the real prospects for getting something done, the real chance that we can leave and close down the 105th Congress feeling good about having addressed one of the most serious problems facing the American people today. 
There are too many insurance companies making decisions for doctors. There are too many women who are being turned out of hospitals too early. There are too many patients who are not being given the opportunity to choose their doctor. There are too many people whose doctors prescribe a medicine only to be overturned by an insurance company. 
Mr. President, it goes on and on. The problem we have is that unless we act, unless we are willing to do our work, unless we take this second shift, we will never have the opportunity to bring this important issue to closure. 
Obviously, there is one other way to do it, and that is to eat up the day throughout the day. We have already indicated that if we can't take a second shift approach, then we have no other recourse but to offer this legislation in the form of an amendment on any vehicle that comes along. Whatever bill may be pending, we will have no other option but to offer it as an amendment, and we will do that just as we have done it before. We will offer it on a bill that will require our colleagues to vote. 
So it is not a question of avoiding the vote. We will either do it in a constructive way on a second shift or we will do it in a confrontational way during the day on the first shift. But we are going to do it. We have said that in the remaining days of this session we must have a vote on minimum wage, we must have a vote on a Patients' Bill of Rights, we must have a vote on campaign finance reform, we must have a vote on pay equity, and we must have a vote on a series of amendments that will improve the crisis in agriculture today. Those are votes we must have, and we must find a way with which to accommodate each other's priorities to allow that to happen. 
Again, let me express my disappointment, my sorrow, my frustration at our Republican colleagues' unwillingness to cooperate with us.

Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate very much the question of the Senator from Massachusetts. The answer is, `No.' 
I know the Senator, who is a real student of history and has a wealth of experience, can go back to those occasions over many, many years when we have found nighttime debates to be the best debates because there are no interruptions. Why? Because Senators don't have to be in their offices with appointments and phone calls. They can be here on the Senate floor. If we are here, we get more interaction. 
There have been some extraordinary debates on the floor of the U.S. Senate after 7 o'clock at night. And the reason for that is because, oftentimes, we do not have so many other tugs and pulls on our schedules. 
So, first of all, the Senator is right when he comments about the historical precedent for this approach. Second, he is correct that not only is it a common Senate practice, but actually the quality of the debate oftentimes is enhanced. Third, unless we do it this way, I fear that we really are not going to have the opportunity to address the issues, as the Senator from Massachusetts has pointed out, that have the highest priority when you ask the American people what we should be addressing. 
So from the perspective of priority, from the perspective of quality, from the perspective of history, the Senator from Massachusetts is correct.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator has asked a couple of very good questions. The first question he asked is why we are quitting work at an hour that could easily accommodate debate on important issues? I think the answer is, we all appreciate a family-friendly environment. We all enjoy being able to go home to our families. By and large, in the last couple of years, we have been able to do that. We have had a family-friendly legislative session that has accommodated personal needs. I think that is understandable, and for the most part, I think I have supported it. 
I think there comes a time, though, when you get to this period at the end of the Congress--not the end of a session, we are talking about the end of a Congress. We have just a few weeks left, and our work has to take priority. 
As the Senator noted, usually Thursday nights have been nights where we work late. What we are suggesting is that we at least take Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights, for the balance of the time that remains in this session, and use that time productively. Let's take 3 or 4 hours and see what we can accomplish--particularly on something as important as the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
The second question is about the degree to which we want to be able to offer amendments. I heard the Senator so compellingly speak about other bills that have required hundreds of amendments, in some cases well over 100 amendments for bills of great import. We are not even asking for that, as the Senator has noted. I think his chart points that out. 
There are categories for which there are legitimate differences of opinion. We want to be able to offer amendments in those areas, to be able to have a good debate and discuss them. But to say you are going to be forced into this three-amendment limit with no ability to talk about all the very serious concerns is just unacceptable and does not do justice to the issue. They say we don't have time for a full debate. We have 3 hours of time. They say we have to limit ourselves to three amendments, even though other bills have taken 150 amendments--we have the time. We have the interest. What is holding them up? No one can really answer that for us. Obviously that is the perplexing question. The bill has passed in the House. Why not debate it here in the Senate as well?

Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his thoughtful comments and for his willingness to engage in this colloquy. 
I think the legislative history ought to demonstrate that there are those of us who truly want this issue resolved. We really are prepared to put in the time and effort to come to closure on what is the most important health question facing this Congress, and that is, how do we deal with the array of problems we are facing in managed care today. 
No one has put more time and effort and leadership into this question than the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. I am grateful for the partnership and extraordinary effort he has demonstrated and put forth in bringing us to this point. 
Mr. President, unless there are further comments, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the leader's comments earlier. I do believe that there is an opportunity here for us to come to some procedural conclusion on how we might address this bill. I think that Senators Grassley and Durbin have been working in good faith. I have had the opportunity to discuss this matter with Senator Kennedy. I personally don't believe the cloture motion is the most constructive approach, but I also recognize that the majority leader has noted that that could be vitiated were we to come to some agreement. 
I think it is a fair statement that if we are forced into a cloture motion, nothing will happen. If we can reach an agreement, there may be an opportunity for us to have a good debate and to have some votes on key amendments, both directly relevant to the bill and perhaps not as directly relevant, but certainly relevant to the American agenda. 
I am hopeful that we can accommodate the needs of Senators who have expressed an interest in amending this bill. I am confident that we can, and I hope this cloture motion will not be necessary.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think that a short explanation may be in order with regard to the objection I just made to the motion that has just been filed by the majority leader. 
Obviously, there are varied opinions about the nature of this legislation and its propriety and how we might pursue some resolution to the issue of individuals transported from one State to another. I think the fundamental question, once more, is simply procedural. Can we find a way to take into account legitimate concerns that should be raised under a debate of this nature? I believe that there are many relevant amendments that will be declared nongermane but that are certainly relevant to this very complex question. 
If a cloture motion on the bill were to be successful, it would preclude those amendments. It is for that reason that I objected. 
It is also worth noting that we are being asked to proceed to yet another bill that has had little debate at the same time we are being told that there is not enough time left in the session to debate HMO reform. That causes me concern as well. 
Perhaps we could explore the possibility of coming up with a definitive list on this legislation as we are attempting to do on bankruptcy. I don't know. But I do know this, that filing cloture prior to the time we had a debate, filing cloture prior to the time we have even considered whether that option is available to us, in my view, is premature, and for that reason I had to object. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah. I want to explain, again, what transpired just a couple of moments ago with regard to our unanimous consent request. 
For the information of all Senators, we made the request that the Senate have the opportunity to take up the HMO reform bill, the House-passed HMO reform bill, Calendar No. 505, and that it be the pending business every day after the completion of the legislative business as outlined by the majority leader and the distinguished Senator from Utah today. 
Why are we suggesting this? We are proposing this because many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said that we do not have time to take up a careful consideration of HMO reform; we don't have the ability to consider a number of amendments that ought to be considered with legislation as complex as this. 
We understand that the Senate has spent days on other bills--150 amendments on the defense bill, over 100 amendments on the highway bill, and over 50 amendments on just about every appropriations bill each. But the Republican leadership has said all we ought to have on HMO reform is three amendments. Why? Because we don't have time. That has been their premise. We don't have time to deal with this issue, but we have time to deal with a missile defense bill that we will debate in the morning, that would commit hundreds of billions of dollars over the course of many years to a missile system that has failed every single time it has been tested to date. 
The only criteria we would use to evaluate that system is technological feasibility, regardless of cost, regardless of effectiveness, and regardless of its implications for treaties around the world. Our Republican colleagues are asking us to commit to a missile defense system, opposed by the Pentagon, that would commit hundreds of billions of dollars. That is what the vote is about tomorrow, and we have time for it. But we don't have time for dealing directly with the concerns of millions of Americans who day by day are shut out of a health system because their insurance company is playing doctor. 
We are simply saying, if we don't have time, let's make time. Let's do what others have already done in past Congresses and certainly in other situations where production becomes a problem. Let us add a second shift. Let us address this issue on the second shift. Let's work longer. Let's make more hours. Let's do what we must to complete our work. 
It is only 6:20, and Senators have already left for the day. We didn't have a vote until 3:30 this afternoon to accommodate Senators who were traveling. Senators have just arrived. I am sure they would be more than willing to stay for a few hours more to debate and to consider carefully the HMO reform bill--6:20 in the evening and people are gone. Tomorrow we start with a vote at 9:30. We will have another vote at 5 o'clock, and we may be gone again. 
Mr. President, we are simply asking our colleagues to put in a full day's work, to do what others would do under these circumstances--to add a second shift, to work overtime, to complete our work in what days we have left in this session of Congress. 
We will continue to push for this approach and offer it in a sequence of requests simply to make the point that at 6:20 in the afternoon, our work shouldn't be done. At 6:20 in the afternoon, we shouldn't be leaving. I don't understand why we couldn't have completed our work on campaign finance reform. I don't understand why we shouldn't be on the floor debating that issue right now. But everybody is gone, and the clock keeps ticking and the calendar pages turn, and time runs out. 
We can run out the clock, but there is no reason why we can't make that clock work harder. There isn't any reason why we can't work longer, and we will make every effort to assure that the Senate does its job. I regret very much that we are not doing it tonight. I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have no intention of offering an amendment at this time. As I understand it, we are waiting for Senator McCain to come to the floor to offer an amendment on campaign finance reform. I hope we could have that debate sometime this afternoon. 
I hate to see time pass without having the opportunity to talk about the array of issues that are pending before this body. Obviously, campaign finance reform is a matter of great concern to many Senators on both sides of the aisle, and I know Senator McCain and Senator Feingold have indicated their desire to offer an amendment, as I understand it, this afternoon. Senator Lott, now, has expressed a desire to have a vote on campaign finance reform at some point this week. Given Senator Lott's pessimism about its chances for passage, I assume that he believes that he has the necessary votes to defeat the amendment, or to defeat a move to bring cloture on the amendment this week. 
I will tell you, it will not be the last vote we have on campaign finance reform, because we will offer it again and again. Whether it is Senator Feingold and Senator McCain or others, I think it important that we ultimately have a vote on the issue itself. 
While we wait on that particular vote and that debate, which I hope will take place sometime soon, I call attention also to the other amendments we wish to offer. 
We will be offering an amendment on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We believe it is essential that we have the opportunity to come to closure on that important issue as well. It has passed in the House, as has campaign finance reform. They are both now pending in the Senate. We have indicated a willingness to take up the Shays-Meehan bill as it exists, pass it, and send it on for signature. 
We are not quite prepared to do the same on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We think we can improve on the House-passed bill, and having that debate is very important. 
In addition to that, we will be offering a series of amendments, as we have noted in the past, on agriculture. I have just returned from South Dakota with a similar impression as others who have returned from their home States about how serious the situation is and how problematic it is becoming for an increasing number of our producers. We will offer an amendment to increase the loan rate. I hope on a bipartisan basis we can support that. 
We will offer an amendment to provide storage payments to farmers so they are not forced to sell their grain now. 
We will be offering an amendment to provide for loan deficiency payments for corn silage, something farmers are so desirous of having simply because they are forced to sell grain that is absolutely worthless right now. At least silage will give them an opportunity to feed their livestock. 
We will be offering other amendments, because we don't believe there is any other choice. 
Mr. President, one could make the argument that with all of this work to be done, we simply can't consider running the Senate in a business-as-usual fashion. We have to take into account the end of the session, the plethora of legislative needs that are out there, and the agenda that places before us. 
So we will be offering a proposal. Our proposal is really pretty simple. Our proposal is that we approach the legislative schedule between now and the end of the session in two shifts; that we take the first shift to address the appropriations bills and some of the array of issues that the majority leader has considered scheduling. As I understand it, we will have a vote tomorrow on missile defense. We will have the bankruptcy bill and other bills. 
But then we propose a second shift. Beginning early in the evening and going until whatever time it takes each night, we would dedicate the Senate to the needs that we haven't addressed and the array of issues that the majority leader says we don't have time for. We do have time for them if we make time. We do have time for them if we actually engage in what businesses do all the time. If they want to increase production, they go to a second shift. 
The time has come for us to increase production. The time has come for us to recognize that we can't consider the Senate agenda in the remaining time that we have available in a business-as-usual fashion. We have yet to pass a budget. Unbelievable as it may be, regardless of what the law requires, our Republican leadership has renounced the law, has abdicated their responsibilities, and has concluded that they somehow can violate the requirements of the law and not pass a budget resolution. I am not sure how you do that. I am not sure of the legal implications of doing it. But if we are not going to address a budget resolution simply because, as the leadership has noted, we don't have time, then, again, our solution, our suggestion, is that we make time. 
Let's consider a second shift. Let's consider working overtime. Let's consider doing what we must, as any business, as any manager, would do. With all the work that is before us, let us consider doing what we must and putting in the hours to resolve these issues and complete our work before the end of the session. 
Mr. President, it is really not very complicated. If we work until a certain time as if we were going to adjourn, then move to the second shift and take up the second agenda, we can complete our work. As I understand it, things like this have been done before, and it is time we do it now. We have very few days left. Less than 6 weeks from now, the Senate is anticipating adjournment. We simply can't adjourn without having addressed and passed campaign finance reform. We can't adjourn without having addressed and passed a Patients' Bill of Rights. We simply can't adjourn without having addressed and passed an array of tools to provide agriculture with the ability to survive. 
All the issues I have mentioned, and many others, beg our consideration and demand our attention. I hope we can address them in a way that will accommodate the needs of both parties and caucuses and the expectations of the American people. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I had noted earlier today that I hoped we could consider a new strategy, or a new way with which to accommodate the growing array of legislative needs that we, as a caucus, and the Senate need to address. I had intended at some point today to offer a unanimous consent request. I will do so, and then I will speak to it in a moment. 
At this time I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its consideration today of the Interior appropriations bill, it turn to consideration of Calendar No. 505, the House-passed HMO reform bill, and that the bill become the pending business every day thereafter upon completion of legislative business. I further ask unanimous consent that the bill be limited to relevant amendments.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think that we want to finish this foreign operations appropriations legislation, and I hope that we can do it. I hope we can do it sometime soon. I note there are a number of amendments that are left to be considered on this important piece of legislation. I commend our ranking member and the chairman for their efforts in resolving this important piece of legislation in a timely way. There are a number of other amendments that must be considered before we can come to closure. 
The question then comes as to what we take up next. Yesterday, we discussed on the Senate floor how important it is that one of the bills that we take up next be the Patients' Bill of Rights, managed care reform. The other piece of legislation, Mr. President, that ought to be taken up immediately is legislation that was already passed in the House, the Shays-Meehan bill, H.R. 2183, the campaign finance reform bill. 
Mr. President, the House deliberated on that bill for some time. House Members worked their will. They did a good job in dealing with all of the controversial aspects of campaign reform this year. They recognize, as many of us recognize, that we are not going to solve the problem with one piece of legislation. But they made a major contribution to solving the problems we face with regard to soft money and independent expenditures and reporting and enforcement. 
Whether or not we move this issue forward will be determined by whether or not we are willing to act in the course of the next 6 weeks. Time is running out. I applaud Senators McCain and Feingold for their news conference this week wherein they said they will press for this legislation, they will offer their bill as an amendment to another bill at some point in the future. 
Mr. President, whether it is the McCain-Feingold bill or the Shays-Meehan bill, this Senate must not lose the opportunity to complete its work on campaign finance reform this year. We must have the opportunity to address the issue. We must take up that legislation. 
I will be propounding a unanimous consent request at some point this morning--in just a few moments--to ask that campaign finance reform be the next order of business, to ask, again as we did yesterday, that it be laid aside for other important appropriations bills simply because we recognize the urgency of passing appropriations legislation on time. We are way past due. We have not passed a budget. We have not passed any of the appropriations bills. Not one has been signed into law. 
Mr. President, to the extent we can do all that we can to resolve the remaining procedural and other related problems on appropriations, we must do so. But there is no question that, as we look to what must be completed prior to the end of this year, the two issues that have to be addressed are the campaign finance reform bill and the Patients' Bill of Rights that we discussed yesterday. 
We come to the floor this morning simply to focus attention on the need for expeditious consideration of this legislation, on how critical it is that we, as Republicans and Democrats, agree, as did Members in the House, to make it the kind of priority it deserves to be, to address the array of problems that we have. 
I cannot think of a more diverse philosophical body than the House today. We have the far left and we have the far right. We have the extremes on both sides. With all of the extreme positions that Members are capable of taking, they came together and passed the Shays-Meehan bill just before we left. 
Mr. President, now it is our turn. Now we have an opportunity to do the same thing. Now we can pass the legislation here. We had a debate earlier. We were disappointed that we were not able to come to closure on it. But now is the time. The House has acted. So must we. 
So far this cycle Republicans and Democrats have spent $37 million more than the last cycle--$37 million. Campaigns continue to escalate in cost and degrade in quality. More and more, there is a rush for dollars. More and more questions are asked about how money is raised. More and more, the people are turned off and tuned out by a political process that has gone awry. They ask that we react. They ask that we show some leadership. They ask that we take some steps to correct this situation before it gets even worse. The House heard; and the House reacted. The Senate now must do the same. 
There is no better time to do it than now. We all are cognizant of the fact that there are only 60 days left before the next election. Within those 60 days, there will be even more money raised, tens of millions of dollars raised, across this country. As we speak, I guarantee you, there are Senators and House Members and candidates in small rooms everywhere dialing for dollars--incessant dollar dialing that has reached an unprecedented threshold. And the implications of all that money become more serious, 
the implications for the legislative process, the implications for campaigns themselves, the implications for the democracy that we all treasure. 
Mr. President, there has to be an end at some point. We have to curtail this incessant effort to raise more and more money at the cost of the credibility of the American people as they view our campaigns in 1998. 
Not all of us are on the floor right now, but if we were, I say with unanimity our Democratic caucus wishes to express the hope that we can pass the Shays-Meehan bill this week, next week, or certainly at some point before we leave. If we pass the Shays-Meehan bill as it passed in the House, which I am prepared to do, I will accept it. I will take the language that was passed in the House and I will send it off to the President. He has already indicated he will sign it. We don't have to go to conference. There is nothing we have to do that would complicate our actions once it passes in the Senate. 
So let's do it. Let's agree, as Republicans and Democrats, that it is important to do it now. The time is running out. I urge my colleagues--urge my colleagues--to agree. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the disposition of the foreign operations appropriations bill, the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 2183, the House-passed campaign finance reform bill, that only relevant amendments be in order, that it be the regular order, but that the majority leader may lay the bill aside for any appropriations bills and appropriations conference reports.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am not surprised, but I am disappointed. 
We will continue to persist. We will continue to make the effort each day, either in the form of unanimous consent requests like this, or with amendments offered to bills that will be considered. We will not let this issue pass. It is essential that we consider this legislation before it is too late, before we run out of time, before we miss a golden opportunity to seize the moment and do what the Senate should have done earlier this year, should have done last year, should have done 10 years ago. This will not go away. We can do it either the easy way or the hard way, but we will continue to persist.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Minnesota raises an important point. 
As I talked to South Dakotans all over the state this last month of August, I found it remarkable how many people simply said they don't want to have anything to do with the political process anymore. I had many, many Republicans who said they are just sick and tired of what is happening out there. Most of it, they said, relates to the money--the money chase, the implications of more money, the influence of big money on the legislative process. They are tired of it. 
I think without question they all understand that the rules, the laws, need to be changed. 
It was remarkable to hear the consistency with which people expressed that point of view to me--Republicans, independents, and Democrats; they all said it. They all indicated with increasing intensity that unless we change the system we could lose it, that unless we change the rules we will become victims of the current ones. 
That, to me, is the essence of why this is so essential, why it is important that we act now.

Mr. DASCHLE. I was aware of that, and I think the Senator from Wisconsin raises a very important point. I actually believe that there are at least 25 percent of the Republican caucus in the Senate who support campaign reform. I just wish they would express themselves, as I know the House already has, in that regard. 
As I talk to colleagues on the other side of the aisle, they tell me they are supportive of it. They tell me they understand we need to see some change. I just hope that some additional courageous Republican Senators will step forth and join us. All we need are 60 votes; we already have 45 Democratic Senators. As the Senator from Wisconsin knows, we already have several Republican Senators who have expressed support and are willing to continue to support our effort. So a dozen or so additional Republican Senators would put us over the top.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Wisconsin probably knows better than anybody in this Chamber the implications of doing nothing. No one has worked harder, provided greater leadership, and engendered more respect on both sides of the aisle than the Senator from Wisconsin. He is running, as am I, this year. He knows the race for dollars. He understands the implications of that race. He understands, as well, the average cost of a Senate race right now is over $4 million. He knows, as I do, that we have already surpassed last year's record-breaking levels, last cycle's record-breaking levels in the amount of money required to be successful. 
He knows, as I do, we will be seeing double-digit figures when it comes to what it will take to wage a successful Senate race anywhere in the country. He knows the implications of that. I must say, Mr. President, you don't need any imagination to recognize just what a devastating effect that has. 
I was at two fundraising breakfasts this morning, neither for myself. That is exactly what is happening all over this city and across this country--fundraiser after fundraiser, more and more money generated with implications on the legislative and political process. 
Where does it end? How will we possibly recruit candidates in the future when we tell them: We want you to be a part of the Democratic process, but we want you to cough up $10 million to do so if you are going to be in the U.S. Senate? 
How can we do that? How can we recruit with a straight face--except for those who have the resources and the wherewithal? How many more millionaires should we have in a representative body of 100 people? We have some very good and diligent and hard-working people of wealth in this country, and I am glad they are here. But I want to make sure that working families are also represented, that we elect people who understand what it takes to earn a paycheck and make ends meet, to send a child to college. I want those people in the Senate as well. How do you do it when you have to raise $10 million? Who do you turn to? So the Senator from Wisconsin very appropriately raises the question, `What are the implications?' There are many, many more. We can talk all day long about the implications. Those are just a few.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts raises the question, `What is the response?' We got it a few minutes ago. We asked very reasonably that we take up this bill next--that we finish the foreign ops appropriations bill, which is critical. We have to get these appropriations bills done. 
As I have noted, not one of the 13 appropriations bills has been signed into law. Here it is now September. The next fiscal year is less than 4 weeks away, and we have yet to pass one appropriations bill. So we recognize that we have to get our work done in that regard, but we also recognize that there will be gaps, that there are other needs out there, legislatively, and there can be no greater needs than the request we made yesterday about a Patients' Bill of Rights consideration and the request we make today on campaign finance reform. Why? Because the House has already acted on both bills. 
So the response we got today, as I noted, was disappointing because we are trying to be reasonable. We are suggesting that only relevant amendments be offered. We are suggesting that we lay the bill aside to finish our work on appropriations bills. We would be prepared to suggest other options. In fact, I would even go so far--and I haven't talked to my colleagues about this, so I am premature in making this offer, but just for the record I would be willing to accept a vote, up or down, on the Shays-Meehan bill--no questions asked; no amendments. Let's just have a vote, up or down, on Shays-Meehan and send it to the President if it passes. I would be prepared to do even that. Many colleagues might want to go farther than that. 
How much time does it take to have one vote? How much time does it take to consider something that has already passed in the House, such as the Shays-Meehan bill? I talked to the Senator from Wisconsin. He is not one of those who is so concerned about pride of authorship that his name has to be on it. He said he would be prepared to take whatever we would do here to get either bill passed. He has taken a very meritorious position on this issue. My point is, in answer to the Senator from Massachusetts, we have tried to be as reasonable about this as we know how to be.

Mr. DASCHLE. Well, the Senator from Massachusetts is as much of a legislative strategist as I am, and he and I and others have talked about what our recourse is given the intransigence on the other side. I suppose we have two options that I am aware of. There may be others, but there are two in particular. One we tried this morning--asking consent over and over that this legislation be scheduled. The second is to take it upon ourselves to schedule it by offering it in the form of an amendment to whatever bill may come along. I have noted already publicly, and the Senator from Wisconsin has noted yesterday in a news conference, that those options are available to us and we will use them as we see the need. 
I hope that will not be necessary. I hope that we can come to some agreement. I hope that we can be reasonable about this and recognize that the House has acted, and that having a vote on Shays-Meehan isn't too much to ask. But those are our options. We aren't going to lay back and just accept the fact that our Republican colleagues would prefer not to deal with this issue. It is too important not to deal with it. It is too much of a priority for too many Americans and for the political system, not to mention the Democratic caucus, for us to ignore it. So we will use those options and others, if they become available to us, because this is as important a bill and important an issue as there is pending before the Senate today.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts puts his finger right on the question. What was that vote all about? Did they really hope, as we do, that it will be put on the President's desk for signature some time before we adjourn? Or was there some cynical ploy here to position themselves for election back home with the realization that it wasn't going anywhere? That is why this unanimous consent request is a test. That is why our continued persistence will continue to be the test as to how serious many of our Republican colleagues are, who publicly espouse campaign reform, when it comes to passing a bill. 
He is also correct in what he said about its implications. 
This isn't my desk. I am standing at the Democratic whip's desk. But this desk happens to be Henry Clay's desk. Henry Clay sat at this desk over 100 years ago. I must say that in all of the time since he sat at this desk I don't know that our democratic process has ever been in greater jeopardy than it is today. Henry Clay used to sit at this desk and would have incredible debates about the direction this country was going to take. People would stay here overnight. People would be here for days and weeks fighting the issues and the policies of the day because they believed so deeply in the direction our country was going to take. 
But do you know what happens? What happens is that we get told by our colleagues that `I cannot be here on Monday. I have to go campaign. I can't be here on Friday. I have to go raise money. In fact, I can't even be here on Tuesday mornings or Thursday afternoons because I have to go raise money.' 
Henry Clay must be turning over in his grave. That isn't the U.S. Senate. The money chase? That isn't what he fought his whole life to protect and preserve as one of our finest patriots. We have to live up to that standard. And I swear we are not doing it so long as we are bridled and enslaved by the incredible money chase that goes on day after day relentlessly and gets worse each political season.

Mr. DASCHLE. I agree completely with what the Senator just said. In a democracy, it is supposed to be of and by the people. But how can it be of and by the people when you need the millions of dollars it now takes to be a legitimate candidate anywhere in the country? How can you say to people from working families, `Look, we want you to be engaged, and not only vote and participate, but we would like you to help lead,' if all we can do in response to their question about what it is going to cost is to admit that it costs millions of dollars that he or she doesn't have? How is it of and by the people when it becomes even more problematic with each cycle of escalating costs, already $37 million more this cycle than last cycle? That isn't democracy. That isn't what the Founding Fathers and what Henry Clay thought about when he thought about this system and what they were going to do to protect it. 
I yield to the Senator from Illinois for a question.

Mr. DASCHLE. I like the way the Senator from Illinois poses the question because it really brings it down to the essence of what we are asking. He asks how close we are. I would suggest we are 1 hour and one vote close. That is how close we are. I would be willing to settle for an hour of debate on either side and have the vote on Shays-Meehan this afternoon and send it off to the President. 
What we get when we pass Shays-Meehan, or McCain-Feingold, is we finally get an end to `soft money'; we finally get some constraints on this outrageous escalation of so-called independent issue ads. We get an array of additional improvements in our systems that constrain and further constrict the money-hungry process from continuing to escalate out of control. That is what we get with one vote and 1 hour.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois asks a good question. Why we have to ask unanimous consent is because even though it is in this calendar, the calendar of business--I could find the page very easily--of Wednesday, September 2nd, it is an item of business to be taken up by the Senate. Why? Because it has already passed in the House. But we have to ask unanimous consent because the Republican leadership is unwilling to schedule it. Even though it has now passed in the House, even though there is a majority of Senators who are prepared to support it, there is intransigence on the part of our Republican leadership to bring this bill up. 
All we can do is hope that perhaps with some persistence and some repetition asking unanimous consent, or offering the bill as an amendment, we can take up what should be a normal course of business given the Senate Calendar.

Mr. DASCHLE. I think it is a sad commentary that anyone could actually subscribe to the proposition that freedom of speech is directly related to the freedom to spend. The freedom to spend actually blocks out the freedom of speech, because if we are spending more and that becomes in essence the cacophony of voices in a campaign, the real freedom of speech--that is, the substantive debate, the opportunity to conduct meaningful campaigns on the issues--is drowned out. 
So that in essence is what is happening. More and more money goes into 30-second attack ads, and less and less real speaking to the issues occurs. That in essence is the irony of this whole debate. That is the problem we are facing. We are reducing real freedom of speech with this unlimited freedom to spend.

Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Connecticut for his leadership and tremendous effort that he has put forth to bring us to this point. 
As to his first question, I hadn't raised until now the point that the Senator made so appropriately. I don't know if there are many Congresses that have spent more time investigating than this one has. This Congress has probably spent more money and more time investigating than any since the early 1970s. And as the Senator from Connecticut so appropriately points out, with all that investigation, there can be no question about the need for some reform. 
Obviously, there is a question about the need for enforcement and follow through after enforcement with regard to what may or may not have happened, the allegations, all of the information raised in these investigations. But then the question comes, What do we do about it? And we have been asking that question ever since the investigations here in the Senate have ended. What do we do about it? 
How tragic it would be for us to say, `Look, we have now exposed all of these problems but we choose to do nothing. We choose to ignore the fact that reform is so critical.' What does that say to the American people? Look, here are the problems. But, look here, we are not going to do anything about them. 
So, the Senator from Connecticut raises, I think, the essence of what it is that we, as Senators, need to confront in our minds, in our hearts, about what is important before we close in a mere 6 weeks. We have investigated. We now know without any question, with great authority, there are some serious problems that have to be addressed. To wash our hands of the matter now would be a tragedy of an order that I do not think we have seen in this country. 
As to what those of you who are watching may do, I hope Senators will receive mail and phone calls and comments from every constituent who has any interest in the democratic process, who understands that without some contact with your Senators there is a real chance they may not change their minds. So, contact is of the essence. I think it ought to be done as soon as possible. 
I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Michigan for a question.

Mr. DASCHLE. I will respond to the Senator from Michigan. Before I do, let me say I wish the entire Chamber had heard what he has just said with regard to what it is we are trying to do and what the implications of this really are. I don't know of anybody in the Senate who has put more force, personally, and more of his own personal credibility, behind this issue than has the Senator from Michigan. I appreciate deeply his commitment. 
The Senator poses a very understandable question. What is it we are asking here? What do we want? We simply want the opportunity to reflect the will of the majority of the Senate on an issue for which there is a moment of opportunity, from a historical perspective. This is our moment. If we fail in the next 6 weeks, we start all over with a new Congress, with all of the odds stacked as much against us, if not more, than they were this Congress. So what we are saying is let's seize the opportunity, let's seize the moment here and do what the House has already done. On a bipartisan basis, let's work with Republicans and Democrats to pass the Shays-Meehan bill. We will take it in any shape or form we can. I offered, as I know the Senator from Michigan heard, to simply take up the bill that was passed in the House and, on a 1-hour, one-vote basis, let's move it on to the President. 
Obviously, I recognize the complexity of this legislation. I would be more than happy, as the request suggests, to consider entertaining relevant amendments because there are differences of opinion. Just yesterday, we argued for the need for relevant amendments to the Patients' Bill of Rights. So we are consistent in our request here. Let's have relevant amendments on the Patients' Bill of Rights. Let's have relevant amendments on campaign finance reform, if the minority chooses--the minority in this case being those who oppose campaign reform--to have them. So we are not asking for much. We are simply saying let's seize the moment, as the Senator from Michigan so appropriately described, and let's get on with doing what we were elected to do before it is too late.

Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I join my colleagues in congratulating today the distinguished Senator from South Carolina. 
With the previous vote, Senator Thurmond joins the extraordinary Senator Robert C. Byrd, as one of only two U.S. Senators in the history of our Nation to cast 15,000 votes in this institution. 
People outside of the Senate may not understand how astounding an achievement that is. 
Let me put it this way: If this were baseball, Senator Thurmond and Senator Byrd would be Mark McGwire and Cal Ripken rolled into one. It is unlikely any of us will ever see their likes again. 
But this is not baseball. 
This is something even more fundamental to who we are as Americans. 
This is the United States Senate. This is the place where we make the laws for a nation dedicated to the rule of law. 
To serve here is a great honor--and an even greater responsibility. 
In his 45 years in this body, Senator Thurmond has fought passionately to fulfill that responsibility as he has understood it. His tenacity and dedication to the causes in which he believes are legendary. 
He fought for 20 years to require warning labels on alcohol. In 1988, thanks to Senator Thurmond's unwavering leadership, the Senate finally voted to do just that. 
Five years later, in a tragic irony, Senator Thurmond's family experienced the kind of agony known to too many American families. 
His beloved daughter Nancy was lost, killed by a drunk driver. She was only 22. 
Nothing can heal the pain of losing someone so dear. 
But I hope that this distinguished Senator takes some comfort in knowing that, thanks to his tenacity, perhaps another father, somewhere in America, will tuck his own little girl safely into bed tonight, instead of mourning her too-early death at the hands of a drunk driver. 
Senator Thurmond truly is an institution within an institution. 
His long and distinguished career is remarkable for its many successes--both in and out of the Senate. 
In addition to being the longest-serving U.S. Senator in history, he has also served as a senator in the South Carolina State legislature and as Governor of that great State. 
He has been a senior member of both the Democratic and Republican parties and the Presidential candidate of a third party. How many more people can say that in this country? 
He volunteered for service in World War II and, on June 5, 1945, at the age of 43, took part in the first drop of the D-Day invasion--the air drop of American troops on Normandy Beach. 
I am told that Senator Thurmond wanted to parachute onto Normandy Beach. But another officer--who clearly did not know who he was dealing with--decided Senator Thurmond was too old to jump out of an airplane. So he piloted a glider instead, landing, with the rest of his company, behind enemy lines. 
Senator Thurmond is today a retired major general in the Army reserves. 
He is also a member of the South Carolina Hall of Fame, and a recipient of more honors and awards than any of us can name, including the prestigious Presidential Medal of Freedom. 
Years from now, when we look back on this summer, millions of Americans will tell their grandchildren what it was like to watch Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa chase Roger Maris' home run record. 
If I am lucky enough to have grandchildren, I will tell them about a milestone that was reached this summer for a second time, another record that people thought would remain forever unchallenged--15,000 votes in the U.S. Senate. 
And I will tell them, `I was there. I got to work with both of those men. And they were truly amazing.' 
So, Mr. President, on this day when Senator Thurmond enters the record books yet again, I congratulate him on behalf of Senate Democrats for his historic achievement. And I thank him for his many contributions to this body and to this Nation. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will not take long. I know that there are discussions ongoing. 
Before we left for the August recess, Democrats made it very clear that it is essential that we not leave here before the end of the year without having taken up and passed the Patients' Bill of Rights. I think it is very clear, given the extraordinary degree of interest in the issue on both sides of the aisle, that there is an opportunity for us to complete our work on that bill. I hope we can do it sooner rather than later. I see no reason why we cannot do it within the course of the next couple of weeks. 
I will propound a unanimous consent request that would allow us to do that. The request, very simply, would allow the Senate to take up the House-passed HMO reform bill, begin the debate, allow relevant amendments, and set the bill aside at the request of the majority leader to take up appropriations bills when they are ready to be considered. It takes into account the need for us to complete our work on appropriations bills, and it takes into account the high priority that both parties have put on dealing with this issue. 
But I must say, for Democrats, that there cannot be a more important issue than the complete and successful conclusion of the debate on managed care and the Patients' Bill of Rights. We now have over 170 different organizations that have said they join us in supporting this legislation and recognize the importance of passing it before we leave. All we have left is 6 weeks. Mr. President, it is critical that we complete our work, that we get this job done, that we do so in the remaining time we have, and that we allow a full debate given the differences we have on how we might approach this issue. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon disposition of the foreign operations appropriations bill, the Senate proceed to consideration of Calendar No. 505, H.R. 4250, the House-passed health care reform bill; that only relevant amendments be in order; that the bill be the regular order, but that the majority leader may lay it aside for any appropriations bill or appropriations conference report which he deems necessary to consider between now and the end of this session of Congress.

We will continue to press this matter. We will look for other opportunities. I would much rather do it in an orderly fashion using the regular order to allow this to come up and be debated. But if we cannot do it that way, we will offer it in the form of amendments. One way or the other we will press for this issue. We will see it resolved, and see it resolved successfully, because I don't believe there is another issue out there this year that is of greater importance to the American people. 
I would be happy to yield to the Senator.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct. First, to the point he made about relevancy, what our unanimous consent request would have done is simply allowed what we have attempted to negotiate with our Republican colleagues now for months, which is to allow a good debate about this issue and allow the opportunity for the Senate to decide on relevant amendments. 
This may be one of the most comprehensive and most complicated medical issues that the Senate will address for a long period of time. It is impossible for us to address it in the way that has been suggested by some on the other side, that we have an up-or-down vote on two simple bills. There is nothing simple about them. These are very serious questions about holding health insurance companies accountable, about making sure that when a woman has a mastectomy she can be protected, about making absolutely certain that when you go into a pharmacy you have a drug that the doctor prescribed and not something that the health care company prescribed. 
Those are the kinds of issues that we ought to have the opportunity to decide in a very careful way. So we offered a unanimous consent request that would have allowed for relevant amendments. 
The Senator is absolutely right, as well, about the 170 organizations. In my time in the Senate on an issue of any magnitude, I don't remember a time when over 170 organizations of all philosophical stripes were on board and said, yes, we want to pass this bill. That is phenomenal. That is historic. And so the Senator is right. I hope, regardless of whether it is today or tomorrow or sometime soon, we can have the kind of debate the Senator from Massachusetts and others have called for for a long period of time. We need time to do it.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. When you think about it, we spent a lot of good time on the highway bill, time we needed to spend on a bill that I supported. We all know that the highway bill has many complicated aspects to it; there wasn't any objection from the other side in that regard. The highway bill was complicated, and because it was, we offered, as the Senator noted, over 100 amendments. Now what they are saying on this particular bill is that even though it is every bit as complicated, they are only willing to provide three slots for amendments--not 100, not 75, not 50, but three slots on a bill that affects personally more people than even the highway bill. 
That is what we are up against. That is the motivation in offering the unanimous consent request this afternoon.

And as the Senator from Massachusetts noted, over that period of time, more and more groups from all over the country, the doctors, the nurses, people in health care delivery from virtually every facet and every walk of life, every one of them have said you put your finger on a problem that you have to solve. It is getting worse out there. And unless we address the situation meaningfully in public policy, it will continue to get worse. How long must we wait? Must we wait until next year or the year after? And how many millions of people will be adversely affected if we do not act? They are telling us to act. And I hope we will do it before the end of this session of Congress.

Sometimes we have to put it in personal terms, in real terms. The Senator from California has just done so, so eloquently. In real terms, this bill would allow an individual, whether it is somebody in this Chamber today or anybody who may be watching, that they will have an opportunity to choose and be treated by a qualified specialist. They would have an opportunity to make sure that the specialist is competent, so they will get the best care for their personal set of circumstances, like young Carly. 
That is what our bill is all about. That is why it is important to pass it this year. That is why we cannot wait until next year. I thank the Senator from California.

Mr. DASCHLE. Before I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts, let me say the unanimous consent request that we made took into account the fact that the House has already acted on this issue. The House has passed a health care bill, not one that I would necessarily be excited about, but it passed a bill. What we are suggesting here is that we want to amend the House-passed bill. We want to complete the job. We want to put a Democratic imprint on a comprehensive health care bill that will do the job and get that bill signed. 
There is another piece of legislation the House has now passed, campaign finance reform. That bill has also passed out of the House. The Shays-Meehan bill has passed, and that, too, is pending now in this Chamber. That, also, ought to be on our agenda. When can we take up the Shays-Meehan bill? It passed in the House. Let's pass it in the Senate.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts is correct. Basically, our unanimous consent request simply would have made as regular order, as the next bill to be considered, H.R. 4250, the House-passed health care reform bill. We would then offer, in the form of amendments, our bill and other relevant amendments that would be considered. We would give the majority leader, certainly, the authority to set that bill aside so long as other appropriations bills or conference reports on appropriations bills need to be considered. We would complete our work on patient protections, and it would be my expectation, following the successful conclusion of that debate, to offer a similar unanimous consent request on campaign finance reform. It seems to me, those two key issues are critical to the agenda of this country and critical to the business of the Senate--particularly given the fact, as I have just noted, that they both now have passed in the House of Representatives. I can't think of anything more important than to complete the work of this Congress on those two bills. That would be my intention.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct. The issue, as we have noted now several times, has probably the most elaborate array of support by health care organizations, organizations that deal with this every day. Organizations on the front line of health care delivery have said this must be our highest priority--not just in health care, but in the array of issues that are confronting this Congress. They say there is nothing more important than passing this legislation this year. I think they are right. 
This is what the American people want. I might note, we just received a faxed letter from the President, from Moscow, on this very issue. I might just read one short paragraph. 
As I mentioned in my radio address this past Saturday, ensuring basic patient protections is not and should not be a political issue. I was therefore disappointed by the partisan manner in which the Senate Republican Leadership bill was developed. The lack of consultation with the White House or any Democrats during the drafting of your legislation contributed to its serious shortcomings and the fact it has failed to receive the support of either patients or doctors. The bill leaves millions of Americans without critical patient protections, contains provisions that are more rhetorical than substantive, completely omits patient protections that virtually every expert in the field believes are basic and essential, and includes `poison pill' provisions that have nothing to do with a patients' bill of rights.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois has made a very eloquent and poignant statement about circumstances that are very real, that are happening as we speak in Illinois, South Dakota, Massachusetts, and California. In every State, there are illustrations of how the system is broken, just as the Senator from Illinois has described. 
But he really needs to direct his question to the majority leader. I don't know what could be more pressing than this issue. Obviously, by law, we have to address appropriations bills. Obviously, by law, we should be addressing the budget, but I am told the Republicans now may overlook the fact that the law requires a budget resolution by April 15. They are overlooking that. So we have already violated--they have violated the law with regard to the budget. But I would hope we can adhere to the law with regard to appropriations, because we know the consequences if we don't. We have already gone through that. I think they have learned their lesson on that. We don't want to shut the Government down, but I would direct your question to the majority leader when you have the opportunity.

Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I welcome back the distinguished Presiding Officer and our staff on the Senate floor and hope that you all had as enjoyable an August recess as I did. 
I want to talk about three things this afternoon. The first is to express how saddened I am with the loss of a very key member of the staff of Senator Kent Conrad and somebody whom I knew and respected quite well. 
Secondly, I would like to talk about the agricultural situation in my State of South Dakota that I spent a good deal of time talking about as I was home. 
And then obviously, thirdly, I would like to discuss the agenda at hand and what my expectations and hopes are for the remaining 6 weeks of this session.

Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, just before Congress left for the August recess, we suffered a staggering loss in our `Capitol Hill family'--the deaths of Detective John Gibson and Officer J.J. Chestnut. 
Today, as we returned to our work here, we learned that we have suffered another loss in our family. 
This past Saturday morning, Kent Hall died in his sleep. Kent was chief of staff for my colleague and friend, Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota. 
Outside of Congress, his beloved family, and his many friends, it's likely that few Americans ever heard Kent's name. But millions of Americans benefited from his years of hard and conscientious work in this body. 
Kent Hall was a rare man--a Renaissance man. He held a doctorate in economics and philosophy. He loved ideas. But he also loved the nitty-gritty of politics, and policy. 
And he loved this institution, this Senate. He was honored to work here. And we were honored to have him. 
He first came to the Hill to work for Tom Harkin. He joined Senator Conrad's staff as agriculture advisor in 1987, the year Senator Conrad came to the Senate. He later went on to serve as Senator Conrad's legislative director and eventually as his chief of staff. 
One of Kent's great passions was the federal budget. He believed America's budget should be balanced not only economically, but morally as well. 
So he fought for budgets that would enable working families to share in these good economic times, budgets that would extend the benefits of this economy beyond Wall Street, to Main Street. He fought for budgets that would allow working parents to take their children to a doctor when they're sick, budgets that would enable parents to find good, affordable day care, budgets that would allow parents to send their children to good schools--and after that, to send them on to college. 
Kent had a special place in his heart for people who live close to the land--farmers and ranchers and the people who grow up in the small towns of rural America. 
He grew up in one of those towns: a little farm town in Iowa--population about 600. And though he left that town long ago, he still kept it close to his heart. 
Farmers and people in farm towns all over America have lost a good friend, and an extraordinary advocate. We are grateful for Kent's diligent work on: disaster relief and farm-crisis relief. 
And we extend our deepest sympathy to Kent's wife, Michelle, who works for Senator Harkin and to their two small children, 4-year-old Caitlin--`Caiti'--and 2-year-old Austin, both of whom he loved even more than he loved this place. 
We also offer our condolences to Kent's father, Ken, and his mother, Evelyn; his brothers, Mel and Michael; his sister Cheri; and his many nieces and nephews. Our thoughts and prayers are with them, and with all the members of the Conrad and Harkin staffs, who are feeling this loss more deeply than probably any member of the `Capitol family.' 
Like Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut, Kent Hall died too young. He was only 52 years old. But his legacy will live on--in his two little children and in the ideals he believed in so passionately, and fought for so hard, and helped transform into law. 
We will miss him.

Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, in July, less than a month and a half ago, the Senate voted unanimously on a resolution to declare there is a national crisis in agriculture, that we needed to take immediate action to address it. 
Following the unanimous passage of that resolution, we passed several amendments to the agricultural appropriations bill designed to address the problem. We passed an amendment to require mandatory price reporting for livestock. We passed a second amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from South Dakota, Senator Johnson, requiring the labeling of imported meat. And we passed an amendment offered by the two hard-working Senators from North Dakota to require at least a $500 million indemnity program for victims of multiple-year disasters. 
Unfortunately, we failed to pass my amendment to lift the cap on marketing loans and extend their term by 6 months--which is probably the single most effective way to address the problem of low prices and lost income among grain farmers. 
Since we considered those amendments, the farm crisis has deepened very seriously. Over the past 3 weeks, as I visited with farmers and ranchers and rural businesspeople from all over South Dakota, they told me the same story. Many of them simply will not survive the coming months unless circumstances change. Unless we can bring about a better farm economy, a more stable price in most of the commodities now being grown, we will see an attrition in agriculture the likes of which we have not seen in over a decade. 
Nick Nemec, a young farmer from Holabird, SD, who testified at a hearing on July 29 on the agricultural crisis, said that when prices go down, his family's everyday expenses go up proportionately. He said, `If the Consumer Price Index was up 40% in one year, there would be riots in the streets of cities all across America. Out in farm country, we just have farm auctions.' 
I heard that same sentiment over and over again when I was home these past few weeks. We have already seen too many auctions. Our farmers and ranchers are very concerned, frankly, about their survival. 
So the circumstances, Madam President, as I report to the Senate this afternoon, are, unfortunately, in worse shape and more precarious than they were just a month and a half ago when these amendments were offered. We must find ways to address the current crisis in American agriculture. 
So I put the Senate on notice this afternoon that we will again be offering our amendment to increase the loan rate, to establish some kind of a floor in agricultural grain prices, just as we have on minimum wage across this country now for generations. We need a minimum price, because if we do not have that, all of those stories and all of those concerns can only worsen. The farm auctions will become more frequent. 
So I hope we can find, in as bipartisan a fashion as is humanly possible this close to an election, legislation we can all agree upon that will allow us to address the price more effectively, that will allow us to deal with the issues we began to confront in July. 
We must pass and sign into law the mandatory price reporting legislation that passed in the Senate. We must pass and sign into law the labeling legislation that was passed in the Senate. We certainly must pass this indemnity legislation and sign that into law as quickly as we can. 
What is missing is what will help the grain farmers. And unless we pass that minimum floor, that increase in the loan rate, there is nothing out there that can help the grain farmers to survive what is the worst disaster they have experienced in now more than 15 years. 
So, Madam President, as we begin to consider what the agenda ought to be as we come back from a month in our States, I hope everyone understands and appreciates and empathizes with the circumstances confronting America's farmers. I hope that empathy will lead to a consensus about increasing the loan rate and providing the kinds of opportunities to farmers that they failed to achieve when we debated this matter just over a month ago.

Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we have 6 weeks remaining in the Congress. Those 6 weeks will define our efforts as a Congress. And this is the last matter that I wish to raise before our colleagues this afternoon--the agenda for those remaining 6 weeks. 
Time is short. Distractions are many. Needless to say, we must focus on our priorities. Our success for the entire Congress will really depend on what we achieve in the next 6 weeks. It will depend on whether we are committed to accomplishing the people's business. 
What is the people's business? I think everyone understands what it is. The people's business is the business that we have before us. Appropriations bills must be completed. 
The Congress' first responsibility is to ensure stable Government operations. There must not be talk of a Government shutdown. I have heard some of our Republican leaders, especially on the other side, suggest that the President may shut the Government down. 
Today is the last day in August. The budget resolution was due in April. So far, neither body has delivered a budget resolution. So I call upon the Republican leadership in the House and in the Senate to do what the law requires, to do what is so essential to restore confidence, to do what really is required to set the framework for the priorities and the commitments that we must make in these next 6 weeks. I call on the Republican leadership to pass a budget resolution. 
Not one single appropriations bill has gone to the President. Republican poison pills appear throughout the appropriations bills. So if there is a danger of a shutdown, we all know where it originates. But it is incumbent upon all of us to keep the Government operating. It starts with the budget resolution. And it will be completed once we pass every one of those appropriations bills, which we must do. 
After we complete that task, we must turn our attention to managed care reform. The American people have said loudly and unequivocally that they want a comprehensible, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights. They want to know that they can go to the nearest emergency room when they suffer a true health emergency. They want to know that they can see a specialist when they need one. They want to know that doctors--not HMO bureaucrats--will decide which treatments are medically necessary. They want to know that managed care organizations, like everyone else in the health care environment, can be held accountable for decisions that result in serious harm or death to patients. 
What they do not want--what they do not want--is legislation that falls short on those or other key patient protections. They do not want legislation that claims to give them rights without providing them the mechanism necessary to enforce those rights. 
There are those who suggest there is not enough time to debate a Patients' Bill of Rights. I disagree. There are those who would, for whatever reason, try to gag the Senate as we debate this important issue. 
Let us eliminate the gag orders and the gag rules. Let us open up this important piece of legislation to a good, healthy debate. Democrats will be prepared to work 24 hours a day to assure that we can have that opportunity. But it is important we set it high on our agenda and our priority list as we complete our work in the 105th Congress. 
Other than the appropriations bills, there is nothing more important on our national agenda right now than that. The Republican bill, as everybody knows, is inadequate in many respects. We need to pass a bill that merits our support, that merits our signatures, that merits a broad-based, bipartisan commitment to real reform in managed care. We will have an opportunity to do that. And I must say that we will be offering this legislation with whatever determination may be required, and to whatever piece of legislation may be presented, in an effort to assure consideration of this legislation prior to the end of this Congress. 
The third issue, beyond the budget and appropriations first, and managed care second, is campaign finance reform. In spite of the Republican leadership's opposition, the House has now passed an important campaign finance reform bill that many thought was impossible to pass just a few months ago. And so the Senate now has the opportunity--a rare opportunity--to enact meaningful reform this fall. 
Madam President, we must seize the opportunity to stem the unrestricted flow of special interest money in Federal elections. There is no question that, given what the House has already done, attention will be focused on the U.S. Senate to see if we can live up to the expectations of the American people in this regard. I, frankly, cannot think of anything more important than to take up this legislation--the Shays-Meehan bill--and give it the kind of priority it deserves, to work in a bipartisan way to pass meaningful legislation within the next 6 weeks. 
Again, I will put my colleagues on notice that this issue is of such import to us that we will offer it in amendment form, if necessary. I hope that isn't necessary. I hope we can get a good opportunity and agreement to bring it up, to debate it, because it is now here. It has already been debated and passed in the House. Let's do it in the U.S. Senate. 
As I have often said, we can pass legislation the easy way or the hard way. I hope we will not be required to pass it the hard way. But Democrats will make every single effort that we have available to us to pass it--hard or easy. There are many other issues that we hope we can address in the short time that we have left. 
We must not ignore education. We must recognize that school modernization is essential. As I traveled through South Dakota, it was remarkable the number of times modernization needs came to my attention, the number of times school board members, school board presidents, teachers, superintendents and principals said, `We hope you can pass legislation that will allow us to deal with our crumbling infrastructure.' As we speak, young children are going back into unsafe school buildings, into environments that are not conducive to learning. School modernization must be addressed. I hope we can address it this year, this Congress. I hope we can address in this Congress this year the need for 100,000 additional teachers. So as children go back to school, as we consider all of the needs of our Nation, let us not forget the importance of the needs in education. 
We must look at Social Security. We must begin to consider very carefully what options are available to us. We must stop any action, whether it is on a tax bill--which I understand will be brought to the Senate floor--or elsewhere, which might jeopardize Social Security. There are those who, for short-term gain--either political or economic--would argue that we have to tap the so-called surplus. We have made the case--and I think everybody understands it--that there is no surplus unless you use Social Security trust funds. I hope that both sides of the aisle will come to the same conclusion about the inadvisability of doing that this year--or any year. 
We must look at juvenile crime. We certainly will have an opportunity to debate the minimum wage. The minimum wage is, without a doubt, one of the single most important actions we can take to improve the economic stability and viability of working families in many homes across our country. Madam President, those issues, too, must be examined and action taken before the end of this session. 
As we come back after being away 1 month, we also recognize our international obligations. Just this afternoon, the President left for a very important summit with the President of Russia. We wish him well as he departs. We know how precarious circumstances now are in economic and political terms in Russia. We know how difficult this trip will be. I hope I speak for everybody in this Chamber in expressing our hope for great success, with the realization that all we can have are limited expectations, given those circumstances. We must not overlook the need for IMF funding, especially in light of the Russian crisis. We should redouble our efforts to fulfill our obligations to the International Monetary Fund. Terrorism, again, became a very important aspect of foreign policy in the last several weeks while we were gone. We must support efforts to stem it and support military efforts to respond to it. 
Arms control issues in Iraq and North Korea must be addressed, and so the array of foreign policy challenges, not the least of which is an important question relating to funding in the United Nations, also must be high on our international priority list. 
Madam President, obviously, to accomplish all of these important objectives, we will need to use these 6 weeks wisely, to stay focused on our Nation's needs and priorities. I hope that we can do that. Earlier today, the majority leader suggested that Democrats want to stall legislative business. Nothing could be farther from the truth. To the contrary, we are anxious, as we have been for months, to get on with the Nation's agenda, the agenda that I have outlined. 
So speaking on behalf of my Democratic colleagues in the Senate, I welcome back both Republican and Democratic colleagues, and I urge them to work together to accomplish all of this and more. Time is short, the need is great, and our desire to achieve is high. I hope we can meet all of those expectations in the coming weeks. 
Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

The pending amendment would be, of course, the McConnell amendment. Senators wishing to offer amendments in the second degree subject to recognition would be recognized as authors of amendments in the second degree. 
It is with that understanding that I do not object. I am sure the majority leader would clarify and would conform with that understanding.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member for their indulgence. As both of you know, the Hunt Building Corporation (HBC) constructed an 828-unit military family housing complex, known as the Centennial Housing Project, at Ellsworth Air Force Base in 1990 and 1991. Unfortunately, within a year of the completion of construction, serious and often dangerous defects were found in many of the units. It is my understanding that over half of the units in the Centennial Housing Project constructed by HBC are currently uninhabitable.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object again, I was consumed, I guess, in assisting the chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in working down the amendments. We have been working on that tirelessly all day. The majority leader and I have worked throughout the day on a number of issues. Not once did he raise this issue with me. That explanation would have been welcomed, would have been appreciated 5 minutes ago, a half hour ago, 2 hours ago. But he surprises me at this hour after we cooperated all week on an array of issues working over these appropriations bills amendment after amendment. And I guess it is very, very disappointing to me. 
I ask unanimous consent that an amendment that would provide $500 million in indemnity payments to farmers and that was passed unanimously on the Senate floor during the debate on the agricultural appropriations bill be attached to the bill that is now under consideration, and for which the majority has asked unanimous consent. 
Would he accept that addition to the bill? Because, if he would, I am sure then that we could accommodate the majority leader and those who wish to pass this, as it was a surprise to the rest of us.

We are not going to object. Let's just quit playing these kinds of games. Let's just get on with it. Let's pass it. But let's all be aware of what we have done. 
You and I have a good relationship. We ought to keep it that way. I don't like being dealt with this way. I will accept it this time, but I wish we would work in the manner in which we have been working all week. 
This is a very serious, important issue. There are a lot of political ramifications, and we can play the political game. The fact is that there are a lot of people out there who want some help. This is going to be a little help. I wish we could pass the indemnity payment tonight. I don't see why we could not. The fact is that we would pass it unanimously, and that would be new money, $500 million in new money. I wish we could do that just as easily as we are going to agree to pass this thing that isn't going to mean that much. But we will pass it. 
But I must say, we shouldn't be doing it this way. I have been here all night. I haven't left the floor. Somebody could have come to me to say, look, we want to do this. Instead, what has happened is that this was sprung on me. 
Now, you don't have to apologize. Nobody has to apologize. It just isn't the way we ought to do business. 
So, Mr. President, we don't object.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation designed to combat unfairly traded imports of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) from Saudi Arabia. MTBE is an oxygenated fuel additive derived from methanol. 
Through the wintertime oxygenated fuels program to reduce carbon monoxide pollution and through the reformulated gasoline program to reduce emissions of toxics and ozone-causing chemicals, we have created considerable demand in this nation for oxygenated fuels, such as MTBE, ETBE and ethanol. It has been my hope that this demand could be met with domestically-produced oxygenates, thereby reducing our dependence on foreign imports and expanding economic opportunities at home. Unfortunately, this goal has not been achieved, in large part because of a substantial expansion of subsidized MTBE imports from Saudi Arabia. 
Mr. President, I am a supporter of free trade when it is also fair trade. However, there has been a marked surge in MTBE imports from Saudi Arabia in recent years that does not reflect the natural outcome of market-based competition. 
These imports appear to be driven by a pattern of government subsidies. Not only is this increasing our dependence on foreign suppliers, but it is unfairly harming domestic oxygenate producers and those who provide the raw materials for these oxygenates, such as America's farmers. 
The Saudi government has made no secret of its desire to expand domestic industrial capacity of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE). In particular, several years ago, there were public reports that the Saudi government promised investors a 30% discount relative to world prices on the feedstock raw materials used in the production of MTBE. The feedstock is the major cost component of MTBE production, and the Saudi government decree has apparently translated into a nearly -30% artificial cost advantage to Saudi-based producers and exporters. 
Moreover, it appears that this blatant subsidy is in large measure responsible for the increase in Saudi MTBE exports to the United States in recent years. These exports have not only reduced the U.S. market share of American producers of MTBE, ETBE, and ethanol, but also has discouraged new capital investment, thereby depriving American workers, farmers, and investors of a significant share of the economic activity that Congress contemplated when it drafted the oxygenated fuel requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. 
Mr. President, I believe it is high time for the United States government to respond to the Saudi government's subsidies. Saudi Arabia is a valued ally; however, our bond of friendship should not be a justification for turning a blind eye to an unfair element of our otherwise mutually beneficial trading relationship. 
Because it is not a member of the World Trade Organization nor a party to its Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, the Saudi government may not feel constrained by the international trade rules by which we legally are required to abide. This does not mean, however, that we must stand idly by while foreign subsidies undermine an important sector of our economy. 
For this reason, my bill would require the Secretary of Commerce to self-initiate an investigation under Section 702 of the Tariff Act of 1930 to determine whether a countervailable subsidy has been provided with respect to Saudi Arabian exports of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE). If the Secretary finds that a subsidy has indeed been provided to Saudi producers, he would be required under the terms of our existing law to impose an import duty in the amount necessary to offset the subsidy. Because Saudi Arabia is not a member of the WTO, there would be no requirement for a demonstration of injury to the domestic industry as a result of the subsidy. 
Let's talk for a moment about what is at stake here for American consumers. Last year, I asked the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) to assess the impact on U.S. oil imports of the Reformulated Gasoline (RFG) program that was created by Congress in 1991. The GAO found that the U.S. RFG program has already resulted in over 250,000 barrels per day less imported petroleum due to the addition of oxygenates like ethanol, ETBE and MTBE. That means, at an average of $20 spent per barrel of imported oil, we currently save nearly $2 billion per year due to domestically produced oxygenates. 
The GAO further found that, if all gasoline in the U.S. were reformulated (compared to the current 35%), the U.S. would import 777,000 fewer barrels of oil per day. That is more than $5.5 billion per year that would not be flowing to foreign oil producers and could be reinvested in the United States. 
This is not `pie-in-the-sky' theory. Ethanol production and domestically produced MTBE can reduce oil imports and strengthen our economy. In rural America, for example, new ethanol and ETBE plants will be built, so long as we wise up and create a level playing field against subsidized Saudi competition. 
Phase II of the Clean Air Act's reformulated gasoline program (RFG) requires transportation fuels to meet even tougher emissions standards starting in the year 2000. That gasoline market is growing, with demand for ethanol, ETBE and MTBE in 2005 estimated to be 300,000 barrels per day. Unless we act to ensure that American-made oxygenated fuels can compete in American fuels markets, we stand to cede those markets to subsidized Saudi Arabian MTBE. 
Mr. President, I am hopeful that my legislation will help level the playing field for American producers of ethanol, ETBE and MTBE and add new economic vitality to their associated communities of workers, farmers, and business owners. I urge my colleagues to give it serious consideration and to enact it as soon as possible so that we may begin the process of bringing fairness back into the realm of international trade in oxygenated fuels.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer. 
Mr. President, as I noted this morning, Democrats have supported and continue to support tax relief for working families. In 1993, we supported tax cuts for millions of working families making less than $30,000 per year through an expansion of the earned income tax credit. Last year, we supported major tax relief proposals, including a $500-per-child tax credit, a $1,500 HOPE education tax credit, a 20-percent lifetime learning credit, the reinstatement of student loan deductions, full deductibility of health insurance premiums for the self-employed, a cut in capital gains taxes for investors and small businesses, and an expansion of estate tax relief for family farms and businesses. All of these tax cuts for working families had one thing in common. They were consistent with a balanced budget; they were fully paid for. 
Democrats continue to have an ambitious agenda of tax relief for working families. But we also continue to insist that tax cuts be consistent with fiscal responsibility. This is because we understand that fiscal responsibility equals economic growth, and economic growth equals more jobs and higher wages. 
Part of our continuing agenda to provide working families with tax cuts is to provide them with substantial relief from the marriage penalty. In many families, married couples pay more in income taxes than if they had remained single. Democrats would like to remedy this undesirable aspect of our tax system. 
The amendment that I have just offered would let families deduct 20 percent of the income of the lesser-earning spouse. This deduction would be phased out for families making between $50,000 and $60,000 a year. The 20-percent deduction would be an `above-the-line' deduction, ensuring that that everyone could claim it, regardless of whether they chose the `EZ' form or itemized their deductions on a more complicated tax form. Also, the deduction would be factored into the earned income tax credit calculation; that is, it would help people making less than $30,000 who may have no income tax liability against which to take the deduction. 
But, Mr. President, perhaps most important, contrary to the amendment offered this morning, this amendment is fully offset. The offsets include a number of proposals from the President's budget that have attracted broad support. Most of them would terminate unwarranted tax loopholes for corporations and investors. Because the amendment is fully offset, it is in keeping with the tradition and the practice that we have maintained all through the tax debate this year and previous years. 
To summarize, unlike the Brownback-Ashcroft amendment offered this morning, the Democratic amendment, first, focuses roughly 90 percent of its tax cut on families who are actually penalized., compared with about 40 percent to 45 percent for the Brownback amendment offered this morning. 
Second, it is fully offset. Its gross cost is $7 billion over 5 years and $21 billion over 10; but its net effect on the budget is zero. By contrast, the Brownback-Ashcroft amendment would have drained the Treasury and the Social Security trust fund by about $125 billion over 5 years and $300 billion over 10 years. 
Therefore, if Senators are interested in delivering meaningful marriage penalty tax relief rather than simply grandstanding about it, they will want to support our amendment. Here are two examples of just how much tax relief our amendment would provide: 
First, a couple making $35,000, split $20,000 and $15,000 between two spouses. With our 20-percent, second-earner deduction, this couple would receive an additional deduction of $3,000, or 20 percent of the $15,000 income of the second earner. That translates into an annual family tax cut of about $450. 
Second, a couple making $50,000, in this case split $25,000 each between the two spouses. Under our 20-percent, second-earner deduction, the couple would receive an extra $5,000 deduction, or about $1,400 in actual cash-in-the-pocket tax relief. 
Mr. President, my amendment provides Senators with an opportunity to help hard-working married couples without busting the budget or endangering our efforts next year to restore the Social Security system to solvency for future generations. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think the distinguished Senator from Colorado makes a very good point, and our desire is certainly not to complicate his efforts and the efforts of the distinguished ranking member to complete action on this bill. I know there are some Senators who wish to be heard on this particular version of the amendment, but I do believe that we can accommodate those Senators. I would be willing to enter into a time agreement of 30 minutes, if we could assume that there isn't going to be a great deal of debate on the other side. I am not sure we have to equally divide it. I propose we ask unanimous consent the vote on this amendment occur no later than 3 o'clock.

Mr. DASCHLE. In response to the majority leader, we have, I think, four amendments that currently would require a rollcall vote. There are two of those four that may actually still get worked out, so I think we are getting relatively close to coming to closure on this bill. I hope all Senators who wish to offer amendments will stay on the floor because this could happen fairly quickly. I think it would be very helpful if you are right on the floor to offer the amendment. It would expedite our ability to complete our work on this bill.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would certainly want to reiterate what the majority leader said at the beginning of his comments, which is that we have been negotiating now for some time in an effort to determine how we might bring to the floor the health care bills offered by the Republican caucus as well as the Democratic caucus. I see Senator Graham standing. There are other bills that may be contemplated in this debate as well. 
Our view is that it would be very difficult to have a debate of the importance of what we consider this to be, with the limit of amendments that the majority leader has proposed. We had 56 amendments on the Agriculture appropriations bill. We disposed of them. We had 82 amendments on the Commerce-State-Justice bill. We disposed of them. I would not say, in either case, people felt that was too long a debate to have on an important bill like those two appropriations bills. We had 150 amendments on the Defense authorization bill. 
I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader's request be modified to provide for relevant amendments--to limit it to relevant amendments. I think we can have a good debate. We are prepared to limit them to relevant amendments. I have asked my colleagues not to offer the Patients' Bill of Rights amendment to other bills because, in large measure, we have been working in good faith to try to see if we can accommodate a schedule that will allow us to bring it to the floor. 
Certainly, I think having an agreement that would allow a debate, limited to relevant amendments, would certainly take into account the concerns that many of our colleagues have raised about being too limited on a bill, and a debate that is as consequential as is this one. So I make that request.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I don't want anyone to misinterpret the vote just taken. Obviously, there are a lot of motivations in offering amendments like this on the appropriations bill. As the Senator from Missouri just noted, this legislation would have been blue-slipped had it gone over to the House. I appreciate the actions just taken in withdrawing the amendment. 
So that there will be no doubt, we will be offering a similar marriage penalty amendment this afternoon--a marriage penalty amendment that will be paid for, that will be targeted, that will offer a far greater opportunity to address the real issue without using the Social Security surplus. 
The previous amendment would have, without question, used Social Security to pay for it's tax benefits. One hundred billion dollars over the next 5 years out of the Social Security Trust Fund surplus is something most Democrats are unprepared to support. We don't have to use the Social Security trust fund. We don't have to use the surplus. We don't have to use a broad-based, completely untargeted approach to marriage penalty relief. 
So we will have another opportunity this afternoon to vote on the marriage penalty in a reasonable and a direct and a far more responsible way. And I look forward to that debate as well.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from North Dakota raises a good question. I don't know what motivation there may have been to simply put the Senate on record one more time. As everyone recalls, we had this debate on the tobacco bill. We had two versions of the marriage penalty proposed--the Democratic version and the Republican version. There are some very considerable differences. But, voting against the tabling motion and then withdrawing it seems somewhat of a convoluted approach to legislating. I am unclear as to what the motivation may have been.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois is correct. There was a motion to table the amendment at that time. They voted to do so at that time. Obviously, they will probably be voting again this afternoon to table a marriage penalty vote that we will be offering. 
It will be interesting to see how this plays out. But, clearly, I think there was a political motivation as much as a substantive motivation on the part of our Republican colleagues. That was evidenced in the tobacco bill debate, and it will be evidenced again today.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely correct. We don't have to use Social Security trust funds. We don't have to use the surplus to pay for a marriage penalty amendment. 
We can find an appropriate offset and delineate that offset, which is what I think is the responsible thing to do. There was no delineation of an offset in the previous amendment, so one has to assume that the Republican amendment was, again, more of a demonstration of rhetoric than genuine effort to provide responsibly-funded tax relief. The rhetoric we get from our colleagues on the other side that they will not use the Social Security trust funds. The facts are otherwise. For example, in this amendment, $100 billion in Social Security trust funds were likely to be used. 
There is a difference between our approaches to fiscal responsibility, protecting Social Security, and providing tax relief. I think that ought to be made clear in the Record. We will have an opportunity once more to debate that this afternoon.

The chairman of the Finance Committee did the responsible thing and was certainly showing, once again, his leadership in this regard in making sure everyone understood this is not a tax bill. This is an appropriations bill. There is a time to address taxes. There is a time to address spending through appropriations. The chairman of the Finance Committee drew that distinction, as did most of us. 
So, again, we will have another opportunity to discuss this matter, but I simply wanted at this point in the Record to be sure everyone understood what motivations there may have been for those of us who feel we ought to take a more responsible view with regard to the marriage penalty itself. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to extend my deepest sympathy to the families of Officer J.J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson, and to the many friends that they leave, particularly their brothers and sisters in arms, the members of the United States Capitol Police. 
Our hearts ache for them as they struggle with their staggering loss. 
Like many Members of Congress, I was headed home Friday afternoon when Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson were slain. I was in the airport in Minneapolis, changing planes, when I first learned of what had happened. I was shocked and sickened and saddened. 
Throughout the airport, wherever there was a TV, people crowded around it to watch the news, and try to understand. 
At home in South Dakota this past weekend, I spoke with countless people who told me how terribly sad they are about the deaths of these two brave men. 
In that airport, in South Dakota and across our nation, Americans understand that Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson sacrificed their lives to guard and protect something that is sacred to all of us. 
This Capitol truly is `the people's house', a symbol of freedom and democracy, recognized the world over. 
That is one of the reasons Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson loved it so, and were so proud to work here. 
It is difficult, unless you have worked here, to understand what a close-knit family the Capitol community is. We come to work every day, pass each other in the halls. We ask about each others' families, joke with each other. 
And today, we try to comfort each other. 
Whenever you suffer a death in the family, as we have in the Capitol Hill family, there is at first a sort of unreality about it. 
That is especially true when the person is taken suddenly, or too young, as Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson were. 
But then, you come to where they should be and there is a hole in the world and you begin to understand that it's true. 
Coming back to work today, we have all experienced that void. 
Inside the Capitol, another officer stands where Officer Chestnut should be. 
And the door over the House Majority Whip's office, where Detective Gibson was stationed, is draped in black bunting. 
Everywhere, the voices are quieter than usual. Tears rim the eyes of many people. Outside, the flag over the Capitol flies mournfully at half-staff. 
Below it, on the white marble steps, lay flowers and cards left by a grateful public to honor two fallen heroes. 
Then, there is perhaps the saddest sight of all: the black bands stretched like a gash over the badges of the Capitol Police officers. 
These are the inadequate tributes we pay to these two extraordinary men whose professionalism, courage and selfless dedication last Friday afternoon surely saved many innocent lives. 
But the real tribute is not what is different about the Capitol today. The real tribute is what is the same. 
The halls of `the people's house' are filled today--as they are every day--with vacationing families, school children, Scout troops and thousands of others who have come to see their government in action. They walk these majestic halls and marvel--as they do every day--at the beauty of this building, at its history and its openness. 
That is the real tribute to Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson. 
Because they made us feel so safe, we may not have understood fully the risks they took each day when they put on their badges and came to work. But they understood. 
They knowingly risked their lives because they loved this building and what it represents, and they wanted others to be able to see their government at work. 
Among the bouquets on the steps outside is a handmade tribute: a collage of a silvery cross on black paper. Glued across the top of the collage is the headline from S aturday's newspaper. It reads `2 Slain Officers Remembered, Called Heroes.' 
Today, as we struggle to accept that loss, we offer our condolences and thanks to the men and women of the Capitol Police Department especially those who were at work last Friday afternoon and who reacted with such selfless professionalism as well as those who worked through the weekend so that `the people's house' could remain open to the people. 
We can only imagine how awful these days are for you, and how difficult it must be for you to be here. 
We are proud to work with you, and deeply grateful to you for your courage and dedication. 
Above all, our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson. May God comfort them and ease their terrible anguish. 
Tomorrow, we will put aside our normal schedule in order to pay our final respects to Jacob Joseph Chestnut and John Gibson. 
Their bodies will lie in honor in the Rotunda, surrounded by statues of other American heroes. That is as it should be, for they truly are heroes. They gave their life for their country and, in doing so, saved the lives of countless others. We are in awe of their sacrifice, and we are grateful to them beyond words.

So I think this is a plan that will still require some cooperation and support on both sides of the aisle, but I think we can do it. I think it is the best way with which to accommodate schedules as well as the need to address these issues soon. So I certainly commend the majority leader for the recommendations and the proposal, and I hope we can complete our work.

Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, as I understand it, there are a few minutes left. I wanted to come to the floor to commend the distinguished Senator from South Carolina on his amendment. I believe this is really one of the most critical economic and fiscal decisions we will make this year. It will probably affect, more dramatically than anything else we do, the budget, the deficit, and, most certainly, Social Security. There are four numbers that I think everybody needs to understand. I know a lot of this has been discussed before. 
The first number is $520 billion; $520 billion is the projected surplus including Social Security trust funds that we anticipate between now and the year 2003. If you take out the Social Security trust funds, you get to the second number---$137 billion. If we remove the Social Security trust funds, we actually have a deficit over the next 5 years of $137 billion. 
Let us not kid anybody here. When we talk about a surplus--and I wish we could talk more forcefully and more convincingly that, indeed, we have a surplus--the reality is that we have a surplus only if we include the Social Security trust funds. 
Let's move to the second set of numbers. The first is $1.548 trillion. All of these figures, by the way, Mr. President, are CBO numbers. That figure is the budget surplus including the Social Security trust funds that CBO anticipates for the next 10 years. 
The fourth and final number is $31 billion; $31 billion is all that CBO anticipates that we will have over the next 10 years in surplus if we do not include the Social Security trust funds. 
There should not be any question about our circumstances. Do we have a surplus? Yes. But it is yes with an asterisk, and that is what the distinguished Senator from South Carolina says so forcefully and so convincingly. We have a surplus only if we are prepared to drawn down those Social Security trust funds that we know we are going to need in the outyears. 
When we talk about how do we use the surplus, it is pretty simple. The question we should be asking is, How do we use the Social Security trust funds? Of the roughly $650 billion over five years and $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years in Social Security trust funds, how do we use them? 
Most of us believe very strongly that we ought to use those funds for one purpose and one purpose only: to pay out the commitment that we have made to Social Security recipients in this generation and the next and the next. 
That is the question. That is why this resolution is so important, and that is why I hope everybody will support the distinguished Senator from South Carolina. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I certainly appreciate the concern expressed by consumers about rising cable rates, and share the desire of the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] to better understanding the reasons for this trend. While further attention to this matter is warranted, I am not persuaded that the amendment before us will substantially further that worthy goal. 
The amendment is intended to compel the FCC to tell us how it plans to address cable rates. But the FCC is already required to report on competition in the cable industry at the end of this year. The 1992 Cable Act requires the FCC to conduct an annual study on the status of competition in the cable industry, and our focus should be on ensuring that that study sheds new light on this issue. 
The FCC has done little about cable rates, and the agency's track record raises doubt that yet another study by that agency, the very one that the Senator from Wisconsin faults for inaction, will add to public understanding of this matter. In addition, the amendment requires a report within 30 days, which is woefully inadequate to achieve any real information about an issue of this scope. 
There are initiatives under way which should add to the policy debate. The senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] and I have asked the independent General Accounting Office to conduct a study of the causes of increasing cable rates. It is my expectation that this review will provide new evidence about steps we need to take to help control cable rate increases. 
In addition, as the distinguished Ranking Member of both the Commerce Committee and the Subcommittee on Commerce-Justice-State [Mr. Hollings] has said, the Senate Commerce Committee is holding a hearing on cable rates next week. As noted by the Senator from South Carolina, the Senate need not prejudge that hearing and the findings of the committee of jurisdiction with a premature amendment. 
Indeed, the Commerce Committee is fully capable of ensuring that the existing statutory requirement to study this issue is fulfilled in a manner that answers the concerns raised by the Senator from Wisconsin and other members of the Senate. I encourage my colleagues on that committee to vigorously exercise their oversight responsibility in this area. 
Mr. President, this amendment, while well-intentioned, is not the answer to our constituents' frustration about their cable rates. Hopefully, the FCC study currently underway and required by year's end, and the GAO review, will shed new light on this issue.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the amendment offered by my colleague, Senator Kyl, addresses a serious problem in our society, and I support most of its provisions. 
I agree that we should protect children from having the opportunity to gamble on the Internet. 
I agree that we should regulate gambling in a responsible manner. 
I agree that we should take steps to protect the integrity of our amateur and professional sports. 
The amendment offered by Senator Kyl will address these problems, which have accompanied the rise of Internet gambling. The problem with the amendment is that it does not address these problems in a manner that treats Native Americans fairly. 
To address this situation, I am cosponsoring the amendment offered by Senator Craig. This measure will exempt from the Kyl amendment those Indian gaming activities regulated and sanctioned by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, thereby retaining the current jurisdictional structure established under IGRA for Indian gaming, a structure that involves the federal courts and the National Indian Gaming Commission. 
Mr. President, it would not be fair to Indian tribes to enact the restrictions of the internet gambling prohibition amendment offered by Senator Kyl without retaining the regulatory structure of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act as Senator Craig suggests. If Congress wants to modify the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, it should do so only after serious review that includes the input of those parties affected directly by that change--in this case, the tribes and tribal gaming enterprises. 
Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support the Craig amendment.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as every Senator is aware, a number of Committees are investigating the national security impacts of two parts of the U.S. relationship with China: the launching of American commercial satellites on Chinese rockets, and the so-called `China Plan' to influence the American political process through campaign donations. 
Earlier this week the Majority Leader came to the floor to announce what he called `major interim judgments' of his task force coordinating this investigation. His remarks sparked a round of debate and speculation that may have clouded the real issues at hand, and I would like to take a moment to respond. 
These are unquestionably significant issues that merit serious, objective review. For me and for the Democratic Senators on our investigation task force, the objective is simple: national security. 
We want the national security to be enhanced; we want American lives and American interests protected. 
If the Senate's work on the satellite export issue reveals flaws in our export controls that endanger national security, we want those flaws corrected--now. 
If the facts warrant, we will gladly join with our Republican colleagues to that end. But there should be no place for politics, for partisan political maneuvering, when it comes to national security. 
We also want U.S. law to be enforced without fear or favor. If the law was violated in campaign financing for the 1996 election, Democratic Senators want the guilty held accountable. The best way to ensure this occurs is not to discuss classified information associated with these cases, and thereby avoid impeding or damaging the FBI's and the Justice Department's ability to investigate and build cases. 
In short, we care about this investigation because we care about national security. 
One of the most important guardians of national security is the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. This is a unique committee, Mr. President. It is not set up like others. It has a vice-chairman, not a ranking member. Its makeup gives the majority party just a one-vote advantage regardless of the composition of the Senate. 
We try to keep partisanship out of most things we do, but in the case of this Committee, Mr. President, we insist on it, because Americans are more safe when Congress can conduct oversight of intelligence functions in a manner that is not just bipartisan, but nonpartisan. 
It is for this reason that I agreed with the Majority Leader's decision to assign primary responsibility to the vital China investigation to the Intelligence Committee. And it is also for this reason that I am so gravely disappointed when its nonpartisan tradition is violated. 
That tradition makes the assertion earlier this week that `interim judgments' had been reached in the China matter particularly disturbing. The Vice Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, the senator from Nebraska, said they most assuredly had not, a fact subsequently confirmed by the Chairman. 
The Democratic priority is national security. National security is a complex and demanding topic in today's world. While several Senate committees consider the effect on Chinese ballistic missiles of launching American commercial satellites in China, this nation faces many other equally grave and immediate threats to our national security. 
For example, Russia, which is now in an economic and military tailspin, has thousands of nuclear warheads and many tons of fissile material from which warheads could be made at stake and perhaps in jeopardy. 
The temptation in Russia today to look the other way while such materials quietly migrate to rogue states must be acute. That's one way in which Russia's problems threaten the United States. 
Other threats appear in the headlines for a few days and then recede from public view, but they are still out there: the very unstable nuclear confrontation in South Asia, the development of weapons of mass destruction by Iran and other rogue states, the growing conflict in Kosovo, the growing tension between the Koreas, the still-tense Bosnia situation. 
We are also threatened today by non-nation state actors, the terrorist organizations who plot to kill or kidnap Americans overseas, and the crime cartels who use today's increasingly open international borders to bring narcotics and other criminal activity to our shores. Information warfare and the relationship between computers and our national infrastructure is another arena in which hostile nations, movements, or even individuals can threaten us. 
All these threats present greater challenges to the defense, intelligence, and law enforcement establishments than they encountered during the cold war. 
At the same time, the haystack is growing, the needles are as small as ever. We need to support and strengthen our capabilities in these areas. We need to be able to react quickly to changing threats and develop the brainpower to master environments ranging from now-obscure foreign cultures at one extreme, to global cyberspace at the other. 
The one thing we should not do is stand pat, as if winning the cold war gives us the right to relax. 
Congress authorizes and appropriates funds for the elements of government that defend against, deter, or counter the threats: the world's most capable military forces, informed by the world's leading intelligence services, as well as law enforcement entities which are second to none. It is our responsibility in Congress to fund these activities, to guide their continued improvement, and to oversee what they do. 
If these departments and agencies are essential to our national security--and they are--then our Congressional authorization, appropriation and oversight processes for these activities are also essential to national security. 
The need to address these issues underscores the importance of the Intelligence Committee's mandate. To approach these matters in a spirit of partisanship arguably puts the national security at risk. 
As for the China inquiry, to my knowledge, none of the four committees that have conducted hearings on the matter has reached any conclusions, interim or otherwise. Many documents already in the possession of Congress have not even been reviewed. Other documents have not yet been received from the administration, which is working hard to comply with the sweeping document requests they have gotten from Congress. 
So it is premature to reach even interim conclusions. To do so subverts the Congressional oversight process. 
I would prefer not to be here discussing ongoing investigations. But I think it is important to correct the record so that from this point on we can let the committees do their work. 
It has been suggested this week on the Senate floor that the Clinton administration's export controls for satellites are wholly inadequate. That statement should be considered in its historical context. 
The policy of exporting satellites for launch on Chinese rockets was initiated in 1988 under President Reagan and has continued under Presidents Bush and Clinton. President Bush authorized the export of 9 satellites to China in three years. Each of these satellites could only be exported after President Bush determined that the transaction was in the U.S. national interest and that the Tianamen sanctions should be waived. 
President Clinton did make some changes in the licensing process for the export of commercial communications satellites. 
President Bush transferred licensing authority for over one-half of all commercial satellites from State to Commerce and recommended that serious consideration be given to moving the rest over to Commerce. President Clinton completed this transfer and issued an executive order that greatly increased the role of the Defense Department in these decisions. In recent testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, a witness, otherwise critical of the Clinton administration, acknowledged that the United States has the strongest and best export controls in the world! 
Does this mean the system is perfect? Certainly not. No multi-agency process involving thousands of decisionmakers and difficult technical and political issues can be. In fact, as a result of some of the information disclosed in the early stages of the hearings, I believe some modification is probably in order. For example, the Departments of Defense and State should see the final text of all licenses. 
However, these are minor fixes in a system that, according to State, Commerce, Defense, and the intelligence community, is working well. 
Second, it has been asserted that sensitive technology related to satellite exports has been transferred to China. Under the Clinton administration, all requests to launch U.S. satellites aboard Chinese rockets go through an exhaustive and careful scrutiny. The Departments of Defense and State must approve all licenses and always place U.S. national security in the forefront of their decision process. Their primary role in this process is to specifically design procedures to ensure that China's access to U.S. technology is limited solely to what is needed to mate the U.S. satellite to the Chinese launcher. 
If these procedures are properly followed, the Chinese learn little, if anything, about our satellites or the technology they contain. Indeed, the Chinese gain no direct access to our satellites and only take ownership of the U.S. satellites they purchase from us after they are successfully placed in orbit. 
Third, it has been charged that China has received military benefit from U.S. satellite exports, and reference has been made to Chinese missiles pointed at U.S. nuclear cities. These very same missiles were developed years before President Reagan decided to allow U.S. satellites to be placed atop Chinese launchers. 
Furthermore, Intelligence Committee hearings have been held on this very issue. And I might say all of them were closed hearings, and public accounts of those hearings fail to substantiate this sensational charge. There is no public account, to my understanding, that substantiates the sensational charges made earlier by people on this floor. 
The final specific charge I will address today is the assertion that new evidence has come to light about a Chinese plan to influence our political process, and that this new evidence should lead the Attorney General to appoint an independent counsel. Unfortunately, the `new' evidence cited is highly classified and cannot and should not be discussed publicly. 
Mr. President, publicly characterizing classified information under any circumstance is dangerous. Using it to make charges against which the accused are unable to defend themselves is even more so. 
Classification is a misunderstood, sometimes frustrating, thing. It is difficult to explain and understand why we keep some things secret. Well, the reason is simple. Americans, and our friends around the world, quite literally risk their lives to gather this information because we promise to protect them. 
When classified information is characterized, the sources who collect intelligence and the methods by which they do so are in danger. Furthermore, because the information involved was classified, those citing it are fully aware that the individuals involved cannot, under law, use that information to reply. 
I will resist the temptation to place on the Record my own characterization of this new classified information. Instead, I will simply make the point that we have heard Republican Members make equally ominous proclamations about the China-plot in the past only to see that these facts fail to substantiate their own allegations. 
Moreover, Attorney General Janet Reno has access to all relevant information, classified and unclassified. She has not been reluctant to call for a special prosecutor in the past, and I am confident that should the facts warrant, she will not hesitate to do so in this case. 
These observations cover my concerns about what has been voiced by critics of this administration's export policies. However, my greatest reservation is the result of what has not been stated. These critics repeatedly fail to mention that the last six Presidents--Democratic and Republican alike--have each concluded it is in our national interest to engage China, not isolate it. 
Specifically, every President since Ronald Reagan has agreed that our national security is enhanced as a result of allowing the Chinese to place U.S. satellites in orbit. 
Based on current information, I agree with this assessment. I believe it is in our national interest to dominate the world's commercial satellite market. This is a strategic industry vital to our defense. We simply cannot be the dominant power in today's high-tech world without this industry and others like it. 
This industry also produces tens of thousands of challenging, high-paying jobs for Americans. So when the Chinese choose an American satellite instead of a foreign satellite, that is good for our security as well as our economy. But the underlying point is that congressional committees are taking a fresh look at all these issues. Therefore, I will reserve final judgment pending their findings. 
The China investigations now underway could have significant, positive benefit for national security. That is my goal and the goal of the Democratic task force. We look forward to working with Senator Lott and Republican members of his task force to get an outcome that makes America safer. 
I applaud many members of our task force and the work done by members of the committee. The next speaker, Mr. President, deserves special commendation. He is not only a member of the Intelligence Committee, but he is our ranking member on the Armed Services Committee. I do not know of anyone who has put more time and effort into sifting through these facts and attempting as best as he can, in as objective a manner as he can, what the facts are. He has done so in a fashion that is commensurate with his reputation. I commend him again for his studious and thoughtful analysis and the work that he has provided not only to our task force but to the committee. 
I yield the floor.

We were on the Lugar amendment most of the day yesterday, for good reason. It was a very controversial issue that I think was important. We had a good opportunity to discuss it. We have had some good amendments on this side. 
But there comes a time when we have to bring this matter to a close. I hope my Democratic colleagues can work with the leadership here in an effort to come to a finite list that is narrower than the one that currently exists, in an effort to accommodate our schedule. I am hopeful we can do that in the next couple of hours so we have a very definitive list of what needs to

Mr. DASCHLE. Late yesterday several of my colleagues took to the floor to discuss their views on the need for congressional action on encryption legislation. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly provide my thoughts on this important issue. 
As everyone who follows encryption policy knows, despite years of discussion and debate, we still have not found a solution that is acceptable to industry, consumers, law enforcement and national security agencies. In this Congress alone, we have seen 7 competing bills introduced--3 in the House and 4 in the Senate. 
The country is paying a price for this inability to produce a consensus solution. That price is evident not only in loss of market share and constraint on internet commerce, but also in the steady erosion of the ability of law enforcement's and national security agencies' to monitor criminal activity or activities that threaten our national interest. 
We simply must find a comprehensive national policy that protects both U.S. national security and U.S. international market share--sooner rather than later. And I believe we can. 
After many months of participating in discussions on encryption policy and hearing from all sides of this complex issue, I have reached two conclusions. First, the Administration has and is continuing to make good-faith efforts to reach agreement on the numerous complex issues that underlie our encryption policy. And second, there is already considerable agreement on a series of key issues. The challenge is to pull together to forge a consensus encryption policy for the 21st Century. 
Earlier this year, I sent a letter to Vice President Gore asking for the Administration's goals and plans for encryption policy. In his response to me, the Vice President indicated that he supports `energizing an intensive discussion that will apply the unparalleled expertise of U.S. industry leaders in developing innovative solutions that support our national goals.' Subsequent actions demonstrate that the Vice President and this Administration have been true to their word. 
In the last several months, the Administration has engaged in intensive discussions with the Americans for Computer Privacy, an important business-oriented interest group. These discussions have focused on technical, policy, legal, and business issues associated with encryption, and the impact of strong encryption on law enforcement and national security. The Administration is also reviewing ACP's proposals for export relaxation. I have been assured by senior Administration officials that, in making decisions on our encryption policy, the Administration recognizes it must carefully consider commercial needs as well as law enforcement and national security interests. 
As a result of the Administration's statements and actions, I am more convinced than ever that there is already agreement on a significant number of issues and that a consensus on encryption policy is possible in the not-to-distant future. First, all parties accept the need for and reality of strong encryption products. Second, all parties agree that strong encryption products are essential to the growth of electronic commerce and the internet. Third, all parties agree that 40-bit keys are inadequate to ensure privacy and security. Fourth, all parties agree that doing nothing has a real and significant downside. According to a recent study, maintaining existing encryption policies will cost the U.S. economy as much as $96 billion over the next 5 years in lost sales and slower growth in encryption-dependent industries. Finally, all parties agree that doing nothing is unsustainable because the relaxed restrictions the Administration placed on 56-bit encryption products expire at the end of the year and must be addressed within the next month or two. 
So where does this leave us? Unfortunately, while recent discussions between industry and the Administration have been fruitful, they have not gone far enough or proceeded fast enough to produce the kind of agreement I believe the majority of the Congress would all like to see. The time has come for the Administration to announce exactly where it stands on several key issues--including how it intends to proceed when the current relaxed restrictions on 56-bit encryption expire. 
Having urged the Administration to greater efforts, I must also ask if it would not be constructive for those who are most frustrated with the pace of change in this area to take a step back and closely examine their own positions. For example, several of the bills introduced in the Congress this session call for the Secretary of Commerce to have exclusive jurisdiction over the export of encryption products. Despite the widespread agreement that the sale of encryption products has important ramifications for our national security and law enforcement, these bills would give no role to officials from the Justice Department, the FBI, or the intelligence community in the decision process regarding which encryption products can be legally sold. 
This fact would be noteworthy even in isolation. It is even more remarkable when one combines it with the observation that many of the adherents to this laissez-faire approach to export controls for encryption products are the most vocal critics of the Administration's export policies for commercial satellites. 
The incongruity of these two positions is stunning. Trying to reconcile them is impossible. There are only two conclusions to be drawn from this inconsistency. Either the right hand does not know what the left is doing, or at least part of the criticism directed at the Administration is politically motivated. 
I will be working with the Administration and my colleagues in the days ahead in the hope of reaching some consensus on national encryption policy. I am hopeful that over the next few weeks we can begin to resolve the numerous difficult issues that remain. Neither industry nor government is likely to get 100 percent of what it wants. However, if both sides are flexible and cognizant of the stakes involved, I am hopeful we can reach an agreement that's good for consumers, good for business, and good for law enforcement and national security.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for her excellent statement and appreciate very much her reflecting on the seriousness of the situation in Louisiana as well. 
As I noted, Mr. President, I will use my leader time to finish the discussion of this amendment. 
I think this poster probably says it as well as anything. The only thing I would call to everyone's attention is that when it says `rural S.D.,' it could say `rural Louisiana,' it could say `rural Illinois,' or it could say `rural' any State in the country. `Ag slump threatens rural'--blank. For me, it is `rural S.D.'. 
The problems that we are having here that are outlined in these articles say it very well. Prices have dropped dramatically. Prices have dropped in corn, in wheat, sorghum, barley, soybeans--you name the commodity. Prices have plummeted. It is not just the grain, it is the livestock as well. 
There is a statement here in the first part of the article by David Kranz, the Sioux Falls Argus Leader.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will quote from the article: 
`We are seeing a major impact. It's all because of $2 corn and under $5 beans and going lower. And you have $30 hogs and $50 cattle. I don't know if you could call it a depression, but it is awfully close to it,' said Tom Reecy, owner of Reecy Farm Supply Co. in Dell Rapids. 
Contributing to farmers' problems are weakened demand for agricultural imports and some prolonged periods of weather disasters and crop diseases. Some agricultural economists are predicting financial fallout as harsh as during the farm crisis of the mid-1980s. 
This isn't a Democratic Senator saying this. This isn't even a farmer saying this. What they are saying is that, because of these falling crop prices, you have got the owner of a very important business in Dell Rapids, SD, saying, `It's over.' Its over unless we change what is happening out here today. 
The article by Kevin Woster makes it very clear that the problem goes beyond--it is not on this chart--but it goes beyond Dell Rapids, SD. He talks about Redfield, a very important community in the northeastern part of our State. The 1996 census update showed a 3.3 percent drop in population in just that year. Rod Siegling owns the family grocery store, Siegling Super Value, which has been operating in Redfield for 40 years.

Mr. DASCHLE. I will simply read one paragraph: 
During the last decade, the devastating effect of low commodity and cattle prices has affected every household in the county. Commodity prices at the 1950 levels have contributed to the continuing exodus of our youth to cities for jobs while the age of our farmers and ranchers average in the 60s. 
Yesterday, the Senate voted 99 to nothing simply to say, with bipartisan emphasis, we hear you. We understand. We know that when prices are this low, you are going to see the consequences as reported in these stories and this letter. 
Today, we now offer our solutions. This amendment, the one upon which we will be voting briefly, lifts the cap on marketing loans and extends the loan term as one of the most consequential ways with which to respond immediately to the problem of low prices. 
Why? Because we are giving farmers some flexibility to say, look, if the prices continue this way, I am going to take out a loan for at least 15 months to see if all of the other things they are doing out in Washington and throughout our agricultural economy will give me a better price later on. 
That is what we are suggesting. Let's give our farmers the opportunity to obtain a better option in the short term. We are talking about farmers' ability to survive the 1 year that this amendment takes place. That is all it is, 1 year. We are not suggesting this be a permanent change to the legislation pending. We are simply saying the very survival of thousands of family farms depends upon whether we give them the tools right now. 
For those who oppose this amendment, I would simply ask, What immediate action do they propose? What will they do to help farmers today? 
We are all for trade. I don't know of a Senator who will come to the floor and say, `I oppose increasing trade.' That is like saying I will oppose eating apple pie. We favor trade. We want to see our markets opened. And I might say parenthetically the fastest way to open them is to pass the funding of the International Monetary Fund so that we can open these markets and stabilize the economy. 
So let me just describe again this first in a series of steps that we are proposing to deal with these prices. The amendment, again, that we will be voting on momentarily would eliminate the caps on marketing loans and set the new rate at 85 percent of the average price of the previous 5 years, and here is the key, `on an emergency basis.' On an emergency basis, it would extend the marketing loan term from 9 months to 15 months under the same conditions. 
I hope everyone will note the distinction between this amendment and earlier legislation to break the loan caps. In contrast to other marketing loan proposals, this measure only goes into effect in the case of an economic crisis. It gives the President discretionary authority to control extreme, persistent income loss by lifting the marketing loan caps and extending their terms in this year only. 
Regardless of how my colleagues may feel about changes in permanent law, regardless of how they may have voted in the past, I really cannot imagine that anybody can say that for 1 year, under these circumstances, I am opposed to bumping up that loan that has to be paid back by the farmers, regardless of whatever concerns they might have. In every single case that I am aware of in talking to farmers around the country, they tell us that the single most effective thing we can do, the single most important thing we can do to affect price in the short term is what we are offering right now. 
You can listen to some of our colleagues complain that this is an old solution. The fact is that this is the best solution, the best short-term emergency solution that we are aware can be proposed. It is supported by the National Wheat Growers, by the Barley Growers, by the American and National Corn Growers, and by a growing list of farmer organizations and farmers across this country who say, yes, with an exclamation point, pass this. 
Combining the two provisions--the extension of the time and the moderate increase in the availability of the loan value--provides our farmers with increased market flexibility and a far better shot at surviving over the next 12 months. Adopting this proposal would result in loan rate increases, and we think price increases, for every single grain commodity. Wheat loan rates would increase 64 cents a bushel; corn loan rates would increase 36 cents a bushel; soybean rates would increase. 
The flexibility contained in the new farm bill is great. Farmers get their signals from the market but not the Government. But they cannot be left without the marketing tools necessary to capitalize on the new free market. This is an opportunity to send a clear message to farmers in every State, every State where we can add `rural' in front. We understand the ag slump threatens rural States, rural South Dakota, rural North Dakota, rural Maine, rural California, rural Louisiana, and we are going to do something about it. We are going to offer this as our best opportunity to deal immediately with price, knowing how consequential this could be for every single farmer who is watching and listening and hoping that we understand. We can use all the rhetoric we want. The only way we are going to get this job done is to match our actions to our rhetoric. The rhetoric came yesterday. The actions now must come today, and they must start by increasing this loan rate. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from Montana for this amendment. 
We have a very serious situation with regard to price transparency. Can you imagine going into a store and not knowing the price? Can you imagine a retailer going into the market and not knowing what the prevailing price is? 
What these two Senators are doing is simply asking that we have a pilot project to be able to decide if there is a way by which to better describe prices and a way to bring about price transparencies so producers and retailers or anybody has a better understanding of what the market is. 
If you really believe in a free market, you will support this pilot project because it simply allows the free market to do its work. 
Mr. President, I am deeply disturbed by the number of small to medium-sized producers going out of business in our states, and by mounting evidence that anti-competitive forces within the livestock market are contributing to this trend of shrinking income. 
This amendment offered by Senator Kerrey will help end the secret livestock deals that are driving small to medium-sized producers out of business in our states, by requiring that they report the prices they pay for live cattle. 
This in turn will assure that the market price accurately reflects the real value of livestock, in other words increases market transparency. 
In South Dakota, smaller livestock producers are leaving the industry literally by the hundreds.S8230 
According to South Dakota State University, in the past five years South Dakota has lost over 1,000 of our smaller cow/calf operators, and over 800 small feedlots. 
Not only do these losses cripple rural communities, they threaten the vitality of the agriculture industry itself. 
Small business plays an essential role in any market; it is small business that can respond most rapidly to changing consumer demand, and small business that is most likely to innovate and meet the preferences of niche markets. 
As packers and feedlots continue to merge, as smaller operations go out of business, and as producers face progressively fewer markets for their production, we lose an important segment of the industry. 
The result will be a less diverse, less responsive marketplace. 
Increasing market transparency is essential to ensuring our producers at least have a chance to compete. 
I appreciate that USDA publishes voluntarily reported price information, but we need to do more. 
The contract prices that currently are not reported may have market distorting effects because reported cash prices do not reflect true market conditions. 
Formula pricing, captive supplies, and vertical integration all contribute to transactions off of the cash market, and severely impede many producers' ability to compete. 
This amendment would ensure, on a test basis, that all livestock prices are reported. 
This means producers and feedlots will know that the market price accurately reflects the prices being paid in private transactions. 
This is the way the free market is supposed to work. 
The majority of producers who talk to me about conditions in the industry today simply say they want a fair shake. 
They want a chance to work hard to produce a high quality product and to sell it for a fair price. 
We expect our foreign markets to be open and fair so that we can compete abroad. Producers absolutely should be able to expect the same of our domestic markets. 
Producers and farm organizations have been saying for some time that as prices and terms of trade become increasingly limited, there isn't enough information available to determine the fair market price for livestock. 
I continue to hear that not only is complete price information vital to an efficient market, but also that it may reduce the potential for exploitative relationships in the industry. 
This is an important, reasonable step to take on behalf of our small livestock producers. 
If we care about small business, if we care about the rural communities they serve, if we care about having a fair and open marketplace in agriculture, we will pass Senator Kerrey's amendment. 
I hope that on a bipartisan basis we can support this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will have the opportunity to discuss, in greater detail, the remarks just made by the distinguished majority leader. Let me just say that our interest, too, is to have a bipartisan review of the actions taken with regard to the technology transfer in China. But I do hope that it will be bipartisan. The majority leader gave what I would view to be a pretty partisan report this morning with regard to the allegations pending on this particular matter, and I will have a very thorough response to the majority leader at some point today. I do believe that the issue warrants our review. As he said, this is a constitutional responsibility, but it also warrants objectivity and very thoughtful and careful consideration of the facts. Many of the reports the distinguished majority leader cited were allegations that have yet to be proven, allegations 
reported--he mentioned the New York Times on a number of occasions--allegations reported, citing unidentified sources, and what I would consider to be very questionable sources with regard to the information reported in some cases. So we are going to have to be very careful about the distinction between allegation and fact, the distinction between what has actually occurred and what is reported or what is alleged to have occurred. So I hope that we can do that, as he noted, in a bipartisan way, thoroughly and very carefully examining the facts and coming to some conclusion prior to the time we issue any reports.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in the next few minutes we will have an opportunity to revisit an issue that many of us hoped would not have been rejected last month. The amendment before us is the so-called McCain managers' amendment to the comprehensive tobacco bill reported by the Commerce Committee. The only significant change is the Lugar amendment to repeal the tobacco quota and price support programs is removed. 
There were many complaints about how loaded up the tobacco bill had become. The amendment we are discussing this morning has none of the extra provisions dealing with taxes and drug abuse. Each day that we wait, 3,000 kids start to smoke; 1,000 of them will die prematurely of tobacco-related illnesses. Tobacco companies are targeting 12-, 13- and 14-year-old children as replacement smokers to fill the shoes of the 2 million smokers who quit or die each year. We have all heard the facts. Tobacco-related disease kills 400,000 Americans each year. 
So today's tobacco amendment, the McCain managers' amendment, is simply designed to deter teen smoking without raising all of the other issues that surfaced during the debate. We had hoped very much that we could modify this amendment before its consideration today. Our Republican colleagues and the leader chose to oppose our unanimous consent request to change the amendment. We were going to modify the legislation to make it a straightforward authorization. 
I will tell my colleagues that the modified amendment will be offered at a later date on another bill. We will be content to have the vote on the point of order on this amendment and then we will, as I have noted before, revisit this question on several occasions. 
I am disappointed that our colleagues, for whatever reason, have chosen not to allow us to modify our amendment at this time. I hope no one will be misled. Their actions reflect their willingness to make difficult choices on tobacco legislation targeted at teenage smokers. 
That is what this amendment is all about. So we will have an opportunity to vote on it. We can vote procedurally and we can obfuscate the question, but we will come back, and we will come back again and again over the course of the coming months, to offer legislation that will not be subject to any points of order. So we may be delaying that vote, but we will eventually have that vote. 
I think it is critical that everyone recognize what a very important moment this is. The attorneys general are meeting as we speak. There is very likely to be an agreement dealing with past actions on the part of the tobacco industry. The question is, Can we deal with future ones, can we anticipate similar actions and establish public policy that will prevent the tobacco industry from targeting teenage smokers? That is, in essence, what we are attempting to do here with advertising restrictions, with research, with an array of disincentives to teenage smokers that otherwise will not be part of any agreement. It takes legislation. 
So, Mr. President, this will be our opportunity to do that. I know there are other Senators who wish to speak, and I will yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts says it very well. That is as succinct a description of the problem as I have heard. The attorneys general may help address past problems, the retrospective and very serious concerns that have been raised in court cases throughout the country. The problem, then, becomes, how do we avoid those problems in the future? And what every attorney general has said is the only way you can do that is to establish new public policy that strengthens regulatory controls on tobacco, ends advertisements that target kids, expands our research efforts, increases the price of tobacco to deter youth from falling prey to the smoking habit, holding tobacco companies accountable for accomplishing youth smoking reduction targets, that is, let's put into place strategies that reduce teen smoking. Permanently. This must happen prospectively. What the Senator from Massachusetts said is exactly right. It s a question of whether or not we can successfully put into place laws that preclude any further abuses by the tobacco industry. We must act now to stop the industry from any further use of covert strategies such as those that, thanks in large measure to the work of the attorneys general, are now common knowledge.

Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his question. We are in an interesting position here. The Republican majority will argue that the pending amendment violates our budgetary rules, and on the basis of that violation, they will vote against the amendment and vote against the motion to waive the point of order on the budgetary rules. 
Last night, we offered to change the amendment to accommodate the budgetary rules, and we were denied the opportunity to change that amendment. So here you have the Republican majority objecting to our amendment based upon budgetary rules, but unwilling to allow us to change the amendment so that it conforms to budgetary rules. So the question then becomes, What is the basis for the real opposition? The basis for the real opposition, one could only assume, is that they simply do not want to pass meaningful tobacco policy that takes aim at the array of serious policy concerns the Senator addressed in his earlier question.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have discussed this matter procedurally with our distinguished managers on both sides of the aisle and appreciate very much their willingness to cooperate in terms of expediting the consideration of these critical amendments. 
The amendment that I have just submitted is one that Senator Harkin and I and others discussed on the floor this morning. 
The amendment builds upon what I hope will be a very significant vote at 5:15 this afternoon. As we note, the first amendment hopefully brings us together, Republicans and Democrats, in a way that allows us to say: Yes, we understand there is a problem; yes, we have to respond. Even though we may not yet have an agreement on how we might respond, there should be a response. 
That is, in essence, what we are saying with the passage of the resolution that we have just ordered a vote on. Now we go to the next phase: All right, if we recognize there is a problem, then what we do we do about it? As many of us noted this morning, we are offering a series of proposals that we hope will allow us to respond in a meaningful way to the situation that we find ourselves in in agriculture. A lot of people already today have put excellent reports found in various publications into the Record. The Chicago Tribune on June 21 of this year had a report that I don't think is yet in the Record. The article is headlined `Harvest of despair.' 
In the article, the very first statement says:  
Falling prices, poor growing conditions, and government deregulation are forcing thousands of family farmers to abandon their way of life, perhaps the worst blow to the rural Northern Plains since the bankruptcy crisis of the middle 1980's. 
Mr. President, I don't think there is an article that could say it more succinctly than that. It goes on to explain the circumstances. 
In 1996, for a bushel of wheat, farmers received $5.20 cents. In May of 1998, they received $3.07--a $2.13 reduction in price on a bushel of wheat in a 2-year period of time, a 40-percent-plus reduction in the availability of price for farmers. 
That is the problem. This precipitous drop in price is generating an extraordinary crisis financially for family farmers and ranchers all over America. It is not just wheat. I could give the same statistics for corn. We could talk about livestock. We could talk about virtually any commodity found in the northern Great Plains, or in the West today, and you would see a situation that could be entitled `Harvest of Despair.' 
So the question is, What do we do about it? I am one who believes in the marketplace. But I also know that the market has many ways that have been used, many tools that have been used, both public and private, in an effort to soften these economic upturns and downturns. We see it on Wall Street. We see it on Main Street primarily through the Tax Code. We have seen it in agriculture for decades. We are not suggesting in response to this crisis that we reopen the farm bill and, in so doing, reopen the debate about all of the infrastructure that is now in place dealing with the relationship that the people of the United States have with farmers. We are not going to do that. 
But what we are going to do is to suggest that there are some actions that can be taken that would have profound benefits to farmers and to ranchers to get through this crisis. And what we are suggesting is that in many of those cases we put a time limit on it. We don't say for all perpetuity now we are going to make these changes, because that would be doing the very thing I said we weren't going to do. So the amendment that I have laid down is a perfect illustration of just that. 
The amendment says that the Government will take the average price that we have seen for commodities over the last 5 years, drop the highs and lows, and put in place a marketing loan at 85 percent of that price that the farmers could avail themselves of, if they don't want to be forced to sell their grain tomorrow. 
Let's assume a farmer has a good crop. Let's assume that he is suffering, with this remarkable chart showing that prices have gone from $5.20 down to $3.07 in 2 years, and he doesn't want to settle for $3.07. What does he do? He goes to the Department of Agriculture and says, `I heard about this marketing loan you all have. I would like to take out a loan.' For now it is 9 months. We are going to give them a little more flexibility. We are going to say 15 months--1 year and 3 months--5 quarters--before he has to pay it back. He is going to say, `I am going to take out that loan,' betting their price is going to turn around. So he does. The price goes up, he pays the loan, the Government makes money, and the farmer stays in business. 
Mr. President, that is what we are doing. That is what we are suggesting here.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on an emergency basis we give the President the opportunity to deal directly with the crisis that we are facing right now in farm after farm, in rural community after rural community. It only goes into effect in case of an economic crisis. It gives the President the discretion to control the extreme and persistent income losses by lifting the loan caps and extending their terms this year only. This authority expires this time next year. 
Regardless of how my colleagues feel on lifting the caps, this measure would probably do more than any other I can think of in providing immediate help--immediate relief--to farmers who are the victims of the `Harvest of despair'. 
I know a lot of my colleagues have said, `Look, we don't want to get back into that. We have had those battles.' I understand that. But I also understand, Mr. President, that we have very few options. And almost categorically when we talk to farmer organizations, and farmers themselves, they say, `We have to have some other option than to force our grain on the market when it is this low. Give us an opportunity for some breathing space. Give us some room.' So that is what we are doing. 
Wheat loan rates would increase 64 cents a bushel--from $2.58 to $3.22. Corn loan rates would increase 36 cents a bushel--from $1.89 to $2.25. Soybean rates would increase 7 cents a bushel--from $5.26 to $5.33. 
Keep in mind that we are talking about the 85 percent average over the last 5 years. 
They have flexibility. They have a little more certainty about what they are going to get for their crop going into the market this fall. 
Mr. President, that is as good as we think we can do under these circumstances. 
Would I like to see a higher loan rate? Absolutely. Would I like to see even more substantive ways in which to ensure a better price? Absolutely. But after very careful consideration, we said, `Look, let's do something that is reasonable. Let's do something that we believe the administration and most Members of Congress would recognize to be prudent and responsive to the problems we are facing in agriculture today.' 
I know that we are scheduled to vote at 5:15. I know the distinguished Senator from Iowa wanted to address this matter as well prior to the vote. 
Just as soon as he appears in the Chamber, I will yield. I would like to yield the remainder of that time to the distinguished Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. President, the `harvest of despair' needs to be addressed. All we are asking is an opportunity to address it in a way that is very prudent budgetarily, that very carefully addresses the emergency nature of the situation farmers are facing today. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Senator Harkin will have an amendment in just a moment. He is on his way over. I thought it might be appropriate to get the debate started and to have a discussion about the essence of the amendment. It will be simply a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that calls upon the Senate and the country to respond to the problem we find in agriculture today. 
Most of America prospers with an economy that is striking for its performance and success. On Wall Street, on Main Street, in the suburbs of America, and in virtually every segment of our country the economy is as strong as it could possibly be. Wall Street has exceeded their expectations manyfold. The number of housing starts is up. The number of new businesses created is way up. The number of people employed has been dramatically improved upon in the last 5 years. We now have over 14 million Americans who have new jobs. 
So while the overall economic picture is extremely bright and encouraging, with no end in sight, the Federal Reserve Board continues to argue that its circumstances are that they don't see any need to change; they won't increase the interest rates. While all that is happening, there is a segment of our economy that continues to get worse and worse and more and more bleak. 
While most of America prospers, our farmers and ranchers in rural communities are now in a crisis. While we recognize the geographic differences that exist, there are some areas where you might suggest that crisis is avoided. Some in agriculture today--rice farmers and cotton farmers--are generally happier than they have been on other occasions. But across the Great Plains, down into Texas, well into the Dakotas, across into Montana and the West, down into the Southeast, every time I go home, we see increasing evidence of serious economic alarm. 
This crisis rivals now the worst of the farm crisis in the 1980s in some parts of our country. Farm income is down dramatically in South Dakota and across the country. It has fallen in 32 States. It is down by 30 percent in more than one-fifth of the country today. The problem is low prices. In 1998, the average net farm income for Great Plains farmers is expected to be near the poverty line for a family of four. 
Let me make sure everybody understands that. 
A farmer in the Great Plains who is on the farm today working actively as a producer--the average farmer today--will actually see his or her income at the official poverty line for a family of four. 
Here we are experiencing one of the greatest booms in modern day on Wall Street in virtually every segment of the economy, and yet our farmers and ranchers are the ones experiencing an unbelievable economic and financial crisis that equals, if not exceeds, anything they have had in the past. 
Farm debt is now $172 billion. That, Mr. President, is the highest it has been in 13 years. We have to go all the way back to the time when farmers rolled their tractors into Washington to find a time when farm debt was as high as it is today at $172 billion. Overall farm income nationwide is down $5.2 billion since 1996. 
So we have seen a precipitous decline in farm income. We have seen an accompanying increase in debt rivaling anything we have seen in my lifetime, going all the way back to the farm crisis of 1985. And that is our current circumstance. Do you call that a crisis, when a family of four is trying to eke out a living on a farm, or a ranch, is at the poverty-line income, when debt has gone up by $172 billion, when we have seen the precipitous decline in farm income in just the last 2 years of $5.2 billion? 
Mr. President, that translates into losses that go beyond farms. In fact, we are told that we could see a loss of 100,000 jobs in rural America as a result of the problems in the agricultural sector--100,000 people. Why? Because farm income has plummeted, debt has gone up, and the economy continues to worsen. 
So there is no doubt that this isn't just a farm issue, it is a rural issue of enormous magnitude. The ripple effect is clearly now in evidence. 
Mr. President, I have the greatest admiration and affection and respect for the current Presiding Officer. He and I have worked together and come from the same part of the country. I appreciate his sense of humor. But in some ways you have to have a sense of humor to look at the Freedom to Farm Act today. Freedom to Farm, in my view, is what is responsible in large measure for what has happened. It has destroyed the safety net for our country's family farmers. Many of us predicted on the day that it passed that this would be what we would be facing. In fact, going back to a quote I made the day that the bill passed, I said at the time: `I think the Senate has made a very tragic mistake. This fight is not over. We will come back.' 
Well, we are back. I wish we didn't have to be. But we are back. We are back because we have no choice now. The crisis is upon us. Some of us could have predicted it. The fact is that it has happened. Without delving into all the reasons why it happened, at least right now, I don't think with the figures I have just stated for the Record that anyone can deny that it is happening. What else can you say about a family farm that is experiencing poverty-level income? What else can you say about an income overall in the economy, the farm economy, that has projected a $172 billion debt, the highest since 1985? What else can you say about just 2 years of lost income, now $5.2 billion? 
Mr. President, there is no question we are in a crisis. The question is now, what do we do? Frankly, after a great deal of debate internally, most of us have concluded that it isn't our purpose now to completely reopen the debate on the Freedom to Farm Act and revisit each and every one of the areas that we think need improvement. That is something we will have to save for another time. We are in a crisis. We are in an emergency. Because we are in an emergency, we don't have the luxury of saying let's just take our time, go back and review everything, and rewrite everything that we believe may be causing these problems. Rather, what we decided to do, Mr. President, is simply this: 
First, let's offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that recognizes the seriousness of the problem, and as clearly, and hopefully in a bipartisan manner, say: `We want to respond. We hear you. We are empathetic. We agree the situation is very serious, and we are going to respond.' That is the purpose of the sense-of-the-Senate resolution.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, many of our Republican colleagues have said that high prices and robust trade would keep the farm economy strong. I agree. I don't think there is anyone who disagrees with that. High prices and robust trade go hand in glove. The problem is, we don't have either. Prices across the board have plummeted to the lowest levels they have been in more than a decade. Livestock prices and grain prices are at such a point that no one can survive today. No one can survive on prices that farmers are receiving at the local elevator--no one. They are at the levels that farms received when the Presiding Officer and I were born. The same levels that farmers were getting when we were born are the prices farmers are getting today. Could we survive on that kind of an income as Senators, as members of the Senate staff? Could anyone on Main Street survive on prices they were getting in 1947, in my case? We know the answer to that. 
This last week, an amendment was offered which was introduced by the distinguished Presiding Officer, Senator Roberts, and our very distinguished colleague from Washington, Senator Murray, exempting farm products from sanctions. We could have added a lot of things to that. But the Senator from Kansas said--and I had a discussion, and we agreed--that it was better to get something done than to use it as a vehicle for more proposals that we wish could get done. 
So on a bipartisan basis, I think unanimously--if not unanimously, almost so--the Senate went on record in favor of lifting the agricultural sanctions that have existed now for some time. 
The right thing to do--and I am very proud that on an overwhelming basis we sent as clear a message on trade with that vote as we could. Now I hope we will send just as clear a message on domestic solutions. If we can do it on trade, as the Senator from Kansas has noted, we ought to do it on price. And while there is no question that trade can have a positive effect on price, I think one would have to argue vociferously, and I don't think ever conclusively, that whatever changes we make on price related to trade will not be short term. It will be very, very difficult to see any short-term, immediate repercussions based on trade, although for long-term purposes it is exactly what we need to do. We need to find ways to market our products abroad. We need to find ways to be competitive and to see that those markets open up. For us to shoot ourselves in the foot at the very time when farmers need those markets is the absolute worst thing we can do. 
So, Mr. President, the trade piece is the right piece for the long term. The problem is, we have short-term needs that will never be addressed by trade. So here we are, back to correct the failed policies that have crippled rural America, back to recognize that we have to take some actions on this particular bill. 
The amendment that we now have before us recognizes the plight of the family farmer in America. It says that we are on your side, we understand your situation, and that we must act on a solution. That solution will be the subject of additional amendments that we will lay out over the course of the next period of time. It will remove the cap on marketing loans and extend the loan term. We require mandatory price reporting for livestock. We want to require labeling of imported meat. We want to target emergency assistance for victims of multiple-year disasters. The alternative is to do nothing. All Senators should ask, all Senators really need to ask is this: Would they accept a 30 percent cut in their income as thousands of farmers have? Do they want rural America to survive? Do they value the whole societal fabric that family farmers bring to rural America today? 
We have to recognize and respond to this crisis and help farmers in rural communities, help at least in part by restoring a small segment of the agricultural safety net, create a more open and fair marketplace where a safety net isn't even necessary, and give farmers an opportunity to share in America's prosperity. 
That is what we hope to do. We wish we could do it outside the context of an agriculture appropriations bill. That would be my choice. We have been unable, at least to date, to get markups and votes in the committee, taking legislation from the Agriculture Committee to the Senate floor. And so our choice is left to this, to offer amendments on the best second vehicle we could have. The agricultural appropriations bill is a bill that has to pass. 
We will work with the distinguished manager, and there is no better, I might add, than the manager of this particular bill. We will work with him to see that we have the opportunity to pass this legislation and do what we must to assure that farmers have the resources they need. I cannot think of a more important issue than this. I cannot think of a better time than this for us to respond. 
I hope that on a bipartisan basis we will see fit to pass this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to express my gratitude to all of our colleagues, Democratic and Republican, who have worked so hard for so long on the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring Act of 1998. This bipartisan legislation builds on the recommendations of the year-long National Commission on Restructuring of the IRS and addresses many of the concerns raised during Congressional hearings. These reforms have been a long time coming, and I am pleased to support them today on the last leg of their journey through the legislative process. 
We would not be here today, poised to enact the most sweeping restructuring of the Internal Revenue Service in living memory, if it were not for the vision, diligence, and persistence of the senior Senator from Nebraska, Bob Kerrey. Today's vote represents nearly three years of concerted effort on the part of Senator Kerrey. He developed the legislation to create the commission in 1995, co-chaired its proceedings to a successful conclusion in 1997, and has worked assiduously since then with Members of Congress and the Administration to shepherd the legislation to today's final vote. On behalf of the Senate and taxpayers across the country, I thank Senator Kerrey for his inspired public service. 
This legislation has two essential goals: to make the IRS more accountable to private citizens and to transform its culture into one that resembles the customer service orientation of a well-run business. 
Too often lately, South Dakota business owners, farmers and others have told me stories that make IRS tax collectors sound a lot more like a team of overzealous special prosecutors. With this agreement, we send a strong message that the abuse, intimidation, harassment, quota systems, and patterns of targeting middle and lower-income people--or any segment of the public--will no longer be tolerated. IRS reform will ensure that taxpayers receive the fair and equal treatment they deserve. It will also pave the way for restoring the public's confidence in our Nation's tax collector. 
I support this conference report because it will make the IRS more accountable to, and respectful of, taxpayers. 
The extensive public hearings held by the Commission and Congressional committees have highlighted management problems within the IRS as well as individual cases of abuse and harassment by some IRS employees. The new IRS Commissioner, Charles Rossotti, has begun to implement significant changes to the structure and culture of the agency. By approving the conference report, the Senate can at last give him the tools he needs to expedite these necessary changes. 
The bill establishes a new series of taxpayer rights, including one that places the burden of proof on the IRS in disputes before the tax court. It also permits a taxpayer to sue for civil damages if any IRS employee, in connection with any collection activity, negligently disregards the law. I am also pleased that the legislation provides a number of specific protections for taxpayers subject to audit or collection activities and establishes a private board of directors to oversee the IRS. 
In addition, the conference agreement begins the important process of coming to grips with the complexity of the tax code. Thanks to this legislation, in the future, Congress will have an opportunity to hear from IRS technical experts concerning the likely compliance difficulties posed by individual tax legislation proposals. I am hopeful that involving these IRS tax experts early in the drafting process will help us attain our ultimate goal of a simpler and less burdensome tax law. 
Nevertheless, there is one aspect of this conference agreement I find wholly unbecoming of a piece of legislation intended to protect taxpayers. Mr. President, we should be paying for this bill just like every other tax bill. Regrettably, the conference report fails to uphold the spirit of fiscal responsibility that brought us last year's historic balanced budget agreement. Our Republican colleagues have chosen to employ a blatant gimmick to cover the costs of the bill over the 10-year period required by budget rules by pushing the costs out beyond that 10-year period. In so doing, they tarnish an otherwise important victory for taxpayers. 
Protecting taxpayers is not limited to improving the fairness and efficiency of their tax collection system; it also involves maintaining discipline in government finances. There is no good reason why these two goals could not have been achieved simultaneously. 
Specifically, the Roth IRA revenue offset in the conference report raises revenue for only 3 years. Thereafter, it loses more revenue than all the other revenue raisers in the bill combined. Indeed, this bill will drain more than $30 billion from the Treasury in the second 10 years following enactment. This burden on the federal government's finances will occur at precisely the time baby boomers begin to retire in large numbers, Medicare is projected to become insolvent, and the Social Security system's finances come under pressure. I will vote for the conference report because of the many good things in it. Nevertheless, I hope that at the next opportunity Congress will correct this serious flaw in the legislation. 
I am also disappointed that the conference report to the IRS reform bill includes the technical corrections for the new surface transportation law. Like many veterans' advocates, I had hoped the Republican leadership would allow the Senate to debate this matter separately and reconsider its unwise and unfair decision to use $17 billion set aside for veterans' disability compensation to pay for new transportation projects. 
As I have stated many times, I strongly believe that veterans suffering from smoking-related illnesses as a result of their military service should be compensated. That is why I voted against efforts to eliminate this compensation during consideration of the Republican Budget Resolution earlier this year. And that is why I supported the point of order that was raised by Senator Patty Murray on this matter yesterday. Although both efforts were narrowly defeated, I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Murray, Senator Rockefeller, the ranking member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, and others in an effort to ensure that veterans receive the disability compensation they deserve. 
Mr. President, despite my objections to these particular provisions, my vote in favor of this conference agreement comes down to what I believe is in the best interests of working families. The American people deserve some assurance that, if they work hard and play by the rules, they can expect fair treatment from the IRS. I am convinced this legislation can make a difference for honest taxpayers who come into contact with our tax collectors. We should pass the conference report in order to give Commissioner Rossotti the authority he needs to carry out his plans to restructure this troubled agency as rapidly as possible. I have been attempting to expedite passage of this legislation since January, and I believe that American taxpayers should not have to wait one day longer.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the legislation before us today, the Higher Education Act, is an example of what can happen when the majority makes an effort to work together with Senators from this side of the aisle to do something for the good of the country. I commend Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for their good work on this bill. Unfortunately, we have seen too few examples of this type of bipartisan cooperation this year. 
The Higher Education Act is very important, and I am pleased we are making good progress in renewing and strengthening it. As we are all well aware, access to higher education can help unlock the door to a better future for our students and for our Nation, and this legislation provides the key for many students. Pell grants, student loans, campus-based aid and other programs have helped millions of students afford a college education. Through these programs, we provide $38 billion in financial assistance to more than 19.4 million students in postsecondary education institutions. 
The bill we are adopting today makes a number of important improvements in this law. First, and most important, it continues the effort to make a college education more affordable by continuing current programs, increasing the maximum Pell Grant, reducing interest rates on student loans, improving repayment options for students, and increasing the information available to families about the cost of a college education while encouraging institutions to minimize cost increases. 
The bill includes important incentives to improve the quality of teacher training and recruitment and to expand professional development opportunities. I commend the Committee, and in particular the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, and the Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, for their efforts to consolidate and strengthen these provisions into a more logical, coordinate system. We know that putting students in a classroom with a well-trained, qualified teacher is one of the most effective ways to help them achieve to the best of their abilities. 
I am also pleased that the bill establishes a demonstration program to expand post-secondary opportunities for distance learning. This will help many people, especially those in rural areas, those with disabilities and nontraditional students, gain access to programs in which they might not otherwise be able to participate. The Senator from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, has been a strong supporter of these provisions. 
The bill also includes a proposal offered by the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, which I cosponsored, to encourage colleges to establish campus-based child care for low-income students. I also support provisions in the bill that will help reduce binge-drinking on college campuses and reduce campus crime levels. 
Finally, I strongly support the provision creating a new grant program for Tribal Colleges and Universities. These institutions, most of which struggle financially, do a remarkable job of creating educational opportunities for Native Americans. They need and deserve federal support. 
I would like to note that while I did not support the Kennedy amendment, I do support the study called for in the managers' amendment to determine whether there might be ways to move toward a more market-based student loan system to improve the efficiency of the student loan system. While I did support the Harkin amendment because it reduced the cost of student loans, I would note that I strongly believe we must take care to maintain a strong Federal Family Education Loan program. The evidence is strong that competition between the Direct Loan program and the FFEL program is good for both programs and ultimately good for students, and I believe it is important that we work to maintain this balance. 
Mr. President, the Higher Education Act is yet another example of the positive impact the federal government can have in helping our Nation invest in our future. By helping to lower the cost barriers to higher education, we help millions of young people gain the skills they will need to be contributing members of society while we build a strong work force, encourage the development of our intellectual capital and nurture the leaders of the next generation. I urge my colleagues to join me wholeheartedly in supporting this very important piece of legislation.

Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. President, I am very disappointed with the action just taken by my good friend, the majority leader. He has filed cloture on one of the most controversial, complex, far-reaching pieces of legal legislation that we will address in this decade. We have done this before, and it would seem to me that our colleagues would understand that when this happens, we are denying the very function of the U.S. Senate, the right of every Senator to offer amendments, the right to have a deliberative----

Mr. DASCHLE. It is the right of all Senators to fulfill the functions of their responsibilities as U.S. Senators to offer amendments, to have a debate. For us to file cloture, for the Senate to file cloture on a bill of this import, without one speech, without one amendment, without any consideration, is absolutely reprehensible. 
I am very, very disappointed that the majority leader has seen fit to do it. I guess I would ask, What are they afraid of? What is it they don't want us to offer? What is it about the amendment process that worries our colleagues on the other side? What is it about not having a good debate that so appeals to them? Mr. President, I don't know. 
But I do know this. Senators on this side of the aisle will continue to fight for our rights to offer amendments, regardless of circumstance. There are many of our colleagues who may support this bill on final passage, and I respect their rights even though I disagree. I personally think this bill is as bad as all the others that have been proposed, and I hope that we have a good debate about how good or how bad this legislation truly is. But for us to start the debate by saying that there will be little or no debate, especially when it comes to our opportunity to offer amendments, precluding the very right of every Senator to be heard, precluding the opportunity for us to offer ways in which we think it could be improved. 
So we will have this debate over and over and over again. But on so many occasions now, our colleagues on the other side insist on denying the rights of every Senator to be heard. That doesn't have to happen. This is not the House of Representatives. This is not the most deliberative body in the world so long as we continue to utilize this practice. There is a time and a place for cloture, but that time and that place is not as soon as the bill is laid down. Many of us could have objected to the motion to proceed. We could have voted against going to the motion to proceed. We could have even filibustered the motion to proceed. We didn't do that. Why? Because, in good faith, we felt it was important to get on to the bill. But now what do we have? Another in a continued pattern by our Republican colleagues to curtail debate, to curtail thoughtful consideration of a very important issue. 
I don't know of a more complicated bill that any one of us will have to address in this session of Congress than product liability. We could offer a pop quiz today, and I am sure many of our colleagues would probably fail simply because we are not familiar with all the ramifications of this issue. So for us, now, just at the beginning of the debate to say we don't want amendments, we are not even sure we want a lot of debate, we are just going to get this out of our way so we can move on to other things, that is not the way the Senate ought to work. That is not what we ought to be doing here. 
What goes around comes around. This issue is going to come around again and again and again. We will not be denied our rights. 
So I am just very hopeful that even many of our Republican colleagues who may have misgivings about this bill will join Democrats in defeating cloture when the occasion arises on Thursday. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. DASCHLE. I think the Senator from Massachusetts raises a very important point. Exactly. We have seen this in a series of different episodes over the course of the year. It is a dangerous precedent to be setting. It is a remarkable admission from the other side that they are unwilling to face the reality here, to face the opportunity to have a good debate on key votes having to do with improvement of the bill, having to do with different views on a bill. Just as we saw with tobacco.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts raises a very important note here. It seems that our colleagues on the other side are reverting to two practices: One is to file cloture as soon as a bill is laid down. That is what they did in this case. That is what they did--what they did on the Coverdell bill. The other practice is to offer a bill, and as soon as we offer an amendment that is in disagreement with their larger scheme, they pull the bill. That is what happened to the Ag appropriations bill when we offered tobacco on Ag appropriations. That is what just happened on the VA-HUD bill. 
So it seems to me there are two actions taken by our Republican colleagues with some frequency here: File cloture, deny the colleagues the right to offer amendments because of cloture; or pull the bill and move on to something else and never come back. So the Senator from Massachusetts raises a very good point.

As the Senator from Massachusetts just noted, we are no longer in a position where the regular order is to go back to an appropriations bill. They have been shelved. They have been put back on the calendar. Now, we have to move to a motion to proceed to bring the bills back, where at least before we had the bills as the regular order should we fail to reach any kind of an agreement on how to proceed on a current bill.

It goes to the tremendous number of victims of managed care abuses all over this country, in every State of the Union, who have said if you do anything in Congress this year, we want you to fix managed care. We don't want you to wait until we lose more people. We want you to solve this problem this year. 
And that is what we are trying to do. We have 10 weeks to go, fewer than 40 legislative days. If we don't do it now, when are we going to do it? 
The Senator from Massachusetts makes a very important point. I yield to the Senator from Vermont.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Vermont speaks with a wealth of experience that goes well beyond what this Senator has had in his 12 years in the Senate. But like him, I have not seen this practice used with the frequency and the amazing degree of persistence demonstrated by the majority leader to cut off debate, to gag the Senate, to stop an open opportunity for us to debate key issues, complicated issues such as this. 
The Senator is right, this experience is one that I think really bears a great deal of explanation to the American people. Why on key issue after issue--why on education, why on tobacco, why on all these issues that we face this year--does the Senate majority persist in precluding a good opportunity to have the kind of debate the American people expect and want and need. The Senator from Vermont is absolutely right. 
This is not the Senate's brightest moment. This is a very, very disappointing episode in what has been a pattern all year long, and it is disappointing not only to us but the American people. I yield to the Senator from Illinois.

Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Chair for the clarification. Let me just say, the Senator from Illinois is absolutely right, he was asking if I agreed with his characterization of the way this Senate has performed. 
Sometime this year, our Republican colleagues will be asked, `Tell us what you did on tobacco.' They will say nothing. 
Our Republican colleagues will be asked, `Tell us what you did on campaign reform.' Our colleagues will say nothing. 
Our Republican colleagues will be asked, `Well, tell us what you did on education; what did you do to build infrastructure; what did you do to reduce class size?' And our Republican colleagues will have to say nothing. 
Our Republican colleagues are going to be asked, `Well, tell us what did you do, then, on trying to address one of the most important health care questions our country is facing today in managed care?' And, again, our Republican colleagues will say nothing. 
Mr. President, the list continues to grow. Why? Because they appear to be afraid of a debate, appear to be afraid to take this issue to its successful conclusion. If we don't go along, we don't do anything on that particular issue. That isn't the way this Senate is supposed to perform. 
I yield to the Senator from Connecticut.

Mr. DASCHLE. Well, the Senator from Connecticut has demonstrated his characteristic eloquence again. I would answer in the affirmative. I do not know what motivation there may have been on the part of the majority leader, but I must say this, that it complicates dramatically the position of those who support this legislation, complicates it dramatically. As the Senator from Connecticut correctly points out, it could actually kill the very bill they are trying to pass. 
Now, for those of us who want to protect Senators' rights, we are surprised and I guess somewhat amazed at the actions just taken by the majority. Keep in mind, if we pass cloture, all relevant amendments will be barred. And yet our Republican colleagues have already laid an amendment down, an amendment, I might add, that nobody has seen. You talk about a legislative pig in a poke; there isn't a Senator on this side, maybe with one exception, who has seen the amendment just laid down by the majority leader--not one, with one exception perhaps. I have not talked to Senator Rockefeller. 
So I am astounded that our Republican colleagues would say, `We want our amendments, but we don't want you to have any. We're going to pass our amendment, but on the chance that you could pass one of yours, we're going to preclude them all.' 
Mr. President, the Senate cannot work that way. As the Senator from Connecticut just pointed out, we are acting more and more like the House of Representatives. If any one of our colleagues wishes to run, let them declare their candidacy. There are all kinds of open seats, uncontested seats, on the other side. Go run. But if you want to be a U.S. Senator, live up to the responsibilities of the U.S. Senate. This is supposed to be the greatest deliberative body in the world. 
How deliberative can we be when, vote after vote, amendment after amendment, bill after bill, this side is precluded from offering amendments either because the majority leader pulls the bill or they file cloture immediately upon filing? That cannot work, Mr. President. 
So I appreciate the wisdom of the Senator from Connecticut, and I must say the courage, because clearly there could be Senators who misinterpret, were it not for his eloquent explanation just now, why he is going to work to protect Senators' rights. 
I must say, there will be Senators on the other side who will want their rights protected at some point. Majority or minority, it does not matter, it happens to all of us. 
So I appreciate the position taken by the Senator from Connecticut. I hope all of our colleagues have heard his explanation and his reasons. And I hope a lot of our Republican colleagues will join us. Cloture must be defeated. We must protect Senators' rights, and we must protect the institution of the U.S. Senate. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the issue of patient protection is among the most important health questions facing the American people today. In survey after survey, the American people have said without equivocation that they want Congress to deal with this issue. More and more, from places all over the country, we hear reports about victims of our current system and cries for reform. The need to address this issue, this year, has become more and more pronounced. 
For many months, we have worked in concert with the White House and with our House colleagues to come up with a way to comprehensively respond to the growing array of concerns and problems that people from all over the country have raised as they talk about the current situation we face with regard to health insurance and HMOs. 
After a great deal of attention, study, thoughtful analysis, and working with over 100 organizations from all philosophical and political persuasions, we have introduced legislation that provides a number of very basic patient protections: providing access to needed specialists including pediatric specialists for children; ensuring access to an independent appeal board when insurance companies deny care and requiring timely resolution of those appeals; guaranteeing access to the closest emergency room so that people don't have to waste precious time as they drive miles to save their insurance company a few dollars; allowing patients to see the same doctor through a pregnancy or a difficult treatment even if their doctor stops participating in an HMO; allowing women direct access to their ob/gyn without asking their insurance company for permission; preventing drive-through mastectomies and other inappropriate insurance company interference with good medical practice; and holding HMOs accountable when their decisions to deny or delay health care result in injury or death. 
These provisions, and a number of others that I will not list now, were very carefully thought through before we incorporated them in this patient protection bill. I do not know of another piece of legislation that has higher priority. I do not know of another piece of legislation that deserves the attention of the Senate more than this one. 
Every day we fail to act on basic patient protections, the list of families who suffer continues to grow. We have fewer than 10 weeks remaining before the end of the session. We have yet to spend 1 day talking about the Patients' Bill of Rights, debating patient protections, and dealing with this issue in a comprehensive way. My hope is that we can work through this amendment and come up with a way in which to address this issue on this bill. 
I also would like very much to be able to schedule debate and a vote on this legislation. To date, we have not been able to do that. So I offer this amendment in good faith and hope that we can finally come to closure on what I consider to be the single most important piece of health legislation facing the Congress and our country today. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to salute Lisa Kaufman of Freeman, South Dakota--an outstanding young woman who has been honored as South Dakota's first place winner in the eleventh annual National Peace Essay Contest sponsored by the United States Institute of Peace. More than 5,000 students in the 50 states participated in this year's contest. Students wrote about the way in which war crimes and human rights violations are accounted for in various international conflicts. 
Ms. Kaufman was chosen to represent South Dakota in a special program for state-level winners here in Washington this past week, where she participated in a three-day simulation of high-level discussions with the goal of finding the best way to address war crimes and human rights violations to ensure a stable peace in Cambodia. She has received a college scholarship to reward her achievement. 
I also commend Ms. Vernetta Waltner, the faculty coordinator for the contest at the Freeman Academy, for her involvement and for encouraging participation in this type of program.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today, Democrats are offering identical bills in the House and the Senate--the `Retirement Accessibility, Security and Portability Act of 1998'--to make the prospect of retirement less frightening for millions of American workers. Right now, just under half of all American workers have pension plans, and the number is far worse for women and low- and moderate-income workers. 
Our plan would increase the number of Americans with pensions by making it easier and cheaper for small businesses to set up pension funds. It would create a new system to help workers who have no pension coverage to build their own retirement savings through direct contributions from their paychecks into an IRA. 
Our plan would make it easier for workers to take their pensions with them from one job to the next. This is incredibly important in an economy where the average worker will change careers an average of 7 times. 
Our plan would increase pension security to ensure retirees will actually have a pension when they leave the work force. And, it would help close the huge pension gap that now exists between men and women and that leaves far too many older women who are widowed or divorced living in near-poverty. 
Mr. President, I talk frequently to people all the time who are worried they won't be able to afford the `luxury' of retirement. I say, we can't afford the luxury of ignoring the coming retirement crisis. Retirement shouldn't mean an economic freefall. And it doesn't have to. 
The first of the baby boomers turns 50 this year. We still have time to make the changes that will allow us to enjoy a secure retirement. But it will take change from individuals, employers and from the government. 
That's what this bill provides. 
This bill would expand pension coverage and access to more Americans by establishing an easy-to-administer defined benefit plan option for small businesses known as the SMART Plan; providing a maximum credit of $1,000 to help small business cover the cost of setting up new pension plans; and modifying new rules for the `SIMPLE' and 401(k) plans to encourage the provision of pensions to low-to-moderate income employees. 
This bill would encourage pension portability by requiring faster vesting of employers' matching contributions under defined contribution plans, including 401(k) plans, so that employees would have rights to the contributions after the least 3 
years of employment; allowing rollovers between 401(k) and similar plans set up by non-profit organizations, including 403(b) plans; and allowing participants in plans set up by state and local governments to roll over their account balances to IRAs. 
This bill would protect and strengthen pensions by establishing greater safeguards to prevent corporations from raiding their employees' pension plans; creating stricter requirements for audits of plan assets and how companies are investing these assets; prohibiting employers from making credit card loans against pension assets; and providing pension plan participants with regular and informative benefit statements so they can monitor the activity and value of their pension assets. 
In addition, this bill would reduce the wide gap in pension coverage between men and women, as well as provide greater protections for older women by creating new safeguards to ensure that pension benefits are not overlooked when a couple divides assets upon divorce; a new option for federal workers to provide a greater benefit for women who outlive their husbands; protections for low-income women against the loss of their Social Security benefits; a new women's pension information hotline; and a requirement that additional hours taken under the Family and Medical leave Act are credited to one's pension plan for purposes of participation and vesting in their plan benefits. 
In 1994, President Clinton signed a bill protecting the pensions of more than 40 million American workers and retirees against risky investments and corporate raids. In 1996, he signed additional legislation cutting red tape and start-up costs for pension plans, so more small businesses could create retirement plans for their workers. 
Before 1998 is over, we intend to give the President another retirement security bill to sign. 
This Congress has done precious little so far to address the concerns of America's working families. passing this bill--increasing Americans' retirement security--would do a lot to fill that void. We urge our Republican colleagues to join us in passing it.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today as a cosponsor of the amendment before us. This amendment would further reduce the Secretary of Defense's ability to close and realign bases without the consent of Congress. The amendment also expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should not authorize additional rounds of base closure until we have ceased operations at bases already marked for closure. 
I have listened carefully to the arguments of those opposed to this amendment. In the immortal words of that great pop philosopher Yogi Berra, it feels like deja vu all over again. If memory serves me correctly, on this very bill last year, many of these same Senators used many of the same arguments we are hearing today. After listening to last year's debate, the Senate overwhelmingly rejected their arguments. Little has changed in the intervening period. I believe the Senate should follow the same course this year. 
Since 1988, Congress has authorized four rounds of base closure. As a result of these authorizations, operations will be ended at 97 major military installations in this country--nearly 20 percent of all U.S. bases. In addition, activities will be curtailed at hundreds of other military bases around the country. These closures and consolidations will take until 2001 to complete. As they did last year, opponents of this amendment argue that we have not done enough. They argue that we need to close more bases. They assert that previous rounds of base closure have produced billions in savings and that future rounds will do the same. And they again rely upon incomplete and questionable data from the Pentagon to back them up. 
Last year, I joined with Senator Lott, the distinguished Majority Leader, and Senator Dorgan in pointing to base closure studies by the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office that raised significant doubts about the Pentagon's data. After listening to our arguments, the Senate, by a vote of 66 to 33, adopted language offered by the Republican leader and myself requiring the Defense Department to submit a comprehensive report on base closure and to have GAO and CBO review this report. 
The Pentagon recently issued its four-volume report on base realignment and closure. Unfortunately, this report appears to be as short on new information as it is long in word count. Despite the fact that the report runs nearly 2000 pages, it fails to provide some of the basic information required under the legislation adopted by Congress last year. Moreover, since the Department chose to release its report just a short time ago, GAO and CBO have been unable to complete their review prior to the Senate's consideration of this amendment. 
Nonetheless, these organizations have already provided us with a considerable amount of information about the Pentagon's data on excess capacity and base closure savings. First, let me briefly address the Defense Department's assertion that significant excess capacity remains. As the Cold War was winding down in the late-1980s, the Defense Department properly decided to reexamine our military strategy and force requirements. The Pentagon conducted a rigorous analysis called the Bottom-Up Review. This review spelled out the numbers and types of military forces this Nation would need to meet the security challenges of the 1990s and beyond. In order to minimize disruptions, this review set precise future targets on such force components as military personnel for each service, combat ships, and fighting aircraft. 
Unfortunately, the Defense Department has never seen fit to produce a similar master plan on military bases. Despite the fact that the Pentagon has stated since the late 1980s the approximate number and types of forces it will need well into the next decade, it has never chosen to specify the number and types of bases necessary to house this force. Instead, DoD continues to make the case for base closures using questionable calculations of excess capacity. We made this point last year, and it remains valid today. According to a May 1, 1998 letter from GAO, `precise measures of excess capacity are often lacking, and we have noted that DoD needs a strategic plan to guide the downsizing of its infrastructure.' 
As for savings from base closures, both GAO and CBO have issued reports that call into question the reliability of the Pentagon data offered up by the proponents of this amendment. According to GAO's most definitive base closure report, `the exact amount of actual savings realized from [base closings] is uncertain.' GAO goes on to say that the Defense Department's cost and savings estimates were, `not of budget quality and rigor.' CBO stated, `[it] is unable to confirm or assess DoD's estimates of cost and savings because the Department is unable to report actual spending and savings for [base closure] actions.' In other words, both GAO and CBO have raised significant questions about the accuracy of the Pentagon's accounting system for base closures. 
Mr. President, this is an extremely important issue. The outcome of this debate will have important consequences for both our national security and the scores of communities across this country that host military facilities. I remain concerned about the impact that additional base closures could have on our national defense. Once the Pentagon closes a major military installation, that facility is gone forever. The Defense Department cannot simply reopen the doors to a military base it has closed should a new military threat arise. 
This debate will also have a major impact on our communities. Ellsworth Air Force Base in my home state is an excellent example. This facility and the people who run it have served this Nation well for 50 years. Given the far-reaching ramifications of closing additional bases, it is critical that Congress make informed decisions when deciding on the future of key facilities like Ellsworth and many others across this country. Despite the best efforts of myself and the Majority Leader in last year's Defense Authorization bill to gain the necessary knowledge, numerous important questions remain unanswered. 
In addition to firming up the cost data, the Pentagon must provide the Congress with rigorous analysis that spells out the number and types of bases it will need for the base force. Once the Pentagon has done its homework, it will be appropriate for Congress to consider taking action. I look forward to working constructively with the Department of Defense in the months and years ahead on the relationship between our national security and our base structure. Once the Pentagon has its own house in order, I am prepared to revisit this issue. Unfortunately, that time has not yet come. Therefore, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wish to join the majority leader in this tribute this evening and in cosponsoring the amendment to name the 1999 defense authorization bill after the distinguished chairman. 
Senator Thurmond joined the Armed Services Committee in January 1959, during the 86th Congress. He has served continuously for 40 years on the committee since then, a truly remarkable achievement. 
When Senator Thurmond joined the committee, its membership, included a number of Senators who would go on to greatness, and whose names would become synonymous with a strong national defense: Richard Russell, John Stennis, Henry Jackson, to name a few. 
Over the past 40 years, Senator Thurmond's name has become synonymous with a strong national defense. 
A lot has certainly changed over the 40 years that our chairman has been on that committee. 
One of the first bills the committee addressed in 1959 was a bill to extend the draft. Today, of course, we rely on volunteers--both men and women--to man the force. 
When Senator Thurmond joined the committee, the cold war was raging, and the flash points of the Cuban missile crisis was just a few years away. Today, of course, with the collapse of the Soviet empire, the cold war is largely a matter for the history books, and the military is repositioning itself to meet the challenges of the next century. 
During Senator Thurmond's tenure on the Armed Services Committee, our Nation's military has responded to the challenges of every sort in every corner of the globe: Western Europe, Vietnam, Middle East, the Caribbean basin, the Persian Gulf, and today in Central Europe. 
His steadfast commitment to national defense, and to the men and women in uniform, has been instrumental in ensuring that our military has always been ready to answer the call whenever and wherever needed. 
From the day he was first commissioned as a Reserve second lieutenant in 1924 until today where he serves as the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, Strom Thurmond has dedicated his life to national service and America's military. 
I don't know of a more fitting tribute or a more fitting way with which to say thank you to this leader, to this patriot than to name the defense authorization bill after him tonight. 
On behalf of all of our colleagues, I congratulate our chairman, Strom Thurmond.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we are in the midst of a disturbing slowdown in the confirmation of judicial nominations, especially when the nominees are women or minorities. A few days ago, on June 22, the Senate finally confirmed, by a vote of 56 to 34, Susan Oki Mollway, a Japanese-American nominated by President Clinton almost 3 years ago to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii. 
Ms. Mollway was first nominated in the 104th Congress and was renominated again in the 105th Congress. She was favorably reported out of the Judiciary Committee, not once but twice. It took 3 years for Republicans to bring her nomination to the Senate floor despite the fact that a judicial emergency was declared in her district. 
I am particularly concerned about the lack of progress in the consideration of Hispanic judicial nominees before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Of the 36 judges confirmed in 1997, none were Latino, although six Latinos had been nominated. Thus far in 1998, 2 of the 26 judges confirmed were Latino and five are currently awaiting confirmation. It took the Senate 32 months to confirm Ms. Hilda Tagle, the only Hispanic woman the Senate confirmed this year. Why are the nominations of these qualified individuals taking so long? These nominees and the American people deserve an explanation. 
The nominations of Emilio Cividanes, Richard Paez, Jorge Rangel, Annabelle Rodriguez, and Sonia Sotomayor have been pending before the Senate for months. Two of these 5 nominees had to be renominated this Congress because their nominations expired in the 104th Congress without Senate action. 
Sonia Sotomayor, a nominee for Second Circuit Court of Appeals, was reported out of committee on March 5, 1998. Nominee Richard Paez for the Ninth Circuit was reported out of committee on March 19, 1998. No Senate action has been taken or scheduled on either nominee, and no explanation of the delay has been forthcoming. My colleague, Xavier Becerra, Chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said it best when he stated, `This is a crisis. . . . Only two Latino judges have been confirmed this Congress out of a total of 62 confirmations.' 
The Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Patrick Leahy, has come to the floor 3 times in the past month to demand Senate Republican action. He pointed out that `We are having hearings at the rate of one a month, barely keeping up with attrition and hardly making a dent in the vacancies crisis . . . confronting the judiciary.' 
The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, William Rehnquist, calls that `vacancy crisis' a `most serious problem.' He warns that `vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.' 
We cannot wait for the judicial system to collapse before the Senate acts. I call upon Senate Republicans to reject partisan politics and significantly accelerate the pace of scheduled judicial confirmations before the Senate adjourns in October.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know that everyone is expecting a vote shortly, and the distinguished Senator from Virginia has noted that he will be making a motion to table in just a moment. But I want to take a couple of minutes simply to applaud the two previous speakers. 
Let me thank the distinguished Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Massachusetts both for their eloquence and their passion with which they articulated their views. Clearly these issues deserve a lot more attention and consideration and careful thought than what they have been given so far. 
We have heard a couple of speeches; that is it. As the Senator from Michigan has noted, these deserve an opportunity to be heard and thoughtfully considered in ways that ought to include committee consideration, ought to include other amendments, ought to include other countries. And that, in essence, is what argument the Senator from Michigan made, I think, with a great deal of authenticity and authority this morning. 
Then the issue of timing. Mr. President, if there was ever a question about what it was these amendments were truly designed to do, it is simply, as the Senator from Massachusetts noted, designed to embarrass the President of the United States on the eve of his trip. 
That is what this is about. And I hope Republicans and Democrats understand, what comes around goes around. And I hope everyone understands that, in the past moments of equal import, this isn't what the Senate did, this isn't the way the Senate operated; on a bipartisan basis, we would send the head of state off to another country with a clear understanding that we would stop at the water's edge when it came to sending the wrong message, that we would send President Bush to another country with the realization that we were behind him, that we would send President Reagan to Reykjavik with a clear understanding that he had very big issues he had to deal with and we were going to protect his right to stand united for this country in negotiations as important as they were. 
Time after time, in situation after situation, we put politics aside. We knew what we had to do. We knew there was a time for politics, there was a time for issues, and there was a time to pull together as Americans, saying, look, we don't support you, Mr. President, on virtually anything, but when it comes to this, what could be more important? 
Well, there are some in this Chamber who have come to the conclusion that that is no longer the way we do business here. We do not care what message we send about the importance of American unity. We do not care whether progress is going to be made on a historic trip of this kind. We do not really care whether or not he comes back with a collective appreciation of new accomplishments having to do with trade and maybe even human rights and shipments abroad and abortion and all of the other issues dealing with human rights. That doesn't matter, because we want to make our points on the Senate floor. 
Mr. President, I hope we take a collective step back. I hope we take a good look at what message this sends. And I will tell all of my colleagues, I see this as a procedural vote. I am not going to vote to table, because I am not going to allow one single vote on China this week. And if we are going to play this game, we are not going to have any votes on defense either. I am going to be voting against cloture, because I don't want to see any votes on defense, any votes on China, any votes that are as reckless as they would be cast were we to have votes this afternoon or on any other issue regarding China or other matters pertaining to defense. 
So it is over. We might as well pull this bill. We are not going to have those votes. We are not going to embarrass this President. We are going to stick to procedural votes, and we will let everybody make their own decision. But we are not going to have votes on substance when it comes to issues of this import. 
So, Mr. President, that is my position. I hope my 
colleagues will subscribe to it. I hope that we can come back to our senses and do the right thing, come together in a bipartisan way and send the right message. We are not doing that right now. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I want to say a couple of words about this nomination. I am very pleased that Susan Mollway's nomination has finally reached the Senate floor. As others have noted, it is a long, long time in coming. I am told that it has taken 2 1/2 years. But today she is finally going to get a vote, and I am confident that she will be confirmed. 
I think it is quite an impressive story. Susan Mollway, first nominated for the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii in December of 1995, was reported favorably by the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 25 of 1996. Nothing happened, of course, with that nomination, and she was renominated again on January 7 of 1997 and again reported out favorably by the Judiciary Committee. 
She must be the most patient woman in the world. For all this time, with all this uncertainty, with all of the implications professionally, it has been a long wait, not only for her, but for Hawaii. 
The seat which Ms. Mollway has been nominated to has been vacant now for 3 years, since April of 1995. Were it not for the extraordinary persistence of our colleagues from Hawaii, the senior Senator, Daniel Inouye, and the junior Senator, Daniel Akaka, we would not be here this afternoon. It is only their persistence and the extraordinary credibility and, frankly, persistence that they have demonstrated for all this time that we are now celebrating this moment. 
Their persistence is well invested. Susan Mollway is fully qualified and will be an extraordinary credit to the bench. She is a partner in the Honolulu law firm of Cades, Schutte, Fleming and Wright where she went upon graduation from Harvard Law School. 
She has practiced in a broad range of areas, including a successful argument before the U.S. Supreme Court. She has won numerous awards, including the Hawaii Women Lawyers' Outstanding Woman Lawyer Award in 1987. 
The granddaughter of a `picture bride' and a plantation worker in Hawaii, Ms. Mollway and her family have learned strength and commitment from their story. Her father left high school during World War II to join a Japanese-American unit of the U.S. Army. Together with Senator Inouye, he fought in Europe as part of the 442nd Regiment Combat Team, the most decorated military unit of its size in World War II. At the same time, people he knew were among the thousands of Japanese-Americans interned by our own Federal Government. Later, Ms. Mollway's father used his veteran's benefits to attend Harvard. Clearly, his daughter now understands the great joy and honor of being an American, but also the burdens and barriers faced by some in our society. 
We are all proud of the distance we have come as a society in ending the kind of discrimination faced by Japanese-Americans of Ms. Mollway's father's generation, but the confirmation of this judge to be now U.S. district judge will mark yet another step in this progress. Susan Mollway is an outstanding nominee and deserves to be confirmed. 
I, again, congratulate my two colleagues from Hawaii, and I call upon all of my colleagues to vote in her favor in 40 minutes. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I won't be long. I will accommodate the manager of the bill. 
Let me just say this is an amendment that reflects where we were yesterday on what we consider to be one of the most important issues facing our country. I am hopeful that we can come back to this legislation again, as we debated it yesterday. The tobacco bill may have died last night, but the tobacco issue is very much alive. 
We have noted that as legislation is presented to the Senate we have no recourse but to continue to press for final consideration, to get a vote, and ultimately to pass legislative changes that will allow us to confront the remarkable problems that we are facing in our country today. In South Dakota, 45 percent of teenagers now are addicted to smoking or are smoking--45 percent. Every day, thousands of children continue to light up for the first time. 
Many of us feel that even though we lost parliamentarily yesterday, that we have no choice but to continue to press this issue, to continue to force the Senate to consider ways with which to resolve this matter. 
As I said, there ought to be principles that unite us, principles that Republicans and Democrats can agree with, principles that would allow the FDA to regulate tobacco as a drug, principles that would allow us to come up with an orchestrated national effort to discourage smoking among teenagers, principles that recognize the importance of research as we continue to confront the myriad of health problems that are directly related to smoking and addiction. Those are principles that ought to unite us. 
I don't think anyone ought to come to any conclusion that somehow because the McCain bill died last night that we now can wash our hands of this issue, that we now are going to move that aside and think that everything is just fine with regard to the schedule or with regard to this particular issue. It isn't. We are not going to be fine until we have come to some conclusion about this. It doesn't really matter what legislation comes before the Senate. We are going to be compelled, either in the 
form of amendment or in a motion to proceed, to force the Senate, to whatever extent we can, to stay focused on this issue until we resolve it. We are open for suggestions on how we might break this impasse, how we might resolve this matter. We are certainly prepared to sit down with our colleagues and come up with a piece of legislation that will work. 
We will not let this issue die. We believe very strongly that it must continue. That is, in essence, what this amendment does. This amendment, for the information of all of my colleagues, simply takes us back to the McCain bill and the managers' amendment. The managers' amendment was added after a great deal of consultation with Members on both sides of the aisle. The managers' amendment and the McCain bill passed, I remind my colleagues, on a vote of 19-1 out of the Commerce Committee. 
So this is an opportunity, once again, to use a vehicle to start the negotiations to allow us to come to closure on this issue. I had hoped we could do it sooner rather than later. This is an important bill. I hope we can get on to energy and water. I hope we can deal with all of the appropriations bills. Those bills have to be dealt with, but at the same time, many of us believe that tobacco has to be dealt with as well. Our effort to deal with it will have to be in the form of amendments or in the form of our motions to proceed so long as we haven't found any closure on how we ultimately resolve this very, very important national issue. 
I hope we can have a good debate on this amendment. I hope we can have some good give-and-take about what we might do, as a Senate, Republicans and Democrats, to break this impasse and ultimately to pass meaningful tobacco legislation this month. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to ask the majority leader two questions. 
First, with regard to the cloture motion, he and I have talked about this matter. The motion itself says: 
We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the committee substitute. . . 
And it is signed, of course, by 16 Senators, including the distinguished majority leader. If, indeed, it is his position that he will vote against the cloture motion, I am curious as to how he can be signing the cloture motion.

Mr. DASCHLE. Well, Mr. President, I just say, I have never heard of it before. I think it is highly unusual, but certainly that is the majority leader's prerogative. I just call attention to this interesting juxtaposition of filing cloture and then voting against it. 
Another question I have relates to the Budget Act point of order. Is it the majority leader's understanding that those who vote not to waive the budget point of order will then be voting against those amendments that the Senate has adopted, including the amendment on marriage penalty and the amendment on drug enforcement; is that the understanding of the majority leader?

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will designate our manager as the manager of our time, Senator Kerry. 
Let me make a couple of brief remarks. Many of our colleagues, obviously, want to speak to this issue. 
First of all, our caucus is united, as we have been throughout this debate, on this very important issue. I hope the American people will see it for what it is. We are not deceived, and they shouldn't be either. This will be an effort, this afternoon, to kill this bill. The gun is on the other side. They will shoot it dead. It will be dead if those votes occur this afternoon as we predict they will vote. That is a tragedy. That is a tragedy. Three thousand kids a day start smoking; 1,000 kids a day die early because they started too early. That is what is at stake. 
I hope it is more than just a coincidence that, a night after we raised $10 million downtown, they raised $10 million downtown. 
We vote today to kill the tobacco bill. I am amazed, really, at the logic of some of our colleagues on the other side. How many colleagues have come to the floor to say we cannot pass this legislation until we include the marriage penalty, until we include the drug amendment, until we include some cap on lawyers' fees. Guess what. We spent the last 4 weeks doing just that: We passed a marriage penalty; we passed a drug enforcement amendment; we passed, now, some limit on legal fees. I will guarantee that virtually every one of our colleagues on the other side, in spite of that, having voted for it, will vote to kill this bill. 
It is amazing to me that I have heard even our majority leader say we can't pass this legislation until we address the marriage penalty, that we can't address this bill completely until we have done the drug issue. We have done those, and now we are being told it is too heavy, we can't pass it. 
The majority leader just said, `I can't think of a way to bring this to closure.' I can. If the Democrats were in the majority, we would bring this bill to closure, because I would vote for cloture. I would vote for cloture this afternoon, and every one of our Democratic colleagues would vote for it as well. We would bring an end to this bill. There is no mystery to it. You get 60 votes. We have more than 40 on this side. All we need is a fraction of the caucus on that side and we would bring this vote to closure. There is no mystery here. 
Let me say, as my colleagues have noted, this is not over. This bill may be dead, but tobacco legislation is not dead. We will continue to come back. I will tell my colleagues right now, we will not let this issue die. We will continue to come back. There are, as the Senator from California noted, some principles that ought to unite us as Republicans and Democrats. We ought to be united on stopping kids from smoking. We will continue to pursue other methods, other ways, other legislation, but we will keep at it. 
So I hope we can agree on principles. I hope we will all agree that even though that bill may die today, the issue does not die. The issue will continue to live until we are victorious. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. I yield myself a couple of minutes, and then yield the remainder of the time to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. President, let there be no misunderstanding what it is we are doing here. This is one more effort to kill this bill. If it wasn't dead the first time, they are going to try to ensure that on the second shot it dies. That is what this is about. 
I think it would be much better if we just voted it up or down, yes or no. Instead, some of our colleagues on the other side are hiding in the rocks. They want to shoot and kill that bill so nobody knows who it was who killed it. 
Well, this will kill it pure and simple, and it is a cynical approach to killing it, because it is an amazing demonstration, in my view, of political juxtaposition here that the very Senators who will vote to kill it by not supporting the waiver on the point of order are the very Senators who offered the amendments on taxes and on drugs and on the other amendments that brought us to this point. The very Senators who said we have to have a tax bill, we have to have a drug bill, we have to have all these other amendments added before we can support this legislation are now going to vote not to waive the point of order to bring the bill down. 
So I hope there is no misunderstanding about what is at stake here. We are going to kill this bill tonight. I should say they are going to kill this bill tonight. But they are going to try to use this ruse of saying, now that we have loaded it up, it is too heavy; now that we have loaded it up, we can't afford to carry it further. 
Mr. President, that is a disappointment. The fact remains that this bill dies tonight, but the issue will live. And some day in the not too distant future, we will pass tobacco legislation that will rectify what we are doing tonight. This is wrong. I hope nobody misunderstands what this vote is about. They killed the bill tonight by voting not to waive this point of order. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished majority leader in introducing this bill to promote the reuse and recycling of scrap materials. There is broad agreement that more should be done to establish a climate in which businesses are encouraged to recycle scrap materials in an environmentally sound manner. We should make every effort to expand the responsible and beneficial use and reuse of this waste as soon as possible. 
While I remain hopeful that bipartisan negotiators will be able to work out differences on broad-based Superfund reform, it appears unlikely that Congress will achieve that goal this year. That is particularly unfortunate, because there are many elements of Superfund reform for which there is agreement and for which we should move forward as expeditiously as possible, including establishing greater incentives for brownfields redevelopment, and providing liability relief to deserving municipalities and small businesses. 
There are a number of important Superfund issues on which there continues to be significant disagreement. Despite the fact that resolution of these issues is unlikely in the near-term, we should not allow ourselves to adjourn this year without making a strong effort to enact those reforms on which there is broad agreement. 
Therefore, I am very pleased that Senator Lott has taken the initiative to move forward with this important element of Superfund reform. With enactment of this legislation, we will foster additional scrap recycling in America, thereby reducing the stream of waste materials now sent to landfills and other solid waste management facilities. By doing so, we will help to eliminate the fears of many businesses of potential Superfund liabilities even if they pursue legitimate means to recycle scrap materials. By clarifying the liability rules for recycling transactions under Superfund, this legislation will place recyclers on a more even playing field compared with those who produce goods using virgin materials. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this timely legislation with Senator Lott. This is an important step in providing meaningful reform and clarification to the Superfund law and I encourage all my colleagues to support this effort to promote scrap recycling as soon as possible.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to express my support and admiration of small business owners and entrepreneurs as we reflect on another successful National Small Business Week. It is appropriate that we recognize the contributions and achievements entrepreneurs have made to strengthen our communities and our national economy. 
Small businesses account for 99.7% all the employers in the country and employ 53.7 percent of the private work force. Senate Democrats have demonstrated their support of small business by advocating increased funding for the reauthorization of the Small Business Administration, supporting targeted tax relief, ensuring responsible regulatory relief, and increasing procurement opportunities for small businesses. 
Small businesses are changing the face of the economy by creating jobs and bringing prosperity to small towns and cities across the country. One such small business is the Roundup Building Center, owned by Doug and Julie Kapsch in Belle Fourche, South Dakota. As part of National Small Business week, Doug and Julie have been awarded special recognition from the Small Business Administration as the South Dakota Small Business Owners of the Year. 
Doug and Julie became business owners under a rather unique set of circumstances. In 1990, a fire destroyed much of the Belle Fourche Building Center, which Doug managed at the time. Faced with adversity, Doug and Julie saw an opportunity. After the fire, Doug contacted the former owner of the Belle Fourche Building Center, and the Kapschs began building their business. Today, Doug and Julie's business, the Roundup Building Center, serves the tri-state area of South Dakota, Wyoming and Montana by providing local contractors and do-it-yourself builders with a variety of building supplies. The business has grown by approximately 10 percent a year under Doug and Julie's management. 
As successful small business owners, Doug and Julie have shown that hard work, initiative, and a bit of risk-taking can produce big dividends. I congratulate them on their success and wish them many more profitable years of business. 
I would also like to commend another woman who has made significant contributions to South Dakota's small business community. Sandra Christenson, President of Heartland Paper Council, has been appointed by the Small Business Administrator to serve on the National Women's Business Council. The Council advises the President and the Administrator on small business issues especially important to women. 
After serving as President of Triangle School Service in Sioux Falls, Sandra was named President of Heartland Paper Company in 1989. In this capacity, she oversees 170 employees and the company's seven thousand customers. Heartland Paper has been a vibrant member of the Sioux Falls business community under Sandra's leadership, and I am confident that with her leadership and experience, Sandra is uniquely qualified to represent the views of women business leaders and rural America before the Council. 
Small businesses are vitally important to South Dakota's economy, and I truly appreciate the contributions that Sandra, Doug and Julie have made to our state's small business community. They join countless other small business owners across the country who have helped make America's vibrant economy the envy of the world.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to say farewell to a wonderful group of young men and women who have served as Senate pages over the last five months, and thank them for the contributions they make to the day-to-day operations of the Senate. 
This particular group of pages has served with distinction and has done a marvelous job of balancing their responsibilities to their studies and to this body. 
Page life is not easy. I suspect few people understand the rigorous nature of the page's work. On a typical day, pages rise early and are in school by 6:15 a.m. After several hours in school each morning, pages then report to the Capitol to prepare the Senate Chamber for the day's session. 
Throughout the day, pages are called upon to perform a wide array of tasks--from obtaining copies of documents and reports for Senators to use during debate, to running errands between the Capitol and the Senate office buildings, to lending a hand at our weekly conference luncheons. 
Once we finish our business here for the day--no matter what time--the pages return to the dorm to prepare for the next day's classes and Senate session and, we hope, get some much-needed sleep. 
Even with all of this, they continually discharge their tasks efficiently and cheerfully. 
This page class had the good fortune to be present on the Senate floor for several landmark votes, including NATO expansion and IRS reform. 
I hope before they leave they will see us pass a comprehensive national bill to reduce teen smoking. 
It seems to me that would be a fitting way to thank these particular young people for their service to their country. 
I hope every person in this page class gained some insight into the need for individuals to become involved in community and civic activities. 
The future of our nation strongly depends on the generations who will follow us in this august body. 
I look forward to the possibility that one or more of this fine group of young people will return as a Member of the U.S. Senate. 
Mr. President, I would like to read into the Record the names and hometowns of each of the Senate pages to whom we are saying goodbye today. 
They are: Philip Amylon, North Scituate, RI; Sarah Argue, Little Rock, AR; Marisa Boling, LaCrosse, WI; Sara Cannon, Seaford, DE; Colin Davis, Sioux Falls, SD; Laney Fitzgerald, Montgomery, AL; Sarah Flynn, Nashua, NH; Sarah Fowler, Kansas City, MO; Julia Le, Wilbraham, MA; Bari Lurie, Milwaukee, WI; Monique Luse, Farmington Hills, MI; Shana Marshall, Scottsburg, IN; Josh Melgaard, Pierre, SD; Sina Nazemi, Woodinville, WA; Georgia Sheridan, Santa Fe, NM; Michael Stahler, Lyndonville, VT; Angela Swanson, Springville, UT; Dan Teague, Concord, NH; Amanda Anderson, SC; Ashley Anderson, SC; Hunter Holmes, SC; Erin Lindsay, SC; Jennifer Lowry, UT; Stacie Seigler, SC; Tamarah Siegel, RI; and Bradley Wolters, WI.  
I am sure all of my colleagues--I know all of my colleagues join me in thanking these fine young men and women and wish them well as they proceed to a new phase of their life. We thank them for their services. We thank them for being who they are. We thank them for being so good at what they were to us over the last several months. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to explain this particular amendment because I believe it is very important that everyone understand the juxtaposition of the Democratic amendment and the so-called Gramm amendment. 
A vote for the Gramm amendment was a vote either to take about $120 billion of budget surpluses away from our effort to shore up Social Security or to drain 80 percent of the money out of the tobacco trust fund, money that would otherwise be going to States' antismoking efforts, medical research and farmers. That is the choice presented by the Gramm amendment from 2008 through 2022. 
That was the problem we had with the Gramm amendment. In the out years, after 2008, it either took so much money out of Social Security and out of the surplus, or it took 80 percent of the tobacco money. We were not satisfied with this choice. We were not supportive of, first, the overall amount of money to be taken, and, secondly, the pots from which it was to be taken. 
That is only the first problem--where the money to fund the tax cut would be drawn from in the out years. The second problem is that, in the first ten years, the revised amendment costs 50 percent more than the Democratic alternative; that is, $46 billion versus about $31 billion. But, here is the catch: it actually delivers far less marriage penalty tax relief. So while it costs more, it does far less with regard to the marriage penalty itself. The reason for that is about 60 percent of the Republican tax cut goes to couples who have a marriage bonus in the sense that they pay less if they are married than if they filed single returns. 
Keep in mind that today about 52 percent of those who are married get a marriage bonus. There is actually an incentive built into the Tax Code to be married. The other 48 percent incur a marriage penalty. Sixty percent of the Gramm amendment goes to those who have a marriage bonus. So, in addition to the current marriage bonus, they will get a Gramm bonus. In our view, given the fact that this additional bonus costs so much and comes from either Social Security or tobacco, the additional Gramm bonus does not make a lot of sense. 
The Democratic alternative, by contrast, focuses about 90 percent of its tax cut on families who are actually penalized by providing a 20% deduction against the income of the lesser-earning spouse, phased out between $50,000 and $60,000 of family income. If the Republicans were genuinely interested in the marriage penalty relief problem as Senator Gramm and others have proclaimed, they would vote for the Democratic amendment. It would provide a bigger cut in the marriage penalty for most couples than the Gramm amendment over the next 10 years. 
Let me give a couple of examples. A couple making $35,000, with income split $20,000 and $15,000 between the two spouses, would see the following circumstances if this amendment were to pass. In the year 2002, under Gramm the couple would receive an average additional income of about $1,000. By comparison, under our 20-percent second earner deduction alternative, the couple would receive an additional reduction of $3,000, that is, 20 percent of $15,000. 
Mr. President, that represents about three times as large a tax deduction and would provide nearly three times as much tax relief--three times more tax relief under the Democratic amendment than under the so-called Gramm amendment. Next, take a couple making $50,000, split $25,000 and $25,000 between the two spouses. Again, under the Gramm amendment the couple would receive an average additional deduction of about $1,000 in 2002. By contrast, our amendment would provide an extra $5,000 deduction, representing five times the amount of relief as under the Gramm amendment. 
So because we target our benefit to those who are actually penalized by the penalty rather than spread it across those who now enjoy a tax bonus for being married, we are able to deal with the penalty in a far more consequential way over the next ten years. 
To recap, the Gramm amendment costs 50 percent more over the first 10 years than the Democratic alternative and gives far less marriage penalty relief during this period. It makes more sense to redirect the additional $15 billion that Senator Gramm spends on bigger marriage bonuses to the original purposes of this bill--to public health, to research, to state programs, and to farmers. 
That in essence is the difference between our two approaches. Let's spend and invest those resources on the things that this bill is designed to do. Let's do as Senator Gramm suggests, focus on the problem he has described, that is, the marriage penalty, and try to deal with it as effectively as we can. By following that counsel, by taking that approach, we should pass the Democratic amendment, we should ultimately accept this compromise and the balance that it reflects, a balance between investments in public health and tax reductions. This is a prudent balance that recognizes the importance of this tobacco legislation as it was originally intended. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 35 years ago, President Kennedy took the bold first step to secure equal pay for women. Although there has been much progress since 1963, women continue to earn less than men. That is why we mut take action to improve and strengthen President Kennedy's landmark law and ensure that America's working women and families are paid the wages they deserve. 
In 1963, President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act prohibiting employers from paying women less than men for the same job. Knowing that the legislation was merely a first step in the right direction, President Kennedy noted that `much remains to be done to achieve full equality of economic opportunity.' 
While the Equal Pay Act prohibited discrimination against women in terms of wages, substantial pay disparities continue to exist. Women still earn, on average, only 74 cents to a man's dollar. 
That's why fair pay continues to be a major issue for American women and working families. In fact, the dramatic increase in the number of women in the work force and the number of families who depend on women's earnings make fair pay a matter of justice and necessity now more than ever. My state of South Dakota has the highest percentage in the nation of working mothers with children under the age of 6. These families need and deserve both parents to be paid fairly for an honest day's work. Now is the time to take another step toward fair pay and equal treatment for all people. 
Last year, I introduced the Paycheck Fairness Act to address the glaring inequities between men's and women's earnings. The bill seeks to eliminate the wage gap by beefing up enforcement of the Equal Pay Act, increasing penalties for pay discrimination, and lifting the gag rule imposed by many employees who forbid employees from discussing their wages with their co-workers. The bill would also ensure that employers who make real strides in establishing fair and equal workplaces would be recognized and celebrated. 
As we commemorate the 35th anniversary of the passage of the Equal Pay Act, I join my colleagues, the President, and the Vice President in calling on Congress to schedule a vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act, and renew our efforts to advance the principles of equal pay for equal work. Through the Paycheck Fairness Act, Democrats honor and continue President Kennedy's legacy of equality for a better workplace economy, and country.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have been concerned over the last few days to hear growing attacks against the so-called e-rate--the program Congress created just 2 years ago to help schools, libraries and hospitals connect to the information superhighway. 
I am concerned because of the timing of these attacks. Only last month, the Senate approved a bill increasing immigration quotas for highly skilled workers from other countries. Why? Because there are not enough American workers with the technological skills to meet the needs of our economy. If that is not an acknowledgment that we need to do a better job of teaching technological skills in this country, frankly, I don't know what is. I supported raising the quotas for skilled workers, but that was a one-shot emergency response to a crisis. 
By the year 2000, 60 percent of all jobs in our country will require technological skills that only a fraction of Americans now have. In the longrun, the only way we can keep America's economy growing is by giving our own workers the skills to compete and win in a high-skills economy. That is why the sudden course of criticism of the e-rate is so alarming. 
Today, only 27 percent of the classrooms in America are connected to the Internet. In poor communities, rural and urban, only 14 percent of classrooms are linked to the Internet. If we don't take the opportunity now to address this problem, we simply will not have enough skilled workers to retain America's position as the world's strongest economy. We will also consign our children to two very different futures, separate and unequal. 
It seems like every week we hear more and more talk about the year 2000 problem. What about the `year 2010 problem'? 
That is when--if we do nothing--children who are in kindergarten now will be graduating from high school without the technological skills they need to get a decent job or get a good college education. We simply can't allow that to happen. We can't do that to our economy, and we can't do that to our kids. 
Congress understood that two years ago. That's why we created, on a strong bipartisan basis, the e-rate program as part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 
The e-rate program gives crucial discounts to schools and libraries to establish or upgrade Internet connections. The steepest discounts going to the neediest communities. All commercially available telecommunications services are eligible for discounts. 
Across the country, 30,000 schools and libraries have already applied for help from the e-rate program to establish or upgrade Internet connections. 
In my own state of South Dakota, 280 schools have already applied. 
Educational technology is critical in rural states like ours, Mr. President. Through teleconferencing and other kinds of long-distance learning, students in South Dakota can take all kinds of classes they never would have had the chance to take. 
If we pull the plug on the e-rate, we will slam the doors to countless educational opportunities--not just in South Dakota, but all across America. 
The United States is the most prosperous nation on earth. We are currently enjoying incredible economic growth. It is a travesty to say we can't afford to give our children access to the tools they need to share in this economic miracle. 
Yet, if we kill the e-rate program--as some would clearly like--that is exactly what we will be saying to children in poor rural and urban communities. 
How have we reached this sad state? 
In a nutshell, some telecommunications companies are not playing straight with the American public. They are trying to use schoolchildren as an excuse for costs they themselves choose to pass on to consumers. 
Mr. President, the big long-distance companies have reaped a $3 billion windfall in the last 18 months. 
That is $3 billion! 
That's how much long-distance carriers saved in reduced access charges they paid to local telephone companies in the past year and a half. Because of the direct actions of the FCC, these companies have received more than enough money to pay for the entire e-rate program. 
Over that same period, they have been asked to collect only $625 million for the e-rate. 
But the long-distance carriers want to retain the $3 billion in savings and insist consumers should pay for connections for schools and libraries. 
They would have us believe that the e-rate is driving up the cost of long-distance phone service. 
They say they intend to add a new line-item to their customers' bills telling them just that. 
The strategy is clear: Opponents know they can't attack the e-rate on its merits--because Americans care deeply about their children's education. 
So they call the e-rate a new tax--and hope people get so mad about another tax that they demand an end to it. 
The problem with their rhetoric is: it's not true. 
The FCC is not requiring long-distance phone carriers to line-item the costs of the e-rate program on to their customers. The carriers made that decision themselves. 
In addition, only a small part of the amount the carriers want to include in that line item actually goes to schools and libraries. 
Most of it is used to provide phone service to rural America and other hard-to-reach customers. This is not a new responsibility. Phone companies have had that legal obligation for 60 years. It's called `universal service.' 
In 1996, Congress expanded universal service to include schools and libraries. We should keep our word--and keep the e-rate program. 
That's why I have asked the Chairman of the FCC, Bill Kennard, to require strong truth-in-billing standards for long-distance companies. Those that choose to place line-item charges on their phone bills should also tell their customers about savings they have reaped from reduced access charges. We should not allow these companies to mislead their customers by charging for certain costs without disclosing savings they gain from other governmental actions. 
This issue has sparked an important debate in Congress and the FCC about the future of universal service. The FCC's top priority must now be to secure the long-term viability of the high-cost fund as well as the e-rate. 
Learning how to use the basic tools of modern communications is not a luxury for our children. It's not a frill. It is a necessity. 
The e-rate was created with strong bipartisan support. It deserves our continued bipartisan support. And I hope it will receive it. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think the senior Senator from Massachusetts makes a very important point in his question. I believe that not only people all over the country made that assumption but many of us in the Senate did as well, as we contemplated our vote on that bill. That was not an easy vote, as I know the Senator from Massachusetts remembers. That was a very, very difficult vote. I ultimately decided that, on balance, this bill merited my support. I give great credit to many Senators who put a lot more time in bringing that product to the Senate than I did. But I voted for it in part because of the assumptions that we made about the opportunities and services it would provide to people across this country, especially in improving education and information in schools, libraries and rural health care centers. 
So the Senator is right. We made some promises. We made some commitments. We also made a deal that said as a result of all of this, the long distance carriers would ensure proper collections for the schools and libraries program. They knew they were going to see some reduced costs. Indeed, according to figures I have been provided, $3 billion in reduced access charges has already been achieved. Now all we have done so far with regard to the e-rate is collect about $625 million, a fraction of that $3 billion. Some of these companies have now indicated that they are fighting a small increase, the amount that, as the Senator says, has been assumed would be available for the schools and libraries across this country to improve the technological skills of every child in our schools. 
I hope they will come forth with an explanation. If they are going to put in this new line item indicating the e-rate cost to people across this country, why aren't they going to show equally the $3 billion in reduced costs they have already reaped? There has to be some fairness here. There has to be truth in billing. 
I think the Senator from Massachusetts has made a very important point. We made a commitment when we passed that bill, and I hope it can be realized.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for the last several days we have attempted to find a way to get around the impasse we have experienced. I am disappointed that we haven't made more progress, and it was only with the frustration which I had experienced that we were led to file cloture on two occasions last week. 
Our desire to come to some closure on this bill and on the amendments that are pending could not be greater. We have no reservations and no objections to having a vote on the amendment offered by the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, or the amendment offered by the Senator from Georgia, Senator Coverdell. What we would like, however, is the opportunity to offer similar amendments that deal with the same issue at approximately the same time. Let's have an amendment offered by our Republican colleagues. Then let's have an amendment by our Democratic colleagues. Let's go back and forth as we had been doing now for some time. But I really do not think it is the amendments or the procedure relating to the amendments that is keeping us from getting this job done. I think the opponents of the bill will never let a fair process unfold. 
It is every Senator's right to hold up legislation. That is the prerogative of the U.S. Senate. So we all understand this is a filibuster. The only way to break a filibuster is to invoke cloture. 
The bill, as everyone knows, is designed really to stop 3,000 kids a day from smoking. That is really what this is all about. Since we have been on this bill, 60,000 kids have become smokers. I think everybody needs to understand what has happened; 60,000 new smokers have begun smoking since we started this legislation, 60,000 of them. About one-third of them will die of smoking-related diseases. So 20,000 of those kids at some point, because they started smoking since we have become involved in this legislation, will die. 
From votes taken on those issues, it is clear that there is a bipartisan majority for reaching conclusion here. Some of the Senate wants votes on other issues like taxes, drugs, and lawyers. We are prepared, as we have already expressed, to have votes on those issues. Our position is as clear as it can be. Let's have the votes. We voted on lawyers' fees. We have already voted on an array of other issues. Some I voted for, and many I voted against. We are ready to vote on the marriage penalty. We are ready to vote on drug abuse. We are ready to keep voting, just like we started alternating back and forth. 
We are ready to sit down and work out a way to process the rest of the amendments, and to finish the bill. But we have now spent more time on this bill than any other bill this Congress. 
The time for talking is over. Now is the time to act. Now is the time to vote. Now is the time to stand up and be counted. How many more thousands of kids will start smoking before we finish? Another 60,000? 600,000? And, if it is, indeed, one-third of those who will die from smoking, how many kids can we prevent from acquiring the habit and from dying? That is what this bill is about. That is why it is so important to come to closure.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to introduce legislation to encourage family and work and to facilitate the purchase of affordable health insurance by self-employed individuals. 
It is no secret to many married Americans that the tax code often penalizes marriage. An estimated 21 million American couples with two breadwinners pay more than if they had remained single and filed separate tax returns--an average of nearly $1,400 more. 
The marriage penalty is justifiably one of the most unpopular aspects of our tax system, second only to the complexity of the tax code. The federal government should be encouraging family and work, not discouraging them through disincentives in the tax code or any other area of public policy. 
The bill I am introducing today would significantly reduce the added tax burden that many middle and lower income couples face when both spouses work. It will do so by providing an above-the-line 20 percent deduction against the earnings of the lesser earning spouse. The 20 percent deduction would be phased out between family adjusted gross incomes of $50,000 and $60,000. It would also be applied against the calculation of earned income for the purpose of determining eligibility for the Earned Income Credit, increasing the size of these refundable credits for a large number of families with incomes between $10,000 and $30,000. Finally, the bill would accelerate the date at which health insurance costs incurred by the self-employed become fully deductible. This is necessary to place farmers and small businessmen and women on the same footing as large, established companies when they purchase health insurance. 
Congress has wrestled with the marriage penalty problem several times during the past century in an attempt to reconcile two goals that cannot always be satisfied simultaneously in the context of a progressive tax system. The first is to ensure that a couple's total tax is the same, irrespective of the breakdown of earnings between spouses. The second is to ensure that couples will be taxed the same irrespective of whether they are married or still single. 
Before 1969, the tax code treated married couples as if they were composed of two single individuals. This avoided penalties on marriage, but it created higher rates on single taxpayers than married couples in cases in which one spouse earned all or most of the couple's income. Joint returns were computed by applying the normal rates to one-half of the couple's aggregate taxable income and multiplying the resulting amount by two. Single taxpayers' returns were computed by applying the normal rates to the full taxable income, causing a greater amount of the income to be taxed at a higher marginal rate. 
When Congress acted in 1969 to redress the perceived inequity to single taxpayers, it created the modern-day marriage penalty by causing some married couples who file a joint return to pay more tax than would two single persons with the same total income. Congress based its action on the assumption that a married couple's expenses are lower than those of two single persons having separate households. 
The time has come to reexamine this tradeoff, which was made nearly thirty years ago. Doing so, however, will require us to confront hard budgetary realities. Complete elimination of the marriage penalty without also eliminating the marriage bonus would cost an estimated $29 billion per year, a sum that is far in excess of what can be afforded while maintaining our commitment to a balanced budget and the use of budget surpluses for Social Security reform. While the drive to pay down the national debt and save Social Security will make comprehensive reform of the marriage penalty difficult any time soon, more targeted efforts are not only possible, they are the right thing to do. 
We have an historic opportunity to redress the unjustified added tax burden we place on some married couples without undermining our commitment to pass an effective national tobacco policy and enact reforms to save Social Security. My bill would sharply reduce the marriage tax penalty for most couples with incomes of less than $60,000 at a fraction of the budgetary cost of other marriage penalty tax proposals, such as that offered by Senator Gramm of Texas to increase deductions for all married couples. The reason is that these other proposals fail to distinguish between couples who incur a penalty and those who enjoy a marriage bonus. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that about 29 million families, those in which one spouse earns much more than the other, currently pay less than if they had filed single returns--an average of $1,300 less. Senator Gramm's proposal and others like it dilute the amount of tax relief they are able to deliver to penalized couples by providing just as much of a tax cut to couples who receive a bonus. 
By targeting its tax relief more directly on the couples who experience a marriage penalty, my bill would reduce this penalty far more for most families with incomes below $60,000 than competing approaches. For Example, in the case of a couple making $35,000, split $20,000 and $15,000 between the two spouses, my proposal would provide an additional tax deduction of $3,000 (i.e., 15% of $15,000). This is over twice as much marriage penalty tax relief as could be provided at a comparable cost by a proposal to increase the deduction for all joint filers. Similarly, for a couple making $50,000 divided evenly between the two spouses, my bill would provide a $5,000 deduction (20% of $25,000), representing more than three times as much tax as a proposal that costs the same but extends a supplemental deduction to all married couples. 
We simply do not have the luxury of applying tax relief indiscriminately if we are to make good on our other commitments, whether they be passage of an effective tobacco bill that reduces youth smoking or preservation of budget surpluses for the difficult task of shoring up the financing of the Social Security system. The legislation I introduce today is aimed at demonstrating that we can reconcile our competing priorities. We can do right by married couples incurring a tax penalty and farmers and small businesses who must purchase their own health insurance at the same that we do right by our children and our growing population of seniors.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the majority leader has taken the floor to criticize what has occurred this morning. I notified the majority leader last night of our intention to file cloture again. We have been on the bill 42 hours, 39 minutes as of 11:53. Eight days we have been here debating. We have sought some cooperation from our colleagues on the other side in terms of reaching some agreement on how we can proceed on amendments. We have attempted to do that. We were getting nowhere. It was only after we filed cloture last night that we were able to get a vote finally on the Durbin amendment. 
The majority leader talks about fairness being the criterion by which we judge a Senator's right to offer an amendment. In the name of fairness, we need to offer Senators their opportunity to come to the floor to offer amendments. I wish we would use the same standard. Let's use the same standard for the tobacco bill as we used for the Coverdell bill, as we used for all other bills that we have had before the Senate this year. We were arguing fairness when Senators were denied the opportunity to offer amendments. In fact, somebody said, `Can you believe they are offering a tax amendment on the Coverdell bill?' We said, `Well, this is a tax bill.' But we were accused of destroying what harmony there may have been to reach some agreement. And Senators on this side of the aisle were precluded from offering amendments on the Coverdell bill even though it was a tax bill, because they said this is an education bill. Do you remember that debate? Because it was `an education bill,' we were not supposed to offer tax amendments. But it was a tax bill. 
Now we have the tobacco legislation, and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are saying we want to offer a tax amendment. We are saying this is a tobacco bill. They say it doesn't matter. We are going to offer this tobacco amendment, and you are not being fair unless you ensure that we have a right to offer tax amendments. 
I am just asking, let's play fair. Let's use the same standard. That isn't too much to ask. Once we have agreed on what that standard is, let's accommodate Senators on both sides who have amendments they wish to offer. We have a tax amendment. We don't understand why it would be that difficult for us to come to some agreement about having a vote on two competing ideas on the same exact issue. Let's have our debate. Let's lay the amendments down. Let's have a vote back to back on the amendments, and let's move on. We will have an amendment to the amendment that has now been offered by the distinguished Senator from Georgia. We laud him for many of the things that are incorporated in his amendment. There are some concerns that we have. If we can't work through those, we will certainly have an alternative there as well. 
But it seems to me that we have a double standard here, Mr. President. When it was in circumstances in the past, we had one set of rules. Now, with circumstances with this bill, there is another set of rules. Let's play by the same rules. Let's work together and see if we can't find some resolution of this 
problem. I think that can be done, but we have a ways to go. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I don't know how many days it is that we have been on the tobacco bill now, but it is clear that we are not making any progress. I am increasingly frustrated by the degree to which many of our Republican colleagues, in the name of amending the bill, have stalled, obfuscated and, in many ways, attempted to defeat the legislation without any real sign of progress, without any real sign of coming to closure, without any real effort to find some resolution. 
I have expressed my continued patience, my continued desire to find ways in which to move this legislation along. I give great credit to the manager of the bill, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, for his tireless efforts to move both sides along. 
This has not worked. We have continued to be thwarted in the name of compromise, and in the name of negotiation, and in the name of consultation. Frankly, I don't know what other options there are but to file cloture on the bill. We may not win. I am prepared to acknowledge that unless we get many of our Republican colleagues to join us, we will not win. But I also understand that if we don't move this legislation forward, we will continue to be in a position of having to say no to other bills the majority leader may wish to bring up until we resolve this matter. We have said, as late as Tuesday, that we are not in a position to move to any other legislation until we finish this bill. I don't know how we can say it more clearly than that. 
We want to finish this legislation so we can move on to other bills. There are a number of other pieces of legislation that ought to be addressed, and we recognize that. We are prepared to enter into time agreements on amendments. We are prepared to come to some time limit on the bill itself. But we have now virtually wasted the better part of a week waiting for colleagues to offer amendments, waiting for some resolution to the Gramm amendment, waiting, procedurally, to find some solution to the impasse that we now are experiencing. 
So, Mr. President, I really have no choice but to offer a cloture motion, with some frustration, and with the realization that it may take more than one. We may have to file several cloture motions. But, beginning today, I will take whatever action is necessary to expedite the consideration and ultimately the solution and the conclusion to this legislation. 
We have a lot of people who have invested a good deal of effort into this legislation; three of them are on the floor right now. I thank them for all they have done to bring us to this point. But unless we take it to its final conclusion, all of the thousands of hours spent by the Senators who are on the floor already, invested in time and good-faith efforts to move us to this point, will be for naught. I don't want to see that happen. I don't want to see this necessarily as a Republican versus Democratic debate. But, frankly, it becomes more and more apparent that we are not getting the help--with the one stellar exception of my friend and colleague from Arizona--in getting this legislation passed. So we are very hopeful that we can move this legislation and find some way to resolve the matter. 
I understand that I can't file until 2:15 under a previous agreement. I will certainly wait until then. 
Let me just make sure that our colleagues understand where things stand. Right now, we are discussing the motion to recommit offered by the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, with amendments pending to that motion. The Gramm amendment would cost $52 billion. It would rob the bill of any real opportunity to address research in health care, to address the targeted approach that we are attempting to make on advertising and reducing teenage smoking. It would reduce every option that we have available to us to reverse the trend and reduce teenage smoking in this country. Why? Because the Senator from Texas believes that we ought to address the marriage penalty. 
Unfortunately, Senator Gramm's amendment doesn't address the marriage penalty alone. In fact, one could argue that it has little to do with the marriage penalty. It has everything to do with spending the tobacco revenue raised in the health fee. We are presented with an option that is a Hobson's choice for many: reduce taxes for those who are under $50,000, or reduce teenage smoking, reduce the number of children who are dying from smoking. That is the choice. While we debate this choice, 3,000 kids a day choose to smoke for the first time. A large percentage of those--some say 40 percent--are people who ultimately will die from the habit at some point in their life. They get cancer and ultimately succumb to cancer because they started smoking too early, without knowing the facts, without being able to quit once they had started. That is the issue here. 
Can we prevent young people from acquiring this terrible habit and from dying because of it? Can we target advertising and research, and can we find ways in which to ensure that we can turn the trend around for the first time? Or are we going to spend that money for something else? Mr. President, Democrats have come up with an alternative.

<TEXT>
Mr. DASCHLE. I will agree to withholding filing of the motion so long as I don't lose my right to file the motion. If that takes retaining the floor, I intend to do so. But I will certainly allow the Senator from Arizona whatever time he may require to talk to the Senator from Texas. 
Mr. President, let me just say that is really the essence of this argument. Can we stop kids from smoking? Can we turn this around, or not? And can we find a way with which to address the concerns expressed to us by many of our colleagues? 
We believe we can address the marriage penalty for a whole lot less than $52 billion. But our objective is not to gut the bill. Our objective isn't to say we are going to use up all that money because we don't want to spend it on stopping kids from smoking; we don't want to spend it on research; we don't want to spend it on tobacco farmers; we don't want to recognize what has already been achieved in the State-by-State negotiations on this issue and the tremendous effort put forth by attorneys general all over the country in an effort to resolve this at the State level. The Federal Government didn't do that. For whatever reason, we didn't go to court. The States did. Now that the States have racked up their victories, and now that they are expecting some way to resolve this matter, we are saying: We are going to use that money, too; we are going to take the money that you have already won in court fairly and squarely against the tobacco companies, and we are going to spend it; we are going to spend it on a tax cut. 
So this gets interesting as we go on. We are saying we ought to respect the decisions made by the attorneys general, we ought to respect the decisions made by the committees of the Congress, and the Senate in particular, in recognition of the fact that we have to find new ways to target those who are most vulnerable to campaigns by tobacco companies today to get them to smoke. We think that is worth an American investment. We think it is worth an American investment to put some real effort into research on how we cure diseases that have been connected to smoking. We think it is important that we find ways with which to rid this country of the production of tobacco products and to encourage tobacco farmers to find other ways to make a living. That is what this is about. 
Mr. President, there is no choice. We can continue to talk. We can continue to find ways with which to obfuscate. But it really comes down to this: Do you want to pass a tobacco bill or not? We are getting a resounding `no' on the other side of the aisle. We are getting an absolute, emphatic `no,' exclamation point, `we don't want a tobacco bill.' 
We have come to a point that we do not have any choice. We must move this legislation forward and use the parliamentary and procedural methods available to any Senator to begin to curtail debate, recognizing that every Senator who still has a germane amendment would have the right to offer an amendment. 
But having been on this bill now for 2 weeks, and now recognizing the majority leader's frustration and impatience with our slow progress, his desire to move on to other bills, I, frankly, wish that we could do this together. I wish he and I could file this cloture motion. He has filed cloture a lot faster on virtually every other bill that has come to the floor than on this one. But I understand the difference in the initial position with regard to where we are on this legislation. So I wouldn't expect him necessarily to be enthusiastic about doing it. But we 
have to move on. We have to find a way with which to address this bill in a more consequential and productive way. That, in essence, is what it is we are attempting to do. 
We have a series of amendments. The Durbin amendment, which, in my view, is one of the final and very important pieces of legislation that we want to address on this side, a piece of legislation that would be designed to strengthen the so-called look-back, or the targets that we set out, to reduce teenage smoking--I don't think that is necessarily anything anybody ought to have trouble considering, or ultimately debating. We haven't even been able to debate that. We have had to wait. 
Mr. President, I say with all sincerity--I don't see the Senator from Arizona on the floor. He had asked that I postpone the filing of the cloture motion, and I have agreed to do so. But I am prepared to file it assuming that there is no other reason for him to ask for additional delay.

<TEXT>
Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just respond to a couple points made by the distinguished majority leader. First of all, I only wish I had had his text in front of me when we took up the Coverdell bill, when we took up a number of other pieces of legislation earlier this year, because I can recall his passionate determination to get time agreements, to stack votes, to find a way to come to closure in a matter of a couple of days, a couple of days, and were it not for the fact that we had the votes to hold 
off on cloture, I don't know where that would have gone. We finally came to a resolution on the Coverdell legislation because we were able to come to some agreement on how we would proceed on amendments. 
Now, I am perfectly willing to ask unanimous consent to withdraw the cloture motion if we can get an agreement on the process and some time agreements by which we can have these amendments considered. 
Now, I don't know why, but I have been told--and I will admit I haven't talked directly to the majority leader--that the Republicans are refusing to allow the Democratic tax amendment to either precede or immediately succeed the consideration of the Gramm amendment. They don't want them back to back. I don't know why. And if that is not accurate, I hope somebody will tell me. 
We have offered to have a limited amount of debate on the Gramm amendment, a limited amount of time on the Democratic amendment, and then let's have two votes back to back. We can do that this afternoon. I am prepared to have a vote, I would suggest, at 5 o'clock today. Let's have the debate on the Gramm amendment, the debate on the Democratic amendment, and then two votes, and we are out of here on taxes for a while. Then let's go to the drug amendment, let's go to the Durbin amendment. We can stack those votes. We can have all four of those votes tonight. But I bet you I won't hear that offer made by the other side. For some reason that isn't good enough. It was good enough for the Coverdell bill, but it is not good enough for the tobacco bill.

Would he agree with me to a 2- or 3-hour time agreement to be divided equally on the two amendments relating to tax, the Gramm amendment and the Democratic amendment, and that two votes be cast at the end of that time in sequence of his choosing? Would the majority leader agree to that proposal?

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the majority leader has just made my point probably better than I can. What he has said is that this offer to have two amendments, one Republican and one Democrat, both dealing with tax, under a time agreement, is objectionable to them. 
My point originally was the reason it is objectionable is because they don't want to get this legislation passed. They do not want to see closure to it. That is really what is behind all of this. This is not some concern about a tax amendment. This is concern about ultimately moving this legislation to a point where we can get completion. The reason the majority leader cannot get unanimous consent is not because it is not fair. It is because there are colleagues on his side who want to drag this out past the Fourth of July. They want to start using the clock. That is what this is about. You want a blow-by-blow account of the play-by-play action here? It is that. We are simply playing the clock. Because if you play it long enough, we run out of time and then, guess what, we do not pass a tobacco bill. 
We can play that. We can stay on this bill through June, if we want to. But I am telling you, this legislation ought to pass. It is about saving kids' lives. It is about making them healthy. It is about coming up with new tobacco policy, and we are prepared to stick to whatever it takes to see that we get that done. 
I don't understand why that would not be a fair proposal. I am disappointed that our Republican colleagues object to what is a reasonable proposal. When I used the reference `king of the hill,' I was simply saying you have two proposals, both pending, both being debated, and Republicans and Democrats both roll the dice. Let's see what the majority of Democrats and Republicans support with regard to the options presented to them. 
We have an amendment. They have an amendment. Maybe the leader is right. Maybe both amendments will pass or both amendments could fail. He thinks there is a majority support for the marriage penalty amendment. I think he is probably right. The question is, What is the amendment? The Gramm amendment goes way beyond marriage penalty. It goes way beyond it. Don't anyone be confused about that. This is not a marriage penalty amendment. You can find marriage penalty in it, but it goes beyond that, and he is prepared to spend $52 billion going beyond that. 
Now I understand he wants to pull it back some, but there is no question the majority of what the Gramm amendment would eat up would go to research, would go to kids, and would go to farmers. We know that. So we will have to wait until another day to have our debate and have a good opportunity to consider competing proposals. But we are prepared to do that. We will do it Monday next week, Tuesday, whenever. But we will be here. I yield the floor.

<DOCNO>105-daschle-sd-11-19980604</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just say, my offer stands. We are prepared to negotiate some time agreement, some way with which to deal with these amendments. And if we can do so satisfactorily to both sides, I am prepared to ask unanimous consent to revoke the cloture motion for now. I will talk with the majority leader and we will see if we cannot resolve it. Perhaps this discussion, if nothing else, has moved us closer to that point. 
He did make a point, though, that I think has to be responded to, and that has to do with money which is being allocated here. He said, What is wrong with dealing with the marriage penalty? Shouldn't we address the inequity there? Let there be no mistake. We are prepared to address the inequity in the marriage penalty. Our amendment would do that. We are simply saying we don't want to do it at the expense of revoking the commitment made to the attorneys general, made to the States, made to tobacco farmers, made to children, made to the researchers--made in all of those ways that has set up this comprehensive tobacco policy which we hope to address over the course of the next 10 years. We don't have to do that. We don't have to destroy that. 
So there is nothing wrong with dealing with the marriage penalty. But to say we are going to do it at the expense of everything else is the problem Democrats find with the Gramm amendment. It also begs the question, what about the cost to Medicare and Medicaid from smoking-related illnesses? Should that not be addressed? Isn't that an inequity? The American taxpayers are paying huge--billions and billions of dollars, huge amounts of money to pay for the programs that we have set up to deal with health care; Medicare and Medicaid, the two most consequential. More and more billions of dollars are spent every year dealing with smoking-related illnesses. Isn't it important for us as a Nation and this Senate to recognize that and deal with it? 
What the Gramm amendment says is, `No, it isn't. No, we are going to spend it on a tax cut. We think that is more important than anything else, over and above the commitment to the attorneys general, over and above the commitment to the farmers, over and above the commitment to the children, over and above the commitment to the Medicare and Medicaid.' That is the problem we have. That is why there hasn't been an ability to find some common ground. So long as that becomes the only way with which to spend resources, we think there is a better way, a more prudent way, a more balanced way, and that is what this debate is about today. I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. That is the case. Those who benefit by being married are benefited even more by the Gramm amendment.

His admonition to the Senate was, `Let's take a look, let's step back and make sure we are not just overreaching.' Well, if there was a definition of overreaching, I don't know that I could find a better example than the Gramm amendment because of exactly what the Senator from North Dakota has noted.

Mr. DASCHLE. Like the Senator from North Dakota, I have been around here a while, too, and this has been a first for me as well. It doesn't come often. To have the quarterbacks all on that side deciding the amendments to be offered is an interesting set of circumstances. 
The point the Senator from North Dakota makes is right on the mark. We are giving benefits to, in the name of the marriage penalty, married people who have no tax penalty, who actually benefit from being married. But the real irony, the real sad aspect of this, Mr. President, is we are doing it at the expense of those smoking-related illnesses in Medicare and Medicaid. We are doing it at the expense of tobacco farmers; we are doing it at the expense of children; we are doing it at the expense of research; we are doing it at the expense of a comprehensive attack on teenage smoking. 
That is the real irony here, and that is why a lot of us feel very mystified by this proposal and by the approach the Republicans are insisting on and troubled by the inequity, not only procedurally but in substance, with the amendments they are demanding that we consider.

One would be for us to seek unanimous consent for the vote to be postponed until Tuesday; or, secondly, that we are not in session on Monday, which would then make Tuesday the next business day when the cloture vote would ripen. 
I am hopeful that the majority leader and I can find a way with which to resolve the schedule that will accommodate both sides. So I hope that perhaps we might tentatively announce that the vote will be held on Tuesday, but certainly if we are in session, I am not prepared at this point to agree to a unanimous consent request that would move it to Tuesday until we have been able to talk through the balance of the schedule.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader's intent as he has expressed it and the unanimous consent request. As he knows, taking this action would actually put the tobacco bill back on the calendar, and it would then subject the leadership to a request to take the bill off the calendar once again and move the legislation. We would have to get either unanimous consent to move the bill or we would have to make a motion to proceed back to the tobacco bill. So this is a very, very difficult parliamentary challenge. 
Obviously, we are in a very different set of circumstances if this unanimous consent request would go into effect. It would put us at the mercy of every single opponent of the tobacco bill. They know that. I give the majority leader great credit for attempting to try to expedite our legislative calendar. There are a lot of things we should be doing. But I will not subject this tobacco bill to the fate that would be destined this legislation if we were to require that we be at the mercy of every opponent of the tobacco bill when we want to bring it back. 
I would ask unanimous consent, reserving the right to object, that regardless of the outcome, the Senate resume consideration of the tobacco bill and remain on the bill until its completion.

Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the President for that clarification and his interpretation of what has just been presented to him. 
Mr. President, I have heard the majority leader on many occasions come to this floor and make an impassioned speech to all of our colleagues that we are going to stay on this bill until we get it done. I heard him say that eloquently and passionately on NATO. I heard him say that when we talked about the budget. I heard him say that when we talked about the Coverdell bill. I have heard him say that on so many occasions this year--we are going to stay on this piece of legislation until we get it done because we have to finish it so we can move on. 
I do not want to misinterpret his remarks. I know he would like to see some completion of the tobacco bill. I just wish he and our colleagues would show the same passion and resolve to finish this bill so that we can move on. 
That is all we are asking. Let's move on to other pieces of legislation once we have completed our work on this. This is an open invitation to go off of this legislation, move on to other things, and, oh, by the way, if there is time, and if my Democratic colleagues play their cards right and behave, we will probably have a chance to come back to tobacco. 
That is the problem. I want very much to make this month as productive as the last month was. But you know how it was productive? It was productive when we said we were going to stay on a bill until we finished it. We finished the highway bill. We finished the technical bills. We finished an array of pieces of legislation because we showed some focus and we resolved to stay on that legislation until it was completed. That is what we are asking here. Let's stay on this bill until it is done, and then let's move on to the array of other pieces on the calendar that have to be addressed, too. 
So because we fail to do that, unfortunately, I object.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I concur with the remarks just made by the majority leader. We have 20 or 25 Senators, all of whom have planes to catch this afternoon, who don't want to miss this vote. I certainly hope that we wouldn't inconvenience a third to half of the Senate as we get to this crucial time. 
I hope everybody will cooperate and work with us. We have to get this legislation done. My hope is that we won't leave until we get it done. I hope we could seek cooperation on both sides.

Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate the information the majority leader has just shared. I think that is certainly in keeping with the understanding that he and I have had in our private discussions now for some time. My hope is that we can come back and complete our work on the tobacco bill. I believe that is certainly within our reach. 
I understand, because of the plethora of other bills that are on the calendar, we have to begin consideration of other issues. We have some amendments and bills that we want to raise at some point as well. But I think this schedule accommodates the demands that we are going to have on our schedule for the balance of the month of June, and I am hopeful that we can see the same level of cooperation on both sides of the aisle with that schedule that we have had over the course of the last 2 or 3 weeks. 
I certainly have no objections to proceeding as the majority leader has suggested, certainly with the expectation that we will complete our work on the tobacco bill early when we come back.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise for a moment to congratulate all of those Senators who have had so much to do with the success that we have just demonstrated with the passage of the Interstate Transportation Efficiency Act, the so-called ISTEA II bill. Senator Baucus, Senator Chafee, Senator Warner, Senator Byrd, and Senator Gramm deserve our accolades and our commendation for a job extraordinarily well done. 
This represents the single biggest investment in our infrastructure in our Nation's history. It represents an effort to recognize the importance of infrastructure and the array of challenges that we face in an information age, as well as at the turn of this century and the entrance into a new millennium. 
It also recognizes the importance of regional balance--the West, the South, the Northeast, the Midwest--all with our disparate challenges and problems that we face with infrastructure, all with the needs, all with the recognition that our States are vastly different as those needs are reflected in public policy. This not only represents the greatest investment, in my view, it represents as well the best regional balance that we have been able to demonstrate. 
Finally, I think it recognizes the importance of something the distinguished Senator from Louisiana and the Senator from West Virginia have said on the floor many times: We must recognize the critical nature of the trust fund itself and restore the practice that this country had at one point and was religious in adhering to, and that is that we use the funds that are designated for particular trust funds as they should be used. When this legislation is fully implemented, that is exactly what will happen; the trust fund will be used as it must be used. 
Today, we spend approximately $32 billion from the trust fund on an annual basis, but only $21 billion goes to highways and infrastructure needs; $11 billion, roughly, goes to needs that are not highway designated, that are not related to infrastructure. Mr. President, the time has come for us to make a change in that practice, and this legislation does it. 
There has been a great deal of concern expressed on both sides of the aisle about the veterans' offset. Frankly, I am very disappointed and discouraged about the fact that we are using a veterans' fund for purposes of offset, but this is not the last word. I must say, if we were using the trust fund for which it was designed, we wouldn't need the veterans' fund because the highway fund is more than adequate to cover our needs for infrastructure in this country. 
We will revisit the veterans smoking issue, and, in my view, we will revisit it in a successful way. We must recognize there is a dependency created in large measure because of past practices in the Armed Forces that we must address. Whether it is in the smoking bill, whether it is in some other legislation in the future, we will not ignore the fact that veterans need the same consideration as every other smoker in this country; in fact, in some cases you could clearly say more. 
There are two issues to be resolved: One is the offset; the second is the policy. I believe in the longer term we will deal with both successfully. But that should not in any way dissuade us from taking great satisfaction today with this accomplishment, for the tremendous job that was done in bringing us to this point; that, in fact, at long last--a month overdue--at long last we did what the Nation was waiting for us to do: Pass a meaningful infrastructure bill that represents the needs, challenges, and demands that must be put on this Nation as we enter a new era. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today to indicate my support for H.R. 2709, the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act. 
The message this bill sends to the international community is clear. The patience of the American people and their elected representatives is not infinite. If diplomacy fails to produce satisfactory results, the United States is prepared to take decisive action to protect our security and that of our allies by imposing sanctions on those who violate international agreements restricting the transfer of ballistic missile technology. 
In my judgment, it is time for Congress to send this message. And it is long past time for those who violate international agreements to heed the message. 
I appreciate that diplomacy has produced some positive results in this area and may ultimately yield more progress. Nonetheless, these efforts fall short of what is needed to halt the illegal transfers. In the absence of immediate and conclusive evidence of a dramatic reversal of Russian behavior, stronger measures are needed, and H.R. 2709 is an appropriate vehicle. 
The end of the Cold War has affected our national security policies in many ways. It has reduced the likelihood of a large-scale conventional conflict on the European continent. It has made it much less likely that either the United States or Russia will intentionally use nuclear weapons against the other. And it has allowed us to meet the remaining threats to our security with slightly smaller defense budgets. These are obviously positive developments. 
On the other hand, the post-Cold War period has been marked by the emergence of a new threat--the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. Let me run down the current state of affairs with regard to weapons of mass destruction. 
First, at the end of the Cold War, five countries--the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain, and France--had declared themselves nuclear weapons states. Unfortunately, as proven by India's actions just last week, the true number in the nuclear club is much larger. 
Second, the Pentagon suspects that as many as 20 countries have chemical weapons programs, and that a slightly smaller number have biological weapons. 
Third, the Defense Department believes that about 15 countries currently possess ballistic missiles, and that the number could grow to more than 20 by 2000. 
It is these disturbing trends that the United States and many other nations in the international community are trying to combat. 
Reversing these trends is a daunting challenge. If there is to be any chance of even slowing the spread of this threatening technology, the United States must act decisively and firmly when confronted with actions that violate existing agreements designed to proscribe this type of behavior. It is in this context that we must view efforts by several Russian entities and individuals to assist the Iranian ballistic missile program. 
The status of the Iranian missile program should be of particular concern to U.S. security officials. Iran is located in a critical region of the world. Vital U.S. economic, political and military interests are at stake. 
Tens of thousands of U.S. troops are within easy reach of the Iranian missiles speeding through their development stage. 
The entire state of Israel, a staunch ally and friend, would be well within range of the Iranian missiles. 
Concern about Iran's intentions are further heightened by the fact that many intelligence analysts believe the Iranian government has repeatedly supported and sponsored terrorist activities. 
Both supporters and opponents of H.R. 2709 agree on one fact: Russian entities and individuals have played an important, if not crucial, role in the Iranian ballistic missile program. Even Russian officials acknowledge the involvement of Russian companies in these illegal activities. It has been publicly estimated that, largely as a result of this assistance, Iran could soon field missiles with sufficient range to threaten the entire Middle East. 
Where people differ is over what to do about this assistance. 
Opponents of H.R. 2709 argue the bill's sanctions are a blunt instrument that will not achieve the intended result of stopping Russian assistance. They prefer to allow more time for the Administration's diplomatic efforts to bear fruit. 
Mr. President, I take a back seat to no one in my appreciation for the negotiations the President and his advisers have conducted with their Russian counterparts on this complex issue. These negotiations have produced positive tangible results. Russian cooperation with Iran has ended in a few specific cases. In addition, the Russian government has issued and agreed to enforce decrees intended to stop the missile trade. 
Yet, despite the Administration's best efforts and the progress they have engendered, and notwithstanding a score of Russian promises, the fact remains that Russian assistance to the Iranian missile program continues. After months of negotiation, it appears that talk alone is not going to be sufficient to end Russia's involvement with Iran's ballistic missile program. 
If we are to convince Russia and the world that we intend to protect ourselves and our allies, the time has come for more than talk. If we are to enforce international law prohibiting transfer of ballistic missile technology, it is time for action. 
Mr. President, passage of H.R. 2709 is the appropriate action to take at this time. However, Senate passage of H.R. 2709 need not be the final word on this critical issue. If we adopt the Levin amendment, the bill will go back to conference with the House. There is still a very limited amount of time for the Russian Government to convince this Congress that it has heard our concerns and moved to end cooperation with the Iranian missile program. Failing an immediate and dramatic reversal in Russian behavior, it is time to redefine the playing field for those currently violating these laws and those contemplating future transgressions. 
To those parties, enactment of the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act will underscore that the United States stands ready to defend its own security interests and those of our close allies; that the United States will do all it can to stem illegal efforts to spread ballistic missile technology; and that the United States will ensure that violations of international law will not go unpunished. 
I ask my colleagues to join with me in voting for H.R. 2709.

 Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to honor the concert band from Tulare High School in Tulare, South Dakota, and the Garden Valley Collegiate school in Winkler, Manitoba, Canada for their participation in a special spring concert to be held in Manitoba on June 2. 
This is an exciting opportunity for these band members and students to reach across the North American border, and together, promote the exchange of culture and ideas. The concert promises to be a very celebrated event, which should build bridges between these schools for a long time to come. 
I would like to recognize the leadership of Sam Glantzow, band director at the Tulare High School. He has dedicated so much time and effort into seeing this important exchange take place. Also, I would like to thank Paul Moen, band director, and Karl Redekop, principal, from the Garden Valley Collegiate School. By extending an invitation across the border into South Dakota, they have made an important contribution to international dialogue and understanding. I admire these teachers and administrators for providing their students such a creative and unique opportunity. 
I wish the students and teachers the best of luck for a beautiful and successful concert.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to express my strong support for the nomination of Patrick A. Mulloy to the position of Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Market Access and Compliance in the International Trade Administration (ITA). I believe his many years of experience in dealing with international trade policy issues and his unswerving commitment to public service equip him well for this challenge. 
For over a dozen years, Mr. Mulloy has had major responsibility for the development of all legislation dealing with international trade and finance in the Senate Banking Committee. His expertise spans export administration, export promotion, exchange rates, foreign investment, international banking, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. He played a lead role in developing the Export Enhancement Act of 1993 and has demonstrated an ability to work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. For many years, he also has served as the Banking Committee's advisor to U.S. negotiating teams at the GATT and WTO and contributed to the successes achieved during these negotiations. 
Patrick Mulloy's diverse career experience, spanning the State Department, Justice Department and the Senate Banking Committee, have given him an unusual depth of perspective on international economic policy issues. I am confident that, as Assistant Secretary of Commerce, he will work diligently to help ensure that U.S. businesses are given every opportunity to compete freely and fairly in the global marketplace of the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know we are about to come to a vote on this amendment. I begin simply by complimenting the sponsors of the amendment for what I know is a well-intended effort to address one of the most consequential of all the issues we must face. I certainly don't deny a very strong case can be made for following through with what is described as the intent of this amendment. I happen to come down on the other side, and I am going to try to explain the reasons why I believe this amendment ought to be defeated. But it is not without high regard for the sponsors, both Senator Gregg and Senator Leahy, and the effort they are making. 
Let me just say, as to the question of immunity, one thing that I think needs to be said is that there is no immunity in this bill, period. There is none. No one should be misled. There is no immunity in this legislation. There are ways with which we deal with the tobacco companies and their legal standing, but no one should say that the bill provides immunity for the tobacco companies. On the issue of immunity, I think the managers of the bill have made great progress over the course of the last week. Working with the administration, they have improved dramatically what was done initially in the Commerce Committee. What the Commerce Committee itself did, in my view, is raise serious concerns that I, frankly, felt had to be addressed if, indeed, we were going to resolve the overall issue of how we approach tobacco policy in the future. 
There were special protections for the tobacco industry that were written into the committee bill originally, which I believe were very, very seriously in error as a matter of public policy. For example, allowing parent companies of tobacco companies total immunity would have been wrong. To say that we are going to ban all claims based on addiction would have been wrong. To say that we were going to prevent State courts from hearing all claims would have been wrong. 
Mr. President, I want to make sure that all of our colleagues understand that every one of those special provisions has now been eliminated. All of those special provisions no longer exist. The managers' amendment, which is now part of the bill, has eliminated all of them. The only remaining provision is a cap on yearly payments, and that cap has been raised from $6.5 billion to $8 billion. So before any Senator is called upon to make their vote, I hope they understand that simple fact--perhaps I should say those simple facts. There is no immunity in this bill; there are no special protections, unlike what was reported out of the Commerce Committee. What is left is a cap that has been raised by $1.5 billion annually. 
Let me emphasize something else about that cap. The cap is available only to those companies that agree to additional advertising restrictions beyond what is contained in the FDA rule. They have to commit never to challenge the entire bill to be eligible to come under that cap. They can't advertise and they can't challenge the provisions of this legislation just to be eligible. And then there is one more thing. Everybody needs to understand that in order just to be able to do that, they have to pay out an upfront payment of $10 billion. So here is what we are offering the tobacco companies: You pay the country $10 billion; you agree to limit your advertising way beyond what the FDA rule will provide. You also agree not to challenge the provisions within this bill, and then we will fit you under an $8 billion liability cap. And only those companies which make those commitments are eligible. Only those companies that make those commitments will have State suits settled. 
Any company that says, `Wait a minute, that is too high a price. You are asking me to limit my advertising way beyond what FDA is going to tell me. You are telling me that I have to accept every provision in this legislation. You are telling me I have to 
pay forth $10 billion, and if I don't do that, you are saying I still have to face all those court suits in the States'--well, companies that refuse to sign the provisions under this bill get absolutely nothing. So a tobacco company is faced with the prospect of coming under an $8 billion liability cap by agreeing to all these additional provisions or getting nothing, under this legislation. They will continue to face lawsuits in the States if they don't sign onto the provisions that we have laid out in this legislation. 
But it even gets more complicated for tobacco companies. We are not giving anything away by putting in an $8 billion cap. We are getting something we can't get through our own legislation. We can't legislate the advertising restrictions that go beyond the FDA rule without raising first amendment questions. And we could not prevent the tobacco industry from challenging other provisions of the bill. That is a problem. The cap is our way of addressing that particular, very serious problem. 
Let me remind my colleagues of what the tobacco companies have to do to come under that $8 billion yearly cap, beyond what I have already mentioned. Of course, I have mentioned the advertising restrictions. I have mentioned the upfront payment. I have mentioned that they have to agree not to challenge the terms of the legislation, not to challenge the FDA authority. They cannot challenge the look-back surcharges. That is, they can't challenge the provisions that hold them accountable for reducing youth and teenage smoking. They can't challenge those look-back provisions or any of the payments, for if they challenge any of that, it is all over and they are back right where they started. They fall outside the cap and they are subject to every single state lawsuit and the unlimited liability that they are facing right now. 
Let me also remind my colleagues that the tobacco companies will lose the protection of the cap if they fail to comply with any one of the terms--not all of them; all they have to do is miss on one of them. 
So, Mr. President, I don't know how you get any tougher than that. Even if the companies comply with all of those provisions, they could lose the cap for other reasons: If they miss the youth smoking targets by 20 percent or more, if they are caught smuggling or aiding and abetting smuggling, and if they fail to make an annual payment within the year that it is owed. All of those additional criteria are locked in with this bill. 
So I don't know, Mr. President. It sounds to me like that is about as tough as it gets. First of all, they have more restrictions than they have ever had in any other set of circumstances. They are required to pay more money. They are subject to discipline each and every year with regard to an array of very tight provisions. And what they get in return is an $8 billion cap on liability. 
Mr. President, I will oppose the Gregg amendment because I believe the managers' amendment approaches the issue in the right way. 
It gives protection only to those tobacco companies that go further than we legislate, that acknowledge the need to limit advertising in a way that we can't legislate in this bill. The other tobacco companies, those that do not sign up, will have no cap and will continue to fight it out in the courts in all of the States where these cases are being contested. 
I think we have to do all we can to reduce teen smoking. Additional advertising restrictions and a commitment made by tobacco companies not to challenge the law will increase our likelihood of success--not decrease it, increase it. 
Mr. President, for all those reasons, as well-intended as this amendment is, I hope my colleagues will think very carefully and very conscientiously about how important this question before the Senate truly is. We must do what we can to ensure passage of this legislation, to ensure that we stay tough on these companies, that we make them to do what we know they must do to reduce teen smoking, and to comply with the intent and the spirit of our objectives in this law. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, earlier this year I introduced S. 1672, the Missouri River Erosion Control Act of 1998. It will create an important new program to provide homeowners on the Missouri River with the assistance they need to protect their homes from shoreline erosion. 
Today, my colleague Senator Johnson and I are introducing a second bill that I hope will help to preserve the character of the Missouri River for generations to come. Up and down the Missouri River, South Dakotans can tell you that the river is slowly changing as a result of the dams built under the authority of the Pick-Sloan Act. While the dams undoubtedly have made positive contributions to South Dakota by controlling floodwaters and making affordable electricity available to promote rural development, they also ended the Big Muddy's ability to carry a full sediment load for long distances. Sediments are now being deposited into shallow areas of the river, causing the water table to rise, flooding shoreline lands and worsening erosion. In addition, the sediment build-up has made navigation nearly impossible in some areas. 
These problems have grown particularly severe near the city of Springfield, where a delta is forming downstream from the confluence of the Missouri and Niobrara Rivers. In order to better understand the causes of the sediment build-up and to develop solutions to address it, I am introducing legislation today to direct the Corps of Engineers to conduct a study of the lower Missouri and Niobrara River watershed. It is my hope that this study will provide the blueprint necessary to alleviate the sediment build-up, reduce future sedimentation, and preserve the character of the rivers for years to come. I hope my colleagues will give this legislation their full support.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the debate on tobacco legislation that we will begin again at 10 o'clock this morning is one of the most significant in which any of us will ever be involved. 
Smoking is, in the words of former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, `the chief, single avoidable cause of death in our society, and the most important public health issue of our time.' 
Every year, tobacco kills more than 400,000 Americans--accounting for more than one out of every five deaths in our country. Smoking kills more people than die from AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, murders, suicides and fires--combined. 
So often, when we hear that someone has died as a result of smoking, we think, `That was their choice. They were adults.' 
But chances are, they were not adults when they made the decision to pick up that first cigarette. 
Ninety percent of adult smokers started smoking at or before the age of 18--before they were even old enough to buy cigarettes legally. 
The average youth smoker starts smoking at 13, and is addicted by the time he or she is 14. One out of every three of those children will eventually die from smoking. 
It may take another 20 or 30--or even 50--years until that decision catches up with them. But the decision is made when they are children. 
That is what this debate is really about. Are we willing, as a nation, to protect our children from an epidemic that may eventually kill them? 
During the first half of this century, another epidemic threatened America's children: polio. 
Summer was a time of fear for American parents and their children. Parents kept their children out of swimming pools, movie theaters--anywhere the virus might be spread. 
Still, thousands of children died every year from polio, and tens of thousands were crippled. 
The worst polio epidemic in U.S. history occurred in 1952, when nearly 60,000 new cases were reported. 
Back then, America marshaled all its resources and all its resolve and, in 1953, Jonas Salk discovered a vaccine. 
As a result, polio has all but vanished from this nation. 
We may not be able to eliminate all tobacco-related disease, as we eliminated polio. But we can dramatically reduce the number of people who pick up that first cigarette as teenagers and become addicted and eventually die from smoking. 
The bill that will be pending in just a few moments provides the comprehensive approach that is needed to do that. 
It is supported by a majority of this Senate--Democrats and Republicans--and by the President. 
More importantly, it is supported by the American people.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have not wanted to get into this until now, but I must say I applaud what the distinguished chairman has said in a couple of aspects. First of all, I think that it is true; up until now, there has been a good deal of effort on both sides to bring this bill to the floor. We wouldn't be here today were it not for the leadership of the Senator from Arizona and the tremendous work put forth by the Senator from South Carolina, as well as the Senator from Kentucky. It is the only way we got to this point. We got here because the ranking member and the chairman concluded that this bill needed to get to the floor, and we were under a timeframe within which to do that. 
That has now happened. It was only through that effort that we were able to get this far. And I think it is fair to say both sides have been working in good faith to bring us to this point. 
So there is really two questions here. No. 1, is it within the right of the majority leader to amend his legislation as he has proposed to do? And clearly he is within his rights to do that. The real question is, Is it in keeping with what we have established as the working order here? Are we in the same kind of partnership that we thought we had all the way through this process as we moved procedurally to the floor? 
The answer clearly is no; this was a surprise. Senator Hollings has been in the meetings discussing what would go in the managers' amendment until at least 4 o'clock this afternoon. Senator Hollings, the administration and others have signed off on every single piece of what was to go into the managers' amendment. 
I just left the floor to check with the administration to see if they knew that this was in the managers' amendment, and the answer was emphatically no. No one told them this was going to be included. No one gave them any indication. 
So clearly we start this debate with a very serious misunderstanding and a very serious violation of good faith. It is within the right of the majority to take steps of this kind, but, unfortunately, it comes at a price. That price is the cooperation needed to complete our work. The price is coming to terms with all the other procedural questions we have to face. 
How is it possible to get unanimous consent under these circumstances? How is it possible to get any understanding about the degree to which we can agree on amendments with this problem? 
So, Mr. President, we have compounded the problem this afternoon, unnecessarily it seems to me. The majority leader has a job to do. He has to make choices, and I understand that. But I hope as those choices are made, we clearly demonstrate the appreciation for the kind of communication that is going to be absolutely essential if we get anything done at all. I hope we can work through this. I hope before the night is out, or at the very latest tomorrow morning, we can resolve this matter, because if we are going to move forward adequately, successfully, it has to be resolved. I yield the floor. 
Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am proud to announce to the Senate today the names of the two young men who have been selected to receive the 1998 American Automobile Association Lifesaving Medal. This award is the highest honor given to members of the school safety patrol. 
There are roughly 500,000 members of the school safety patrol in this country, helping over 50,000 schools. Every day, these young people ensure that their peers arrive safely at school in the morning, and back home in the afternoon. 
Most of the time, they accomplish their jobs uneventfully. But on occasion, these volunteers must make split-second decisions--placing themselves in harm's way to save the lives of others. This year's honorees exemplify this selflessness, and richly deserve recognition. 
The first AAA Lifesaving Medal recipient comes from Kensington, Maryland. 
On October 1, 1997, Rock View Elementary School Safety Patrol Joseph Coggeshall was preparing to end his shift at the busy intersection of Connecticut Avenue and Denfeld Road. 
Getting ready to go home himself, Joseph noticed one last group of children heading home. He decided to stay at his post a little longer. As they reached the intersection, two boys, ages 6 and 7, attempted to go around Joseph's outstretched arms and into traffic. Reacting quickly, Joseph grabbed both children, pulling them back onto the curb just before they would have entered into rush-hour traffic on a six-lane highway. Joseph probably saved those boys' lives. 
This year's second AAA Lifesaving Medal honoree comes from San Mateo, California. 
On January 5, 1998, St. Timothy School Safety Patrol Christopher Aquino stood his usual post at the north gate crosswalk. 
Close by, a father led his two young daughters, ages 3 and 6, toward the crosswalk. Spotting the family car parked across the street, the 3-year-old broke free from her father's hand, sprinted into the road and into the path of an oncoming truck. On instinct, and with no regard for his own safety, Christopher ran after her, grabbed her by the hand and returned her safely to her father. 
Mr. President, on behalf of the Senate, I wish to extend congratulations and thanks to these two young men. They are an asset to their communities, and their families, and neighbors should be very proud of their courage and dedication. 
I would also like to recognize the American Automobile Association for providing the supplies and training necessary to keep the safety patrol on duty nationwide. 
Since the 1920's, AAA clubs across the country have been sponsoring student safety patrols to guide and protect younger classmates against traffic accidents. Easily recognizable by their fluorescent orange safety belt and shoulder strap, safety patrol members represent the very best of their schools and communities. Experts credit school safety patrol programs with helping to lower the number of traffic accidents and fatalities involving young children. 
We owe AAA our gratitude for their tireless efforts to ensure that our Nation's children arrive to and from school safe and sound. 
And we owe our thanks to Joseph Coggeshall and Christopher Aquino for their selfless actions. The discipline and courage they displayed deserves the praise and recognition of their schools and their communities.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to salute an outstanding young woman who has been honored with the Girl Scout Gold Award by Girl Scouts of the Black Hills Council in Rapid City, SD. Kimberly Schubert of Rapid City was honored yesterday for earning the highest achievement award in U.S. Girl Scouting. 
The Girl Scout Award symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community service, career planning and personal development. The award can be earned by girls ages 14-17, or in grades 9-12. 
Girl Scouts of the USA, an organization serving over 3 million girls, has awarded more than 20,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to Senior Girl Scouts since the inception of the program in 1980. To receive the award, a Girl Scout must earn 4 interest projects patches, the Career Exploration pin, the Senior Girl Scout leadership award, and the Senior Girl Scout Challenge, as well as design and implement a Girl Scout Gold Award project. A plan for fulfilling these requirements is created by the Senior Girl Scout and is carried out through close cooperation between the girl and an adult Girl Scout volunteer. 
As a member of the Girl Scouts of the Black Hills Council, Kim Schubert began working toward the Gold Scout Award in 1996. She completed her project in the areas of sports and leadership, and she richly deserves the public recognition for this significant service to her community and her country.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, first of all, let me compliment the distinguished manager of the bill and the ranking member for the level of debate that has already occurred on this important piece of legislation. I have extraordinary respect for both Senators and I appreciate the manner in which they have presented this critical matter to the U.S. Senate. 
In listening to the debate on S. 1873, I am struck by the appearance that rigid adherence to ideology seems to be trumping the sound judgment of this Nation's senior military leaders. 
The proponents of this latest attempt to deploy ballistic missile defenses at any cost have entitled this bill the American Missile Protection Act. But I think it is important that we be clear as to what this really legislation does. The only thing S. 1873 protects, is the opportunity for defense contractors to move far ahead of where we ought to be with regard to a commitment to develop and deploy national ballistic missile defenses. 
As stated by the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in their letters opposing S. 1873, deployment of national missile defenses at this time is unnecessary, premature and could end our arms control efforts.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, there is no one from the Republican side of the aisle on the floor at this moment, so I do not want to propound the request until someone is available. But I do want to put our colleagues on notice that I would like very much to be able to propound a unanimous consent request within the next few minutes that would do two things: First, it would ask that Senator D'Amato be recognized to offer a bill regarding inpatient hospital care for breast cancer with a time limit of 2 hours for debate on the bill, with no amendments or motions in order thereto, and that when all time is used or yielded back, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the D'Amato bill, and that immediately upon disposition of the D'Amato bill, the Senate then proceed to the immediate consideration of the Daschle-Kennedy Patient Protection Act with a time limit of 2 hours for debate, with no amendments or motions in order thereto, and that when all time is used or yielded back, the Senate proceed to vote on the passage of the bill with all time equally divided and controlled in the usual form, and that the above occur without intervening action or debate. I would ask that those bills begin to be considered at 11 o'clock. 
As I said, Mr. President, I will not ask unanimous consent at this time simply in deference to our colleagues. But let me again explain what it is we are attempting to do here. It is our hope this week, in a very limited timeframe, that we can pass two bills of great concern and importance to this country, first and foremost, a bill that many of us have cosponsored dealing with the need to protect patients in an array of different health circumstances that they face. More and more, the American people are saying they are victimized, not assisted, by HMOs. More and more, they are saying that managed care is not working as it is supposed to. More and more, they are saying that we are facing some critical decisions that we must make if we are going to ensure that managed care and HMOs work right. 
Day after day, our caucus has come to the Senate floor recognizing the importance of calling the attention of this country to victims of our current managed care system. These victims have lost their health, and in some cases, their lives as a result of very critical decisions being made erroneously by people sitting at computers instead of by doctors and nurses in the hospital rooms and clinics of this country. 
We have introduced legislation that would provide protections to patients. It recognizes that in this HMO, managed care environment we have to do a lot better job of focusing on patients, and not on bottom-line calculations that are oftentimes used regardless of patients needs. The Patient Protection Act is absolutely essential to that effort. We also recognize that there is a need, as part of the legislation, to deal with the problem of premature release of patients when they have mastectomies. 
Senator D'Amato and Senator Feinstein and others have made a real effort to highlight that particular problem. And we are very supportive of that effort. So we hope we can pass both bills. Let us pass the Patient Protection Act. Let us pass the Feinstein-D'Amato mastectomy bill. Let us do it en bloc. Let us do it: 2 hours and 2 hours. We are prepared to do it this morning. We can get on with that and also the array of other very important technological bills that we will be bringing up. I thank very much the Senator from Montana for affording me the opportunity to make my presentation. As I noted, just as soon as we find a Republican colleague on the floor I will pose this unanimous consent request.

Mr. DASCHLE. It is our desire to see if we can find a way to take up this legislation and pass it today. And if not today, at a time certain. If we cannot do it for some reason at 11 o'clock this morning, we are prepared to set a time--perhaps June 15--perhaps right after we get back from the Memorial Day recess. If we are doing the tobacco bill next week, and we have technology bills this week, 4 hours today seems to me to be a reasonable period of time to debate both of these bills and pass them. If we cannot do it today, I think it is incumbent upon the Senate to pass this legislation at a time certain--to agree to a debate at a time certain. I am sure that will happen.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I tell the Senator from Massachusetts that, just last week, a family from South Dakota told me that if there is one thing the U.S. Senate should do this year--this year--it is pass the Patient Protection Act. It is to deal with the problems they are having with managed care. And it is to deal with the recognition that there is a growing problem out there. In poll after poll after poll, the American people are saying: We don't care what else you do, do this and do it this year. 
So I think it is very clear that the intensity level is as high as it can be. People care about this issue, and they recognize the problem. People know how difficult it is today to face managed care organizations that, in large measure, are not addressing these problems as they should. So the Senator from Massachusetts raises the right question. Do the American people want us to address this issue? The answer is not only yes, but yes with an exclamation point.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his very good statement. He raises an interesting point that I failed to mention. Oftentimes, we talk about this as a matter simply of urgency and concern for victims. Indeed, that is the greatest concern--the degree to which victims come to us with stories that they believe call out for attention to this matter. But there are now over a hundred organizations--organizations of all kinds--our doctors, our nurses, an array of working organizations in this country, including education, you name it--organizations that have come forward to say that this isn't just a health issue, this is a worker issue, this is a quality of life issue. This is an array of organizations that rarely come together on any issue. Philosophically, they go from left to right. But the fact is, they care about this issue because they know how critical it is that we solve it this year. 
So, as the Senator said, this should not take very long. Indeed, it is important that we get on with moving this legislation.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for the Conference Report on S. 1150, the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998, and to thank Senator Lugar and Senator Harkin for the tremendous effort they have devoted to this important legislation. 
Immediate passage of the conference report is critical for agriculture research funding, crop insurance, and nutrition funding for legal immigrants. The legislation represents desperately needed investment in agricultural research, essential to the continuing production of safe, plentiful, diverse, and affordable food and fiber. Furthermore, failure to pass this legislation will result in massive reductions in crop insurance delivery around the country, especially in high risk areas such as the Northern Great Plains. 
Not only will terminated policies expose farmers to tremendous risk of crop loss due to events beyond their control, such as weather, but without crop insurance, producers will not be able to take out operating loans essential to planting crops. This will hit young, beginning farmers hardest, which is terrible for agriculture--losing these young producers truly threatens the future of the industry. 
When the last farm bill was passed, farmers nationwide were promised increased access to risk management tools. This promise was made in exchange for the elimination of a wide range of commodity and disaster programs that had, until then, provided producers some protection against the potentially devastating shocks that occur in agriculture. 
Last year, the Dakotas were devastated by extended below freezing temperatures, winter storms that dumped record levels of snow, and spring flooding worse than anyone living had ever seen. Even with the benefit of crop insurance we lost hundreds of producers and farms that had been in families for over 100 years. I cannot imagine what would be left of the agriculture industry in South Dakota today had we not at least had the benefit of crop insurance last year. 
The northeast region of South Dakota is currently experiencing severe flooding that is not likely to subside for some time. This is in an area that has been characterized by good farm land for as long as anyone can remember. No one could have anticipated that the farms in these counties and so many of the roads that connect them would be under water today. A strong and affordable crop insurance program will be critical to producers in this area who are struggling to stay in business. Without it, there would be an exodus from this part of my state, which would destroy the economy of the entire region. It is in all of our interest to provide our nation's agriculture producers with the means to insulate their businesses and the local economies of which they are an essential part against conditions like those we experienced statewide last year, and that our northeast corner is fighting now. 
I also want to stress the tremendous importance of the research reauthorization in this conference report. We owe much of the credit for this country's agricultural success to our network of land grant institutions, state agriculture experiment stations, USDA's Agricultural Research Service, and hundreds of county extension offices. These entities work together in a wide range of ways to produce cutting-edge research and then convert it into improved practices and technology meaningful to producers. This report places increased emphasis on collaboration among institutions and disciplines, and encourages pursuit of goals benefiting more than one region or state. 
The land grant university in my state, South Dakota State University, currently has a highly regarded record of strong interdisciplinary and multi-state cooperative work. I am extremely proud of the fine research and extension SDSU produces, and I am pleased that this legislation will foster their efforts. It helps level the playing field for small schools competing for limited research funds, and it is sensitive to the relative importance of formula funds for institutions in agrarian states with low populations. 
I am pleased that this legislation preserves existing programs that target emerging and critical issues such as the Fund for Rural America. The Fund for Rural America was designed to provide immediate, flexible, and applied research and support to people in rural areas who are adjusting to rapid changes in the agricultural sector since the last farm bill. 
The Fund also promotes value-added processing, which is vital to successful rural economic development. Our rural communities must capture more of the revenue their locally produced commodities ultimately generate. Value-added processing keeps that revenue local, which will be critical to the future of those communities. 
In conclusion, I cannot overemphasize the importance of this legislation and its prompt passage. If we are to maintain our place in the world as a leader in agriculture production and technology, we absolutely must invest in agriculture research today. If we are to have a vital and diverse agriculture sector in the future, we also must ensure producers have access to reliable and affordable risk management tools like the federal crop insurance program. 
The overwhelming bipartisan support for the agriculture conference report is a tribute to the commitment Senator Lugar and Senator Harkin have made to assuring passage of this critical legislation. I urge my colleagues to approve the report in its current form.

We are simply saying, let's debate the D'Amato bill for 2 hours, and then let's debate the Daschle-Kennedy bill for 2 hours. They both deal with protections for patients. They both deal with the need to confront the array of problems we are facing in managed care today. So I am very disappointed the majority has chosen to take this action, and I hope if we can't do it today, perhaps we can do it on the 15th. So let me ask unanimous consent that on a date no later than June 15, both bills be considered in the order that I have just described.

I will put forward a new proposal for my colleague and friend from New York. I would propose that we take up the D'Amato bill today, that we debate it as he suggests so long as by June 15, or at any date in June that would be of his choosing, we can take up and debate the Patient Protection bill for whatever time it takes. If it is complex, let's debate it. If it ought to be amended, let's debate it. If the Senator from New York is prepared to give me that opportunity, to say in June we will take up patient protections with amendments, we will have the debate on his bill today and my bill in June. I would make that proposal to the Senator from New York, reserving the right to object.

Mr. DASCHLE. Continuing to reserve the right to object, since my colleague from New York did now object to my counterproposal, I am flabbergasted. I am absolutely flabbergasted that the Senator from New York would say, since we have not seen action on our bill, we should take up his bill. And why are we taking up his bill under these circumstances? Because the Finance Committee has not acted. That is the reason. We are going to go around the Finance Committee to go straight to the floor, and he is saying we shouldn't go around the Labor Committee to go straight to the floor for the Patient Protection Act. 
So let there not be any confusion here as to what is going on. Everyone ought to know this. This is as glaring as the lights themselves. Our Republican colleagues, for whatever reason, are denying the opportunity to consider a Patient Protection Act, today, tomorrow or any other day. And they are hiding behind the mastectomy bill to do it. 
Well, let's not hide behind any legislation. Let's strip away all the rhetoric. They do not want to do it. They simply do not want to do it. I don't know why they don't want to do it, given that about 80 or 90 percent of the American people are demanding we do it, but they can explain it. 
No one should be misled here. The problem is not that we are combining the two bills. I have just released them. There isn't any connection anymore. We will take up the Feinstein-D'Amato bill today and take up the Patient Protection Act in the next couple of months. Just let us take it up. That is all we are asking. 
So, Mr. President, I am really astounded at that logic and that rationale. But I don't think anybody is misled here. They don't want to take up the patient protection legislation, and I am very disappointed, and I think the American people would be as well.

Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, let me just say the Senator from New York has said on several occasions now that this has not been the subject of any hearings. The Labor Committee has dealt with this issue at more than seven hearings, hearings that have brought people in from around the country, talking about this particular problem and about how serious it is. There has been one meeting in the subcommittee of the Finance Committee on his bill. 
So let's talk about hearings. Let's talk about the array of people who have come forth and said, `Why are you waiting? Why aren't you moving ahead with this legislation?' I don't have an answer to that. Our caucus is attempting to promote the opportunity for all people to be heard on this issue. 
The Senator from New York also made mention of the fact that his bill deals with mastectomy, and it is a very important contribution. I applaud Senator Feinstein and others for making the effort, as they have, to get to this point. But his legislation is very, very narrowly focused. 
He said he supports clinical trials. We want to give him the opportunity to vote for it. He says he supports access to specialists. We want to give him the opportunity to vote for it. He wants to protect the information, the records of patients. Let's give him and others a chance to vote for it. That is what our bill does. It goes way beyond simply the right, that a woman 
surely should have, to be more confident about her ability to get the proper treatment when in a situation as sensitive as a mastectomy. But let's provide them the protection through clinical trials. Let's ensure that they can see necessary specialists. Let's ensure that their records are going to be protected. Let's do it all. Let's not do half a job, let's do the whole job. That is what we are talking about here. 
So I object.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend both the chairman and the Democratic manager for their work on this bill over the last couple of days. I commend them for all that they have done. I think we will see a very strong vote as final passage is recorded this afternoon. It is largely to their credit. 
I particularly want to commend my colleague Senator Kerrey for the tremendous job that he has done over the course of now more than 12 months of work in an effort that has led to the point where we will pass what has been, at times, a very controversial issue. To see the overwhelming vote today is a tribute to him and to the leadership that he showed on the Commission and on the floor, and certainly in the committee. 
While I have made no reservations about the difficulty many of us have with regard to the offset, an offset that I hope can be addressed in conference, an offset that will cost the Treasury and U.S. taxpayers some $46 billion--if it is possible to say `except for that,' I will say: Except for that, this legislation is a major accomplishment that deserves the support on both sides of the aisle. 
The other day, I was visiting on the Capitol steps with a group of high school students from Spearfish, SD. When I told them the Senate would vote this week on IRS reform, they actually burst into wild applause. That is not the usual reaction I get when I talk with people back home about what Congress is up to. So, today they will be pleased to learn that their cheers were heard and that we are changing the IRS as we know it. 
Fortunately, the students didn't ask about the history of the IRS reform bill, because they already knew from their studies how a bill is supposed to become law. It might have been difficult to explain why this bill has taken such an unusual route. 
We could have and should have passed IRS reform 6 months ago. The House did. They passed it 426 to 4 last November. The IRS reform legislation was the last thing we attempted to pass in the Senate last year and the first bill Democrats tried to pass when we reconvened in January. But in the last 6 months, between the time the House passed the bill and now, 120 million Americans filed tax returns without the benefit of the protections of this bill, 2 million taxpayers received audit notices, many millions more received collection notices, and not one of them had the protections of this bill either. That is unfortunate and, in my view, unnecessary. 
But that is behind us. Despite the slow road this bill has traveled, I am glad that we are finally able to vote on it today. So are those high school students from Spearfish, whom I talked to out on the Capitol steps on Tuesday. So are America's 120 million taxpayers. 
The bill fundamentally changes the management and operation of the IRS. I will support this bill because it will make the IRS more accountable to, and respectful of, taxpayers. It will help transform the culture of the IRS to make customer service a top priority, the same as it is in the best-run private businesses. 
Charles Rossotti, the new IRS Commissioner, has created a plan to do all of that. This bill gives him the tools he needs to carry out that plan and really begin shaking things up within that very troubled agency. This bill creates an outside board of directors for the IRS, who will ensure that the agency adopts practices that restore the balance of power between law-abiding 
taxpayers and the IRS employees. It explicitly bans the use of tax collection quotas as a tool for evaluating the effectiveness both of individual IRS employees and of whole divisions within the agency. This is a big step in the right direction. From now on, tax auditors will now be judged by the quality of the service they provide, not the quantity of money they collect. 
Make no mistake, tax cheaters cheat us all, and the IRS should enforce our laws to the letter. But the sort of heavyhanded tactics that have been used by the IRS against some private citizens and businesses should absolutely never be tolerated. Under this bill, they will not be. 
One of the ironies about the 6-month delay is that, while we have more answers about some things, we are now faced with a bigger question that didn't exist back in November. Last year, the Congress made a stand for fiscal responsibility by enacting a plan that would balance the Federal budget for the first time in 30 years. Speeches extolling the virtues of fiscal restraint echoed through this Chamber. And I ask my colleagues, is this bill consistent with the spirit of last year's historic balanced budget agreement? Is it consistent with our commitment to use the budget surplus to save Social Security first? Regrettably, the answer, as I noted a moment ago, is no. 
Since this bill left the House, its price tag has more than tripled, and instead of paying for the added costs, the Senate has chosen, as it did so often in the days before the balanced Budget Act, to fudge it. This bill plugs the deficit hole in the first 10 years by creating an even bigger one--an estimated $46 billion hole in the second 10 years. As if this were not irresponsible enough, it creates that deficit by providing a new tax break that can only be used by people making more than $100,000 a year. 
We know from recent experience how hard it is to balance the budget. We know there is no free lunch. So, who is it that will end up paying for this smoke-and-mirrors gimmick? The 95 percent of Americans making less than $100,000 a year? That is who, unfortunately, will be left paying that bill--the same people who are depending upon these budget surpluses to preserve their Social Security and Medicare benefits in the next century. This bill was supposed to be about protecting taxpayers, not fleecing them when they are not looking or before they are even born. 
I will vote for this bill because the IRS is in dire need of reform. We have kept the new Commissioner waiting long enough for the authority he needs to do the job. More to the point, we have kept the American people waiting long enough for a new and better IRS. But I implore our conferees, don't ignore the funding problem in this bill. Fix it, so that the bill provides protection for taxpayers in the fullest sense of the word. 
The American people want us to make the IRS more accountable. This bill will do that. At the same time, we must remember there is another important issue the American people want us to address. That is: What are we going to do to help families earn more money and keep more of the money they earn? That is why those high school students from Spearfish cheered. They assumed that, by passing an IRS reform bill, we are doing something that will improve the financial circumstances of working families. That is what the people in South Dakota and across the country really want Congress to do. If we don't do that, any `bounce' we get from this bill will be very short-lived. 
Last year, we agreed on a 5-year plan to balance the Federal budget and at the same time invest in the citizens and the future of this great Nation. We are now in the process of crafting a budget that is the first real test of our ability to live within that agreement. In the coming weeks, as we debate the budget, let us keep our word on education and on child care and on health care. Last year we lightened the tax load on middle-class families by creating a new $500 child tax credit and a $1,500 tax credit for college expenses. In the coming weeks, as we debate the budget, let us further that commitment to tax fairness, not walk away from it. 
This year, for the first time in 30 years, we will actually have a balanced Federal budget. In the coming weeks, as we debate the budget, let us remember how hard it has been to eliminate the deficit and what good has come from this fiscal discipline. Let us do nothing that would send us back to where we were 5 years ago, when we were looking at $300-billion-a-year deficits for as far as the eye could see. 
The IRS bill is long overdue, but it is only a start. What the American people also want us to do is, they want us to provide them with some assurance that if they work hard and play by the rules, they will be able to make a decent life for themselves and their families. So let us pass this bill. And, in what little time we have remaining in this Congress, let us work together to keep the commitment we made last year to the issues and the matters and the priorities that really can make a difference in people's lives. 
If we do that, the next time one of us is visiting on the steps of the Capitol with some young people from our State, we will be able to tell them something else they can cheer a lot about. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the time has come for the Senate to take appropriate steps to ensure that our work force is equipped to meet the challenges we will face in the next century. Today, high-skill, high-wage jobs are being created faster than they can be filled. This is not because of a labor shortage. Instead we are suffering from a `skill shortage.' Not enough workers in this country possess the skills necessary to fill these jobs. In order to keep our economy strong and growing, our people must receive the education and training they need to become productive employees in the 21st century. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act of 1997 (WIPA) is the first step in providing the education and training job seekers need to compete for high-wage jobs. This bill would consolidate many narrowly-focused federal vocational education, adult education and job training programs that currently provide a disjointed approach to job training and job placement. Through the establishment of `one-stop' customer service centers, job seekers will have a central point of entry to job training programs. These one-stop centers will also offer `individual training accounts' allowing job seekers to choose their preferred type of education and job training programs to better accommodate their individual skills or interests. Finally, one-stop centers will provide applicants and employers alike with a centralized source of information about training and employment opportunities available in the area. 
WIPA's goal of streamlining our many training programs bears great similarity to legislation I introduced in January, 1997, called the Working Americans Opportunity Act. Reforming and improving our nation's job training system has long been a Democratic priority. I am glad to see strong, bipartisan support for WIPA and look forward to working with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to enact this important legislation. 
The passage of this legislation is of particular importance to the people of South Dakota, where we have recently experienced large scale layoffs in Huron with the closing of the Dakota Pork processing plant, and in Lead with cutbacks at the Homestake Gold mine. People in my home state have been drastically affected by these layoffs. It is my hope that these programs will enable them to receive the training they need to compete for the high-wage jobs of tomorrow. 
I believe it is very important that any investment we make in education and training produces positive, measurable results. That's why I am pleased this bill ensures that each training provider and agency administering state and local programs is held to a higher level of accountability than in the past. These agencies will be responsible for monitoring and reporting job placement, job retention and average earnings for program graduates. If a program is not performing up to acceptable standards, it will no longer be eligible to receive public funding. 
It is of particular importance that we act quickly on this bill. Unless it is signed into law by June 1, the Department of Labor will not be able to implement Youth Opportunity Grants. This grant program invests money in poverty-stricken areas to help youth who have left school to get year-round jobs. Appropriations for these grants are contingent on the authorization of the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. This worthwhile program deserves a chance to be implemented as it was intended. 
By working in a bipartisan way to reform vocational education and job training programs, I believe that we can, during this Congress, create opportunities for American workers that will help to keep our economy strong for the next century.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on behalf of colleagues, both Republican and Democrat, I, too, rise to congratulate our distinguished colleague on this remarkable achievement. 
Just to remind Senators, Senator Byrd began building this unsurpassed record more than 39 years ago. On January 8, 1959, Senator Byrd cast his first vote in the U.S. Senate. Fittingly, it was a vote on Senate procedure. On April 27, 1990, Senator Byrd cast his 12,134 vote, earning him the record for greatest number of rollcall votes in Senate history. On July 27, 1995, he became the first Senator in history to cast 14,000 votes, and now he has built on his record number of rollcall votes to be the first person in Senate history to cast 15,000 votes. 
To place this record in some historical context, Senator Byrd cast the first of his 15,000 votes with Senators John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson here in the chamber with him. When he cast his first vote, Hawaii had not yet become a State, and the United States had not yet put a man in space. 
Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this record is Senator Byrd's lifetime attendance record. Over 39 plus years, Senator Byrd has stood in this well or voted from his chair on 98.7 percent of the votes cast. 
Every one of my colleagues knows the day-to-day pressures of Senate life. We all attend countless hearings and meetings with constituents. We travel thousands of miles to our States and within our States and sometimes attend overseas fact-finding missions like the one just returned from Bosnia. Sometimes these commitments do not match the uncertain schedule of the Senate. 
But for more than 39 years, Senator Byrd has managed to run the Senate as Majority Leader. He has chaired the Senate Appropriations Committee. He has studied and written volumes on the history of the Senate. 
He has earned his place as the unrivaled expert on Senate rules. And he has become perhaps the most popular political figure in West Virginia history, all while making nearly 99 out of 100 rollcall votes on the Senate floor. Not just votes on important treaties or landmark legislation, but countless Monday and Friday votes and late night rollcalls on routine procedural motions. 
Mr. President, future historians will write about Senator Byrd's remarkable impact on this chamber as an orator, a parliamentary expert, a Senate historian, a legislative tactician, and a remarkable leader. 
He has achieved a number of records in both West Virginia and Senate history. He has held more legislative offices than anyone else in the history of his State. He is the longest-serving Senator in the history of his State. And he has held more leadership positions in the U.S. Senate than any other Senator in history. 
For all his grand achievements, Senator Byrd has performed the most basic requirement of a Senator more times than any other Senator in history. But we recognize and respect the senior Senator from West Virginia for the quality as well as the quantity of his service in the Senate. 
During his 15,000 Senate votes, Senator Byrd has been here observing history, participating in history, and now occupies an important new place in the history of this institution. 
Again, I commend him. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the majority leader has spoken well about the difficulty of this agreement. This was, I told him, one of the more difficult, if not the most difficult we have had in some time. I could name 30 Senators on this side of the aisle who have very important amendments, who are very concerned about the lack of an opportunity to offer these amendments on this bill or on other bills. So I, first, thank them for their cooperation and for their support in allowing us to move forward, as we are tonight. I believe there must come a time when this pent-up demand to offer some of this legislation has to be addressed. I will be speaking with the majority leader about that as we go through the schedule for the next couple of weeks. 
I might say, a major factor--and I have indicated this to the majority leader--in our ability to reach this agreement was his assurance that we were also going to take up, in a timely way, some other very critical pieces of legislation this agreement allows us to take up. First and foremost is a crop insurance and research bill that I have assured my colleagues will be taken up, if at all possible, this week. We don't know how long the amendment process will take. But the majority leader has assured me it is the next bill. So I thank him for that and, as I have indicated to him privately and I will say again publicly, that was a major consideration. Another was our strong desire to get on with the consideration of the tobacco bill. The majority leader has assured me that we will do that as well. 
So we have an array of matters that must be addressed. It was in keeping with our understanding of the workload this month that a lot of our Democratic colleagues were willing to concede the recognition of the importance of this particular agreement. 
Let me address what I hope is not a misunderstanding. I don't know of any particular agreement with regard to the bill referred to by the distinguished Senator from New York, except to say that I am very sympathetic with what he is attempting to do. Many of our colleagues on this side of the aisle will wish to be heard on that bill and will wish to offer amendments. So I will work with the majority leader to schedule some time for us to consider this bill, and we will do our best to accommodate all Senators as they are called upon to debate and offer their amendments. But we will negotiate in good faith and attempt to come up with the best agreement we can.

Mr. DASCHLE. I only have two final points, Mr. President. The first is that this is the 6-month anniversary of the passage of this legislation in the House of Representatives. We cannot afford to wait any longer. We must pass this bill. The urgency is recognized by this agreement. I appreciate that very much. 
The final point is that there are a number of Senators who, in good faith, will be offering amendments they truly believe are relevant. I don't know how one defines the relevance of amendments, but I hope we can work with our Parliamentarian and with the Presiding Officers to accommodate our colleagues, as relevance is contemplated and defined. This is a very important matter for a lot of Senators. This is a rare vehicle that they will have to offer legislation. I am hopeful we can accommodate as many Senators as possible with relevant amendments. 
Again, I thank all cooperating Senators and appreciate, once more, the chance to resolve this matter with the majority leader. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to take just a moment on the passage of this important resolution to thank Stewart Balderson for his nearly four decades of distinguished service, as has been referenced in the resolution, and wish him well as he begins the next chapter of his life. 
Stuart Balderson truly is an institution within an institution. 
He began his career in the Senate finance office when he was 22--and Lyndon Johnson was still the Majority Leader. 
He has stayed there for 38 years--through the tenure of 12 Senate Secretaries--working in every department: payroll, accounting, retirement and benefits, and legislative budgeting. 
In 1980, he assumed the top position in that office, Financial Clerk of the United States Senate. 
I first came to the Senate in 1973, as a staffer for another South Dakota Senator. 
As anyone who has ever worked here knows, the finance office is one of the first offices you visit after you're hired. You go there to fill out your W4 and your insurance forms and other necessary pieces of paper. 
From that day until today, I have been impressed with the efficient and friendly service in that office. And I believe that is a direct reflection of the man who has run it so well, and for so long. 
I am not alone in my admiration. 
In 1992, Stuart Balderson was named `Congressional Staffer of the Year,' by Roll Call newspaper. He was given the award at the Senate Staff Club Dinner Dance. 
That night, in his acceptance speech, he said of this Senate, `I love the institution, and I work very, very hard for its financial integrity.' 
He went on to regale his fellow diners with his recollections of what the Senate was like back in 1960, when he came here. 
He recalled how giants like Everett Dirksen, Hubert Humphrey and Sam Ervin used to drop by the finance office just to chat. There was a real `sense of family' on the Hill back then, he said. Everyone knew everyone. 
He said he also remembered thinking that he would `never get anywhere here, because it looked to me like everyone had been here forever, and wouldn't leave until they died at their desks. 
`But, I quickly found out,' he added, `that these people were the sources of knowledge and wisdom, and I found myself calling on them constantly.' 
Clearly, Stuart Balderson was wrong in thinking he'd never go anywhere in the Senate finance office. 
But he was right about another thing: The dedicated men and women who have served this Senate for years truly are sources of knowledge and wisdom--for all of us. 
They are our institutional memory, and our connection to a different time--a time when people on the Hill focused less, perhaps, on party labels, and more on common goals. 
Over the years, Stuart Balderson has earned his place among those sages. 
I know I speak for countless Senators and Senate staffers when I say, we will miss his professionalism, and dedication, and his ever-friendly manner. 
We thank him for his many years of impeccable service to this great institution. And we wish him all the best on his retirement. 
I yield the floor. I thank my colleague.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the question of whether to expand the NATO alliance is one of the most important foreign policy decisions this Senate has been called upon to make since the fall of the Berlin Wall. 
We will make history with this vote. So it would seem appropriate to consult history before we cast it. That's what I did the other day. I re-read some of the debate that took place in this chamber 49 years ago, when our predecessors, in the tumultuous years following the Second World War, had the courage and foresight to commit our own nation to this alliance. 
One of the chief supporters was Arthur Vandenberg, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Vandenberg, a Republican from Michigan, predicted that NATO would become `the greatest war deterrent in history.' 
History has proven him right. Because of NATO, a region that produced two cataclysmic wars in this century has now known a half-century of peace and stability. Those of us who were born after the Second World War tend to take that for granted. But in fact, it is a remarkable accomplishment. 
Just as the map of Europe was redrawn at the end of World War II, it has been redrawn again with the end of the Cold War. Nations that once marched in lockstep with totalitarian dictatorships have been transformed into struggling young democracies. 
It is time for us to redefine NATO to match the new map, the new reality, of this post-Cold War world. 
Enlarging NATO's circle of security to include the new democracies of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic is not only in the best interests of those nations. It is in the best interests of the entire European continent. And, it is in the national security interest of the United States. 
For these reasons, I intend to vote for ratification of the treaty expanding NATO. And I urge my colleagues to do so as well. 
I do not underestimate the seriousness of this action, nor do I take lightly the thoughtful arguments some of my fellow Senators have made against ratification of this treaty. 
As I see it, there are essentially four such arguments. In making my own decision, I have wrestled with each of them. And I would like to share with you some of my thoughts on them. 
First, though, I want to read something from a man who has thought very deeply about these arguments, and about the future of Europe: the President of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel. President Havel is among the most articulate supporters of the treaty we are now considering. 
`As I follow the debate over whether NATO should be enlarged,' he has written, `I have the strong sense that the arguments are often purely mechanical, somehow missing the real meaning of the alliance. `The process of expansion must be accompanied by something much deeper: a refined definition of the purpose, mission and identity of NATO. 
`The alliance,' he continues, `should urgently remind itself that it is first and foremost an instrument of democracy intended to defend mutually held and created political and spiritual values. `It must see itself not as a pact of nations against a more of less obvious enemy, but as a guarantor of Euro-American civilization, and thus a pillar of global security.' 
Does NATO exist to defend a fixed list of nations, chosen 49 years ago, against an enemy that no longer exists? Or does it need to respond to the new threats we face by including, under NATO's collective security umbrella, the three countries that have demonstrated not only a deep commitment to democracy, but a willingness to defend it? That is the fundamental question in this debate. 
The answer, in my view, is yes. We should expand NATO to include the new democracies of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
There are, as I said, four other questions as well. They also deserve serious reflection. 
The first is: What effect would expanding NATO to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have on Russia's relations with the West--particularly its relations with the United States? 
Russia clearly would prefer that we not expand NATO. Given their history, that is understandable. Russia lost 20 million people in the Second World War. 
Despite assurances from NATO that no troops or nuclear weapons will be stationed in the three new member nations, there are those in Russia who remain fearful of an expanded NATO, and others who are trying to exploit those fears to weaken the hands of Russian democratic reformers. This is troubling, because it is clearly in our national interest to see Russia fully engaged with the West. 
There is evidence, however, that Russian leaders wish to continue that engagement. Russia's willingness last year to sign the NATO-Russia Founding Act is one example of Russia's commitment to improved relations with the West. Perhaps an even better example is Russia's continued active participation in the international peacekeeping effort in Bosnia. 
Some of my colleagues cite fear of antagonizing Russia as a reason to reject this treaty. While I respect their opinion, I do not believe this concern warrants such action, and I cite as evidence Russia's own actions. 
We must remember what Secretary of State Albright calls the `productive paradox' at the core of NATO. That is, by demonstrating that we are willing to defend our allies, we dramatically reduce the chances that we will ever actually have to commit troops to do so. 
This has been true in the past, and I believe it will remain true in the future. 
A second question we must address is the price of enlargement. 
It is important that we be clear from the very start: There are costs associated with expanding NATO. And, while most of these costs will be borne by the new member nations, some of the costs will fall to existing members of the alliance, including the United States. 
The initial estimates of the costs to the US were quite high. Two things have happened in the last year, however, to reduce projections of those costs. 
First, NATO invited three members to join the alliance instead of four, the number on which earlier estimates were based. 
Second, and more significant, the military committee of NATO conducted a thorough analysis of the three potential new members and found that their military infrastructures were in better shape than had been assumed. As a result, the cost of bringing them in line with NATO standards is projected to be considerably less. 
The new, more accurate estimates put the cost to US at an average of $40 million a year for 10 years. 
I am not suggesting for a minute that this is a small amount. It's not. But compare it to the price of some pieces of military hardware. One Blackhawk helicopter costs $10 million. One Harrier jump jet costs $27 million. One F-15 Eagle fighter costs $43 million. One Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile costs $53 million. And one B-2 bomber costs $2 billion--five times more than the entire 10-year cost of expanding NATO. 
No, $400 million over 10 years is not a small amount. But if it can help extend stability and security in central and eastern Europe, it is not a bad bargain. 
It is also important to note, Mr. President, that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will be compelled to modernize their defenses--whether or not they join NATO. 
If that modernization takes place within NATO's framework, however, we avoid the risk of re-nationalizing militaries that have caused so much instability in Europe in the past. 
The third question we must consider is if, in expanding NATO, we are simply drawing new lines in the sand, and thus creating the potential for new conflicts. 
Again, I want to quote President Havel, who has also considered the consequences of refusing to erase the old lines. `If this way of thinking prevails,' he warns, `it will turn the alliance into a hopelessly antiquated club of Cold War veterans.' 
We can't allow that to happen. 
It is not this Senate, or the NATO alliance, that erased the old dividing lines of Yalta. History erased those lines. The power of freedom and democracy erased those lines. We must not maintain an obsolete line in Europe because we are afraid of drawing a new line. We must not let fear of an old enemy keep us from embracing a new ally. 
Hitler and Stalin helped draw the line that placed Poland and Hungary and the Czech Republic on the wrong side of freedom in 1944. By admitting these nations to NATO, we are erasing that line. 
Finally, there is a fourth question that some have raised in this debate. That is, when will we next consider expanding NATO? And which nations should we consider? 
I believe that question is premature. We should remain open-minded. But we haven't yet approved the first expansion. We need to see this process through and carefully and thoroughly evaluate it before we can make any sort of informed decision about admitting additional new members to the alliance. I see no reason why we should commit ourselves to a fixed timetable or list of additional entrants now. 
The danger in Europe today does not come from a totalitarian superpower. The danger in Europe today comes from aggressive nationalism and terrorism and the spread and misuse of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. 
By bringing Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into NATO's circle of security and democracy, we will strengthen the bulkhead against these destructive forces. We will bolster NATO's fighting capacity by adding 200,000 troops. We will add geographically significant territory to the alliance. We will increase NATO's understanding of these new threats, and thus its ability to head them off. 
And all of this, Mr. President, is in the United States' national security interest. 
When the Berlin Wall fell, it answered the prayers of millions of people all over the world. It also created a new landscape in Europe. Extending NATO membership to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will help ensure that democracy and freedom fill that landscape, rather than old hatreds and outdated ideologies. 
In his first speech as President of Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel described his dream for his country. 
`I dream,' he said, `of a republic independent, free, and democratic, of a republic economically prosperous and yet socially just, in short, of a humane republic which serves the individual and which therefore holds the hope that the individual will serve it in turn.' 
In the years since the Berlin Wall collapsed, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic all have made great strides toward achieving that dream. They have demonstrated that they meet NATO's standards for membership, and that they can contribute to the alliance in a meaningful way. 
For all these reasons, I will vote to expand the NATO Treaty to include these three new democracies, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will yield the floor in just a moment. But let me, while he is on the floor, congratulate the distinguished Senator from Delaware for his magnificent leadership over the course of the last several days. I said to him privately, and I will say it at this point for the Record, that this was one of his finest hours. This was a time when we needed his leadership, when we needed his expertise, when we could count on him to guide us through this very difficult period. He has done so, as he does on so many occasions, with eloquence, with passion, with expertise, and with a degree of credibility that I think suits this Senate and suits him extraordinarily well. I congratulate him on his achievement. 
I congratulate the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and others who have had so much to say with regard to our achievement tonight. This, indeed, is a very historic moment. I am honored to be a part of it. I am honored to serve with colleagues who led us so well during this debate. 
I again congratulate each and every one of them. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last night, Senator Robert C. Byrd was awarded the Congressional Award Program's highest honor, the Leadership Award. This award is given to someone who has exhibited extraordinary leadership in support of programs which benefit our Nation's youth and the Congressional Award Program. We all know Senator Byrd as a skilled legislator, master of the Senate's rules and procedures, award-winning historian of the United States Senate, a man of great honor and personal integrity, a fine example of true leadership, a colleague, and a friend. We may not be fully aware of his tireless efforts on behalf of the children of this country. The Leadership Award is presented each year to individuals who have displayed outstanding commitment to improving the lives of young Americans and who have provided critical support to the Congressional Award program in its efforts to make the Award a national opportunity for all of our young people. 
Senator Byrd knows only too well the hardships many of our children face: plagued by poverty, challenged by a culture which all too often fails to glorify the values essential to a civil society, facing violence not present when we grew up, a world without the kinds of heroes that inspired Senator Byrd to personal achievement and a life of service to others. As he so clearly articulated last night at the Congressional Award's annual dinner and program, heroes fuel in us a desire for personal development. And Senator Byrd found out that he is a hero to many. 
Grant Hill, NBA basketball star, talked of the great honor of competing against Michael Jordan, and the equally great honor of meeting Senator Byrd, `the Michael Jordan of the Senate.' Mr. Hill was awarded the Horizon Award, which gives special recognition to individuals from the private sector who have contributed to expanding opportunities for young Americans through personal contributions to youth programs, and who have set exceptional examples for young people through their success in life. 
Congress grants only two medals: The Congressional Medal of Honor and the Congressional Award. The Congressional Award was established by Congress through P.L. 96-114. Senator Byrd was a member of the first Congressional Award Joint Leadership Commission and helped set the standards for this bipartisan program which is available to young people aged 14-23. To earn an award, participants must set and achieve individually challenging goals in volunteer community service, personal development, physical fitness and expeditions. 
Please join me in extending our congratulations to Senator Byrd for being the 1998 recipient of the Congressional Award's Leadership Award, and for receiving yet again another first: being named the `Michael Jordan of the Senate.'

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to commend an outstanding group of students from South Dakota who have participated in the We the People . . . The Citizen and The Constitution program across our state this year. The We the People . . . program is an annual nationwide competition sponsored by the Center for Civic Education. 
The We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The We the People . . . program has provided curricular materials at upper elementary, middle and high school levels for more than 75,000 teachers and 24 million students nationwide. This program is designed to help students achieve a reasoned commitment to the fundamental values and principles that bind Americans together as a people. The program also fosters civic dispositions on traits of public and private character conducive to effective and responsible participation in politics and government. 
Students from Marion High School, Harding County High School, Hot Springs High School, Rutland High School, and Spearfish High School showed a tremendous amount of talent and exhibited a great deal of diligent study in a state competition last month in Pierre, South Dakota. Students participated in simulated congressional hearings as the culminating state activity for the We the People . . . program. Each class, working in cooperative teams, prepared and presented statements before a panel of subject experts who acted as congressional committee members and posed challenging questions about the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and our democratic system. The format provided students an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge of constitutional principles and their understanding of civic responsibility. 
These teams had the support and guidance of their teacher and local advisors, which is essential in such a challenging competition. Curt Sage and Principal Mark Rockafellow from Marion High School, Paul Rystrom and Principal Allen Dvorak from Rutland High School, Marty Wood and Principal Gary Peters from Hot Springs High School, and John Pfitzer and Principal Charles Maxon from Harding County High School are to be commended for their involvement and for providing an educational environment in their schools that encourages teachers and students alike to participate in this type of program. 
The Spearfish High School team won the state competition and will be visiting Washington next week to compete in the national competition. The Spearfish team is well prepared for what will be an exciting and competitive final round here in Washington on May 2-4. The members of the Spearfish team representing South Dakota in the national finals are: Melissa Bauman, Tricia Beringer, Toni Bickford, Andy Binder, Pam Blair, Chelsea Collins, Christian Colaiacoro, Nicole Dana, Jason Delahoyde, Jacob Dell, Justin Huck, Lucas Humbracht, Sara Jensen, Brandy Lensegrav, Wade McDonald, Justin Nicholas, Eric Nies, Kirby Sand, Jason Schoental, Becky Stokes, Amy Sylvester, Mikayla Tetrault, Jonathon Watson, and James Williams. I am very proud of their accomplishments and wish them well in the national competition. 
I would also like to recognize their teachers, Patrick Gainey and Tom Freece, for their tireless efforts over many months in working with these talented students. The district coordinator, Lennis Larson, also contributed a significant amount of time and effort in working with all South Dakota schools who participate in the program. 
I commend all the South Dakotans Constitutional scholars who have participated and worked so hard. Our South Dakota student team from Spearfish is currently conducting research and preparing for the upcoming national competition. I wish the students and teacher the best of luck at the We the People . . . national finals, and I look forward to meeting them when they visit Capitol Hill and the Senate.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, drug trafficking, money laundering and drug use in prisons are significant problems that will continue to worsen unless local, state and federal governments can work more closely together to determine viable solutions. Drug trafficking and money laundering can negatively affect our society in many different ways, and the use of illegal drugs by prison inmates dramatically deceases any chance they have of getting their lives back on track after their release. Local, state and federal governments are already hard at work to determine solutions to these corrosive problems, and I am very pleased to join Senators Leahy, Cleland, Feinstein, and Kohl in introducing The Money Laundering Enforcement and Combating Drugs in Prison Act of 1998, which will provide state and federal governments with additional tools to fight drug trafficking, money laundering and drug use in prisons. 
This legislation will complement the Administration's comprehensive 10-year National Drug Control Strategy by providing federal prosecutors with additional means to seize assets linked to illegal criminal and drug activity and prevent drug kingpins and others from engaging in money laundering. Initiatives such as the Safe and Drug Free Schools Act, and the Administration's highly effective radio and TV ads currently airing in 12 pilot cities are sending the kind of anti-drug messages that must reach our young people. The Money Laundering Enforcement and Combating Drugs in Prison Act of 1998 adds to these efforts by reducing the demand for drugs by allowing states to use federal prison grant funds to test and treat drug-addicted inmates and parolees. 
This legislation will greatly enhance the efforts of prosecutors to force international criminals out of hiding by reducing their ability to shield themselves behind foreign banking laws or use other procedural tricks. Moreover, the bill will ensure that defendants arrested overseas will no longer be able to take advantage of U.S. courts to fight against extradition to this country. It would allow federal prosecutors to temporarily seize U.S. assets owned by individuals arrested overseas and thus dramatically improve the ability of law enforcement agencies to shut down drug trafficking operation based outside the United States. Drug kingpins have little regard for nation boundaries, and our nations laws must provide us with the flexibility necessary to combat them. 
Studies prove that an overwhelming majority of incarcerated individuals have been heavily influenced by drugs or alcohol, and those who are illegal drug or alcohol abusers are the most likely to be repeat offenders. If we want to stem the increase in our nation's prison population, we must determine which inmates are addicted to drugs or alcohol, reduce the availability of drugs in prisons and ensure inmates have access to the treatment they need while incarcerated. This legislation will help states meet all these goals by allowing them to use as much--or as little--of the federal prison funds they receive for drug testing and intervention and to develop a strategy to reduce drug trafficking in prisons. 
State and federal governments are waging a battle against drug kingpins, and the Money Laundering Enforcement and Combating Drugs in Prison Act of 1998 will provide much-needed assistance to these ongoing efforts. By enacting this bill, I believe we will make great strides toward removing dangerous criminals and illegal drugs from our neighborhoods. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this important legislation.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, law enforcement agencies in every state rely increasingly on criminal history record information. Suspected criminals cross state lines and move between communities, creating an unprecedented need for greater cooperation between the 50 states and between states and the federal government to share this information. It is imperative that each state be able to take advantage of emerging technologies that make this cooperation possible. It is for that reason that I am pleased to cosponsor the State Grant Program for Criminal Justice Identification, Information and Communication. This legislation will help states upgrade their criminal justice information and identification operations, assist in integrating those operations, and make those operations compatible with the FBI's communication technology. 
Revolutionary technological improvements in communication systems allow localities separated by great distances to share information instantaneously. This communication between law enforcement agencies can make the difference between locating suspects and getting them off the streets, or leaving them free to commit more crimes. I believe we have a responsibility to ensure that states have full access to new criminal history record technologies. This legislation will provide the federal financial assistance and leadership that the states need by establishing a $1.25 billion, 5-year, comprehensive federal assistance program to provide grants to every state for criminal justice identification, information and communications technologies and systems. 
In addition, grants provided under this legislation will assist states as they upgrade their fingerprint and other identification technologies so that they are compatible with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) criminal history record information systems. The FBI will soon implement 2 major information and identification initiatives, the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) and NCIC 2000, that could dramatically improve the access law enforcement agencies have to criminal history record information. IAFIS, in particular, will greatly enhance the exchange of information between the FBI and the states, providing rapid electronic submission and transfer of fingerprint and criminal history information. The states will need the funding assistance provided by this legislation to obtain the equipment necessary to derive full benefit from these new systems. 
In recent years, Congress has recognized the urgent need to secure the safety of our streets for our children and our families, and this has led to the enactment of federal initiatives, such as sexual offender registries, domestic violence initiatives, the National Child Protection Act, and the Brady National Instant Background Check System. Although these initiatives have done a great deal to protect adults and children in communities nationwide, additional steps need to be taken. The State Grant Program for Criminal Justice Identification, Information and Communication will provide assistance to states so they can take that next step. 
Criminal tracking programs have been far more effective in identifying and apprehending dangerous criminals than any other programs in recent memory, but we have an opportunity to make these tracking programs much more effective. As technology continues to improve this country's communication systems, we must make sure the states are not left behind. If the states cannot access these systems, or do not have the funding to obtain them, then this revolutionary technology will be of little help. By enacting the State Grant Program for Criminal Justice Identification, Information and Communication, we have the opportunity to improve the cooperation between law enforcement agencies nationwide. This will be instrumental in getting criminals off the streets and away from our children, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with Senator Lott in sponsoring this resolution honoring the 50th anniversary of Israel's founding. 
I had the privilege of speaking last week at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Founders Reunion in Washington. In my remarks, I quoted from one of the sages of the Torah, who told us more than 200 years ago that God could have created plants that would grow into loaves of bread. Instead, He created wheat for us to grow and mill and transform into bread. 
Why? 
Because He wanted us to be able to take part in the miracle of creation. 
And, just as the founders of the Holocaust Museum can take pride in their contribution to the creation of that memorial, so too can Israelis take great pride in their contributions to the creation of the modern State of Israel. 
In my remarks to the Holocaust Museum founders, I also cited Elie Wiesel's view that: `Survivors are understood by survivors only. They speak in code. All outsiders could do was come close to the gates.' 
That is what the Holocaust Memorial Museum allows us to do: to come close to the gates; to see; to grieve; and, finally, to learn, so that we can pass the knowledge on, from generation to generation, about what can happen when intolerance and hatred are allowed to spread unchecked. 
One of the greatest benefits of the Holocaust Museum is that it helps its millions of visitors understand why there must be an Israel. The Holocaust Museum is evidence of the fact that out of the unspeakable horror of the Holocaust has come the miracle of the creation of the State of Israel to provide a homeland for Jews around the world. Out of this tragedy has come the modern-day State of Israel, the 20th century version of the 3,000-year old historic Kingdom of Israel. 
We are introducing this resolution today to celebrate and commemorate the 50th anniversary of Israel's founding and to offer the Senate's congratulations on reaching this important landmark. 
Mr. President, fifty years is not considered long relative to the lifespan of an England, a China or an India. In the case of Israel, however, it is an eternity when we factor in the obstacles it has faced during these fifty years. 
Throughout its existence, Israel has faced an array of enemies dedicated to its destruction. It has been forced to fight six wars, battle against countless terrorist acts, survive economically in the face of widespread economic boycotts, and make its way in the world despite international criticism against it. 
This resolution commemorates not only Israel's ability to survive these odds, but also its ability to thrive and prosper in the face of these constraints and to maintain its adherence to democracy and the rule of law. Israel today is a dynamic, vibrant society committed to the same values and principles as the United States. 
Another important reason we are offering this resolution is to reiterate the strength of the partnership between the U.S. and Israel--a partnership based on shared values, interests and goals. Israel is a trusted ally and an important strategic partner. 
I would like to make the resolution's four resolved clauses part of my statement offering my best wishes to Israel on this important occasion. 
The measure resolves that the United States recognizes the historic significance of the fiftieth anniversary of the re-establishment of the sovereign and independent modern State of Israel. 
It commends the people of Israel for their remarkable achievements in building a new state and a pluralistic democratic society in the Middle East in the face of terrorism, hostility and belligerence by many of her neighbors. 
It reaffirms the bonds of friendship and cooperation which have existed between the United States and Israel for the past half-century and which have been significant for both countries. 
And it extends the warmest congratulations and best wishes to the State of Israel and her people for a peaceful and prosperous and successful future. 
Mr. President, I urge all Senators to join me in sending our congratulations to Israel on this noteworthy day.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this conference report contains many important provisions that deserve the support of the Senate. 
It authorizes Congress, at long last, to pay our overdue debt to the United Nations. It clears the way for comprehensive UN reform. The bill also includes a much-needed, major restructuring of our nation's foreign affairs agencies. 
In the years since the Cold War ended, the maps of the world have been redrawn. The reorganization plan in this bill would enable us to redraw our foreign affairs structure to match the new, post-Cold War reality. It is the product of careful and detailed negotiations, and enjoys broad, bipartisan support. 
Despite these important provisions, I regret that I will vote against this conference report, and I urge my colleagues to do likewise. The reason I oppose this report is because, in addition to its positive provisions, it also contains an extreme and extraneous provision the Senate has considered and rejected many times in the past. This provision--the so-called `Mexico City language'--would do serious damage to international family planning efforts--including efforts that have nothing to do with promoting abortion and that, in fact, help to prevent abortions. 
It would do serious damage to one of the ideals on which our own nation was founded, freedom of speech and expression. The Mexico City language would bar any agency that receives international family-planning assistance from the U.S. from using their own funds to pay for abortions, or to lobby for abortions. 
Let me repeat: This bill does not tell agencies it cannot use U.S. funds for these services. That is already prohibited under existing law. This bill tells agencies in other nations that they may not use their own funds to pay for, or lobby for, abortions, without losing all U.S. family-planning assistance. This goes far beyond what the current law prescribes. 
This body has rejected this kind of restriction in the past because we agreed it is inappropriate to place such limitations on how organizations in other nations may use their own money. Mr. President, it is still inappropriate for us to do so. But it is important to note that the Mexico City language is not simply the language this body has previously rejected. In 2 important ways, it is even more extreme. 
First, this Mexico City provision will cut funds for international family-planning services. The conference report mandates that family planning agencies in other nations may not receive one dollar in U.S. family-planning assistance unless and until they certify that they will not perform abortions with their own funds. It is true that the President may waive this restriction. But if he does so, U.S. aid for international family-planning programs for that year would be limited to $356 million--$44 million less than we are now spending. 
Second, this new version of the Mexico City language includes a provision that not only prohibits funding for any organization that lobbies to change abortions laws in other nations, as the former version did. It goes far beyond that prohibition to forbid recipients of U.S. funds from making any public statements about abortion. They are forbidden, Mr. President, even from expressing concerns about the dangers of illegal abortions. 
And the President has no authority to waive this provision. The Secretary of State has rightly labeled this restriction a `gag rule.' In no way would this provision improve the lives of women and children around the world, nor would it reduce the incidence of abortion. Instead, this gag 
rule would violate one of our country's most hallowed principles, the principle of freedom of speech. 
What kind of message would we be sending to the rest of the world if violate our founding principles? That those principles are not inalienable after all? That they may have worked 200 years ago, but they are not applicable in a modern world? 
Surely, at a time when struggling new democracies all over the world are looking for guidance and inspiration, these are not messages we want to send. But the greatest danger of these extreme and extraneous provisions is that they will not improve the lives of women and children anywhere, nor will they prevent abortions anywhere. In fact, they will have the opposite effect. They will make it more difficult for women to plan their own families. 
U.S. support of international family planning programs have immeasurably improved the lives of women in developing countries. By helping women limit the size of their families, we have enabled women to make the educational and economic gains that are essential if they, and their children, are to live longer and healthier lives. The number of women of childbearing age is increasing by 24 million every year. Now is not the time for this nation to cut back on our commitment to programs that enable women to plan their families--programs that actually reduce the incidence of abortion. 
And make no mistake, Mr. President, that would be one of the consequences if we pass this conference report. There would, inevitably, be an increase in the number of abortions. That is not something I want to see, and I know that every member of this body agrees with me on this point. 
Finally, Mr. President, it is important to note the context in which we are considering this conference report, and the implications it has for another important piece of legislation the Senate has already passed--the supplemental funding for the U.S. contribution to the International Monetary Fund. 
Last month, the Senate approved these funds overwhelmingly. The vote was 84-16. The size of that margin indicates the importance Senators attach to an adequately-funded IMF. Unfortunately, a small but vocal minority of members in the other body have expressed reluctance to vote on the IMF funding unless we give into their demands on the Mexico City issue. 
They are, in effect, holding hostage an important bill with significant national security implications, a bill that has broad, bipartisan support in the Senate, in order to force their way on a completely unrelated issue. The IMF appropriation is an insurance policy for the world economy and for countless American exporting businesses and farmers whose livelihoods depend on strong markets in Asia, Latin America, and other regions of the world. It is inappropriate and dangerous to link passage of IMF with the Mexico City restrictions. The longer we delay passage of the IMF funds, the more we expose our businesses, workers, and farmers to the risks and uncertainties of world financial markets. 
For all of these reasons, Mr. President, the Mexico City provision does not belong in either the State Department authorization bill, or the IMF supplemental. If the other body wishes to implement the Mexico City restrictions, it should debate those restrictions in the context in which they belong--in a comprehensive foreign aid authorization bill. They should not hold hostage every high-priority piece of foreign policy legislation moving through the Congress. 
It is imperative that the Senate defeat this conference report to demonstrate that we will not support such efforts at linkage either in this instance or in the future. I urge my colleagues to vote against the conference agreement.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in introducing the Medicare Home Health Equity Act of 1998. 
The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) included numerous changes to Medicare that were necessary to extend the solvency of the trust fund and increase the program's integrity. It was extremely important legislation that I strongly supported, but there was no way to know the impact of every provision it included. 
One provision of the BBA in particular, the interim payment system for home health care, locks in place inequities between regions of the country, efficient and inefficient providers, and new and older agencies. I am concerned about the impact of that provision on my state of South Dakota. 
In South Dakota, the interim payment system has raised significant concern. The interim payment system bases each agency's per patient cost limit largely on its per beneficiary cost in 1994. My concern is that South Dakota's cost per beneficiary and number of visits per patient were well below the national average in 1994. Many of the home health agencies in the state have expanded the geographic area they serve since 1994 and have added services that formerly were not available in the more rural parts of the state. Some of these agencies are the sole providers in our most rural counties. 
I have heard from Hand County Home Health Agency which primarily serves women, age 85 and older, with little family nearby and with difficult health conditions. Since 1994, the Hand County Home Health Agency has kept its costs down, but has added new services such as physical therapy and has expanded the geographic area to serve areas that no other provider covers. The agency has told me that they have to consider discontinuing the new services they cover or decreasing the geographic area they serve. Neither of these options seems acceptable to me. 
The interim payment system also creates problems between new and older agencies. In the same geographic area, where there is a new provider and an old agency, the new provider's limit will be based on the national median reimbursement. This results in significant discrepancies in reimbursement and ultimately the services that agencies can afford to deliver within the same area and market. 
Ultimately the impact of this payment system falls on beneficiaries, and this must be foremost in our minds. Senator Collins' bill would go a long way to addressing the access, quality, and equity issues that have been raised by the interim payment system in South Dakota. I am pleased to join her in beginning the dialogue on this issue that I hope will lead to construction changes for home health care patients in South Dakota and across the nation.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I would like to share with my colleagues a development that is occurring in my region with an organization that has long been an agent of change. The Missouri Basin Municipal Power Agency is a joint action agency that provides affordable electricity, through its 58 municipal utility members, to over 200,000 consumers in my home state of South Dakota, and to citizens of North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa. 
The agency was formed in 1960 to coordinate municipalities' efforts to negotiate the purchase of power and energy from the Federal government. In 1970, the Federal government informed public power systems in the region that their growing power supply needs could no longer be met through the Federal hydropower program. Missouri Basin stepped in and met the supplemental power supply of its member communities by participating in, among other arrangements, the Laramie River Station coal-fired plant, one of the cleanest coal plants in the country. 
Over the years, the agency has played a vital role in meeting the energy needs of the region. The agency has promoted integrated resource planning, carried out an aggressive tree planting program, and continued to provide its customers with affordable, reliable electricity. 
Faced with a changing electricity market, Missouri Basin this month changed its name to Missouri River Energy Services, signaling its readiness to embrace a new era in which utilities will provide many added services and benefits for their customers. Missouri River Energy Services is rising to meet this challenge admirably. 
I appreciate the work Missouri River Energy Services has done for our communities and wish the agency the best of luck as it helps forge the future of the electricity industry. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I am the last speaker on our side, and then we have one speaker left on the Republican side. It is with that understanding that I will yield such time now as I may consume. 
First of all, let me begin by commending the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts for his eloquence again just now and for his remarkable leadership on this debate for the last several days. He has been our quarterback, and he has been a real inspiration to many of us. I thank him, and I thank all of our colleagues who have done so much to contribute to this debate, who have done so in a civil way, who have done so in an enlightened way, who have done so with every good intention about raising the level of debate and talking about these critical issues, recognizing the significant difference of opinion that exists between our parties on this important matter of national concern. 
This debate started out as really a difference of opinion on how we commit about $1.6 billion in resources to education. I have noted in the past that I have great admiration for the Senator from Georgia and his interest in pursuing ways in which to improve to education. I differ with him strongly on this particular issue. We have noted on many occasions as we have made reference to his approach that the original design of this legislation did little to address the real problems we have in education. We have argued on this floor on many occasions whether, with $1.6 billion, we should give tax relief largely to those in the most successful quintile of our economic strata. I am told about $37 in tax benefits would go to the top 20 percent of income earners in our country. 
The question is, is that the best way for our Federal Government to commit these hard-earned tax dollars? Should we provide that kind of tax relief, as laudable as the intentions might be and as a different an approach as it might be? Certainly we want to encourage saving. Certainly we want to find ways to reduce the overall cost to all American families of education. The question is, is this the right way? Is this the best way? 
There are those who have argued that if you do not favor the status quo, that this is the approach we ought to be subscribing to. Mr. President, I have to say, probably of all the things that have been said on the Senate floor with regard to this issue and this debate, this is the one which perhaps I feel most vehement opposition to. 
I am an ardent opponent of the status quo in many respects. I oppose simply accepting our current situation as fact. We know that there are things we can do, that we must do. In an information age, we cannot be content to simply sit back and say, yes, this is the best we can do. We can't be content when we are not number one when it comes to math and science. We can't be content when we know that there are people who are not getting a good education because we have not made the right commitments. 
I defy anyone to challenge those of us who believe there is a better way than the underlying bill that somehow we are defending the status quo, because that could not be further from the truth. As evidence of that, I guess I would suggest, No. 1, that you look at the array of amendments that we have offered that would have changed the status quo, beginning with, first and foremost, the single most consequential reduction in property tax that we have considered on the Senate floor, at least in my lifetime. As much as $10 billion in potential property tax relief could have been part of this legislation. In my state of South Dakota, we could have reduced property taxes by as much as $25 million. If we had passed the Moseley-Braun amendment, we could have relieved the burden on state and local taxes, including property taxes, by $10 billion. We didn't have the votes. The majority voted against reducing property taxes by $10 billion. I want to change the status quo. That would have done it. That would have done it, in addition to recognizing the fact that three out of four school districts in this country have at least one school that is in dire need of repair. 
I spoke to people in a school district not long ago who shared with me the fact that, when the winds in South Dakota exceed 40 miles an hour, the school has to be evacuated. When the winds in South Dakota exceed 40 miles an hour, they have to go home. We had a chimney that fell through the third floor of one of our schools in Hartford, SD. I could go on and on. 
The fact is, we have an incredible problem with regard to infrastructure. While we legitimately commit, as we must, to highways, to bridges, to airports, and to the array of infrastructure challenges we have--and I am a strong supporter of the effort to do that--we ought to be committing to infrastructure for the most important part of our population, our children. You want to change the status quo? We should have voted to support the Moseley-Braun amendment. You want to support change in the status quo? We should have supported the after-school 
program supported and offered by the distinguished Senator from California. You want to change the status quo? We should have recognized that we have to go out and find over 100,000 new teachers in the next 3 years. That is real change in the status quo. 
Now our Republican colleagues have come back with proposals of their own to change the status quo. As the senior Senator from Massachusetts has just acknowledged, the real question now is, do we privatize public education? Because that is exactly what we will do if this bill passes and is signed into law. We would privatize public education. 
So while we started out with a bill that promised to do very little, we have ended up with one that would do real damage. We've gone from doing almost nothing for public education to doing serious damage to the fundamental appreciation of the importance in democracy of education as we have known it for 200 years. We do damage. If this legislation was ever signed into law, we would do serious damage, because we would abolish the promise of universal education for the people of the United States as we have known it. This promise has been largely responsible for the democracy that we have enjoyed with all of its richness. We would abolish all remedial education for disadvantaged children. We would abolish safe and drug-free schools. We would abolish the opportunities for schools to come to the people of the United States asking for assistance to acquire new technology in their classroom. We would abolish Goals 2000, which would set some goals for the whole country to achieve as we recognize the importance of the information age. We would abolish teacher training in math and science. We would abolish magnet schools. We would abolish school-to-work. We would abolish the ability to use voluntary national achievement tests in order to empower parents to find out just how their students are doing. The abolition of all of those tools and more are incorporated in what we are about to pass tonight. 
Mr. President, this is a lost opportunity. Yes. But far more than that, during the debate on this bill, we have gone from doing little to doing damage--damage to our public educational system, damage to the opportunities that children all over this country ought to have when they walk into a classroom. We would abolish the national role in public education. 
So the question tonight that we must ask ourselves is, do we support the continued role of public education, recognizing, as we do, the need to move beyond the status quo and fundamentally and radically find ways in which to improve upon the tradition of public education in this country? Do we do that? Or do we privatize education? Do we privatize it and take away whatever role the people of the United States have when we consider our educational challenges in the years ahead? That is the question. 
I hope our colleagues will vote a resounding no on final passage of this bill. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today is a holy day, Yom Hashoah. It is a day set aside every year to remember the victims of the Holocaust. 
I had the privilege of starting this Yom Hashoah morning with an extraordinary group of people, the Founders of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Founders are men and women from across America who have given at least $1 million to the Holocaust Museum. 
This week, as we mark the fifth anniversary of the opening of the museum, it seems an especially appropriate time to recognize the incredible gift the Founders, and all the museum's supporters, have given our nation. 
We are indebted to them all--particularly to Miles Lerman, chairman of the museum council, and Ruth Mandel, the council's vice chair, and to my dear friend Abe Pollin, the chairman of this year's Founders Reunion. 
One of the sages of the Torah told us more than 200 years ago that God could have created plants that would grow loaves of bread. Instead, he created wheat for us to grow and mill and transform into bread. Why? Because He wanted us to be able to take part in the miracle of creation. 
That is what the Holocaust Museum Founders have done. They used stone and steel and sacred artifacts, rather than wheat. But they have unquestionably experienced the miracle of creation. 
Simon Dubrow, the great Jewish historian, was one of the 6 million Jews murdered in the Holocaust. He was killed in the Latvian ghetto of Riga by a Gestapo officer who had once been his student. His dying words were `Schreibt und farschreibt.' `Write and record.' He believed to the end that truth and memory ultimately would triumph over the evil of the Holocaust. 
Through the leadership and generosity of the Holocaust Museum Founders, his prediction has come true. Many in Congress remain in awe of the fact that the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has raised $320 million since its inception. That's a part of the museum's story that isn't fully known or appreciated. 
The Holocaust Museum has not only demonstrated that public/private partnerships can work--it has set the standard for such partnerships. Much has changed since that bitter cold, rainy day 5 years ago when the Holocaust Museum was dedicated. 
Before the museum opened, I understand that the most optimistic estimates were that 700,000 people a year would walk through its doors. That first year, and every year since, I am now told, 2 million visitors have come to the museum--5,000 people every day. Before the museum opened, I well remember that there were some who questioned whether it should be built on the National Mall, since the Holocaust did not take place in our country. 
Today, the Holocaust Memorial Museum is a fundamental part of this city. Not only does it belong on the Mall, but it gives a deeper meaning to the other great memorials there. Ask anyone who has been through the museum and they will tell you. The Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial have never looked so beautiful--and freedom and democracy have never seemed as precious--as they do when you emerge from the darkness of that extraordinary building. 
Elie Weisel has said, `Survivors are understood by survivors only. They speak in code. All outsiders could do was come close to the gates.' That is what the Holocaust Memorial Museum allows us to do: to come close to the gates; to see; to grieve; and, finally, to learn, so that we can pass the knowledge on from, generation to generation, about what can happen when intolerance and hatred are allowed to spread unchecked. 
Elie Weisel is right. We cannot walk on the shoes of the victims, or the survivors. But we can see their shoes--that heartbreaking room full of dress shoes and work boots and baby shoes. And it is one of the many paradoxes of the museum, that in looking at something as simple as those shoes, we can begin to feel the profound tragedy of that terrible time. 
Anyone who has been there knows, the Holocaust Museum is not an easy place to visit. The images in it are not images of beauty, but of incomprehensible evil. People always spend longer in the museum than they expect. And they leave shattered. But they also leave changed. It is one of the few museums in the world that has the capacity to change people fundamentally. 
It teaches many lessons. One of the most profound lessons is about the horrors that can be unleashed when we deny the basic humanity of even one person. Another is what can happen to democracy when we are not vigilant in its protection. 
The museum also teaches us about the necessity of leadership dedicated to preventing intolerance, hatred and oppression. For members of Congress, that is an especially important lesson. And the presence of the museum on the mall is a constant reminder of it. 
Perhaps the most dramatic example of its influence on Congress was 2 years ago, when we debated how the United States should respond to the horrors in Bosnia. There were times during that debate when it was as if the victims of the Holocaust were looking down from the Senate galleries, reminding us of the moral imperative: Never again. I doubt we would have felt their presence so strongly, had it not been for the museum. 
But evil is not always as obvious as it was in Bosnia, or Rwanda, or Pol Pot's Cambodia. The Holocaust Museum reminds us that the early warning signs are more subtle--and, often, closer to home. That lesson is particularly important for people who are entrusted to write the laws that guide this great nation. 
When you walk down that first long, dark corridor, and see the step-by-step dismantling of German democracy, you understand in a deeper way why we must never again allow books to be burned, or laws to be written that permit discrimination and expropriation. 
The last time I visited the museum I stopped on the way out to read what people had written in the `comments' book. None of the comments was very long. The museum has a way of leaving many people without words for a while. 
Among the short messages, there were two that especially stood out. Both were written in what appeared to be the handwriting of teenage girls. One said, `The museum taught me the meaning of democracy.' The other said simply, `I will remember this for the rest of my life.' What an extraordinary gift the Founders have given those young women, and everyone else who has visited these first 5 years! 
I understand the museum is now taking advantage of the Internet and other new technologies so that people in my home state of South Dakota, and all over the world, can `visit,' even if they can't come to Washington. I've been told the website gets 100,000 hits a day! That's most impressive. 
By reaching out in this way, the museum is not only fulfilling our moral responsibility to `write and record' the story of the Holocaust and its victims. It is also creating a stronger America. And, in the process, it is redefining what museums, and public-private partnerships can be, and what they can accomplish. 
The poem that is written on the wall behind the shoes declares, `We are the shoes. We are the last witnesses.' In the 5 years since the museum opened, 10 million new witnesses have been created--one for every person who perished in the Holocaust. Five years from now, there will be 10 million more. And, like the young woman who signed the book, each of them will be remembered for the rest of their lives. 
The Founders, and all the supporters of the Holocaust Museum, have indeed taken part in the creation of something very, very rare. Today, on this holy day of Yom Hashoah, as we remember the victims of the Holocaust, the Congress and the people of the United States thank them.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to join Senator Spencer Abraham to introduce the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act. 
First, let me commend my colleague, Senator Abraham, for all of his work to develop this legislation. This bill addresses some of the critical threats to wildlife habitat and species diversity and demonstrates his commitment, which I strongly share, to solving the many challenges we face in this regard. 
The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act will help to ensure that some of our most valuable and beautiful species of birds--those that most of us take for granted, including bluebirds, goldfinches, robins and orioles--may overcome the challenges posed by habitat destruction and thrive for generations to come. It is not widely recognized that many North American bird species once considered common are in decline. In fact, a total of 90 species of migratory birds are listed as endangered or threatened in the United States, and another 124 species are considered to be of high conservation concern. 
The main cause of this decline is the loss of critical habitat throughout our hemisphere. Because these birds range across international borders, it is essential that we work with nations in Latin America and the Caribbean to establish protected stopover areas during their migrations. This bill achieves that goal by fostering partnerships between businesses, nongovernmental organizations and other nations to bring together the capital and expertise needed to preserve habitat throughout our hemisphere. 
As we celebrate Earth Day, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It has been endorsed by the National Audobon Society, the American Bird Conservancy and the Ornithological Council. I believe that it will substantially improve upon our ability to maintain critical habitat in our hemisphere and help to halt the decline of these important species.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from North Dakota will yield for just a moment, I would like to be added as a cosponsor. I commend both Senators from North Dakota for the resolution and will certainly want to work with them to see that it will be adopted unanimously. 
As he has noted, the Grand Forks journalistic community stood proud. Grand Forks, I think, perhaps more than anybody else, felt the full force of the natural disasters last year. For this paper to be so recognized, for it to have the opportunity to receive international recognition as a result of their effort is certainly appropriate and ought to be applauded. While many other newspapers did not win the Pulitzer Prize, I think it goes without saying that there are other newspaper efforts that were made last year that also deserve recognition for the tremendous work they did under very, very difficult circumstances. 
Again, I commend the Senator from North Dakota for his effort. I hope we adopt the resolution. I certainly congratulate the newspaper.

Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I look forward to the opportunity that we now have today and tomorrow to debate one of the most important issues facing our country. I applaud all of those involved, Senator Coverdell, and others on our side, who have dedicated themselves to finding solutions. 
I must say that while we offer solutions and while we mutually recognize the importance of the issue, I do not really know of an issue that probably divides us more philosophically at this point than does education. 
Our Republican colleagues, in large measure, believe there is not a role at the Federal level for educational priorities, that it really is an issue that ought to be left to the local level, to public school districts, and to others. 
Democrats, on the other hand, believe that there ought to be a role for every level of government, that the people of the United States have an interest and a need to ensure that our educational priorities and our educational challenges are met with every tool available to us in order to be able to compete effectively in the information age. 
So that difference in philosophical approach brings us to the point where we are today, with two very different proposals on how we might best address education. One provides what I would describe as a minimal tax reduction--$7 per tax return if your children are in public school and about $37 if your children are in private school--to the parents of children attending school today, a $1.6 billion plan that does not go very far when you simply spread it out over the many, many families in America who have children in public and private elementary and secondary school today. The other is our approach which allows a more targeted investment in some of the very specific needs that we have in education today. 
I do not think there is much difference of opinion with regard to the recognition that a strong public education system is key to America's future. I would even argue that most of our Republican colleagues would share that view even though they are more likely to be more supportive, it appears, of private educational approaches than public. 
Economic prosperity, our position as a world leader, our very democracy all depend on providing educational opportunity to children. We know that. We also know that in a new global information economy, knowledge and work force skills have become an extremely important factor in economic growth. 
So at the dawn of the global information economy, it is appropriate to give opportunities to communities facing conflicting pressures from rising enrollments and aging infrastructure and demands by taxpayers for State and local relief. It is appropriate to find ways in which to provide communities with new tools to manage these conflicting pressures. We recognize that managing 
these pressures better would be good for society, good for the economy, and good for national security. 
We have heard a lot about what is wrong with public education. For example, our 12th graders are behind the rest of the world in math and science. We all agree that is unacceptable. But there are some signs of progress. Our fourth graders are well above the average in mathematics and near the top in science. 
Innovative programs are being implemented around the country today. Chicago has implemented a broad, districtwide reform program that ends social promotions, that raises standards, and that provides extra help through weekend and summer school programs. Parents and other individuals and communities all over the country are more involved in many aspects of schools than they have ever been before. So there are some good signs. Schools in low-income neighborhoods in New York and other places are implementing programs like Success for All and are getting some dramatic results. 
The bottom line is that, with all of the effort underway at the local level, do we abandon our public schools? Do we abandon the partnership that the people of the United States have had in ensuring, from a national perspective, that our public schools have the opportunities to meet the challenges of the information age? Do we all agree that it should be a fundamental right that all children have the opportunity to develop their God-given talents, that our country's future depends on it? I hope we can. 
We all know the reality. The reality is that student enrollment is at a record level and expected to grow dramatically over the next decade. The second reality is that the teacher core is aging; we may not be able to keep up in recruiting what needs there will be in every classroom in the country--a qualified teacher--to keep student-teacher ratios somewhere close to where they are today. The reality is that schools will need to hire more than 2 million new teachers over the next decade. 
The reality is that school buildings are aging. The reality is that the General Accounting Office has now reported to the U.S. Senate and to the American people that there is a $112 billion backlog in construction funding needed to address deteriorating buildings--$112 billion. And this does not include funds to provide additional classrooms for enrollment growth, reduce class sizes, or put more technology in classrooms. This just says, given where we are right now, given the current enrollment--let us not talk about increases in enrollment, let us not talk about what it is going to take to put technology in classes--given current enrollment, we have a $112 billion backlog in construction. 
We talk about infrastructure backlogs. We talk about the deficits we have--our trade deficit, our infrastructure deficit in highways and bridges and roads, the deficit that we have had for so long with regard to our budget--now fortunately resolved, at least for now--but could there be a more important deficit for which this country needs to be concerned than the deficit we have in our schools and in the educational system that directly affects the quality of education our students get? 
Addressing these problems demands a cooperative and concerted effort at every level of government. I have too many communities in rural South Dakota that recognize everything I have said. But they say to me directly, `We simply can't acquire the resources necessary to meet the challenges that we know are out there. And, frankly, we don't know what we're going to do.' They tell us that this is a national concern and ought to be addressed as a national issue. If it is addressed as a national issue, the people of the United States have to be concerted in their effort to find ways to deal with these problems more effectively. 
The American people want action. You name the poll, conservative or liberal--the polls will tell us that education is one of the highest priorities in our country today. Only 1 percent of the Federal budget is spent on primary and secondary education, and that includes special education--1 percent. 
So, Madam President, it isn't that we are breaking the budget with what we spend. It isn't that we simply have taken money away from other things to put in education. When you have a $112 billion deficit on just infrastructure for education, and are only spending 1 percent of the budget, the question is, what should we do? 
What opportunities can be afforded to address this in a more balanced and more prudent way? 
As we contended with that question over some period of time and with virtual unanimity, Democratic Senators have introduced S. 1708, the bill we call the RESULTS Act, to show what we think should be done to improve public education. Our bill does a number of things, and I want to outline them very briefly. 
First, it reduces the class size in the early grades and helps communities hire 100,000 qualified teachers. We have already seen what hiring more cops does in neighborhoods. I was just in South Dakota for virtually 2 weeks, and I was amazed at the reports that I am getting, at the tremendous effect community police have had. We have added new community police to the work force in so many communities in my State. If it is so good for preventing crime and dealing with crime in neighborhoods, what could be better than to say we have also got to do it in education? We have to find a way to ensure that this dramatic shortage we are going to have with teachers all over the country can be addressed in an effective way. 
Let's hire 100,000 qualified teachers over the next couple of years. Once we have hired those teachers, the second thing we do is to say let's build and modernize 5,000 public schools. We have a series of charts, that I will get to in a minute, that help us address these things. But let's modernize some schools, 5,000 of them; set that as our goal. 
Let's provide after-school care for half a million children. Let's provide more computers for classrooms across the country and training for teachers who were just hired. Let's establish an educational opportunity grant program for high poverty urban and rural areas that are serious about bringing about real reform. 
I was never so pleased as when I saw this morning in the Washington Post where a school in Fairfax County has decided to use the multimillion-dollar investment they have, 12 months a year, to improve education in ways they are not doing today. The article went on to say that there are about 2,700 schools around the country that are doing the same thing. I say it is about time. 
Unfortunately, our Republican colleagues have chosen not to address those issues. They don't deal with these problems. The Republican budget resolution states explicitly that no funding for any of the President's education initiatives shall be authorized--that s explicitly in the budget. It provides $2 billion less than what the President has proposed for education and training in next year's budget. It actually denies help to reduce class sizes and hire the 100,000 teachers I mentioned a moment ago. It actually denies help to communities to build or modernize public schools. It denies additional after-school care to help children learn more and reduce juvenile crime. It denies the incentive to help high poverty communities adopt serious comprehensive reform. 
Instead, unfortunately, my colleagues continue to insist that vouchers to private schools and block grant proposals that absolutely remove any opportunity for the entire country to be engaged in a national investment in education be provided. In short, they do virtually nothing, to improve public education today. 
I reiterate, you can make the case that all this ought to be done at the local level. You can make the case that somehow Rochford and Ipswich and Rosholt and Warner and Buffalo and Faith and Wall, SD, don't need any help from the people of the United States as they try to figure out ways in which to address the incredible array of problems that they have. But we are not willing to admit that. We believe strongly that we have to have a comprehensive agenda in education. We have to address this terrible problem we have in infrastructure. We have to recognize that this teacher shortage is real. We have to find ways with which to acknowledge the information age and access better technical innovation. We can do that. We can pass the RESULTS Act. I hope we will do that. 
Of all the things I hope we can talk about in some detail, I want to focus on one of those today, with the hope that maybe we can come back and address some of the others at another time. I want to talk briefly about this matter of infrastructure, because I do believe that when it comes to the array of priorities we have, perhaps the biggest concern I have right now, as we look at the challenges we face, is infrastructure. 
We are proposing in our legislation--and we will offer an amendment tomorrow--to provide interest-free school modernization bonds to improve public education across the country. It is a new, cost-effective financing option for communities. And I emphasize `option.' There are no mandates. Schools don't have to use this. But as they contemplate whether or not they can afford a new school, a new facility, modernization, they will now have the knowledge, if this legislation passes, that we will assist them, we will reduce their tax load, we will reduce the amount of exposure they have as they make their commitments. We will do that with them. So this is really a tax reduction effort of a different kind. 
The way we do it is pretty simple. We simply say, if you make a commitment to new infrastructure, we are going to help you make it more cost effective. We will make it more cost efficient, more palatable from a cost point of view, by paying the interest. You pay the principal; we will pay the interest. The interest is sometimes up to half of the overall cost. 
The overall bonding authority is about $22 billion. To take a typical scenario where you have conventional bond financing, a $15 million project would require an additional $7.5 million of interest. In this typical project, we would be paying $7.5 million, or about one-third, as a national commitment and the local communities would pay $15 million. So the interest-free school modernization effort would have a profound effect on a local decision. 
Now, as most people know, local decisions involving bond issues sometimes require a 60 percent vote, and in many cases even a 67 percent vote, or two-thirds, is required. I can't tell you how many times bond issues in South Dakota have failed on the basis of 1 percent or 2 percent. An overwhelming majority have passed them, but they have fallen short of the 60 or 67 percent required in order to meet the local legal requirements. I am convinced this would put us over the top in many of those cases. 
Why do we even worry about it? Why should we be concerned about whether the bond issues go over the top? This chart lays it out fairly well: 74 percent of the Nation's public schools today are more than 25 years old; nearly a third are more than 50 years old. 
We have modern businesses, modern Senate office buildings, and we have schools in which our children are expected to learn that are today more than 50 years old. Now, they don't have the resources we have in the U.S. Capitol, a building that is 200 years old. If they did, I would not be concerned. It isn't the age of the buildings, if they are well built, but what kind of buildings are they? Well, this second line answers that question: 
Fourteen million kids today are in schools needing major renovation or replacement--14 million; 12 million children are in schools with leaking roofs and/or ineffective or defective plumbing; 10 million kids are in schools with inadequate lighting; 7 million kids are in schools with safety code violations, such as the presence of asbestos, lead paint, and an array of other environmental problems. 
We want our kids to learn and we say that education is a priority. We say we are willing to make the investment. We say that there can't be anything more important than our children. But then we tell our children that we want you to learn in a building that is out of date, that needs renovation, that may have toxic chemicals in the classroom, that has poor lighting and, God forbid, poor plumbing. But we want you to learn because you are important to us. 
The real problem is that, in the future, this is going to be exacerbated dramatically. Public school enrollment will increase by 13 percent in the next 10 years. And 6,000 new schools are going to need to be built at an estimated cost of $73 billion just to maintain current class size, just to say that if we are going to keep the 25-to-1 student-teacher ratio, we have to build 6,000 new schools. The question comes, if we need a 60 or 67 percent vote at a local level and we say it is all your responsibility, we don't care whether you have the resources or not, this just isn't going to happen, Madam President. Forty-five percent of the school districts are already using 3,621 trailers and makeshift classrooms. If you have not been in one of those classrooms when it is 85 degrees outside, I invite you to participate. It is as dramatic a lesson in the extraordinary problems our teachers and students are facing as they try to learn as anything I have seen. 
The enrollment here is pretty clear. All of the blue we see on this map shows where we see dramatic increases in enrollment. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that in every one of those States we have some very serious educational infrastructure problems that we have to address. 
Madam President, it really comes down to this. State and local taxes as a share of income have already risen 10 percent in the past two decades. The estimated $112 billion backlog and the $73 billion cost of new schools will place an increasing burden on State and local taxpayers, even though these taxes have gone up. By dramatically cutting the cost of school repairs and construction to communities, interest-free bonds will provide badly needed property and sales tax relief to working families. 
This isn't just an education proposal, this is a tax relief proposal. If you think property taxes are too high, if you think local taxes are too high, then you are going to want to support this amendment because this is a way to reduce local property taxes, local taxes to fund the educational demands that we are going to have in virtually every State in the country. 
The State courts are already mandating new infrastructure. They are requiring that we remedy the financing inequities. Courts in 11 States have ruled that the school financing systems are unconstitutional. In nearly every case, States have complied by raising property or sales taxes to finance school improvements. 
What does that tell you if the courts are already mandating what we are trying to do voluntarily? They are saying that you have to find a better way to finance schools because what you have is not working. Litigation is pending in 16 other States already. 
Madam President, it is pretty simple. Americans have looked at this proposal. Three-fourths of the voters in this country--75 percent--favor Federal aid to communities for school repair 
and modernization. Fifty percent of the voters consider overcrowded schools a major problem. Almost 80 percent believe public school renovation and modernization is a higher Federal priority than highway construction. I supported the highway bill, and I continue to do so. I think it was a good piece of legislation. But if we are going to make a commitment to highway infrastructure and transportation infrastructure in this country, where is the same enthusiasm for ensuring that we have the educational infrastructure? 
Madam President, 73 percent of Republicans and 65 percent of independents strongly support a Federal commitment, a commitment by the people of the United States, to education and infrastructure modernization. We will have an opportunity to have more debate and further discussion and consideration of these Democratic proposals. I do hope that, as these votes are presented to our body tomorrow, we will see the wisdom of making these investments, and that we will put our money where our mouth is when we make the commitment and tell our children that we are going to help you be educated, that you are our highest priority, that you truly deserve to have the kind of opportunities to learn in an environment that is conducive to learning. That is what this is about. I just hope our colleagues will weigh it carefully and support these Democratic amendments as they are offered during this debate. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, last week an American giant announced his plans to retire. Obviously, that description has more than one connotation. Bob Crandall is a giant in his industry and a remarkable pioneer. Few, if any, leaders in aviation can match his impressive record of achievement. 
The American airlines he joined is vastly different than the one he will soon leave. In a time of great economic turbulence in aviation industry, Mr. Crandall navigated his company and the industry itself to new heights and vastly new horizons. As a result, we are all beneficiaries. 
We know this man as an innovator. A person who understood that competition was not only good, it was essential. As a frequent flyer, I and millions of other Americans have benefited from the program he conceived to bring down costs and encourage loyal customers. 
We know him, too, as a financial manager of incomparable depth. American has been a consistent leader in profits and fiscal management. His stockholders have benefited from an array of innovations including code-sharing and the hub and spoke system in routing that has now been adopted by virtually every airline in the business. 
My wife, Linda, and I have known Bob for some time now. We have no doubt that this man of many interests and so much energy is far from retiring. There will be new challenges and most likely, more pioneering. 
Whatever future he may now be planning, we wish him well. We congratulate and thank him for what he has been and how much he has done. 
Bob Crandall is an American original.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to compensate the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe for losses the tribe suffered when the Oahe dam was constructed in central South Dakota and over 100,000 acres of tribal land was flooded. Its passage will help the tribe rebuild their infrastructure and their economy, which was seriously crippled by the Oahe project during the 1950s. It is extraordinary that it has taken four decades to reach this point. The importance of passing this long-overdue legislation as soon as possible cannot be stated too strongly. 
This legislation was developed with the assistance of Chairman Gregg Bourland and Council Member Louis Dubray of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. Both men have worked tirelessly to bring us to this point and I am grateful for their assistance. This legislation represents one element of their progressive vision for providing the members of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe with greater opportunities for economic development and to fulfill the debts owed to the tribe by the federal government. 
The Cheyenne River Sioux Infrastructure Development Trust Fund Act is the companion bill to the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe Infrastructure Development Trust Fund Act, which passed by unanimous consent in November of 1997, and the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe Infrastructure Development Trust Fund Act of 1996, which passed the Congress unanimously in 1996. 
The bill is based on an extensive analysis of the impact of the Pick-Sloan Dam Projects on the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, which was performed by the Robert McLaughlin Company. The McLaughlin report was reviewed by the General Accounting Office, which found that the losses suffered by the tribe justify the establishment of a $290 million trust fund, which is the amount called for in this legislation. 
It represents an important step in our continuing effort to fairly compensate the tribes of South Dakota for the sacrifices they made decades ago for the construction of the dams along the Missouri River and will further the goal of improving the lives of Native Americans living on those reservations. 
To fully appreciate the need for this legislation, it is important for the committee to understand the historic events that are prologue to its development. The Oahe dam was constructed in South Dakota pursuant to the Flood Control Act (58 Stat. 887) of 1944. That legislation authorized implementation of the Missouri River Basin Pick-Sloan Plan for water development and flood control for downstream states. 
The Oahe dam flooded 104,000 acres of tribal land, forcing the relocation of roughly 30 percent of the tribe's population, including four entire communities. Equally as important, the tribe lost 80 percent of its fertile river bottom lands--lands that represented the basis for the tribal economy. Prior to the flooding, the tribe relied on these lands for firewood and building material, game, wild fruits and berries, as well as cover from the severe storms that characterize winters in South Dakota and shelter from the heat of the prairie summer. Indian ranchers no longer had places to shelter their cattle in the wintertime, causing a significant loss in the value of their operations. 
The loss of these important river bottom lands can be felt today. Last year, during the extreme winter of 1996-1997, the tribe lost roughly 30,000 head of livestock, including 25,000 head of cattle. Without adequate natural shelter, the remaining Indian ranchers along this stretch of river can expect to continue to have difficulty scratching out a living in future years when the winter turns particularly hard. 
Mr. President, the damage caused by the Pick-Sloan projects touched every aspect of life on the Cheyenne River reservation. Ninety percent of the timber on the reservation was wiped out, causing shortages of building material and firewood. Wildlife, once abundant in the river bottom, became more scarce. The entire lifestyle of the tribe changed as it was forced to relocate much of its people from the lush river bottom lands to the windswept prairie. 
Most Americans, if not all, are familiar with the many broken promises of the United States Government to Native Americans during the 1800's. For Indian tribes located along the Missouri River in the State of South Dakota, the United States Government still has not met its responsibilities for compensation for losses suffered as a result of the construction of the Pick-Sloan dams. This proposed legislation is intended to correct that situation as it applies to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. 
We cannot, of course, remake the lost lands and return the tribe to its former existence. We can, however, help provide the resources necessary to the tribe to improve the infrastructure on the Cheyenne River reservation. This, in turn, will enhance opportunities for economic development which will benefit all members of the tribe. Perhaps most importantly, it will fulfill part of our commitment to improve the lives of Native Americans--in this case the Cheyenne River Sioux.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to provide a refundable tax credit to farmers for the restoration and conservation of wetlands. 
We have learned over the years the extraordinary value that wetlands can provide as habitat for plants and waterfowl, as a filter for water and as a buffer against flooding. At the same time, anyone who has ever owned a farm in South Dakota with what we call prairie potholes can appreciate the frustration wetlands can generate, making it logistically difficult to till the field efficiently and, of course, impossible to grow crops on lands that are flooded. 
To add insult to injury, farmers often need to pay property taxes on these wetlands, even though they provide no financial return. 
As a nation, we have recognized the dilemma this presents and have taken steps in the past to provide farmers with a means of obtaining some value for their efforts to protect wetlands. For years the Department of Agriculture has allowed farmers to enroll wetlands into the Wetland Reserve Program, while the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has worked with conservation groups to provide farmers with long-term easement options. Recently, Congress enacted legislation I sponsored to allow farmers to enroll wetlands in the Conservation Reserve Program. 
Unfortunately, due to the funding caps, many farmers cannot enroll their wetlands into the CRP while others are reluctant to use the WRP or U.S. Fish and Wildlife easements. Consequently, despite these efforts, many wetlands throughout this country continue to present farmers with a challenge: ensuring their protection without any compensation. 
In addition, over the last century, many wetlands have been drained, filled or otherwise degraded. These areas represent a vast reservoir of potentially important wetlands that could provide useful environmental functions if fully restored. The time has come for Congress to establish a more comprehensive set of incentives to both restore degraded wetlands and ensure their long-term protection. 
Under the legislation I am introducing today, owners of wetlands, farmed wetlands and prior-converted croplands that are surrounded by or immediately adjacent to actively farmed cropland in the same ownership are eligible for a tax credit. To take advantage of this credit, farmers must restore to fully functioning condition their farmed wetlands or prior converted croplands condition according to a restoration plan approved by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. A tax credit equal to the restoration costs will be available under this bill. To protect the water quality of wildlife values, a maximum of three associated acres of non-wetland may be eligible for the credit for every acre of wetland. To ensure that the federal government does not pay twice to protect the same wetlands, those enrolled in CRP or WRP are not eligible for this credit. 
The bill provides a tax credit equal to 50% to 70% of the soil-specific Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) rental rate for eligible wetland and associated non-wetland acres, plus any certification fee. This may be taken in each year of the conservation agreement in which the eligible land is not used for agricultural production or drained, dredged, filled, leveled, or otherwise manipulated for that purpose. 
A farmer who enters into an agreement to conserve the eligible wetland and associated non-wetland acres for a period of not less than 10 years will receive 50% of the annual CRP rental rate; a farmer who agrees to conserve the wetland for not less than 20 years will receive 60% of the annual CRP rental rate; and a farmer who agrees to conserve the wetland for 30 years will receive 70% of the annual CRP rental rate. Certification of compliance with the agreement must be made at least every 5 years. 
As a long-term alternative to the conservation credit, farmers may opt for an easement credit, which would be equal to the fair market value of the land in agricultural use, as determined by a certified appraisal. This would be based on the charitable donation by the landowner of a deed restriction, granted in perpetuity on the use which may be made of the eligible land to a qualified conservation organization, exclusively for conservation purposes. The full credit may be taken in the year in which the deed restriction is recorded. 
Mr. President, Americans increasingly are becoming aware of the tremendous environmental benefits that wetlands provide. From critical waterfowl habitat to reducing the severity of flooding, wetlands are a critical component of our landscape. What may not be as widely appreciated is the nature of the farmer's role in protecting this resource. 
The time has come for us to both acknowledge the contributions made by farmers to the conservation of wetlands and provide them with appropriate incentive to preserve them. Farmers should not be penalized for doing the right thing. This legislation will take a giant step toward making available fair and reasonable compensation for their efforts in this regard.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I also want to acknowledge the efforts made by the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, in resolving this minor problem. I appreciate very much his efforts to do what he did. I will say, however, that we have been working in good faith on both sides to try to move this along. Regular order is called, but also Senators deserve the right to be recognized when they seek recognition for purposes of clarification of their vote, so there is a need to be sensitive on both sides in a request of the Chair. I know that the Chair was accommodating or attempting to accommodate Senators. 
I also join with the majority leader in asking the five remaining authors to work with us to see if we might reduce the number of rollcalls necessary. We are very close now, and I thank my colleagues on this side for cooperating thus far. Let's see if we can get it down to a couple, fewer than what we have right now. We can finish this within the hour, and I hope we can receive just a little more cooperation to make that happen. I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, let me commend the distinguished ranking member for his excellent statement. 
Mr. President, it is with some disappointment that Democrats offer any substitute at all. The times when we work best are the times when we can find agreement in the Budget Committee, as we did last year. We were disappointed that agreement could not be reached to everyone's satisfaction. So we find ourselves compelled to offer an alternative to the budget now being proposed by the majority. 
The distinguished ranking member has laid out very thoroughly some of the reasons why our resolution is superior and the reasons why Democrats feel compelled today to express our differences with our Republican colleagues about this budget. 
Our plan very simply does what the President of the United States said we should do in his State of the Union address a couple of months ago. We put Social Security first. We provide targeted tax cuts for working families. We make very important domestic investments so that working families across this country can experience the tremendous economic gain and economic vitality that this country has realized in the last several years. We stay within the spending ceilings established in last year's budget agreement. We maintain balance in 1999 and produce budget surpluses well into the next century. 
We are very proud of what we have been able to achieve thus far. It is on the basis of what we have achieved that we now propose a budget to build upon those achievements and allow this nation to be as successful in the future as we have in the past. Before I describe our fiscal priorities, let's take a brief look back at the past. 
In 1993, the budget deficit was a whopping $290 billion, the highest deficit our Nation had ever experienced. 
The deficit at that time was projected to grow to over $500 billion by the end of the decade. In 1993, the President presented an economic plan and the Democratic Congress--unfortunately, without the help of a single Republican vote--took action. 
Today, the results are very obvious. The 1993 plan produced the largest deficit reduction in our history. The plan produced the first unified balanced budget in 30 years. The plan created 15 million new jobs. The plan contributed to the lowest unemployment rate in 25 years. The plan put us on the road to the lowest core inflation rate since 1965. The plan has led to the fastest annual growth rate in real average hourly earnings since 1976. 
The results could not be more clear. Because we made the commitment in 1993, because we turned the economy around, because we were able to come to grips with the significant economic and fiscal problems that we were facing at that time and address them consequentially, we celebrate success in 1998. Now it is our responsibility to build upon that success. 
We would like to highlight the differences between our vision for the future and that of our Republican colleagues. The most visible and the most important of those differences relates to public education. Our budget contains a series of proposals that will provide our children with the educational opportunities they need to successfully confront the challenges of the 21st century. We provide tax credits for local districts that build and renovate public schools. We provide funds for local districts to hire an additional 100,000 teachers. This proposal will allow schools to reduce class size. For grades from 1 to 3, class size will be reduced from an average of 22 children down to 18. In addition, we provide opportunities for after-school learning programs. I will not elaborate on any of those proposals, because they have each been the subject of a targeted Democratic amendment already offered during this budget debate. 
The Republican budget freezes spending on the most important educational programs. It freezes spending on the new programs I have outlined as well as the programs already established to provide children the opportunity to grow and to learn. As a result, 450,000 children will be denied access to safe after-school learning centers if this Republican budget passes; 30,000 kids will be denied access to Head Start if this Republican budget passes; 6,500 middle schools will not have drug and violence prevention coordinators if this Republican budget passes. 
There is another important difference--and my colleague, the distinguished ranking member, noted the difference. Democrats have a fundamentally different approach to tackling the problem of teen smoking. On this issue there is a very clear difference between the Republican budget and our budget. Every American should carefully examine each side's approach to ending tobacco's insidious hold on young people in this country. Our proposal ends Joe Camel's reign over America's teenagers by fully funding the anti-youth-smoking initiatives, by providing tobacco-related medical research, by allowing smoking cessation programs, by ensuring public service advertising to counter the tobacco companies' targeting of our children today. 
The Republican budget does none of those, not one. There is no anti-youth-smoking initiative, there is no tobacco-related medical research, there are no smoking cessation programs, there is no public service advertising--there is none. It stacks the deck against meaningful tobacco reform and the effort to end teenage smoking. 
So we see a host of important initiatives in the Democratic plan--investing in education, anti-teen smoking efforts, health care and an array of other proposals designed to build upon the success our plan has enjoyed over the last 5 years. Unfortunately, our Republican colleagues have said no to virtually every single one--no to education, no to child care, no to comprehensive solutions to teen smoking. 
For all these reasons, I ask my colleagues to say no to the Republican budget and to say yes to the way we have proposed to 
build upon our success in the past, to say yes to the Democratic alternative. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use a couple minutes of my leader time. I know we are out of time, and I don't want to take any time off the resolution. 
I know the distinguished Budget chair has made his arguments, and I think they merit some response. I will yield in a moment to the distinguished ranking member as well. 
Let me just make three points. First of all, the distinguished chair, the Senator from New Mexico, alluded to our budget proposal as one that seems to be outside the realm of the agreement we made last July. He also noted the Republican budget is in keeping with these same commitments. 
Let there be no mistake about this, the Democratic alternative adheres to the requirements. It keeps the agreement--agreed to and signed by Republicans and Democrats last July--intact. That is the whole premise upon which we based our alternative budget resolution. 
We recognize how important that agreement is. We recognize the importance of investments. But as I noted in my opening comments, there is a profound difference between the vision expressed in our resolution toward major investments in education, in child care, in those areas for which we believe it is essential this country continue to invest, and the Republican proposal which fails to invest in those areas. 
The second point: He sets up a false choice. He says he believes it is important for us to recognize the critical nature of using tobacco revenue to shore up the Medicare program. I agree with that. I too think there is an important need to invest in Medicare to ensure its solvency. However, it is a false choice to say this is the only option available to us as we pass tobacco legislation. Indeed, the Senate Commerce Committee itself takes issue with the statement just made by the distinguished Budget Committee chair. 
Yesterday, on a vote of 19 to 1, the Commerce Committee voted out its recommendations to the Senate with regard to tobacco legislation. They note it is important for us to take some of those revenues and dedicate them to reimbursing public health care programs in Medicare. However, they also say that, in addition to Medicare, it is critical we recognize the importance of prevention and cessation activities, efforts to stop teenage smoking, to support health-related research, to ensure tobacco farmers receive the resources they are going to need, to ensure that we deal with the tobacco-asbestos trust fund, to ensure that we deal with the problems in Medicaid, and to ensure that problems with black lung are addressed through these resources. 
In other words, the committee, in the 19-to-1 vote just yesterday, said we agree with the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, but we think we ought to do more. We think that it is critical that we look at how we prevent teenage smokers from starting, how we assist tobacco farmers in during the transition, and how we deal with research in ways that are not adequately addressed in this budget. 
I think it is very critical to acknowledge that on an overwhelming basis many in Congress have already indicated their support for dedicating tobacco revenues to an array of different needs including Medicare. 
The bottom line is really very fundamental. We have to recognize that this is our one opportunity to state our priorities. Our priorities ought to be in education. Our priorities ought to be in child care. Our priorities ought to be in preventing teenage smoking. That is what our budget does. That is what our priorities are. And that is the difference in vision between Republican and Democratic budgets. 
I ask the ranking member if he has any need to express himself prior to the time I yield the floor?

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senate will soon voice its opinion on the FY1999 Budget Resolution. The debate on this year's resolution offered the American people an excellent opportunity to observe each party's fiscal priorities. A budget resolution is essentially a fiscal roadmap to the future. Within the confines of scarce resources, a budget resolution forces real choices upon the Democratic and Republican parties. 
Earlier in the debate, Senate Democrats offered their vision for America's future. Our plan put Social Security first, lived within the spending ceilings established in last year's budget agreement, and contained key domestic investments and targeted tax cuts for working families. Our budget did all of these things plus one more. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, it maintained balance in 1999 and produced a unified budget surplus for as long as CBO is willing to project. 
Before taking a look forward and describing our budget priorities for the future, I would like to take a brief look back. Just over 5 years ago when President Clinton took office, the budget deficit stood at a whopping $290 billion--the highest level in this nation's history. What's worse, the deficit was projected to grow to over $500 billion by the end of the decade if nothing was done to attack this insidious problem. Fortunately, the President and the Democratic Congress, without the assistance of a single Republican vote, took action. Together we passed legislation in 1993 that began to both stem the flow of red ink and target investments and tax cuts toward working Americans and their families. 
Our political opponents harshly criticized our approach. Although I will not name the names of those who went on record predicting failure for our economic policies, it is not an exaggeration to say that many were predicting a disaster of near biblical proportions. It can also be said that many who publicly predicted economic ruin in 1993 are still here today, and many who bravely cast their vote for this package in the face of this cascade of criticism are not. 
And today the results are clear to all. The economic plan Democrats passed 5 years ago produced the largest amount of deficit reduction in our history. The 1993 plan put us in position for what we accomplished this year--the first unified balanced budget in 30 years. Our plan also provided the foundation for what most economists are calling the strongest economy in a generation. About 15 million new jobs have been created since its enactment. The unemployment rate is 4.6 percent--a 25-year low. The core inflation rate is 2.2 percent--the lowest level since 1965. And real average hourly earnings have increased by 2.3 percent in 1997 alone--the fastest annual growth rate since 1976. These positive indicators moved Goldman Sachs, a distinguished Wall Street investment firm, to conclude in their March 1998 report on the U.S. economy: `the current U.S. economic environment is the best ever--steady growth without inflation. As the expansion turns seven years old this month, there is still no recession in sight . . . On the policy side, trade, fiscal, and monetary policies have been excellent, working in ways that have facilitated growth without inflation.' 
The Democratic record on deficit reduction and economic growth is clear. Our prescriptions for both have produced unprecedented success. And today we come before the Senate with our plan for the future. This plan builds on our past success and is based on four key principles. First, we will keep the unified budget in balance in 1999 and as far into the future as the Congressional Budget Office is willing to project. Second, our plan generates unified budget surpluses of $143 billion over the period 1999 to 2003 and sets the full amount aside to shore up Social Security. Third, the Democratic plan gets the CBO seal of approval. According to CBO, it complies fully with the spending caps established in last year's budget agreement. Fourth, in stark contrast to the Republican budget we have been considering on the Senate floor this week, our plan provides funding for key domestic investments and targeted tax relief for working families and businesses. 
Unfortunately, Senate Republicans defeated this proposal earlier this evening. I would like to take a moment now to discuss briefly the Republican fiscal prescription and how it differs from the plan we offered earlier. These differences are most visible and most important in the area of education. The Democratic budget proposes providing funds to help local school districts hire an additional 100,000 well-prepared teachers. This initiative would reduce class size in grades 1 through 3 from an average of 22 to 18. The Republican budget rejects this proposal. 
The Democratic budget proposes federal tax credits for local school districts that build and renovate public schools. The Republican budget does not even mention school construction. 
The Democratic budget proposes increasing discretionary funding for key education and training programs, including a $2.2 billion increase in 1999 alone. This funding increase supports the High Hopes initiative, after-school learning programs, and educational opportunity zones. The Republican budget freezes spending on most important education programs. As a result, about 450,000 kids will be denied access to safe after-school learning centers. About 30,000 kids will be denied access to Head Start. And about 6,500 middle schools will not have drug and violence prevention coordinators. 
The story is similar on child care and basic research. Within the overall context of a balanced budget, Democrats are proposing important initiatives in each of these areas. And the Republicans? Well, they just say no. No to education. No to child care. And no to basic research. 
The final, but important, difference between the Democratic and Republican budgets is each side's approach to ending tobacco's hideous hold on young people in this country. The Democratic budget contains a comprehensive proposal to end Joe Camel's reign over America's teenagers. Our budget fully funds anti-youth smoking initiatives, tobacco-related medical research, smoking cessation programs, and public service advertising to counter the tobacco's targeting of our kids. The Republican budget does none of these. 
It would be bad enough if the Republican budget stopped there. Unfortunately for this generation of teenagers and those that follow, it does not. The Republican budget goes even farther. It establishes a supermajority requirement for any future legislation that attempts to tackle teen smoking in a comprehensive manner. If this Republican budget as currently constructed is adopted, a minority of this body will be able to dictate whether and how the Congress should reduce the power of tobacco companies and weaken the industry's hold on our kids. In other words, the Republican budget stacks the deck against meaningful tobacco reform. 
In closing, Mr. President, the Democratic approach to tackling this nation's fiscal and economic problems has delivered results unmatched in recent history. Record deficit reduction and economic growth. Our budget plan for the future would continue this progress. It would maintain fiscal discipline while investing in key domestic initiatives such as education, child care and basic research. And the Democratic budget is the only plan that allows Congress to construct a comprehensive approach to reducing teen smoking and provides the resources to do so. At the same time, the Republican budget before us rejects many of these principles. 
Therefore Mr. President, it is for all of these reasons that I ask my colleagues to just say no to this Republican budget.  
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Mr. DASCHLE. I understand we have 1 minute in response. 
Let me just say, this is not in any way, shape or form an amendment designed to provide patients with more choice. This will leave seniors totally uncertain about what their Medicare will cover and let doctors determine the degree of Medicare coverage each beneficiary will have. That is what this is about: Jeopardizing patients' rights, putting them in a very uncertain set of circumstances, taking away the certainty and the confidence they have when they are in a doctor's office or in a hospital or in an operating room that Medicare will pay their bills. Let us not jeopardize those patients' rights or their confidence when they are sick that the Medicare Program is working for them.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I didn't want to object, and I was going to make that clarification following the conclusion of the request, but I would only add one clarification, which I know the majority leader will want to do, and that is to allow 1 minute prior to each vote in a stacked sequence, to be sure that we can explain the circumstances, as is normally our procedure in stacked votes. I know that colleagues on both sides of the aisle have requested that in the past. 
With that understanding and also with the understanding, of course, that Senator Moseley-Braun would then be recognized following this UC to offer her amendment, I think this is a good plan and I commend all of those involved, especially our Chair and ranking member. Obviously, we won't get done with this unless we can find a way in which to manage more efficiently the time remaining. This does it, and I appreciate the cooperation of Members on both sides.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today is the last day of Women's History Month.' Throughout the month of March, we've paid tribute to the vision of women like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott and Susan B. Anthony, the founders of the first Women's Rights Convention 150 years ago in Seneca Falls, New York. We've recognized the historic achievements and celebrated the legacies of Ameila Earhart, Marion Anderson, Eleanor Roosevelt, Dolores Huerta and hundreds of other American leaders. 
During Women's History Month, it is also appropriate that we pay tribute to the countless American women whose names and great works are known only to their families, neighbors and friends. These women may not grace the pages of history books, but their contributions as mothers, teachers, entrepreneurs, farmers, and scientists have shaped the direction and progress of this great country. 
In my own state of South Dakota, women of the plains have a long history of facing challenges with self-reliance and fortitude. Courageous women pioneers worked alongside fathers, husbands, and brothers to clear land, build homesteads, and establish schools, businesses and towns. In 1998, the women of South Dakota continue to build upon the legacy left by their foremothers of strong families and a better life for future generations. 
Sadly, we lost one such woman this year. But the spirit of Sister Maurice Crowley of Aberdeen, South Dakota will remain alive in the hearts of all who knew her. Her legacy of laughter, joy and a lifelong commitment to education continues on in those whose lives she touched. As one of her first grade students more than forty years ago, I am one of those people. 
Sister Crowley was an incredible human being blessed with great warmth, sharp wit and Irish charm. With characteristic humor Sister Maurice Crowley used to joke, God created Adam, stepped back, took a look, and said, `I can do better than that.' Man or woman, we all benefit when we pay respect and honor those who make a difference in others' lives. It is with great respect and admiration that I pay personal tribute to Sister Maurice Crowley during Women's History Month.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last night millions of people across the country sat in their living rooms and at friends' houses, transfixed to the television sets as the Kentucky Wildcats became the NCAA national basketball champions. One of our very own, an employee of the United States Senate, Mr. Donnee Gray, was at that game--not as a player or as a spectator, but as an official. 
Mr. Gray has worked in the Senate Library for 22 years, diligently helping Senate staffs with legislative and legal research. His expertise is well known and respected. 
For more than a decade, Mr. Gray also has been officiating basketball games at various levels of competition--from Olympic and international tournaments to NCAA Division I college games. During the past several years, Mr. Gray has been honored by the NCAA by being chosen to officiate the first round of the tournament. This year, Mr. Gray's involvement in March Madness began with the first round, continued in the Sweet Sixteen round and culminated last night in the final game. The NCAA's selection of Mr. Gray exemplifies his judgment and integrity, as well as his superior knowledge of the game and its rules. 
This really is a remarkable achievement by a remarkable and talented young man. We are proud of Mr. Gray and congratulate him on his selection as an official in the national championship NCAA basketball game. We also thank him for his outstanding work here in the United States Senate.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in introducing the Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 1998. This legislation has been developed cooperatively with Democrats in the House and Senate to address a growing concern of the American public, the quality of care delivered by health plans and insurance companies. Today, three of every four working, insured Americans are in managed care plans, and far too many have experienced serious problems with their coverage. We all know someone with a horror story in that regard. 
Today, David Garvey of Illinois told us the tragic story of his wife, who had taken a `dream' vacation to Hawaii with a few of her friends. When she arrived in Hawaii, she noticed some bruises on her body. She went to a clinic and was quickly admitted to the hospital. She was diagnosed with aplastic anemia. Her doctor in Hawaii began a course of treatment, and said that she would likely need a bone marrow transplant to save her life. 
Several days into the treatment, her HMO called from Chicago and said she had to return to Chicago for the treatment and transplant. They insisted that she return, even over the strong objections of the doctor in Hawaii who said that she was not stable enough to travel and that her immune system could not fight infection. Mr. Garvey tried to talk to the decisionmakers in the plan, but they insisted that she return to Chicago or forego coverage. As the medical bills were adding up, Mrs. Garvey had no choice but to fly back to Chicago. During that flight, Mrs. Garvey had a stroke, and within days of her return, she developed a fungal infection. Ten days later, she died. 
Mr. President, I am outraged by what happened to the Garveys and believe we need legislation to protect patients against medically inappropriate decisions by health plans that too often put the financial bottom line before patients' health care needs. 
The bill I am introducing today would provide enforceable protections for millions of patients. It would ensure access to medically needed care, including coverage at emergency rooms. It would allow patients with serious conditions to see their specialist without asking permission each time and would allow women direct access to their ob/gyn. 
The bill would allow patients denied benefits to appeal decisions both within the plan and to an independent, external reviewer. When a plan says no to a treatment that your doctor says you need, you should be able to appeal to an independent body that has no financial stake in the decision. This bill gives every patient that right and says the decision has to be made in a time frame that will not put the patient at risk. 
The Patients' Bill of Rights provides protection for the provider-patient relationship by banning gag clauses and limiting inappropriate financial incentives to deny care. It also would put a stop to arbitrary decisions by plans to limit care, such as decisions to discharge mastectomy patients from the hospital before it is medically appropriate. 
Finally, the bill would hold plans legally accountable for decisions to deny or delay care that result in harm to patients. Today, 125 million Americans who get their health care through their employer have little recourse if their plans' decisions harm them, even when the decisions lead to death. Doctors and hospitals are held accountable for their decisions, but health plans are not, and that is something that needs to change. 
The Patients' Bill of Rights is an important proposal that has the backing of the American Medical Association, Consumers Union, Families USA, the National Association of Children's Hospitals and numerous other organizations that advocate for quality patient care. 
I hope we can engage in productive debate on this issue in the coming months and pass legislation to improve the quality of health care for the American people.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in numerous ways, this nation demonstrates that our children are our most valuable investment and our most precious asset. We work to improve their education, to give them greater access to high quality health care, to minimize their exposure to tobacco and other addictive agents. We are driven to do all we can to help them realize their potential and achieve their personal and professional goals. 
In that context, it is inconsistent and shortsighted that, year after year, we pay little or no attention to a public health problem that is 100 percent preventable, yet affects more and more children each year, and that inalterably damages physical, mental and emotional processes critical to a child's ability to grow into an independent, fully functioning adult. The public health problem I am referring to is fetal alcohol syndrome. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and the related condition, fetal alcohol effect (FAE), are lifelong conditions characterized by multiple physical, mental, and behavioral handicaps. FAS and FAE cross racial, ethnic and economic lines to affect families throughout the United States. Both conditions are 100 percent preventable--and 100 percent irreversible. 
In January of 1997, I introduced S.148, a bill to establish a program for the prevention of FAS and FAE. S.148 calls for the development of an interagency task force at the federal level to promote prevention and detection of FAS and FAE, as well as a grant program to help communities expand public awareness and prevention at the state and local levels. 
I introduced bills similar to S.148 in the 102nd, 103rd and 104th Congresses, but, as is too often the case, these measures were too modest in scope to compete against `the issue of the moment.' Seven years is a long time to push a bill, but I don't see this effort as a matter of choice so much as a matter of necessity. It is a crime to sit back while more and more women each year drink during pregnancy and more and more children each year are handicapped for life because of it. 
In fact, the more I have learned about these conditions and their impact on children and their families, the more apparent it is to me that, if we truly care about children, we must not only embrace the goals of S.148, we must go beyond them. Not only should we do all we can to protect more children from a life sentence of devastating handicaps, we should acknowledge that for many children, prevention comes too late. 
We must open our eyes to the fact that FAS and FAE children and their families often have nowhere to turn for information, guidance and the social services necessary to respond to their special needs.Up to 12,000 children with FAS are born each year in the United States. According to some estimates, the rate of FAE is 3 times that. 
The incidence of FAS is nearly double that of Down's syndrome and almost 5 times that of spinal bifida. The incidence of FAS may be as high as one per 100 in some Native American communities. 
FAS and FAE are characterized by a complicated and debilitating array of mental, physical, and behavioral problems. FAS is the leading cause of mental retardation, and, let me repeat, it is 100 percent preventable. 
But rather than setting our sites on decreasing the incidence of FAS and FAE, the nation is witnessing a rapid increase in its incidence. In 1995, the Centers for Disease Control reported a six-fold increase in the percentage of babies born with FAS over the preceding 15 years. Again according to the CDC, rates of alcohol use during pregnancy increased significantly between 1991 and 1995, especially the rates of `frequent drinking.' 
This trend defies the Surgeon General's warning against drinking while pregnant. It defies a strongly worded advisory issued in 1991 by the American Medical Association urging women to abstain from all alcohol during pregnancy. Clearly, we need to do more to discourage women from risking their children's future by drinking while pregnant. 
In addition to the tragic consequences for thousands of children and their families, these disturbing trends have immense implications from a fiscal perspective. The costs associated with caring for individuals with FAS and FAE are staggering. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the lifetime cost of treating an individual with FAS is almost $1.4 million. The total cost in terms of health care and social services to treat all Americans with FAS was estimated at $2.7 billion in 1995. This is an extraordinary and unnecessary expense. 
To the extent we can prevent FAS and FAE and help parents respond appropriately to the special needs of their children, we can reduce institutionalizations, incarcerations and the continual use of medical and mental health services that otherwise may be inevitable. It makes fiscal sense, but far more importantly, it is the humane thing to do. 
The bill I am introducing today will establish a national task force comprised of parents, educators, researchers and representatives from relevant federal, state and local agencies. That task force will take on a difficult and critically important task. It will be responsible for reporting to Congress on FAS and FAE--on the nature and scope of the problem, the current response at the federal, state and local levels, and on ways the federal government can help states and localities make further progress. In conjunction with the task force efforts, the Secretary would establish a competitive grants program. This program would provide the resources necessary to operationalize the task force recommendations. 
The concept of a national task force with membership from outside of, as well as within, the federal government make sense for FAS and FAE, because the true experts on these conditions are the parents and professionals who deal with the cause and effects of these conditions day in and day out. If we want to respond appropriately, parents, teachers, social workers, and researchers should have a place at the table. A national task force will also provide the opportunity for communities to share best practices, preventing states that are newer to this problem from having to `reinvent the wheel.' 
Mr. President, responding to the tragedy of alcohol-related birth defects is an urgent cause. I would like to thank the many concerned parents, researchers, educators, and federal agencies who helped develop this bill. Their input has produced what I believe is a solid response to the challenge and obligation before us. I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join me in an effort that can save children from a legacy of unnecessary and overwhelming handicaps, and help those for whom prevention is too late to live independent, fulfilling lives. I believe that if they look at this issue closely, they will agree that it would be a crime to do any less.

Mr. DASCHLE. The leader and I both have expressed ourselves on this bill so many times that I do not know that we need to elaborate anymore. I share the view just expressed by the majority leader that this is as good as it is going to get for both sides. We can continue to be paralyzed and in a standoff or we can find a way with which to cooperate and come to some conclusion. 
I have expressed myself about my disappointment in the way in which our colleagues have been constrained, but I also recognize that the majority leader, as he has noted, is giving us far more amendments than what the Republicans are proposing. And so I think, all things considered--I know my colleagues have expressed great personal concern about this approach, but I also know that if we are ever going to resolve this matter, this is as good as it is going to get. 
So I commend the leader for his diligence and commitment to resolving these matters. I have pledged to him my cooperation to see if we can get to this point. We have done so. I am relieved that at long last we may have a real opportunity, as he has noted, to talk about ways in which to address a national problem, a national challenge. 
This provides a panoply of different approaches and different ideas. We feel very strongly, very excited, about many of the ideas that we have to offer. We will have that chance under this agreement. So I certainly would not object, and I encourage my colleagues to accept it, deal with it, offer amendments, and let us get on with the debate.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, over the course of the last several months, I have come to the Senate floor 3 times now to discuss this nation's nuclear strategy and forces in the post-cold-war era. In each of those previous statements, I made the central point that I perceive a growing mismatch between our strategy and forces and the real world considerations they were designed to address. I also used these opportunities to indicate several practical steps I thought we could take immediately to correct this growing imbalance. 
I come to the floor today, not to amend my previous observations, but rather to provide new, more compelling evidence to buttress my earlier conclusions. 
Let me reiterate the context of this debate. 
First, despite the end of the cold war nearly 7 years ago, the United States and Russia together still field roughly 14,000 strategic nuclear weapons--each with a destructive power tens or hundreds of times greater than the nuclear devices that brought World War II to a close. The closest rival, friend or foe, has less than 500 strategic weapons. 
Second, both the United States and Russia continue to keep roughly 5,000 of their strategic nuclear weapons on a high level of alert, ready to be launched at a moment's notice. 
Third, the United States and Russia continue to adhere to an overall strategic concept known as mutual assured deterrence or MAD. In addition, each side follows operational concepts that permit the first use of nuclear weapons and allow for the launch of weapons after receiving warning of attack but before the incoming warheads detonate. 
This set of facts is disconcerting to say the least. It has led the National Academy of Sciences, in an excellent report entitled `The Future of U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy,' to conclude that:  
The basic structure of plans for using nuclear weapons appears largely unchanged from the situation during the Cold War, with both sides apparently continuing to emphasize early and large counterforce strikes . . . As a result, the dangers of initiation of nuclear war by error or by accident remain unacceptably high. 
This same set of circumstances moved General Lee Butler, who just 4 years ago as a former commander of the Strategic Command was responsible for setting U.S. policy for deterring a nuclear war and, if deterrence failed, fighting such a war, to observe that, `our present policies, plans and postures governing nuclear weapons make us prisoners still to an age of intolerable danger.' 
Mr. President, I agree with the National Academy of Sciences and General Lee Butler. Our strategic nuclear forces are too large for the post-cold-war period, and our operational procedures carry an unacceptable level of risk. 
What are the practical ramifications of this assessment? I have concluded that the United States should seek an agreement to dramatically cut these forces and change the way they are operated. Mutually agreed upon and significant reductions in the numbers of strategic nuclear weapons are in the best interests of the United States. Mutually agreed upon changes in how we operate our forces and systems will increase trust and reduce pressure to launch nuclear weapons on a moment's notice. 
As I noted earlier, I have held these views for some time and have seen nothing to convince me otherwise. To the contrary, recent events have only served to strengthen my convictions. 
In particular, I am referring to an excellent two-part series from last week's Washington Post entitled, `Shattered Shield: The Decline of Russia's Nuclear Forces,' and a study released last Friday by the Congressional Budget Office. 
The main conclusion reached in the Washington Post series is that Russia's nuclear forces and its early warning and command and control systems suffer from a lack of resources that jeopardizes their very existence. 
According to these articles, knowledgeable experts in the United States and Russia have concluded that, `regardless of whether the United States and Russia move ahead on bilateral arms-control treaties, a decade from now Russia's forces will be less than one-tenth the size they were at the peak of Soviet power.' Russia's strategic nuclear arsenal is expected to decline from a cold war high of nearly 11,000 weapons in 1990 to a low of roughly 1,000 by 2007--less than 10 years from now. As evidence, experts point to growing number of Russia's nuclear-powered submarines piled up in port unfit for patrol, her strategic bombers incapable of combat, and a steady deterioration of her land-based missile force. 
In addition, they note that Russia is dedicating few resources to address this decline by developing new strategic systems. 
In short, Russia's strategic triad could cease to exist within the next 10 years. 
If forecasts about this decline are correct, as I and most experts believe, this turn of events presents an opportunity for U.S. and Russian policymakers to immediately push for much deeper joint reductions than currently contemplated under START II or even the START III framework. If the Russians are headed downward, now is the time to lock them in on significantly lower levels. 
If we fail to reach an agreement with the Russians on lower levels, future Russian governments will be free to act unencumbered by strict and verifiable limits. Fewer Russian nuclear weapons will reduce the threat this nation faces from intentional, accidental or unauthorized launch. Fewer U.S. nuclear weapons will still allow us to effectively deter any adversary and makes sense in the post-cold-war environment. 
In addition, this Post series highlighted a troubling development. Russia's systems designed to give it warning of an attack and command and control of its nuclear forces are facing the same precipitous decline as its nuclear forces for the same reason--lack of resources. 
Russia has lost access to many radar sites located on the territory of newly independent states while its system of satellites for detecting missile launches is slowly being depleted. According to one former Russian air defense officer, `Russia is partially blind.' And the situation is no better with respect to its command and control structure. About a year ago, then Defense Minister Igor Rodionov observed, `no one today can guarantee the reliability of our control systems. . . . Russia might soon reach the threshold beyond which its rockets and nuclear systems cannot be controlled.' 
These developments should not cause anyone in this country to rejoice. Russian problems with their early warning and command and control systems can very quickly become our problem. Russian inability to correctly assess whether a missile has been launched or to properly control all of its nuclear weapons puts our national security at risk. All of this is compounded by the fact that both sides continue to maintain excessively large numbers of nuclear weapons at excessively high levels of alert. 
It is in our interest to reduce Russia's dependence on these aging systems. This can best be done by changing the way the U.S. and Russia operate their forces. Each country should lower the number of weapons on hair-trigger alert, and the United States should consider sharing early warning intelligence with the Russians. 
A final piece of evidence to back up my conclusions surfaced late last week. The Congressional Budget Office, in a study carried out at my request, concluded that the Pentagon spends between $20 and $30 billion annually to maintain and operate our current level of nuclear weapons--roughly 7,000 deployed strategic weapons and between 500 and 1,000 tactical weapons. 
Moreover, if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to reject the advice of many outside experts and prevent us from even reducing to the Senate-ratified START II level of 3,500 strategic weapons, CBO estimates this shortsightedness will cost the Pentagon nearly $1 billion a year in constant 1998 dollars. 
If the Pentagon is forced to stay at these excessive nuclear weapons levels, the Defense Department must dump a billion dollars a year on unneeded systems, thereby depriving much more worthy Defense Department programs of much needed resources. 
If the Pentagon were allowed to follow a more rational course, this funding could be used to enhance the housing of our military personnel, to improve their quality of life, to increase their readiness and to arm them with the most sophisticated conventional weaponry available. If we are forced to stay on our current track, we will do none of these. 
Incidentally, CBO noted that if we were to reduce down to the level the Russians are expected to reach shortly, roughly 1,000 strategic nuclear weapons, the savings could reach as high as $2.5 billion annually. 
In summary, Mr. President, I stand by the conclusions I stated in my previous statements on this subject. Our current strategic nuclear policy and force posture is outmoded and in need of major and immediate reassessment. The only change in the intervening period since my first address on this subject is the emergence of new information that has strengthened my case and heightened the sense of urgency on this issue. 
As the Washington Post series points out, we have an opportunity and a responsibility to act quickly to change both our policy and our forces. 
The decline in Russian nuclear forces provides an ideal opportunity for us to make significant progress on the arms reduction front. The deterioration of Russia's early warning and command and control systems compels us to seek ways to reduce the unnecessary level of risk brought about by how we operate our forces. Finally, CBO's study demonstrates there is a financial cost from inaction as well. Our current defense posture forces the Pentagon to divert billions of dollars of scarce resources from more needed and important defense programs. 
Mr. President, now is the time to step into the future. We must dramatically reduce the levels of nuclear weapons and the associated risk levels. 
If we act in this manner, we will greatly reduce the risks of nuclear war, enhance our conventional force capabilities, and improve our own national security. 
Mr. President, acknowledging the presence of the distinguished Chair of the Senate Budget Committee, I yield the floor.  
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I regret that we have not been able to find a final and successful resolution to our discussions which have extended now over the course of several days. 
I think it is important to lay out what has happened to date and where we are so everybody knows what the circumstances are. As everyone knows, the legislation came to the floor immediately and a cloture vote was filed on the motion to proceed. I supported that motion to proceed because I felt it was important that we move on to the legislation. There was some concern expressed about other unrelated matters, and so there was a divided vote on the motion to proceed, but it was an overwhelming vote. 
We then got to the bill itself, and I expressed the desire on the part of many of our colleagues that we have a right to offer amendments. It was at that point that cloture was filed again, prior to the time we had the chance to offer even the first amendment. Cloture was not invoked, as the record shows. That began a series of negotiations about amendments. 
As I discussed the matter with my colleagues, our list included about 32 amendments originally proposed to the bill. While that sounds like a lot of amendments, as I have noted now on several occasions on the Senate floor, it pales by comparison with regard to a similar circumstance that we had in 1992. A narrowly drafted tax bill having to do with a matter that most of us are very interested in, enterprise zones, was offered, and our Republican colleagues proposed at that time that they be granted the right to offer 52 amendments, including amendments on unrelated matters--on tractors and scholarships and the like. 
We didn't offer 52 amendments; we originally suggested 32. We were told that that is too many. I went to all of my colleagues and I said, `Look, we will have to pare this down. I want to be cooperative.' So we pared it from 32 down to 15. I took that to the leader and I said the one thing we really are determined not to do is to give up our right to have those amendments second degreed, but we will drop it by more than 50 percent. We will go from 32 amendments down to 15 amendments so long as we have the right to have an up-or-down vote. 
They said, `Well, we will probably consider having up-or-down votes, but you have to put time limits on all the amendments.' Then I went to all my colleagues and I said, `Well, you aren't going to believe this. I'm going to have to ask you not only to pare your amendments from 32 to 15, but now I'm going to have to ask you to accept time limits, and we are hoping that we can limit it to at least a couple of hours each.' So it was suggested and my colleagues cooperated. 
I presented that, and I reported to the leader that we had agreed to time limits. The leader then came back and said, `Well, now we have a new request. The request is that not only do we want time limits, but the amendments have to be on education. We are not going to allow any amendments that are not related to education.' I went back to my colleagues again and I said, `You aren't going to believe this, but now we have to agree to limit our amendments to 15, to limit our amendments in terms of time, and now to limit them in terms of issue.' I went back again to the leader I said, `Well, I think we can do that.' 
He came back again and he said, `You are going to have to allow second degrees.' Now they have to be second degreed. I said, `I don't know if I can do that.' I went back to my colleagues again and I said, `You aren't going to believe this, but now we have to allow second degree amendments to all these amendments. Not only do you have to reduce from 32 to 15, not only do you have to allow a limit on the issue, that is education, but now you have to allow second degrees.' 
So on four separate occasions, because of demands from our Republican colleagues that be cooperative, I have had to call upon my colleagues to reduce the amendments by more than half, to reduce the amount of time, to allow second degrees, and not to allow any extraneous issues, even though 4 years ago when the roles were reversed they demanded votes on tractors. 
So I must say, Mr. President, the record ought to be very clear about who has cooperated here, who has put out the very best effort to ensure that somehow we could bring this bill to the floor. But the bar keeps getting raised higher and higher and higher. So if indeed we are the U.S. Senate, it seems to me there comes a time when you say, what else can we do? What else is there left? We have education amendments. We have agreed to second degrees. We have agreed to even less than an hour on these amendments; now it is down to a half hour on each amendment. We have agreed to that. We have agreed now that they be limited to education. We have even cut down further the number of amendments. Yet, our Republican colleagues say that is not enough. That is not enough. Go back and do more, prove to us more that you are going to be cooperative. Make sure that you ask your colleagues for more. 
I think there is a message here. The message is that nothing is good enough. Ultimately, there is no way we can satisfy our colleagues on the other side because I don't think they want an agreement. I must say that I do not fault the author of the bill. I am not suggesting he is behind this. I certainly do not fault the majority leader. I think he has made a concerted, good-faith effort to try to figure out a way to deal with this. But I must say that I hope he would say the same about me. I hope, after what I have just described, that it is clear that we have done everything I know how to do, under these circumstances, to be able to resolve this matter in a way that will accommodate both sides. But for me now to go back and say we have given our all, but now we have to even give up education amendments--the last criticism related to me by the majority leader was that we had too many education amendments. It wasn't the issue any longer. We have given that up. Now they are saying we have too many education amendments on an education bill. So now they are asking the minority to say, OK, majority, you tell us what the issue ought to be, what the circumstances for debate ought to be, and now even whether or not we should be able to offer an education amendment on an education bill and we should accept that because we are the minority. 
That is what this cloture vote is about, Mr. President. We are being asked to cave completely, to give it all up. We cannot do that. There comes a time when you have to be able to say, look, we just can't give anymore. 
So I hope my colleagues will understand that. We were within, I thought, minutes or inches of reaching an agreement, in part because of the effort made by the majority leader. But we are not there now. I hope the message will be clear; there comes a time when you just cannot give anymore. 
A couple of colleagues have asked to speak. I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts.

There are many things with which there are disagreements. That is really the essence of this whole debate. Shouldn't we have an opportunity to talk about some of those disagreements? But I think the record is pretty clear. After all these days, we have been precluded from offering the first amendment to which there may be some disagreement.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have indicated to the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee my frustration with the amendment process. The majority leader has noted the need for cooperation. 
I think we have been extraordinarily cooperative. I have encouraged my colleagues to withhold on an array of amendments that were proposed. Now we have an array of amendments here, including one now by the Senator from North Carolina having to do with school construction. If we want to get into a lot of these extraneous amendments, I have a whole pot load of amendments over here that we will begin offering. 
So, Mr. President, I call for the regular order under these circumstances so we can go back to the business at hand. The business at hand is to deal with the IMF amendment and to get on with resolving these matters once and for all so we can finally come to cloture on this legislation. I call for the regular order and hope that at long last we can begin dealing with these issues one by one.

Mr. DASCHLE. The reason I asked, Madam President, is because I am quite sure he cannot get unanimous consent on his side, at least for the moment. And I am not surprised he has not hot-lined it, because he realizes he cannot get unanimous consent. I know of at least one Republican Senator who has indicated he would object. There may be others. 
So, having just made that part of the record, let me address the issue that the distinguished majority leader has propounded once more. I see the chart, and it notes that we have been on this bill for 10 days. What I hope most people will recognize is that while we have been on it 10 days, our Republican colleagues have refused to entertain one Democratic amendment in those 10 days. What they are saying is, we want you to debate this bill on our terms or we are not going to debate it at all. So they bring the bill to the floor, they make a couple of speeches, they lament the fact that we cannot have this cave-in on Democratic amendments, and then they pull the bill and move on to something else. We have been playing this charade, this game, now for 10 days: Put the bill down, give a couple of speeches, pull the bill off, blame it on the Democrats. I do not know about anybody else, but I think that gets a little tiresome. We have seen this charade now in the name of education for 10 days, and we may see it for a lot more. 
In 1992, we had a similar situation. Democrats were in the majority; the Republicans insisted, in a similar situation, that they be allowed to offer 52 amendments; 52. I have checked with all of my colleagues. I am told there may be somewhere between 10 and 15 amendments, give or take; I am not sure. We are still working on it in good faith, in response to the distinguished majority leader, who said, by the way, late last Friday, we would have some announcement, we would see if we could find a resolution for this, by Tuesday. Here it is 4 o'clock on Monday and I am presented with this once more on the floor. No consultation. No personal discussion. This is: Here is a proposal. Why aren't you Democrats responding as you should? Why are you holding this bill hostage for 10 days? It makes me wonder if they want agreement or whether they want to play games. 
So, in 1992 our Republican colleagues said they had to have 52 amendments. What we are simply suggesting is that we have some very good ideas that are beyond the scope of this very limited--`Is that all there is?'--Republican answer to the problems we have in education. And for some reason they are afraid to vote on them. They do not want to vote on school construction. They do not want to vote on after-school programs. They do not want to vote on child care. They do not want to vote on all of the things that we have proposed in our agenda. Why? Because they will have to vote against them, and they don't want to do that. 
So that is what this is all about. Don't tell us we are holding this bill hostage. The hostage takers are on that side of the aisle. How they can come to the floor with a straight face and blame us is beyond me. But I have to tell you, we are going to continue to try to find a way to resolve this. I, in good faith, would like to find a way to allow our Senators the chance to offer good amendments on good education public policy. I want them to do it this week. 
The majority leader says we will have more opportunities. Why 
do I somehow fear that every time we will have an education vehicle on the floor, or a tax vehicle, we will be in this same situation? `It is our bill or nothing at all. It is our amendments or nothing at all. You take this or nothing at all.' Madam President, that just does not wash. This is the U.S. Senate, for Heaven's sake. Go over to the House and work under those kinds of rules if you want to constrain the debate that consequentially. 
So we will try to work it out. We will try to find a way to play by those rules. But I must say, it is very disconcerting. Sooner or later we will have a vote on school construction. There are too many schools out there that need some help. Sooner or later we will have an opportunity to vote on after-school programs, and on child care, and on the things that we have to do to deal realistically with public policy affecting education. No $7 bailout for those making $80,000 a year and say we have solved the education problem. That is not going to work. 
I see my colleague--I will be happy to yield to the Senator from North Dakota.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from North Dakota is absolutely right. I have never seen this so-called debating institution so fearful of debate as I have on this particular bill. It is the most tepid approach to a good, healthy debate about education that I think anyone can imagine: `File cloture because we don't want any amendments. File cloture because we don't want to have to vote on these amendments. File cloture because we have to move onto other things.' You can come up with 100 reasons why we should file cloture, but the bottom line is, if it is 10 days, we have wasted a lot of time talking about talking, and we have not been able to deal with one issue. So, the Senator is right.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Connecticut is correct. Under the proposal raised by the distinguished majority leader, you would be denied an opportunity on the bill of offering relevant legislation that might give us an opportunity to debate whether the $1.6 billion ought to be spent on a $37 tax bailout for those making $100,000, $200,000 a year--$37 is all this legislation provides them in tax relief--or an opportunity to sincerely and very deeply help some people who otherwise are having serious trouble finding ways in which to pay for child care in this country today. So you would be denied that right. 
I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct. This would be the perfect opportunity for us, as we debate how are we going to spend $1.6 billion, whether it ought to be spent perhaps on school construction. Should we spend it on child care? Should we spend more than $1.6 billion on matters concerning after-school programs and the applications of our new technology to education? Should we have an opportunity to say what is the proper Federal role, given our circumstances right now, given the constraints we are working under in the budget? 
For whatever reason, our Republican colleagues are saying, `I'm sorry we don't want you to offer those amendments. We don't want to have to vote on them. We don't want to spend the time on them.' Apparently they don't think it is important enough to spend the time on them. `We just want you to decide for us, and with us, whether giving $37 to people making $100,000 or more a year a tax break of $37 makes sense. That is what we want you to decide with us.' We don't think that ought to be the rule of the Senate. We think the debate of the Senate on education ought to be broader than that. We think there ought to be a real opportunity to talk in detail about these issues. 
We are prepared to perhaps work through some suggestions on how we might limit amendments and try to find a way with which to deal with those issues that are directly confronting us. We are not there yet. Maybe we can't. But simply to tell Democrats, `No, you are going to debate this bill on our terms or on no terms at all,' is just not something we can accept. So the Senator from Massachusetts is entirely correct.

Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to hear the majority leader's answer. My guess is, if I understand the Senator's question correctly, that they don't have an interest in school construction. They don't really have an interest in some of the amendments we are trying to offer here. They would prefer not to have to vote on them, because oftentimes these amendments are critical to school districts back home. So I don't blame the majority leader for trying to avoid having some of these tough votes. Maybe if I were in that position, I would, too. 
But the fact is that they are critical issues directly confronting education. We have an education bill pending. We have a tax bill pending, and the last time a circumstance similar to this occurred when we were in the majority, we let the Republicans offer 52 amendments. So that is really the essence of the question before us. Do we have a good debate about issues that are directly relevant to this bill or not? So far, the Republicans have refused us that debate. According to that chart, we are now in day 10. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, let me respond to a few of the points made by our colleagues in the last few minutes. 
First, with regard to the motion to proceed, the majority leader wasn't forced to file that motion. We could have gone on a motion to proceed. We could have gotten onto the bill. The problem, as the majority leader, I think, would note, is that there is a great deal of concern on this side about his inaction on judges. We have done 10 judges so far this year. There are approximately 40 judges still pending in the U.S. Senate. Six are on the calendar. He knows very well that that was a vote on judges. It was a vote desired by several of our colleagues on my side of the aisle to express how frustrated they are that we are not getting the cooperation that we were promised about Federal judges, 
about moving through these judges. We get one, we get another, we get a third maybe now and then--just enough to keep everybody mollified. But the fact is, you have 40 judges that still have to be acted upon, most of which haven't even come out of committee yet. 
He makes mention of the fact that he was `forced' to file cloture. He hasn't been forced to file cloture this year. He has chosen to file cloture, but he hasn't been forced to file cloture. No leader is forced to file cloture. He has filed cloture to prevent Democrats from offering amendments. So I suppose from that perspective, in order to preclude us from offering amendments, he is forced to do so, but he isn't forced, as leader, to prevent the Senate from having a good debate about these issues. 
I defy my Republican colleagues to find a time when we were in the majority that we filed cloture to prevent an amendment. Now, we had amendments; amendments were offered; but we never filed cloture to prevent an amendment, and I defy my colleagues to find a time. 
I would like to go to the point raised by the majority leader about how improper it is to offer amendments to a tax bill that are not directly related to education. Again, I go back to this time in 1992 when our Republican colleagues demanded they be able to offer 52 amendments. This particular bill, this Enterprise Zone Tax Incentives Act, was a tax vehicle very similar to the tax vehicle we have here on the education bill. This is an enterprise zone tax act. 
Our colleague from Florida, Senator Mack, whom I admire immensely, demanded the opportunity to offer an amendment on, what? On tractors. That is right. Our colleague from Florida asked to be able to be recognized so that he could offer an amendment on tractors on an enterprise zone act. 
And then my colleague, the distinguished majority leader, even though this was an Enterprise Zone Tax Incentive Act, said, `You know, I know it is just on enterprise zones, but I want to talk about scholarships; I want to have an amendment on scholarships.' And guess what? That is on the list, too. 
And then our colleague from Washington, Senator Gorton, said, `You know what, I know it is just a little old tax bill dealing with enterprise zones, but I have an amendment on dental schools, and I want to offer that.' And guess what happened? The U.S. Senate had a debate, we agreed to debate all the amendments to be offered, we had a debate on them, we offered our amendments, we had our day, we finished the bill, and it went on. 
But our Republican colleagues were not coming to the floor then saying, this is just an enterprise zone, so we don't think we ought to be able to offer nonenterprise zone amendments; we want to offer amendments on tractors; we want to offer amendments on dental schools; we even have a great scholarship amendment we think the Democrats ought to vote for. 
What a difference some time makes. It is now 1998. We have a tax bill on the floor. Our Republican colleagues are saying, `No, we don't want you to offer 52 amendments.' Last week it was a half a dozen, then it was 9, now the leader is saying 15--but not 52 and not on anything but education; you have to stick to education, by golly. 
This is an entitlement program. Let nobody misunderstand, this is an entitlement program we are talking about. If we pass this, we pass a new entitlement program. We pass a tax bill. So when you manage the Senate floor, you have to come to the realization that when you pass something with the consequences of a new entitlement and a new tax program, there may be a few amendments and they may not be just on the topic to which the bill is supposed to be directed. 
So, Madam President, we can talk about cattle and welfare and education and all of these issues. The bottom line is, are we ever going to get to a point where we can move off this impasse? I again make the offer to make my best effort to do so. We will continue to try to do so. But I hope nobody here is swayed by 
these arguments that we can't come on to the Senate floor with a tax bill and not talk about taxes and not talk about entitlements, and if we are going to talk about farms, maybe we ought to remember that once, not long ago, we talked about tractors and that was OK. 
I hope we can resolve this, but it is going to take some give on both sides, and we both have to realize that to move forward, it is going to require some cooperation here; we are not going to get it just the way we want it. We may not be able to offer 52 amendments, but we have some darn good amendments that ought to be considered here, and we are going to do all that we can to ensure that our rights are protected. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the President for his recognition. 
And I thank the majority leader for his innovative new offer. This comes as news. We have not had the opportunity to consider his new offer because this is the first time I have heard it. But, clearly, he is beginning to address the concern that Democrats have raised about the way in which this bill is going to be debated. 
None of us has proposed that somehow we want to keep from getting to final passage on this legislation. That isn't our objective. We have already noted the President is going to veto this bill, so we do not have to stop it from passing through the Senate. So that isn't our intent. 
Our intent all along has been simply to have a good debate, to offer our version of what we ought to be doing in education, to offer our version to suggest how we might spend one and a half billion dollars as we look at the array of challenges that we face. 
Now, the majority leader has proposed a plan that I have not yet had a chance to consider, but two questions arise immediately, and one is whether or not this proposal would allow us to deal with pre-educational years; that is, the childhood development questions that we are facing as some of our amendments deal directly with early childhood development. 
We have not indicated to any of our colleagues that they had to file their amendments. Would we be then precluding some of our Democratic Senators who had no idea that somehow, if you had not filed, you would not be protected? 
And then of course there is the question of just an hour. Some amendments are going to take a little longer than an hour; some will not. 
So there are a lot of questions here that obviously we can work through, but to throw the gauntlet down, to say we are going to file a cloture motion to deny anybody the opportunity to offer amendments even though they are certainly related to education, has been our objection all along. 
So I certainly would like to work with the majority leader. The best way to do it is to vitiate the cloture vote so we can talk through this, rather than to insist on cloture and then negotiate, claiming to have some real interest in finding some resolution here. But I certainly applaud the majority leader for his approach, his constructive way in which he wants to find a way to deal with the schedule. 
I yield to my colleague from Delaware, who also has taken a great interest in this issue, for any comment that he might have.

Mr. DASCHLE. I commend the Senator from Delaware for making a very important point. This is the U.S. Senate. I daresay there is not a Senator in this body who hasn't chosen to use a legislative vehicle for purposes of offering amendments that may not be germane. We all understand the germaneness rule. 
We all understand, many of us, why we left the House of Representatives to come to the U.S. Senate. We came to the U.S. Senate because we recognize the glory of the wisdom associated with the right of every Senator, and that is understood each and every time we come to the floor. 
The distinguished majority leader has made quite a point of citing the Coverdell bill as a bill related to education. It is also related to taxes. This is a tax bill, as well. This is a piece of legislation changing the Tax Code. 
Just so everybody understands what the majority leader is suggesting here, he is saying we don't want you to consider this a tax bill. The majority refuses to allow the minority to consider this a tax bill on the Senate floor. We want you to insist and promise that you will never offer a tax amendment on a tax bill that comes to the Senate floor. It is an education bill, so go ahead and offer an education amendment, but don't you dare offer a 
tax amendment to a tax bill. We are not going to allow that. 
Mr. President, I think that points out the fallacy of this whole matter and the reason why my distinguished colleague from Delaware made the point he did about the rights of the minority. How many tax bills will come to the Senate floor? How many opportunities will the minority have to offer legitimate, relevant, tax amendments? 
I am very concerned again about precluding the right of the minority. I was elected to represent 44 Democrats and their rights every time we come to the floor, regardless of the circumstance. I think all of our colleagues recognize the importance of protecting those rights. Whether it is tax, whether it is education, whether it is a matter related to something of great import to our colleagues, we have to protect that right. It doesn't matter the issue. What matters is the right. The right must be protected. That is really what these questions are all about. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know a lot of people are hoping to catch airplanes. We would like to keep as close to the 5:15 vote as we can. Again, I appreciate the majority leader's offer. Unfortunately, the offer does not include the Democratic substitute; it doesn't include the Dodd tax credit amendment for child care expenses; it doesn't include the Boxer after-school programs amendment. 
That makes my point. I think we can work out a way in which to deal with these amendments, but given the time, there certainly isn't the opportunity to do that right now. So things have not changed, unfortunately, to date, even though I think a good-faith effort has been made to try to accommodate some of this. We will have to continue to talk about it, and we are prepared to do that. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the President. 
Mr. President, I was in my office occupied on a satellite communication. I apologize for not being able to come to the floor until this moment. But I thank the distinguished ranking member of the Finance Committee for his efforts and for articulating the position of the Democratic caucus in this regard. 
Mr. President, education is probably the most important issue we will address this year, particularly with regard to the array of budgetary questions that we face and we are anxious to get to the bill to begin this debate. We don't expect that we are going to address every aspect of the education agenda with regard to this bill. But certainly when you have a tax vehicle and an education bill married, as this legislation represents, it affords us a real opportunity to talk about the array of challenges we face in this country, both from a tax as well as from an educational point of view. 
What we are simply asking for is a fair and open debate, giving the minority the opportunity to talk and to offer amendments that are not only germane but relevant. Unfortunately, our rules here in the Senate constrain us with regard to what has been offered. There is a big difference between a germane amendment and a relevant amendment. Democrats have an array of amendments dealing with education that are relevant, but under the very narrow definition of germaneness they are not germane to this bill. 
I have talked about this matter with the distinguished majority leader on a number of occasions. The offer that was given to us last night was the offer of a couple of amendments, or one substitute; we were to be satisfied with the ability to offer a couple of amendments. Mr. President, we have a larger number than a couple of amendments that we think ought to be warranted in this debate, that we think ought to be debated and that we think ought to be resolved in some way. So I, frankly, am not able to agree to a couple of amendments, or one substitute. 
We ought to have a good discussion. If we can spend 5 days on the Reagan Airport, and 4 days on a cloning resolution, my heavens, we ought to be able to spend 4 or 5 days on an issue of great importance to tens, if not hundreds, of millions of Americans today. 
So this is really our opportunity to do so. I am very disappointed that we would begin a debate with a cloture motion, begin the debate by saying, `Nope. We are going to stick to germaneness here,' and try to eliminate the opportunity to offer good amendments relevant to education simply because we have to get on to other things. I want to finish the NATO debate as well. I 
want to be able to get all of this work done, and I pledge my cooperation with the leader, but I hope that the cooperation would go both ways. Cooperation certainly involves giving Senators an opportunity to have a good debate. In some cases we might even be willing to agree to a time limit on these amendments. We don't need all day to talk about some of them. But we certainly need the opportunity. 
So I hope we can work this out. Until that time, certainly Democrats will not be in a position to support cloture. I look forward to talking more about that with the leader at the end of this colloquy. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me, if I could, respond briefly to a couple of points made by the majority leader. 
First of all, I have no reservations about his desire to double-track this legislation. Obviously, I think double-tracking makes sense. But he should not live under any misconception that somehow that is going to accelerate consideration of the education debate. We will have our day. We will have our opportunity to offer these amendments. Those amendments only have to be filed if cloture is invoked. And I hope my Democratic colleagues and many Republican colleagues understand the importance of having a good debate. Whether it is this week or next week or some other week, we are going to have that debate. We will have these amendments offered. We will have them considered. We are going to have it out. We will have a good discussion, as we should, in the Senate. 
This is not the House of Representatives. We are not working under closed rules and all of the constraints under which the House has continued to perform its duties. That is the beauty of this body. And we are going to see that respect for the rules of the institution is upheld. 
It is certainly the majority leader's right in that regard. I wasn't suggesting, in an earlier point I made about the number of days we spent on cloning, that we should not spend them. I 
of days we spent on cloning, that we should not spend them. I just felt that it might be a little more productive to spend them in committee, where this belonged, rather than to rush to the floor with a solution before we had an opportunity to think through what the solution might be. So I thought it really was wasted time. I may be the only one in that regard. But eventually we will come back with something that makes sense. This didn't make sense. And I am hopeful that ultimately we will come to a solution. 
But we did spend 4 days. That was the point. We spent 4 days on something thrown together to respond, in my view, very haphazardly to a very serious problem. If we can spend 4 days on that, it would seem to me we can spend a good while talking very constructively about one of the most important issues facing this country and our agenda in the Senate. 
So I have no objection. I appreciate very much the opportunity to express myself.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we will not object to the rollcall vote as proposed in the motion offered by the majority leader. Let me just say, after consultation with a number of my 
colleagues, I think it is clear that many of us yesterday voted on the motion to proceed with an expectation we would be able to go to the bill. I voted that way and encouraged my Democratic colleagues to vote that way, even though, as the leader indicated, because of unrelated questions, not related to education, more related to judicial nominations, some of our colleagues understandably voted in frustration about their inability to move through the judicial process and the confirmation of judges as was expressed by my colleagues yesterday. 
Our desire, our hope, is that we can move ahead with this bill. Our hope is that we can offer amendments. As I have noted, we would be willing to take time agreements on most, if not all, of them. I would be willing to work into an agreement with the leader on that matter on these amendments. Unfortunately, we will not have that opportunity if we go to the NATO resolution. 
So while we will certainly comply with the vote and have the vote at this moment, it is not my desire to support it and I would hope my Democratic colleagues would not either. 
I yield the floor, and I thank the majority leader for his consideration.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join with the majority leader and with all of my colleagues in reflecting upon this moment and in joining with him in offering our gratitude and our congratulations to this American hero. 
It may have been 25 years, and with years memories fade, but no one should ever forget the commitment made by John McCain and people like him on behalf of their country. They and their families can never forget the pain, the sacrifice, the commitment. 
Someone once said that democracy is something one either has to fight for or work at. John McCain has done both--fighting for democracy, as none of us could ever appreciate, and working at democracy as he does with us each and every day. 
There are thousands and thousands of people who have made a similar commitment, and were they here, I know that we would articulate in much the same sincere fashion our expression of gratitude to them. 
So, in some ways, John McCain not only represents his own experience, but that of all those he served with so valiantly during the Vietnam war. 
I join with my colleague Trent Lott, the majority leader, in recognizing that there are things that never go away: the importance of commitment, the recognition of the need for sacrifice, the continued need to work at and fight for democracy in this and in other countries. 
A resolution of this nature is certainly fitting, and on behalf of all of our colleagues, I hope we can say with unanimity, `Thank you, thank you, John McCain.'

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in introducing the Medicare Early Access Act. The bill offers new coverage options for a population that faces significant problems finding affordable insurance, individuals between age 55 and 65, the age at which they become eligible for Medicare. 
It is not easy to be without health insurance between the ages of 55 and 65. You are twice as likely as someone just 10 years younger to experience heart disease, cancer, or other significant health problems. 
And it is not easy to find health insurance when you're between 55 and 65. Prices for coverage often are unaffordable. For those with serious health problems, finding coverage can be impossible. 
There are 2.9 million individuals ages 55 to 65 without health insurance. Some individuals in this age group lose their employer-based health insurance when their spouse becomes eligible for Medicare. Many lose their coverage because their company downsizes or their plant closes. Still, others lose insurance when promised retiree health coverage is dropped unexpectedly. 
A little over 3 years ago, 1,200 former employees of the John Morrell meatpacking plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, received letters in the mail telling them their retiree health benefits would be canceled in a matter of weeks. These were men and women who had worked for 20, 30, even 40 years at the Morrell plant. 
The company did not give them retiree health benefits out of the goodness of their hearts. The Morrell workers earned those benefits. They took smaller pay increases and made other sacrifices while they were still working so they could have some measure of security when they retired. 
The letters telling the Morrell retirees that their former company was canceling their health benefits was just the first of many shocks. An additional shock came when those Morrell employees under 65 were forced to buy exorbitant private health insurance--an extremely difficult purchase on a retiree's pension. 
To address these concerns, I introduced legislation, S. 1307, the Retiree Health Benefits Protection act of 1997. S. 1307 would require companies to keep the promises they make to their retirees and their families. 
I am pleased that the President, Senator Moynihan, and Representative Stark have incorporated a key piece of that bill in the Medicare Early Access Act. This provision would allow retirees between ages 55 and 65 to buy into their former employer's health plan if the employer cancels or substantially reduces promised benefits. Retirees and their spouses would remain eligible until they turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare. 
The Medicare Early Access Act includes two additional important provisions for individuals ages 55 to 65. First, it would allow people between the ages of 62 and 65 who do not have access to group coverage to buy into the Medicare program. Second, it would offer access to Medicare for workers between the ages of 55 and 65, and their spouses, when their employer downsizes or their plant shuts down. 
Some have questioned whether this program will hurt the current Medicare program. Let me emphasize that the proposal will pay for itself. All workers and retirees who buy into Medicare under our plan would pay premiums out of their own pockets. Any additional costs would be paid through savings from Medicare anti-fraud and abuse measures. Because the bill is self-financing, it does not in any way threaten Medicare's solvency or its future. It is responsible proposal that pays for itself. 
Mr. President, there are hundreds of thousands of Americans who could benefit from this bill. It is my hope that we can engage in productive debate over the next few weeks and find a way to fill these gaps in health insurance coverage, instead of making excuses about why we are waiting to help these individuals.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, in wishing a happy 95th birthday to former Senator and Ambassador Mike Mansfield. If historians were to accept nominations for individuals who are living embodiments of 20th century history, I would nominate Mike Mansfield to be our Democratic representative. 
Ambassador Mansfield's life has framed some of the great events of this century, from his service as a 14-year-old sailor in the U.S. Navy in World War I, to his role as an architect of modern American policy toward Japan as long-time U.S. Ambassador. Along the way, Mike Mansfield shaped history in both ordinary and extraordinary ways: as a miner and mining engineer, as a professor of history and political science, and as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate from Montana, including a remarkable 16-year tenure as Senate Majority Leader. 
As you know, Mr. President, Mike Mansfield's majestic portrait now presides over a room that bears his name just off the Senate floor. To Senators, staff, and visitors, it is a reminder of a Senate giant who was a quiet rock of integrity and perseverance. I am honored and grateful that we have the opportunity today to thank this living reminder of America's greatness and its goodness. Happy birthday, Ambassador Mansfield, and best wishes for many more years of good health and happiness. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DASCHLE. 
Mr. President, I would like to call to the Senate's attention an impressive milestone that a member of this body will reach this weekend. On Saturday the senior Senator from Kentucky, my friend and Democratic Whip, Wendell Ford, will have served the state of Kentucky in the Senate for the 8,478th day. He will become the longest-serving Senator in Kentucky history. 
While I suspect that Senator Ford might be more concerned this weekend about how his beloved Kentucky Wildcats will fare in the NCAA basketball tournament than about achieving any personal record, I hope he will allow me a few minutes to recognize this tremendous achievement. 
It gives me great personal satisfaction to see Senator Ford cap his distinguished Senate career by reaching this milestone. It is also appropriate that Senator Ford does so by surpassing the length of service of another great Senator from Kentucky, the former Democratic Leader and then Vice President of the United States, Alben Barkley. 
Wendell Ford began his Senate service back in December 1974. In 23-plus years, he has made his mark in the Senate in an extraordinary number of ways: as a tenacious fighter for the people of Kentucky, as a skilled parliamentarian and orator, as a leader and faithful soldier of his party, and as a genuinely warm, funny, and down-to-earth human being. 
Perhaps the Almanac of American Politics best described his political tenacity when it said that Senator Ford's `fierce determination to champion Kentuckians' interests seems rooted in a sense that they are little guys who are victims or targets of big selfish guys elsewhere--that they are as humble as Ford's own economic background.' Indeed, anyone who has engaged Senator Ford in the legislative arena knows that he is deeply rooted in the Kentucky soil from which he sprang. 
He has been a thoroughly tireless defender of Kentucky's working families, from 60,000 tobacco growers on small farms across the state to the coal miners in Appalachia's hills and hollows. Wendell Ford surely deserves one of the highest compliments one can give a Senator: that he has never forgotten where he came from. 
Though I can think of no one more tenacious in defense of his constituents, I can also think of no Senator more loyal to his party, 2 traits that are sometimes difficult to reconcile. 
Wendell Ford has served his party in a variety of ways: as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee; as chairman and ranking member of the Senate Rules Committee; as chairman and ranking member of the Commerce Subcommittee on Aviation; and, since 1991, assistant Senate Democratic Leader and Whip. 
His friendship and counsel to me during my tenure as Senate Democratic leader have been invaluable. I could not imagine learning the many facets of this job without Senator Ford at my side. Wendell Ford represents the best of the Senate's old school. He is someone who reveres the traditions and rules that are the foundation of the Senate. He is also someone who values the courtesy, humor, and personal bonds that give the Senate its life and its sense of common purpose. 
Mr. President, the state of Kentucky has sent a number of talented men to this chamber. Men like Albert `Happy' Chandler, Earle C. Clements, John Sherman Cooper, and certainly the legendary Henry Clay come to mind. It is a high honor that Wendell Ford stands next to these great Kentuckians in service to their state. But it is perhaps most appropriate that Senator Ford surpassed the tenure of former Senator Alben Barkley. Like Senator Ford, Alben Barkley had roots in the soil, born on a small tobacco farm in Kentucky. 
Like Senator Ford, Alben Barkley served his state and country in a range of positions, from county judge, to Congressman, Senator, then Vice President of the United States. And like Senator Ford, he was in the Senate leadership in both the Majority and Minority, serving as Leader in both capacities. 
Tested by the loss of the Senate majority in the mid-l940s, Senator Barkley turned adversity to his advantage. In 1948, a poll of journalists in Colliers magazine recognized Minority Leader Barkley as the most effective member of the Senate. This was remarkable, since 10 years earlier, a similar poll had left him completely off the list of the 10 most effective members even though he was Majority Leader. 
In recognition of his effectiveness, one journalist commented that `under conditions that would have caused a less determined man to walk out and rest, he continued to work for his country through his party.' Another said that `by his wisdom, humor, and moderation, plus his devotion to the system, he has strengthened the concept of party responsibility.' More appropriate words could not be spoken about Senator Ford, either. 
We can only hope that Senator Ford may also look to one other example set by Alben Barkley. Senator Barkley became Vice President Barkley in 1948. He served in that capacity for 1 term. Not content to accept a permanent retirement after leaving the Vice Presidency, however, Barkley ran again for the Senate in 1954 and won, returning to his beloved Senate. Maybe Senator Ford will keep that in the back of his mind. 
But taking Senator Ford at his word--that he will be leaving the Senate for good at the end of this year--his staff and I have tried to settle on a fitting tribute to the longest-serving Senator in Kentucky history. A tribute that will symbolize for every Kentuckian the enduring commitment to their well being that Wendell Ford has shown. 
Today I am introducing a bill to name the school under construction in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, the `Wendell H. Ford Education Center.' The Wendell H. Ford Education Center will assume its name the day Senator Ford leaves the Senate. I hope the students who enter its halls will fully appreciate the contributions of Wendell H. Ford and the remarkable way in which he has led his colleagues, his State, and his country in the difficult challenges we have faced in the past 25 years. 
Like many in Kentucky, many in this chamber are familiar with one of Senator Ford's trademark greetings, `How are all you lucky people doing?' This is sometimes abbreviated to simply, `Hey, Lucky!' Truly, all of us who have served with Senator Ford have been extremely lucky. He will be missed by a lot of people around here when he retires at the end of this Congress. 
But today, we all should all take a moment to congratulate and thank Senator Wendell Ford on his record-breaking service to the people of Kentucky, the United States Senate, and the country.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, lately we have watched, marveled at and cherished several monumental athletic achievements. 
A young woman from Idaho, Picabo Street, abbreviates knee surgery recovery to win the gold medal in the Super-G at the Olympic Games in Nagano. John Elway, a 14-year veteran and one of the NFL's premier quarterbacks, leads the underdog Denver Broncos to a victory in Super Bowl XXXII. And, just last weekend, `The Great One,' Wayne Gretzky of the New York Rangers, makes history by becoming the first professional hockey player to score 1,000 goals. 
Mr. President, in keeping with the competitive spirit and standard of excellence embodied in such athletic feats, I want to acknowledge another noteworthy sporting accomplishment. 
A little more than a week ago, on March 1, the Senate pages trounced the House pages, 70 to 35, in the Congress Bowl--a knock-down, drag-out, 8 against 8 battle to the finish. Before a standing room only crowd, the competition was fierce and the play physical in the inaugural meeting of these arch rivals. And, like Picabo Street, John Elway and Wayne Gretsky before them, the Senate athletes demonstrated superior determination, teamwork and skill in cruising to victory. 
Congratulations to all who participated in the Congress Bowl--especially the Senate page team of Colin Davis, Ben Dow, Dan Teague, Sina Nazemi, Bird Bourne, Sean Boyle, Mitch Witherspoon, Brad Wolters and Nick Messina who brought home the win in what promises to be a new and spirited long-term rivalry.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senate owes a great debt of gratitude to the Committee on Environment and Public Works, its Chairman (Mr. Chafee) and Ranking Member (Mr. Baucus) for developing an excellent legislative package to reauthorize the Federal surface transportation programs. Among the many visionary provisions in this bill, the Committee included a provision in S. 1173 that requires the United States Department of Transportation to carry out a bridge research grant program to demonstrate the application of innovative materials in the construction of bridges. 
The State of South Dakota is on the cutting edge of efforts to develop innovative materials for use in bridge construction. Polymer Bridge Systems, Inc., of Mitchell, South Dakota, has developed a very impressive technology that makes it possible to construct items like bridges and utility poles out of composite plastics. Its products use a relatively inexpensive bamboo core for strength. Advanced composites show great promise in reducing costs of bridges and speeding their construction, particularly in rural areas such as those found in our states. 
This Senator has seen samples of this innovative product. It has won wide national recognition ahead of others developed by large corporations we are all familiar with. In fact, the South Dakota Department of Transportation is installing a model bridge developed by Polymer Bridge Systems, Inc., at a weigh station in the state. This product shows great economic development potential, as they intend to manufacture it in the State. 
Mr. President, I would inquire of the distinguished ranking member (Mr. Baucus), if advanced composites are the type of material the Committee on Environment and Public Works intended to be researched under this new grant program?

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I share the view expressed just now by the majority leader. Certainly, our chairs and ranking members have done an outstanding job. I especially want to commend the dean of the Senate, our former majority leader, Robert Byrd, and his colleague, Phil Gramm, and others who had so much to do with making this possible. 
This has been an effort that will have extraordinary consequences for years to come, both in terms of infrastructure and an array of different questions that we have to address. This has been an issue that Senator Byrd has instructed and educated the Senate about for many, many months. It was his leadership and diligence, along with Senator Chafee and Baucus and Senator Warner and so many others, that brought us to the successful conclusion that we have now achieved. 
I commend them. I thank them. And I hope we can use this as a real model for other pieces of legislation that may come before the Senate this year. 
I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Congress last year approved a $2.3 billion tax program primarily to finance capital improvements for Amtrak. This amendment applies to that legislation, which was part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. 
Under the able and distinguished leadership of the Chairman of the Finance Committee [Mr. Roth] and the Ranking Member [Mr. Moynihan], the law wisely set aside 1 percent of the total tax benefit for each state with no Amtrak service, which amounts to $23 million. The 6 states currently lacking Amtrak service are South Dakota, Wyoming, Oklahoma, Maine, Alaska and Hawaii. However, the law limited the use of those funds by non-Amtrak states to inter-city passenger rail or bus service capital improvements and maintenance, or the purchase of inter-city passenger rail services from the National Railroad Passenger Corporation. 
This formulation presented real problems for states like South Dakota, Wyoming, Hawaii and some of the other non-Amtrak states that have no passenger rail service and only limited inter-city bus service. Due to these limitations, this otherwise valuable funding would not significantly benefit our states, nor could they wisely invest funds in such service. 
Our amendment would expand the eligible uses of funding provided to non-Amtrak states under this provision to include the expenditure of such funds for transit, rail and highway safety, state-owned rail lines, small rural air service facilities, and passenger ferryboat service. These modes of transportation provide a similar function in our states to the role played by Amtrak in the states it serves. 
None of these funds come from any other states, nor does our amendment authorize any additional funds for our states. It is completely budget-neutral. Rather, it simply expands the eligible uses of the funds that our states are already scheduled to receive by law. 
Mr. President, let me explain the types of programs our states could use these funds for under our amendment. 
First, it allows use of our funds for rural and public transportation projects that are eligible for funding under Sections 5309, discretionary transit-urban areas, 5310, transit capital for the elderly and handicapped, and 5311, rural transit capital and operations. Rural public transportation, a portion of which is inter-city in nature in transporting elderly and disabled from small towns to larger cities for medical care, shopping and other purposes, as well as providing local nutritional needs and mobility, is extremely important and needed in South Dakota in order to deal with the vast aging population in a sparsely populated area. During FY 1996 in my state, rural public transportation operators provided 1,114,672 rides and traveled 2,102,414 miles transporting the elderly and disabled of which over 50% of the rides were for medical, employment and nutritional needs. However, only about two-thirds of the state currently has access to limited public transportation, and over half of the existing transit vehicles in the providers' fleets are older than 7 years or have over 100,000 miles. Therefore this funding would address significant public transit needs. 
Second, it allows use of our funds for rail/highway crossing safety projects that are eligible for funding under Section 130 of Title 23. Only 219 out of 2025 of South Dakota's rail/highway crossings are signalized, and there is a tremendous unmet need to improve the safety of rail/highway crossings in the state. 
Third, it provides for capital expenditures for state-owned rail lines. This is extremely important for states like South Dakota, which made a major investment and currently owns many of the rail lines operating in the state in order to provide a core rail transportation system to benefit the state's agricultural economy. This is a very narrow class of operations. This special one time credit would be utilized only to upgrade state-owned railroads. In cases where states own railroad facilities, they were purchased by the state only as a last resort. The state took extraordinary measure to preserve a core level of rail transportation to protect the public interest and support the state's economy. 
South Dakota owns 635 miles of active trackage that was purchased from the bankrupt Milwaukee Railroad in the 1980's. The primary operation on this line is performed under an operating agreement between the South Dakota and the Burlington Northern/Santa Fe Railroad. Much of the state-owned rail line has been in place since it was originally constructed, and much of it is in sub-standard condition or is too lightweight to efficiently handle current railroad car weights. This funding would allow the state to upgrade its rail line to enhance movement of agriculture and natural resource products. 
Fourth, it expands the eligible use of the funds to hazard elimination safety projects that are eligible for funding under Section 152 of Title 23. This funding would be used to implement safety improvements at locations on public roads where there is a documented high accident frequency. Projects eligible under this program include installation of traffic signals, traffic control signs, or guardrails; reconstruction of intersections, construction of turning lanes, climbing lanes, or passing lanes; flattening slopes, removing sharp curves, and other appropriate safety measures. This would reduce the potential for traffic accidents and save lives. 
Finally, at the request of my distinguished colleague from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], the amendment permits use of the funds for passenger ferryboat service within any non-Amtrak state. This makes perfect sense for states like Hawaii and Alaska that rely on ferryboat service in the same fashion that other states rely on Amtrak service. 
Mr. President, I thank the able Ranking Member on the Committee on Environment and Public Works [Mr. Baucus] for his assistance in moving this amendment, and the assistance of the distinguished Chairman [Mr. Chafee] for expediting its consideration.

 Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the amendment to strike extension of the ethanol tax incentive from the federal highway bill. This program has proven its value to the nation in the past, and its continuation is important not only to the economic vitality of rural America, but also to the national goals of improving air quality and weaning the country from its dangerous dependence on foreign oil. 
Over the last 20 years, ethanol has grown from a good idea to a serious alternative fuel for American motorists. Its use today--over a billion gallons per year--significantly reduces our need to import foreign oil. As General Lee Butler has pointed out, every barrel of oil we import from the Middle East costs us, in real terms, more than $100 The cost Americans pay at the pump for gasoline is not reflective of this extraordinary investment, which underscores the need to do even more to reduce our consumption of imported oil. 
In addition, clean-burning ethanol helps cities throughout the country achieve clean air standards inexpensively and easily, while reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. And, in rural America, it provides jobs at a time when family farms are struggling to survive. 
Mr. President, less than a year ago, this body made clear its overwhelming support for renewable fuels when it defeated a similar amendment to the budget bill by a vote of 69 to 30. The Senate should reaffirm its support for this program just as resoundingly today. 
The only difference between last year and today is that today we are debating this tax incentive in the context of the transportation bill. In the past, some have raised the specter that this tax incentive could reduce the federal investment in our transportation infrastructure. I would like to dispel that argument once and for all.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we all believe that America is the land of opportunity. But the road to opportunity is not always an equal access road. The highway construction industry in particular has kept newcomers, like women and minority-business owners, in the slow lane. There's no reason equal opportunity should be sacrificed when it comes to road building 
That's why I support the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise, or DBE, program and oppose the McConnell amendment. The DBE program was signed into law by President Reagan and reaffirmed by President Bush; it has always enjoyed bipartisan support. Designed to enhance opportunity for all, and not limit it for any--it's a true equal opportunity program. 
Contrary to arguments made by opponents of the DBE program, the Supreme Court in the Adarand case did not find the DBE program unconstitutional. The Court held only that strict scrutiny should apply to federal affirmative action programs as it does to those implemented by the states. Strict scrutiny requires that there be a compelling government interest in addressing discrimination and that the means chosen to address the discrimination be `narrowly tailored.' The DBE program meets both tests. 
There is clearly a compelling interest in addressing the pervasive discrimination that has characterized the highway construction industry. According to the Supreme Court, `[t]he unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups is an unfortunate reality, and the government is not disqualified from acting in response to it.' 
The DBE program is also narrowly tailored, meeting the second prong of the Adarand test. The DBE program does not include quotas or set asides--it is a `goals' program. The individual States set their own goals that can be above or below the national goal of 10 percent. The DBE program does not set rigid numerical targets that must be met to avoid a penalty nor does it set aside contracts or dollars for certain businesses. Demonstrating conclusively that it is not a quota, the DBE program has no sanctions for failure to meet a goal. 
Working to make the program even stronger, the Department of Transportation is issuing new regulations that ensure that it is as narrowly tailored as possible. For example, the new regulations provide that the program must give priority to race-neutral measures to reach out to women and minority-owned businesses; must ensure that good faith efforts are enough, even if the bidder has not achieved the goal; must ensure that the goal-setting is based on number of qualified DBEs in the state; and tighten up the certification process so that only qualified DBEs are in the program. 
The DBE program is not only constitutional, but also is effective and necessary. The program creates jobs--the Department of Transportation estimates that the program directly or indirectly results in more than 100,000 jobs each year. It also serves as a motor for economic development in disadvantaged communities, with more than two billion dollars in construction contracts going to small businesses under the program. Women too have benefited greatly from the program. Since women were included as DBEs, their procurement dollars have grown by approximately 175 percent. 
But we should not rest on our laurels. The time has not come to end the program, since women and minority-owned businesses are still greatly underrepresented in the highway construction industry. Minorities make up over twenty percent of the population, but minority businesses are only nine percent of all construction firms and those businesses get only five percent of construction receipts. Women own a third of all small businesses but receive less than three percent of federal procurement contract dollars. 
In my state of South Dakota, there are seven DBEs qualified as prime contractors and 75 DBE subcontractors. Their contribution to South Dakota's economy and to their own communities goes beyond just the jobs they create and the business they generate. They are inspiring a new generation of small business owners to believe that they, too, will be able to drive on the road to opportunity. 
That's why we need to keep this program--because we need to ensure that that road to opportunity is the wide open road that America is known for. 
Mr. LIEBERMAN, Mr. President, I rise to express my views on the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, and to explain why I have decided to vote against Senator McConnell's amendment, which would eliminate that program. This was not an easy decision for me to make. In attempting to analyze the constitutionality of the DBE program, we are dealing with a complicated area of the law, where many issues remain unsettled. But just as importantly, the outcome of this vote will affect hundreds of thousands of hard working Americans, of all races and of both sexes. 
I have always opposed laws that establish quotas. I am going to vote against this amendment because I am convinced that the DBE program does not create quotas. There is substantial flexibility built into the program for states to set their own goals based on local conditions. If they fail to meet their own goals, there is no federal sanction or enforcement mechanism. The Secretary of Transportation may waive the national goal of 10% for any reason, and presumably would do so if the collective efforts of the states did not add up to 10% of all ISTEA funds expended. All that convinces me that the percentage stated, while troubling is a goal not a quota. 
But I am still troubled by the fact that this law establishes goals based on gender and racial classifications. Any law that confers some benefit based on gender or race can cause unfair results; those who are not members of the enumerated categories, the non-beneficiaries of the program, are being denied absolutely equal treatment. We should all hesitate before enacting such a provision. Indeed, the Supreme Court's Adarand decision now requires us to engage in a careful analysis before enacting such a provision. In Adarand the Supreme Court held that Congress may only enact racial classifications that are narrowly tailored to further a compelling interest. This standard of review, known as `strict scrutiny', is difficult to meet, but in her opinion for the Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor emphasized that federal affirmative action programs could and would be upheld where Congress was acting in response to the practice and lingering effects of discrimination. 
I am voting against the McConnell amendment in spite of my reservations because I am convinced that discrimination persists in the transportation construction industry and in related industries, and because I believe that the DBE program is narrowly tailored to attack the ongoing practice of that discrimination. The program therefore is both justifiable as sound policy and in compliance with the Supreme Court's Adarand decision. 
We have before us ample evidence of historic and more importantly ongoing discrimination in the relevant industries, not just the transportation construction industry but also in the surrounding economic structure of lenders, suppliers, surety companies, and trade unions. Much of this evidence appears in the record before Congress; Congressional committees have received testimony describing this discrimination, and on many occasions committees of the House and the Senate have concluded that barriers still remain to equal participation by women and minorities. 
In May of 1996, the Department of Justice published in the Federal Register an extensive survey of evidence showing how discrimination works to preclude minorities from obtaining the experience and capital needed to form and develop a business, and how discriminatory barriers deprive existing minority firms of full and fair contracting opportunities. That report found `powerful and persuasive [evidence] that the discriminatory barriers facing minority-owned businesses are not vague and amorphous manifestations of historical and social discrimination. Rather, they are real and concrete, and reflect ongoing patterns and practices of exclusion, as well as the tangible, lingering effects of prior discriminatory conduct.' Discrimination by trade unions and private employers has prevented minorities from getting the requisite experience and opportunity to move on to self-employment. Dozens of studies and lawsuits cited in the report demonstrate gross disparities over the years in these sectors of the economy, often caused by proven racial discrimination. Similarly, minorities have often been shut out of lending and bonding markets: a recent study in Denver found that African-Americans were 3 times more likely to be rejected for business loans than whites, and Hispanics were 1.5 times as high. Contracting itself too often remains a `closed network'; prime contractors maintain their long-standing relationships with their subcontractors, and the new entrant minority or women-owned firms are excluded. 
In my view, this evidence of discrimination is sufficient to establish the compelling interest required by the Adarand decision. But let's move beyond dry statistics for a moment and consider the people behind these numbers. Earlier I referred to the burdens that gender and racial classifications can impose on innocent parties. Our decision today is so difficult because we must compare that inequity to the harm caused to other, equally innocent people, by discriminatory business practices. The companies now benefitting from the DBE program are not inferior; we have heard no complaints about the quality of their work. Yet without the program many of them never would have received an opportunity to win contracts. I have met with these small-business owners, and they are rightfully proud of their accomplishments, and grateful for the opportunity this program gives them. 
Just as I am satisfied that ISTEA's DBE program serves a compelling interest, so too am I convinced that the program is narrowly tailored to further that interest, as required by the Adarand decision. My belief that the DBE program will survive court scrutiny is bolstered by the new regulations that the Department of Transportation will be finalizing in several months. From my discussions with the Transportation Secretary and my staff's discussions with Transportation Department attorneys, it appears to me that the staff at that agency have been doing an excellent job poring over court decisions as well as comments from interested parties. The new regulations will adhere very strictly to the narrowly tailored test, and the result will be a DBE program that considers gender and racial characteristics without becoming quotas. 
For example, states will be given a great deal more flexibility in determining how to calculate their goals, based on the availability of qualified DBEs in the relevant industries. These formulae are designed to focus on the extent to which discrimination in the contracting industry has actually reduced opportunities for DBEs, and to determine how much DBE participation there would be in the absence of discrimination. 
Under the rules someone who is not himself financially disadvantaged will not be able to qualify for the DBE program, regardless of how small his company is. Anyone will be able to start a proceeding to prove that an individual owning a DBE is not actually socially and economically disadvantaged. On the other hand, anyone not presumed to be socially or economically disadvantaged would be able to apply for DBE status based on special circumstances. Finally, the DBE program makes extensive use of gender and race-neutral alternatives, as well as waivers. 
I have listed only some of the more important regulations that have helped convince me that the DBE program will be narrowly tailored to further a compelling interest when it is implemented. Although I am satisfied that the DBE program can survive the courts' scrutiny, I still recognize that innocent people may be burdened by the program's effect on their livelihoods. Our obligation, and the obligation of the Executive Branch, is to minimize these unfair results in the design and implementation of the DBE program, and to strive for a day when we will not feel the need to incorporate even gender or racial goals into our laws at all.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do so to comment on a couple matters raised by the distinguished majority leader. 
First of all, he noted we have spent at least 3 weeks on this bill already, 2 last fall and 1 last week. He also noted that this has been a productive week, and I share that view; it has been productive. I will encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of cloture Monday night simply because we have to come to closure. There are a lot of good amendments to be offered yet. We will have that debate, but we can do that under the strictures which cloture provides, and I am very supportive of resolving the outstanding questions so we can move on. 
I also compliment, as the majority leader did, our two managers. They have done an outstanding job, to date, in working with Members on both sides. I hope that we can continue to be responsive to the concerns, both with the schedule as well as with the legislation. I am sure that will be the case. 
Finally, I thank all of those who voted in favor of tabling the previous amendment. I commend the leadership on both sides who took the active interest in enlightening us all about the importance of the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program. I appreciate very much the overwhelming vote we just had and, hopefully, at long last, it will put this issue to rest. 
Again, Mr. President, I share the sentiment expressed by the leader. This is the time to move this legislation forward. This cloture vote will allow us to do that. I am hopeful that we can have a good debate on other amendments on Monday and have that vote Monday night so we can complete our work sometime by the middle of next week. I have no objection.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in support of the Women's Health Research and Prevention Amendments of 1998, a bill that responds to a fundamental weakness in our health care system: the relative paucity of research devoted to women's health issues. As we learn about the unique health care needs of women, we have an historic opportunity to redress the unjustified disparity in the level of effort and resources invested in women's health. 
This measure extends several targeted initiatives of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), including research on osteoporosis; breast, cervical and ovarian cancer; and heart disease as it affects women. 
This research is clearly needed. While heart disease is the leading cause of death among women, there is inadequate understanding of how heart disease manifests in our female population. Indeed, a recent study showed that 2 out of 3 doctors were not aware that the risk factors for heart disease are different for women than they are for men, and 9 out of 10 did not know the symptoms vary according to gender. 
Like cardiovascular research, efforts to understand and treat osteoporosis are critically important. More than 28 million Americans, 80 percent of whom are women, suffer from or are at-risk for osteoporosis. Half of all women age 50 or over will suffer a bone fracture due to osteoporosis. Research into the causes, treatment and prevention of osteoporosis is a smart public health investment. 
An equally strong case can be made for the other NIH research initiatives extended by this bill. Whether the focus is breast cancer, a disease which takes the lives of 44,000 women each year, or ovarian cancer, which currently has a tragically low survival rate, the research priorities identified for inclusion in this bill represent some of the most important initiatives of any kind that we, as a nation, can undertake. 
The bill also extends key women's health initiatives at the Centers for Disease Control: One that I believe is particularly important is the CDC National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection program. Over 1.5 million screening tests have been provided by the program, which began its seventh year in 1998. As a result, more than 23,000 women were able to fight back against an otherwise silent killer. The CDC early detection program is now operational in all 50 states. More than 100 women are screened in my own state each month. 
Another very important program reauthorized by this bill is CDC's Community Programs on Domestic Violence initiative. 
Domestic violence is a threat to women, to children and to the family unit. It is shockingly prevalent and tragically under-reported. Studies indicate that one-quarter of all women in the United States experience domestic violence at some point in their life, and that 92 percent of them do not discuss these incidents with their physician. We need to recognize the problem for what it is--a crime, a killer, and a public health threat--and fight it with every tool we have at our disposal. Through the CDC program, non-profit organizations apply for resources to combat domestic violence in communities throughout the country. Local efforts to increase public awareness, dispel the myth that domestic violence is a private family matter, and help women and children who fall victim can, case-by-case, make a tremendous difference in the lives of millions of present and potential victims. 
This bill continues the effort to bridge the gender gap in the quality of research, data, and care. It asserts the fact that women have unique health care needs and addresses areas of particular importance to women's health. It also affirms the value of health research generally and recognizes the important role research plays in both improving health outcomes and decreasing health costs for many diseases. I am proud to be part of this effort.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing on behalf of my colleagues, Senators Murray, Moseley-Braun, Kennedy, Dodd, Boxer, Breaux, Robb, Levin, Lautenberg, Glenn, Kerry, Feinstein, Reid, Reed, Bryan and myself, legislation that puts the spotlight directly on our efforts to strengthen and modernize our nation's public schools. 
We recognize that a strong public education system is the key to America's future. Our economic prosperity, our position as a world leader, our system of law, and our very democracy require that all of our children have access to the best possible education. 
We have heard a lot over the last 20 years about the things that are wrong with education in this country, and there's no question that we need to do some things better. We just learned the other day, for example, that our 12th graders are behind the rest of the world in math and science achievement. That is unacceptable and must be corrected. But there are signs that we have been able to make some progress. Our fourth-graders are well above the average in mathematics and near the top in science. And there are innovative programs springing up around the country that are taking advantage of federal funds to make remarkable changes in the way public schools are run. The City of Chicago, for example, has taken dramatic steps including ending social promotions, raising their standards, and providing extra help to make sure that children can achieve those standards. Parents and community members are more involved , and, while it's too early to see results in terms of test scores, there are dramatic improvements in attendance. Those who are involved are amazed at their progress. 
Despite many local improvements, our schools still face many challenges. Student enrollments are at record high levels and are expected to increase over the next decade. This growth, combined with aging buildings and the demand of technology, is straining many school facilities. Growing enrollments and teacher retirements also mean that more than 2 million new teachers will be needed over the next decade. The quality of those teachers will have a significant impact on student achievement levels. Recent advancements require better integration of technology in our public schools and better training for instructors in using technology effectively in the classroom. While many schools have implemented reforms and student performance is improving in some communities, too many children, particularly those from low-income families, are still not learning up to their potential. 
The legislation we are introducing today--the RESULTS Act--will addresses these issues in 5 ways:

Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Majority Leader for raising this important issue and am pleased to join him as a co-sponsor of the Government Secrecy Act. I look forward to working with him, the other co-sponsors of the bill, and the relevant committees to move this legislation early in this session. Although some modifications to this legislation may be necessary, I think we can all agree that a democratic government depends on an informed public. This legislation will greatly improve access to government information. By reducing the number of secrets, this legislation will enhance the public's access while at the same time enabling the government to better protect information which is truly sensitive. 
As the Majority Leader mentioned, for the past five decades, 
the secrecy system has been governed by a series of six Executive Orders, none of which has created a stable system that protects only that information deemed vital to the national security of the United States.

Mr. DASCHLE. In deciding that we needed to design a better, more rational classification system, I was moved by the fact that under the current system we are classifying an enormous amount of information each and every year. For example, in 1996 alone, the Federal Government created 386,562 Top Secret, 3,467,856 Secret, and 1,830,044 Confidential items: a total of 5,789,625 classification actions.

Mr. DASCHLE. In addition to costing the taxpayer billions annually, this excessive government secrecy leads to a host of other problems. Secrecy hampers the exchange of information within the government, leads to public mistrust, and makes leaking classified information the norm. 
I think it would be useful at this point to note that this legislation will not require the disclosure of a single document or fact deemed vital to our national security. Instead, this legislation will prevent the government from stamping `Classified' on information that is not sensitive. 
The Clinton administration has made significant reforms to open government information. For example, last month, Secretary of Energy Federico Pena announced that he would seek to end the practice that considered all atomic weapons information as `born classified' and instead would only classify `where there is a compelling national security interest'. The Department of Energy is to be commended for its efforts in recent years to make available information 
concerning nuclear tests conducted in this country and their effects on human health and the environment. This is a useful step. However, as the statistics I cited above for 1996 make clear, there is still much more to be done.

Mr. DASCHLE. Greater Congressional oversight of classification policy is long overdue. For too long, classification and declassification policy have been both developed and implemented by bureaucrats, often anonymously. Consideration of the Government Secrecy Act, S.712, will promote an open discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of secrecy, a discussion which is not limited to the views of those who are charged with implementing classification policy.

Mr. DASCHLE. One of the most striking aspects of the Commission report is the lack of Congressional involvement in the secrecy system. Apart from the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Atomic Energy Act, which only applies to atomic secrets, there are few statutes dealing with these issues. If secrecy is a form of regulation, then this legislation will serve a similar purpose to the Administrative Procedure Act for the secrecy system. 
And there has been little Congressional oversight. I believe the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy, which Senator Moynihan chaired, is only the second statutory examination of the secrecy system.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Government Secrecy Commission has learned from history and issued much more prudent proposals. Some individuals have raised constitutional concerns regarding this legislation, but the Government Secrecy Act (S. 712) respects the President's constitutional prerogatives by maintaining the authority of the President to establish categories of classified information and procedures for classifying information. The precedent for Congressional action has already been established by the Atomic Energy Act, the Espionage Act, and the National Security Act.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, yesterday, I came to the floor to discuss the agreement that has been achieved between the UN and Iraq with regard to access to suspect sites in Iraq. At that time, I indicated that clarifications over the course of the last 48 hours had increased our confidence about the degree to which we think the agreement can be successful. 
I want to talk a bit more about that agreement now, given the comments just made this morning by UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler. His statement helps clarify even further the degree to which the agreement may be as successful as we had hoped it would. 
As I stated yesterday, what we are seeking could not be more clear. We are simply seeking unconditional, unfettered access to all suspect sites, as called for in prior Security Council resolutions. We also noted yesterday that diplomacy, backed by the threat to use overwhelming force, has brought us closer to that goal. 
The comments made over the last 24 hours by UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler are of immense help in clarifying the important details of the agreement, some of which we have not had access to until now. 
As the process of clarification continues, there is a growing sense of just what we have achieved here. The perspective of UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler, whose track record of toughness with Iraq is legendary, is especially valuable. 
I want to take just a moment to highlight some portions of Chairman Butler's take on UNSCOM's role in the agreement.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in his statement earlier today, he made a number of comments, and I want to describe them at this point. His first comment on the overall agreement says that the agreement: 
. . . gave expression to a fundamental commitment that is set forth in the resolutions of the Security Council, mainly that UNSCOM must have immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access to all sites in Iraq for the purpose of carrying out its mandate. The memorandum of understanding at high political level reaffirms and reiterates that commitment. 
In other words, what Chairman Butler has said is that his highest priority is to assure that we have this unrestricted, unfettered access to all sites in Iraq. Having now examined the details of the memorandum of understanding incorporated within the agreement, Chairman Butler concludes that the commitment is intact. With regard to the UNSCOM role in the context of the agreement, he said: 
I view it [the agreement] as strengthening UNSCOM in the conduct of its work in Iraq. 
With regard to UNSCOM's access to presidential sites, he noted: 
The arrangements that are made for that access, set forth principally in paragraph 4 of the memorandum of understanding, have been the subject of some misunderstanding and, regrettably, some misrepresentation. I want to make clear that those arrangements are entirely satisfactory to me and the organization that I lead. 
With regard to the role of diplomats in the inspection effort, Chairman Butler said the following: 
With the establishment of a special inspection group within UNSCOM, to be led by a chief inspector of UNSCOM, to which diplomatic observers will be added to insure concerns that Iraq has expressed and the council has acknowledged with respect to the particular dignity of those sites, we will be able to do our work. 
Putting it in simple language, Chairman Butler has noted that adding a diplomatic contingent to the inspection effort will not hinder UNSCOM in fulfilling its mission. 
With regard to the concern about unclear lines of authority as UNSCOM performs its duties, he said the following: 
These lines of authority and reporting are clear, and I find them entirely satisfactory. Going beyond that, quite frankly, I find it a positive additional resource which will now be put at our disposal to enable us to do the work in those designated sites within Iraq. 
Chairman Butler also adds a note of caution regarding implementation of this agreement, as have the President, the Secretaries of State and Defense, and many Members of Congress: that the proof will be in the testing. 
If Iraq implements the agreement, weapons inspectors will, for the first time, have unrestricted, unconditional access to all suspect sites in Iraq, with no limits on the numbers of visits or deadlines to complete their work. If Iraq does not cooperate and we need to take action, we are in a stronger position internationally than ever. Again, if Iraq fails to comply, our response will be swift, strong and certain. 
Chairman Butler concludes that this is a strong agreement. I share his view. This agreement allows us to complete our work. This agreement, backed up by the use or the threat of force, would allow us the access that we did not have before. 
Mr. President, I don't know how much clearer one can say it than that. Chairman Butler has concluded that this agreement does the job--as long as the Iraqis comply. Now, the question is, will Saddam Hussein be willing to live by his word? Will he provide the access he committed to in this MOU? If not, it's back to business, it's the use of force, it's a swift response militarily and by whatever other means may be necessary. 
So, Mr. President, I think we need to get on with it. Let's take the necessary steps to get the inspection teams to Iraq and inspect these sites. Let's clarify, to whatever extent may be required, whether these sites contain material that needs to be destroyed. Let us continue the overall assessment of compliance on the part of Iraq. We are in a position to do that now. This agreement allows us to pursue our work. I applaud those responsible and will continue to monitor this situation with every expectation that, one way or the other, we will get the job done. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Let me thank the majority leader for his efforts in scheduling this legislation. 
As I think everyone knows, this has been a matter of great priority for many of us. We are very pleased that now we are able to move ahead with the debate and consideration of this important legislation. 
We do not want to miss the construction cycle, and, certainly, by passing the legislation at an early date, we ought to be in a position to send a clear indication as to what our intentions are with regard to highway funding for the foreseeable future in time to meet the construction season. 
We hope that our House colleagues will also be sensitized to the importance of moving this legislation ahead quickly. 
Obviously, this legislation will go to conference. That will take some time. Even if we can expeditiously consider it now, it will be some time before we are prepared to send it over to the President. The sooner we can do that the better. 
It is for that reason that I hope we can avoid debate on extraneous amendments and legislation that may not be directly germane to the issues that fall within the consideration of this title and of this bill. It is for that reason that it is not our intention to offer campaign reform legislation to this bill or other forms of legislation that might be of high priority to the Democratic caucus. 
I will say, with regard to campaign reform legislation, there is no doubt at some point that it will be our intention to revisit the question, revisit the issue, but not on this bill, not at this time. Our hope now is that we can expeditiously consider it so we can get the legislation passed in time to assist States in planning for resources and the allegation of the available funding that will be made as a result of the completion of this legislation. 
So, I thank again the leader and all colleagues involved for bringing us to this point. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to raise one of the most critical issues facing this nation today, nuclear weapons security, and to call the Senate's attention to one of the most intelligent and courageous people involved in the debate surrounding this issue, General Lee Butler. 
At a National Press Club appearance earlier this month, General Butler delivered an eloquent address entitled, `The Risks Of Nuclear Deterrence: From Superpowers To Rogue Leaders.' His major conclusion was that, `. . . as a nation we have no greater responsibility than to bring the nuclear era to a close. Our present policies, plans, and postures governing nuclear weapons make us prisoners still to an age of intolerable danger.' 
For those unfamiliar with General Butler, let me provide some background on this distinguished American that should add some context to his remarks. After graduating from the Air Force Academy, General Butler spent the next 33 years advancing through the ranks of the U.S. Air Force. 
In 1991, he was promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Strategic Air Command and, shortly thereafter, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Strategic Command. In this last post, General Butler was responsible for the overall U.S. strategy for deterring a nuclear war and, if deterrence fails, fighting such a war. 
It is safe to say that very few Americans know as much as General Butler when it comes to nuclear weapons and their role in our national security posture--from the concrete, such as the physics of these weapons, to the more abstract, such as deterrence theory. When General Butler speaks about nuclear deterrence, people should listen. 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>105-daschle-sd-2-19980225</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DASCHLE. General Butler summarizes his experience in the following terms: 
I came to a set of deeply unsettling judgments. That from the earliest days of the nuclear era, the risks and consequences of nuclear war have never been properly weighed by those who brandished it. That the stakes of nuclear war engage not just the survival of the antagonists, but the fate of mankind. That the likely consequences of nuclear war have no politically, militarily, or morally acceptable justification. And therefore, that the threat to use nuclear weapons is indefensible. 
General Butler goes on to note that for much of the Cold War period up to the present, America's massive nuclear arsenal was justified and sustained on the basis of a single concept: deterrence. However, his experience and analysis led him to the inherent flaw in the concept of deterrence. 
Deterrence failed completely as a guide in setting rational limits on the size and composition of military forces. To the contrary, its appetite was voracious, its capacity to justify new weapons and larger stocks unrestrained. Deterrence carried the seed . . . that spurred an insatiable arms race. 
Mr. President, the consequences of this paradox remain with us today--despite the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War. Consider where the world is with respect to nuclear weapons as we approach the end of the 20th century--over 50 years since man developed the first nuclear device. 
First, the United States and Russia together still field nearly 15,000 strategic nuclear weapons--each with a destructive power tens or hundreds of times greater than the nuclear devices that brought World War II to a close. The closest rival, friend or foe, has less than 500 strategic weapons. 
Second, the United States and Russia each still deploy large numbers of tactical nuclear weapons. According to unclassified sources, the United States has about 500 to 1,000 operational tactical nuclear weapons, and the Russians have about 4,000. 
Third, both the United States and Russia continue to operate large numbers of their strategic weapons, roughly 5,000 weapons between them, on a high level of alert, ready to be launched at a moment's notice. As noted by Senator Sam Nunn and Dr. Bruce Blair, `while [this] practice may have been necessary during the Cold War, today it constitutes a dangerous anachronism.' 
Fourth, the United States and Russia continue to adhere to nuclear plans that permit the first use of nuclear weapons and allow for the launch of weapons after receiving warning of attack but before incoming warheads detonate. 
Mr. President, this is truly a very troubling state of affairs, made all the more so by the fact that the Cold War has dissipated and our major adversary during this period, the Soviet Union, has long since ceased to exist. General Butler's conclusion is that the United States and the world should aspire to the abolition of all nuclear weapons. 
General Butler makes a very compelling case for this lofty yet pragmatic goal. And, as General Butler will be the first to note, it is not one that can be quickly or easily achieved. It will essentially require putting the nuclear genie back in the bottle and being able to verify that no country tries to let it out. 
This is a very difficult task to say the least, and one that ultimately may not be achievable. But that is no reason not to try. 
There is an old saying that, if you shoot for the stars and miss, you still could hit the moon. If in shooting for the ultimate objective of nuclear elimination we take lesser steps that enhance our security, then the journey will have been worthwhile. 
At his National Press Club speech, General Butler released a letter signed by 117 leaders from 46 countries that calls for the immediate removal of nuclear weapons from alert status, an end to nuclear testing, the beginning of discussions on deeper reductions in the U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals, and the development of a plan for eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons. Among the signatories were Mikhail Gorbachev, President Carter and Helmut Schmidt. 
In this regard, there are 3 initiatives the United States could take immediately to begin this journey to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons: dealerting a portion of U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear weapons, ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and pushing for much deeper reductions in nuclear weapons than currently contemplated in START II. 
Each of these steps make sense in isolation. Together, they will lead to a safer world, and one much closer to that envisioned in the poignant remarks delivered by General Butler.

The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requires that all DME suppliers purchase a surety to qualify for a supplier number. The minimum amount for the bond is $50,000. The Health Care Financing Administration has estimated that these bonds will cost about $788 per year for each supplier. Many South Dakota pharmacists do not take in sufficient revenue from Medicare DME sales to support the purchase of a bond. Therefore, the surety bond requirement in the Balanced Budget Act could severely compromise the availability of services for Medicare patients in rural areas. 
The surety bond requirement was established as an important way to combat Medicare fraud and abuse. I remain in strong support of efforts to combat fraud and abuse, because they are crucial to protecting and strengthening the Medicare program. Because the ultimate aim of fraud and abuse measures is to improve Medicare, they should be applied in ways that are consistent with the goal of quality health care and should not jeopardize access to necessary services and supplies. 
This legislation retains the surety bond requirement for many DME suppliers, but it exempts licensed pharmacists. This policy is not only logical in terms of fairness to these pharmacists; it is the right thing to do for the beneficiaries who depend on their services. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment to title XVIII of the Social Security Act. It will lift an unreasonable burden from small pharmacists without jeopardizing fraud and abuse prevention efforts, and it will enable pharmacists to continue to provide quality health care services in their local communities.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to address the evolving situation relating to Iraq and talk briefly about the circumstances surrounding the agreement reached between Secretary General Annan and Iraq as we know them now. I am concerned about some of the comments made in the media and on the floor about the situation in Iraq. I think it is important to review the situation as the President, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, National Security Adviser and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have laid out in the last 24 hours. 
First, with respect to what we are seeking, from the outset of this crisis the fundamental goal of the United States has been very simple. The goal has simply been to assure that UNSCOM has unconditional and unfettered access to all suspect sites as called for in the U.N. Security Council resolutions. Period; that's it. All we needed was simply an opportunity to visit sites that we think are suspect. 
We were denied that, which triggered this whole affair, beginning, as everyone now knows, several months ago. Diplomacy, backed by the threat to use overwhelming force if required, has moved us forward and closer to achieving that goal. There can be no doubt that the presence of a military force of the magnitude that is currently in the gulf had everything to do with the fact that we now have an agreement. General Secretary Annan has said that. Others have noted it. There is no question that the combination of diplomacy and military force gave us the opportunity to bring about this agreement over the last 72 hours. 
Iraq precipitated this crisis, as we all know, by trying to avoid its obligations under the Security Council resolutions. It attempted to dictate to the international community where UNSCOM could hold inspections, the manner in which they could be conducted, and the length of time that they would continue. Iraq's effort has failed. We were clear about what we were seeking: Unfettered access. Iraq objected. Iraq obfuscated. Iraq clearly was at fault in not allowing access to the sites in question. Diplomacy was used, force backed up that diplomacy, and the results are now in hand. 
Let's look at what we have achieved with this agreement. The government of Iraq has made a written commitment to provide immediate, unrestricted, unconditional access for the UNSCOM inspectors to all suspected sites. So, regardless of the rhetoric, regardless of whether it was framed in exactly the way we might have it framed, what matters is the bottom line. What matters is what is now to be the order. And the order is very clear. The order is to provide immediate, unrestricted, unconditional access for inspectors to all suspected sites. If fully implemented, this commitment will allow UNSCOM to fulfill its mission: First, to find and destroy all of Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons; second, to find and destroy the missiles that could deliver these weapons; and, third, to institute a system for long-term monitoring to make sure Iraq doesn't do it again. 
This commitment applies to all sites anywhere in the country, including eight so-called `Presidential Sites' that have now been precisely delineated, as well as the so-called sensitive sites that until now Iraq has tried to claim were off limits to UNSCOM. Any and all of these sites are subject to repeat visits. There are no deadlines to complete the work. In short, for the first time Iraq has committed explicitly to open every site throughout the country to weapons inspectors. Again, that has been our bottom line. That will continue to be our bottom line. And we now have it in writing that Iraq will agree. 
For the eight `Presidential Sites', the agreement allows diplomats to accompany the UNSCOM inspectors, and that is acceptable if the inspectors are free to conduct rigorous and professional inspections. All other sites will be open to inspection under the existing UNSCOM procedures. The Secretary General has assured us that UNSCOM Chairman Butler remains in 
charge of UNSCOM and all weapons inspections. He has also made that abundantly clear to the Iraqis themselves. 
Questions have been raised about the Memorandum Of Understanding between Annan and Iraq. There are issues that still need clarification and we want to clarify them, notably with respect to the inspection procedures for the eight `Presidential Sites'. The United States has made clear that we expect all aspects of this agreement to reinforce the fundamental requirement that the investigators be permitted to carry out their inspections in a rigorous and professional manner. 
We have received important assurances from the Secretary General that clarify aspects of the MOU, notably with regard to the eight `Presidential Sites'. UNSCOM and Chairman Butler will preserve their independence. The special team for the `Presidential Sites' will be part of UNSCOM. The team leader will be an UNSCOM Commissioner who is an expert in Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, chosen by the Secretary General and UNSCOM Chairman Butler. The special team leader will report to Chairman Butler. The diplomats will be observers only, with UNSCOM retaining operational control. Procedures for these inspections will be developed by UNSCOM and the Secretary General, not by Iraq. And, as has been the case since 1991, Chairman Butler will continue to report to the Security Council through the Secretary General. 
So, the more clarification we get, the better the agreement looks, the clearer the understanding we have about the success of this effort. The bottom line is that we have access in Iraq that we didn't have last week at this time. 
So what is next? We support a U.N. Security Council resolution that will make it clear to Iraq that any violation of its commitments would have the most serious consequences. That would be a useful but not necessary signal from the international community. We also need to test and verify Saddam's intent. In the days and weeks ahead, UNSCOM must robustly test and verify this commitment. It is one thing to have it in language. It is one thing rhetorically to agree. It's another thing to allow it to occur. Failure to allow UNSCOM to get on with its job would have serious consequences. The United States will keep its military forces in the gulf at a high state of preparedness while we see if Iraq lives up to its commitment that it has signed. 
The United States remains resolved to secure, by whatever means necessary, Iraq's full compliance with its commitment to destroy its weapons of mass destruction. So again, it will be diplomacy backed up by force. So long as diplomacy works, force will not be necessary. At the very moment diplomacy appears not to be working, force will be employed. So, let there be no mistake. This is not a question of breathing room. This is not a question of simply delaying and somehow, then, obviating the need for the use of force should it be required. It will be there. 
Iraq's commitments are an important step forward, but only if matched by its compliance. They have made an important step forward in word. Now they must step forward in deed. As the President has said, `the proof is in the testing.' 
This agreement can be a win-win. Either Iraq implements the agreement or it does not. If it does, the weapons inspectors will for the first time have unrestricted, unconditional access to all suspect sites in Iraq with no limits on the numbers of visits or deadlines to complete their work. If Iraq does not cooperate and we need to take action, we are in a stronger position internationally than ever. After two crises provoked by Iraq in 4 months, the international community has certainly lost its patience and will not stomach another bout of Iraqi defiance. And there will be no doubt in anyone's mind about who will be responsible for those consequences. 
This agreement is backed up by an immediate test that Saddam Hussein will either clearly pass or clearly fail. Our response will be swift. It will be strong. It will be certain. 
So, Mr. President, we have made great progress on paper over the last 72 hours. Again, I give credit to the United Nations 
Secretary General Annan, to the administration, to all of those responsible for bringing us to this point. I respect the President's decision and believe it was the correct one, to keep our forces there, because, as we say, there is only one option for Saddam Hussein: Comply with his agreement. Allow access. Allow us the opportunity to complete our work. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, here we go again. I thought that we had an understanding about the opportunity that we would be presented to have a good debate. In fact, I am going to go back to the Record and check, but I am quite sure that there was some understanding that there would not be any need to fill trees and to prevent open and free debate, because we saw what happened the last time we tried this. It locked up the Senate for weeks on end with absolutely no result. 
I would ask my colleagues, what are you afraid of here? Why are our colleagues on the other side not willing to allow this body to work its will? Why is the majority party filibustering legislation that the majority of Senators supports? 
Mr. President, I am disappointed and frustrated. I am prepared to take this to whatever length is required to bring it to a successful resolution this week, next week, at some point in the future. We have a lot of work to do here, and I want to work with the majority leader to find a way to accomplish all that must be done. But I can't think of a better way to slow progress, to stop progress, to preclude us from getting our work done than to deny this body the opportunity to have a good debate and some votes on this important issue. 
I must say, it is, again, a reminder to the Democratic caucus that when we enter into these agreements, we better check the writing, we better check the specifics, we better ensure we have a clear understanding of what the agreement is. 
There was a colloquy just a moment ago about whether or not we could have an up-or-down vote on the Snowe amendment. Clearly, with this scenario, there is no way you can have an up-or-down vote on the Snowe amendment. This is a tree so loaded that the branches are breaking. And so I suppose I could dream someday of drafting a scenario that would allow us to get to the amendment of the Senator from Maine. It ain't going to happen. With the tree as filled as it is right now, there is no way there will be a vote on the Snowe amendment. 
I note, and the majority leader even noted, that there is maybe another option, another route, another bill, maybe, as the Senator from Arizona suggested, an appropriations bill. I suspect that this loaded tree will provide both sides with ample opportunity to offer amendments and bills to other amendments, and with a limited period of time, we all know what that means. But if those are the cards we are dealt, I am prepared to accept that as the circumstance and deal with it. 
It is really amazing to me that there are those in the Senate who profess to support a process by which we can accomplish all of our legislative goals, but then continue to put obstacles in the path of resolution to the objectives in reaching those goals. 
So, I am disappointed and, frankly, somewhat amazed that we have not learned our lessons of the past. But so be it, the tree is filled, the opportunities will be there, either this week, next week, the week after, but they will be there, just as they were last fall.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from North Dakota is absolutely correct. I think we can all go back and look through the Record and, again, as I say, we have to look at the meaning of each word in these agreements with perhaps greater skepticism. This idea of filling the tree is great short-term strategy. It has a horrible long-term effect, long-term effect on the comity of the of the Senate, long-term effect on getting legislation accomplished. 
So we are compelled, once again, to use the techniques and methods we have used in the past. It is very likely that we will be relegated to using them again in the future. 
The Senator is right, clearly we had an understanding that we would have an opportunity to debate issues, to offer amendments and ultimately to resolve this issue. We have been denied that as a result of the actions taken just now, and I deeply regret it.

Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Minnesota is absolutely right.

But we will certainly pursue this in other ways.

Mr. DASCHLE. There is no doubt about it. Again, Senator Lott, and I quote a comment he made to reporters that very day, said: `As far as I can tell at this point, amendments would certainly be in order, would be considered, they might be second-degreed and they certainly would be given a third degree.' 
There is no question that we had the clear understanding that there would be an opportunity to have a good debate, offer amendments, have them voted upon and ultimately dispose of this issue. 
So I am really disappointed we have not been able to reach that point in this debate to date, and this, in my view, is not what we had agreed to last fall.
