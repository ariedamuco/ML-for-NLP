Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, one year ago this body adopted, by a vote of 95 to 3, legislation increasing our nation's commitment to finding the cause and cure for a long overlooked, but truly devastating disorder: Parkinson's disease. I was proud to cosponsor and vote for the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Disease Research Act, signed into law as part of the Fiscal 1998 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. The Udall Act authorized $100 million in research focused on Parkinson's disease to be funded through the National Institutes of Health in fiscal year 1998, 1999 and beyond. 
The passage of the Udall Act was a great accomplishment, particularly for the hundreds and thousands of victims, and their families and friends, who worked so diligently to bring this issue to the Congress and make us aware of the need for additional Parkinson's research funding. I would also like to commend the Senior Senator from Pennsylvania, one of the true champions of medical research, for his strong support of the Udall Act and Parkinson's research.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am concerned that the National Institutes of Health has implemented neither the letter nor the spirit of the Udall Act, and that funding for Parkinson's-focused research has not increased in a fashion consistent with Congressional intent. An independent analysis, conducted by Parkinson's researchers at institutions all around the country, of the grants NIH defined as its Parkinson's research portfolio for fiscal year 1997 indicates that a majority of the grants are in fact not focused on Parkinson's disease. Only 34 percent of the funding NIH claims is Parkinson's research is actually Parkinson's-focused research, as required by the Udall Act. As troubling as that is, the study also found that 38 percent of the funding has no relation whatsoever to finding a cause or cure for this terrible affliction. 
It is my understanding from published NIH budgetary documents that $106 million is expected to be allocated to Parkinson's research in fiscal year 1999. My concern is that without more direction from Congress, the NIH will undermine the intent of the Udall Act by continuing to classify, as part of its Parkinson's portfolio, research that is not focused on Parkinson's disease and, in doing so, will allow meritorious and much-needed Parkinson's research projects to go unfunded. I propose that a hearing be held early in 1999 to address and clarify these matters.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that corruption and fraud are major problems in the procurement of goods and services funded by multi-lateral lending programs. Since these programs are paid for by U.S. taxpayers, the Senate Appropriations Committee identified potential mechanisms in its report accompanying the fiscal year 1999 Foreign Operation Appropriations bill to ensure that procurement processes by borrowing or recipient nations are transparent, non-biased and open. 
One of the mechanisms identified by the committee is independent third party procurement monitoring. An independent third party procurement monitor provides an independent review and assessment of government procurement projects by auditing and certifying that the procurement process is non-biased, open, transparent and fair. Importantly, independent third party monitoring provides technical assistance and training in country to improve the quality of the procurement process, thereby making the procurement process more effective. The program also verifies that the contractual, technical, economic and financial obligations of the supplier are fully discharged. 
I encourage the Administration to support the use of programs such as independent third-party procurement monitoring which have proven their value in reducing costs by deterring corruption and fraud, ensuring the quality of the goods and services provided, stimulating competition and free trade, as well as enabling U.S. business to compete more successfully.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the statements made by the Senator from Missouri are, I'm sad to say, quite true. Most recent official figures from 29 state health departments indicate that close to 800 agencies have closed in those states. This number represents parent agencies; other data from the states indicate that the number of agencies and branches that have closed is much higher. We also know that there are many more agencies on the brink of closing if some relief from IPS is not provided soon. If the current rate of closures continues, we could easily see a loss of 2,000 more home health agencies by October 1, 1999. 
Agency closing are resulting in significant beneficiary care access problems. In fact, a recent GAO study found that two-thirds of discharge planners and more than a third of the aging organizations surveyed reported having had difficulty obtaining home health care for Medicare patients in the last year, especially those who need multiple weekly visits over an extended period of time. Matters will only get worse as agencies become more and more limited in their ability to provide needed services. In fact, in testimony before the Ways and Means Committee in August, Ms. Gail Wilensky, former head of the Health Care Financing Administration, warned that, if the Congress waits for proof that a crisis is occurring in home care before it acts, it will be too late. She also indicated that more money was taken out of home care than the Congress had expected when IPS was designed and then implemented by HCFA.

Mr. Cochran. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. In addition to HCFA imposing an untested payment system with the home health IPS, the scoring mechanism used by CBO to estimate savings resulting from IPS included a 2/3 behavioral offset. What this means is that CBO presumed that for every $3 saved under IPS, agencies would find some way, through expanding the number of beneficiaries they serve, to make up $2 of every $3 lost under IPS. What has become clear, as was indicated by the Senator from Missouri, CBO's behavioral assumptions about agencies increasing the number of beneficiaries served have not come to pass. Instead, we are seeing a near dismantling of the home care program as the result of IPS. 
We have already seen the devastating effects of the interim payment system in my state of Mississippi. While I applaud the Senate for its efforts to reform the interim payment system, we must commit ourselves to continuing this work as soon as the Senate reconvenes. I am particularly concerned that we must address the problems that will be created by the automatic 15% reduction in payment limits which we have agreed to delay one year. It took this distinguished body that long to reach the temporary solutions which we have before us today and we cannot put off deliberations on this additional cut until the last moment. Prudence dictates that we find ways to insure that any additional cuts in reimbursement not adversely affect efficient providers nor burden patients in their access to necessary home care services.

Mr. Cochran. Mr. President, I too am very concerned about the delay in the development and implementation of a PPS system. It is the only clear solution to deal with those complex patients who are having increasing difficulty in gaining access to home care services. If we cannot have PPS soon, we must find a way to better reimburse agencies which care for these high cost patients. Home health agencies in Mississippi report to me that this is one of the most important problems that must be addressed. At the same time, putting together a PPS program will do no good if we destroy the foundation of our home health services delivery system. As the result of IPS, I am told that home health agencies across the country will find some time in the middle of next year that they have likely been over paid by the Medicare program even though they delivered appropriate services to patients at a reasonable cost. This Congress must find a way to deal with that pending crisis in order to protect those home health agencies that met patient's needs yet still incurred costs beyond the arbitrary limits which were developed under IPS.

 Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I bring to the Senate's attention that October 16 is World Food Day. As the largest international food aid organization in the world, the United Nations World Food Program feeds 52.9 million people in 84 countries and deserves special recognition. 
Millions of people have survived civil unrest, famine and other disasters because of a project called Food-for-Life which makes emergency operations the primary focus of the World Food Program. Other projects include Food-for-Work which uses food as a tool to encourage people to work within their communities in order to become self reliant and Food-for-Growth which distributes food aid at schools, clinics and hospitals to help children and pregnant women. 
I am proud to say that Judy Lewis, a native of Scott County, Mississippi, and past Director of Organization of my 1978 campaign staff, has been named the World Food Program's Country Director for Ethiopia. Since 1992, Ms. Lewis has many times endured dangerous conditions to participate first-hand in helping to bring food to starving people whose lives were threatened by natural disasters or armed conflicts. She has played a key role in many of the World Food Program's biggest emergency and development projects around the world in places like Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Somalia. As Country Director for Ethiopia, Ms. Lewis will be managing a $30 million emergency and development operation aiming to help over 800,000 people, focusing on refugees, famine relief and urban poverty. 
I commend Ms. Lewis for her strength and diligence. And I congratulate the World Food Program for all of its good work.

 Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to learn that the Mississippi Hotel and Motel Association will honor my good friend, Douglas Fontaine, on October 23, 1998, by establishing a scholarship in his name. The scholarship will provide education assistance to future entrepreneurs in the hospitality industry. 
Doug literally grew up in the hotel business watching both his parents and grandparents manage the historic `Allison's Wells Spa' in Way, MS. After returning from a tour of duty in Germany where he managed a R & R hotel, he took his turn managing Allison's Wells. Doug eventually moved to Pascagoula, MS, where he has owned and operated the La Font Inn for over 35 years. 
As the only Mississippian to have been President and Chairman of the Board of the American Hotel and Motel Association, his program, `Quest for Quality' has been his lasting legacy for hotels around the United States, Europe and the Caribbean. 
Doug has been President of such organizations as the Jackson County Heart Fund, Rotary Club, the Pas-Point Navy League, United Way of Jackson County, the Mississippi Hotel and Motel Association, the Gulf Coast Hotel and Motel Association, the Gulf Coast Economic Development Council, the Jackson County Economic Development Council, and the Jackson County Chamber of Commerce. 
Doug was also on the committee that worked to bring Naval Station Pascagoula to Mississippi, and he has chaired the committee to `Save the Homeport' for many years. 
Currently, Doug serves as a lifetime Director of the American Hotel and Motel Association and as a member of the National Restaurant Association. He also serves on the Board of Director's of the Hancock Bank, a position he has held for over 27 years. 
We are very proud of the leadership and example of Doug Fontaine. Our Nation is strong because of people like him. I congratulate him, his wife Lou, and the Mississippi Hotel and Motel Association for making this tribute a lasting legacy that will offer opportunities to younger members of this industry.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we begin consideration again today of the Agriculture Appropriations Conference Report. Yesterday we were on that report for 3 1/2 hours and had a full discussion of views on the question of whether or not the conference report should be adopted. I was pleased to see this morning an assessment of the situation by the Washington Post, in an editorial entitled, `The Appropriations Game.' I read excerpts from that editorial: 
In the agricultural bill, an election-year bidding war has broken out between the parties over aid to distressed farmers. This is one from which the president should back away . . . The Democrats want not just to give a larger amount but to do so in such a way as to repudiate the last farm bill . . . The administration earlier in the year rightly resisted the position it has now adopted; it should revert. 
That is the end of the quotation from the Washington Post editorial. I think it appropriately points out the difficulty we face in confronting a threat from the President to veto this conference report. It is not just about money. 
The President is suggesting, through his Secretary of Agriculture and through the Democratic leadership, that this conference report is unacceptable, not because it doesn't appropriate enough money, but because it doesn't change the policy that was agreed upon in the 1996 farm bill and signed by this President. It changes a fundamental policy of setting Government loan rates and using them to encourage the planning of some five or more specific commodities. 
To get away from that old way of Government support, the Congress and the President, the administration, worked together to develop an alternative, a farm policy that would be driven by the dictates of the market, the demands of the market, the signals that the market would send to producers to indicate what prices might likely be during a crop year, and farmers themselves would make the choice as to what they would plant. 
Some call this Freedom to Farm--freedom to plant what you want to rather than what the Government dictates you have to plant in order to be eligible for Government support. To make this a transition where the Government wasn't going to just say, `OK, everybody, you're on your own, farmers are on their own,' there would be a series, over 5 years, of transition payments made. 
Interestingly enough, as pointed out by the distinguished Senator from Kansas, Senator Roberts, yesterday during the debate, this year's transition payments are going to be higher. It was assumed by the writers of that policy, the legislative committees, that at first farmers would really need to have higher payments. They were very prescient figuring this out and including that provision in the farm bill. 
What we have suggested in our disaster assistance plan is, not to change the policy, but to provide bonus payments under the market transition formulas to increase the amount that all producers who are eligible for these payments would receive to help deal with the income losses that are occurring because of lost markets in Asia and elsewhere during this global economic crisis. 
Then there are those who have sustained weather-related disasters in certain areas, which has meant lost crops, not just lost income, not just diminished yields, which the increased market transition payments will help deal with. But, for those who have suffered crop losses, no loan rate is going to help them. There is nothing to put under the loan. 
The Washington Post points out, correctly, that we are not just in a bidding war on this bill--we are out of sorts because the Democrats keep advertising that their plan is worth $7 billion plus, and the Republicans only $4 billion; and therefore, the Democrats have a preferable plan and one that would provide more benefits--but the fact is, you change the policy instead of providing direct disaster assistance and you are not necessarily delivering money to those people who need the disaster benefits. 
The $4.2 billion plan is a direct assistance plan to those who qualify because they have suffered losses, plus the additional amount that is included in the transition bonuses. 
We continue to debate the issue. I am hopeful the Senate will approve the conference report. We have voted twice in the Senate, at the Democrats' insistence, on lifting the loan caps under the 1996 farm bill, and that has been rejected each time. We have voted twice on it, and twice it has been rejected. Now the administration is saying if you don't reconsider those two decisions, put that or something similar in the farm bill, in the disaster program, then the President will veto the bill. 
This is a $59.9 billion bill--$59.9 billion. We are talking about a very small part, a disagreement on a matter of policy where the Democrats are trying to get the Congress to be required by this President to repudiate a part of the 1996 farm bill so some Senators, I suppose, can go home and say, `I told you so; we had a better bill,' even though it has been pointed out clearly that under the old farm bill, under the old policy that they are trying to reinstate pro tanto--a good law school phrase--they would be getting less money. 
Under the Freedom to Farm bill, all farmers are getting more money from the Government as transition payments than they would have been eligible to receive under the 1996 farm bill which they want to exhume, resurrect, breathe life into, and put back on the books. That is not a very impressive proposal. That is not a very attractive proposal, and this Senate ought to reject it. 
I hope there will be votes enough to override the President's veto. It has been done before on an agriculture appropriations bill. It was a long time ago. But you usually don't see a President vetoing an agriculture appropriations bill. I hope somebody will get around to pointing out what all is in this bill for production agriculture, for the women, infants, and children feeding program, for food stamps for people who are unable to provide for their own nutrition needs, for school lunch and breakfast programs. 
I just came from a conference with the House on a reauthorization bill for child nutrition programs. We have some very important needs that are met in this legislation. Close to 65 percent of the funding in this appropriations bill that we are approving today goes to help people provide for their own nutrition needs. 
The President may call this a veto of a disaster assistance program, but that is one very small part of what he is saying no to. He is rejecting the hard work of many Members of this body and the other body as well in crafting a bill that meets the need for agriculture research, for rural water and sewer system loans and grants, for economic development initiatives in small towns and rural communities throughout the United States. 
If one looks at the amount of money that goes to support production agriculture in this legislation, it is minuscule compared to the total amount being spent on other programs. Many in agriculture have said that this bill should not even be named an agriculture appropriations bill--that there should be a more accurate way of describing the funding that is contained in the bill. It doesn't go to agriculture, or at least not most of it, very little of it, as a percentage of the total amount appropriated. But the President is willing to put at risk those programs that are funded in this bill to accommodate the interests of a few Senators who are suggesting that this is an unfair, an insensitive approach to providing disaster assistance to those who have suffered weather-related disasters and suffered because of a downturn in the world economic situation. 
We are confronting a serious crisis in American agriculture. This bill responds to that crisis by providing direct assistance to those who have been harmed and who are eligible for transition payments and weather-related disaster benefits. 
I suggest the Washington Post is right about this, and to repeat what they say this morning in this editorial, this is an election-year bidding war from which the President should back away.  
The Democrats want not just to give a larger amount but to do so in such a way as to repudiate the last farm bill. . . . The administration earlier in the year rightly resisted the position it has now adopted; it should revert. 
And so the observers at the Washington Post have figured this out. I hope that Senators will resist the entreaties being made to vote against this bill. This conference report ought to be adopted. It is a fair allocation of resources across the programs that are funded in the bill. 
I mentioned the Department of Agriculture programs that are funded in the bill that the President is willing to put at risk and to create the uncertainty and the anxieties among those who are expecting benefits at the beginning of this fiscal year. Right now we are operating under a continuing resolution. To veto the bill creates more delay, more uncertainty, more anxiety. It puts in jeopardy the very benefits we are trying to make available for people now. 
Farmers need help now. They are beginning to be skeptical of the whole process and promises that are made by the Federal Government. I would like to do something to correct that. I would like to make sure that Government is trusted again to do what it promises to do and what it says it is willing to do, and many of us have been trying to put together a package of benefits that makes sense, is supported by the facts, can be administered. 
We provide additional funds in this bill for the administration of the program. And it is going to cost more. We have tried to work with the administration to determine the amount needed so that there will not have to be extra burdens assumed at county offices throughout the country, where there will be an increase in the workload, where there will be more demands made on the administration, the farm service agency in particular. 
We have tried to cooperate with this administration. It was our recommendation at the conference that these funds be added to help the administration deal with it. And now they turn right around and say, `We're going to veto that bill because it is inconsistent with the proposal made by Senate Democrats on the Senate floor,' that was twice rejected by the Senate. `If you don't include the disaster bill the way they want it written or in that respect, then we're going to veto this entire bill.' 
This entire bill, Mr. President, provides $56 billion in funding for a wide range of programs, most of them nutrition assistance, as I mentioned. So I hope the people in the country will stop and think what this administration is about to do to you if you are depending upon and looking to the Federal Government for support in nutrition programs. If you have free and reduced lunch and breakfast programs in your schools, they are not going to be funded on time because this President says, `I'm vetoing this bill because it doesn't satisfy a few Senate Democrats.' 
That is not only bad politics, that is bad Government, and it ought to be repudiated by the Congress. If the President does insist on carrying out this promise or this threat to veto the bill, I hope the Senate will--if the House can--overturn the veto and not sustain the President's action. 
The Washington Post is right, the President ought to go back to the position he earlier had taken. The President signed the 1996 farm bill, and now he is suggesting that we need to go back and rewrite portions of it and that that will satisfy the needs of production agriculture, that that would be a better deal for farmers. The fact of the matter is, if we start going down that old road again, we will have an unworkable and unpredictable level of support from the Federal Government. 
Now farmers know what the Federal Government is going to provide in transition payments that are outlined in legislation over a 5-year period. Farmers can look at that. They can make judgments about what is best for their own farm operation, what the market conditions are, so that they can make decisions based on what is best for them at that farm in that crop year, given their own economic conditions as to what they will do. They will not lose benefits because they make a decision to change the crop they are planting. They would under the old law. If you do not plant that same crop that you are eligible for, you lose your eligibility for any assistance from the Government. 
And another thing. If you do not make a crop, you cannot put any crop in the loan. You cannot put an empty basket under the loan program that the Democrats are trying to resurrect. So if you would--like you have in southern Georgia--have crop losses, and you just plowed up a field, and you did not even try to harvest it because it was burned up, increasing the loan rate would not help you--not a bit. 
So my point is, the Democrats' plan is not all that it is cracked up to be. It is more an expression of frustration. And I sympathize with the frustration in many parts of the country. It is an effort to grasp at some straw in the wind and hold out the hope that this is going to make everything right. 
We are doing a very workmanlike job, in my view, of bringing together all of the different problems in agriculture and trying to design a program of benefits and assistance that helps farmers make it to the next year, helps compensate them to the extent that some will be spared going into bankruptcy or having to sell their farms at a forced sale. And it is that bad in some areas. 
We think this is a balanced approach, not only for this disaster assistance program that is funded in this bill to the extent of $4.2 billion. That is in addition to all the other transition payments that we are providing under the existing law. And an option to obtain an accelerated payment of next year's market transition payment, that is available now in October because of a bill that was passed just recently. 
We think the bill itself, the entire conference report, justifies the support of this Senate and an overwhelming vote to approve it and to send it to the President. 
Before I yield the floor, Mr. President, I want to point out that this is just one aspect of what is being done or what is attempted to be done by this Congress to help the outlook for farming in America and in agriculture. Our economy--that is one of the most successful of any sectors of our economy in terms of its ability to export, to generate income for people not just on the farm but at the store, driving trucks in the transportation system, the inputs that go into production agriculture, the equipment that is purchased, the seeds, all the rest that go into this giant part of our economy--is very important to our country. 
We generate a positive trade balance. I think this year it is going to be almost $20 billion in trade surplus. This is comparing the amount and the value of exports with imports of agriculture and food products. 
The House just recently passed a tax bill, reported out of the House Ways and Means Committee. It was my hope that we could take that bill up here and pass it in the Senate, because it delivers to farmers and farm families some new tax benefits that can help them in this time of crisis on the farm and would be good policy changes for the future, one of which permits a 5-year carryback of operating losses. Another makes permanent the income averaging provision of the more recent tax bill that was signed into law. Another accelerates the phasing in of exemptions of inheritance tax and gift tax for small businesses and farms. That is very helpful to farmers and farm families. 
Another provides 100 percent deductibility of the costs of self-employed health insurance, health insurance for those people who work for themselves. In the past, they weren't able to deduct the costs of that health insurance. 
Under the bill that was reported out of the House Ways and Means Committee and passed by the other body, the total costs of that premium could be deducted from income tax. We should make that the law now. Farmers need that now. Farm families need that benefit now. 
Because of a threat by the Democrat minority, we can't call that bill up. We are told there will be an objection. And if a motion is made to proceed to consider the House bill, 60 votes would be required to shut off debate on the motion to proceed. So that bill is unlikely to be considered by the Senate, we are told, because of those objections and that resistance. Again the President said, `If you pass it, I will veto that.' 
So farmers ought to know where the problem is. They are being told with big speeches out here and a lot of charts that the Democrats are the farmers' best friend. The evidence is piling up on the other side of that argument. I think it is going to become very, very clear that that is not the case. 
Here is another example. We have been told that American agriculture is suffering right now--unfairness in the international marketplace. People are erecting barriers to trade while we are trying to sell more in the market or break into a new market for agriculture products and foodstuffs, that we are running into barriers of one kind or another, and that the importation of certain foodstuff--cattle, wheat--from Canada violates existing rules of fair trade in this hemisphere. For months, the administration has done absolutely nothing that I know of to try to deal with that situation. 
One thing they asked last year of the Congress was to enact fast-track negotiating authority for the administration so agreements to adjust these problems, to resolve the difficulties, could be negotiated and worked out. Congress would make a commitment that if fair agreements were worked out we would take them up under fast-track procedures and vote them up or down. So the Speaker of the House, as we were working to put together the disaster assistance program, agreed he would call up the fast-track authority legislation in the House for a vote; the Senate has acted. The House couldn't pass it because the Democrats wouldn't vote for it. A huge number of Democrats voted against it. The President, apparently without the ability to lead on that issue in the House, couldn't turn out the votes to pass the legislation he said was important, he said was needed to help agriculture. The Republican leadership called it up and most of them voted for it. 
I am suggesting that is another example of a problem that we have here in the government. I am not trying to put this into a partisan debate to say that the Republicans are right on everything and the Democrats are wrong; but I am pointing out these facts that exist in the context of trying to do something to help farmers and help agriculture. 
Most people live outside the United States, and if the growth is going to be achieved in agriculture sales and we are going to see increases in incomes and prices, we are going to have to sell more of what we produce in the export market. Mr. President, 95 percent of the people in this world live outside the United States. It is that area of the world where the population is growing the fastest. The needs are greater for foodstuffs. 
I hope, as Senators look at this problem and try to decide whether we are doing the right thing or not by approving this bill, they will recognize we can't solve every problem that this sector has in one bill. But this is a very positive step toward dealing with the real crisis that exists out there in agriculture today. I am hopeful that the Senate will vote for this conference report and that we will have a resounding vote to overturn and override the President's veto, if he insists on continuing down this path. It is wrong. It is not justified. I hope he will change his mind. 
I yield to the distinguished Senator from Idaho such time as he may consume.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of the time on our side. 
Let me say to the distinguished Senator from Montana, I appreciate his courtesies as well. It is a pleasure working with him on these issues. I am sorry we have to disagree on some of the issues contained in this agriculture appropriations conference report. 
On the subject that the Senator mentions, and also the Democratic leader when he was speaking mentioned as a reason why the President ought to veto this legislation, was the question of price reporting and meat labeling. These are two separate issues. Frankly, I was surprised by the comments and also including this as a basis for urging the President to veto the legislation. 
When we passed our bill in July, we received the reaction following that, after the administration had an opportunity to study the legislation--we received the reaction in a formal letter from the Secretary of Agriculture dated September 24, a `Dear Thad' letter from Dan Glickman. 
Included is a table going down through the bills. This is prior to conference now--I think that is right--prior to our going to the conference with the House conferees to work out differences between the House- and Senate-passed bills. In Secretary Glickman's letter pointing out their reaction to the Senate-passed bill and the provisions in the House bill, they get down to the meat labeling provision, which is title X in the Senate bill. There is no House provision on that subject. The USDA position as conveyed in this letter to me says: Working with Congress to address concerns about adverse trade effects and concerns that implementation would divert resources needed to address important food safety issues. 
We tried to work with the administration, and did, to address those concerns. If the administration had been supportive of the meat labeling provisions, they would have said so, because they go right down through the list and support some other provisions. Or if they opposed it, they point it out and they say so. 
Here is another example, the Biodiesel Energy Development Act, which the administration says, to a separate bill in the House, the administration opposes. 
The administration did not say that they supported the meat labeling. They suggested they had concerns about it and they wanted to work with the Congress to address those concerns. So here is what we did in conference to try to address those concerns. We provided conference report language, statement of managers, to this effect: 
The conferees direct the Secretary to conduct a comprehensive study on the potential effects of mandatory country of origin labeling of imported fresh muscle cuts of beef and lamb. The report shall include the impact of such requirements on imports, exports, livestock producers, consumers, processors, packers, distributors and grocers. 
We went on to say: 
The report shall be submitted to Congress no later than 6 months after the enactment of this Act, and shall contain a detailed statement of the findings and conclusions of the Secretary, together with his recommendations for such legislation and administrative actions as he considers appropriate. 
I have suggested to the Senate that the action taken by the conferees is responsive to the objections and concerns that were raised in our letter from the administration on that subject. And here, at the very last minute, the Democratic leader raises this issue and spends a good deal of his time talking about this as the reason why the administration ought to veto the conference report. 
Another subject that was raised was price reporting. We also got a letter from the Office of Management and Budget as well as the Secretary of Agriculture, responding to our bill and suggesting things that they think need the attention of conferees. If they have objections to provisions, they say so in either the OMB letter or the Secretary of Agriculture's letter. 
On the subject of price reporting, there was a USDA request to review any final language adopted by the conferees. Here is what the conferees provided in the statement of managers on that issue: 
The conferees direct the Secretary of Agriculture to take steps to increase the voluntary reporting of fed cattle, and wholesale beef carcass prices and volumes on a quality and yield-grade basis, as well as the prices and volumes of boxed beef. . . The Secretary shall encourage the reporting of the price differential for USDA Prime, the upper 2/3 of USDA Choice, and a sub-select price category. Reports should include imported beef products and livestock. 
Then we go on to say: 
The Secretary of Agriculture shall compile and publish price, volume sales, and the shipment information regarding all exports and imports of beef, veal, lamb, and products thereof which is collected via the expanded voluntary process. . . . The Secretary shall also standardize the Agriculture Marketing Service price reporting data collection activities to ensure uniformity and complete sales data capture and to maximize the information available to all aspects of the industry. 
The Secretary shall report to Congress, not more than 6 months after enactment, on the feasibility or need for mandatory price reporting. . . 
I suggest, Mr. President, that the conferees have done a very good job of trying to deal with these two issues in this conference. We have responded to the concerns expressed by the Secretary of Agriculture in his letter to us of September 24 giving us his reaction to our bill. Never did they single out in the letters to us that this would trigger a veto if we didn't do such and such with either one of those provisions. There was no such suggestion made. 
There was a veto threat in the letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and here is what the veto threat says: 
If the bill presented to the President includes the unacceptable FDA language-- 
And, by the way, that has been removed from the bill in conference, the so-called RU486 issue-- 
and agriculture disaster provisions that provide inadequate indemnity assistance or are inconsistent with the Daschle/Harkin proposal, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill. We look forward to working with you to resolve these concerns. 
The veto message, if this is a veto message, is that if we don't enact the Daschle/Harkin disaster indemnity assistance proposal, then the senior advisers will recommend to the President that he veto the bill. 
We have talked about the disaster assistance proposal and why we think the direct assistance is much to be preferred over rewriting a portion of the 1996 farm bill as proposed by Daschle/Harkin, and we certainly think that is not good policy. It won't serve to increase prices for farmers at market, which is what we are trying to do to help ensure a brighter future for American production agriculture. 
Mr. President, I urge the Senate to approve the conference report on Agriculture appropriations.

Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, pending before the Senate at this time is the conference report on the fiscal year 1999 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. We present this conference report for the Senate's approval this afternoon. 
The agreement provides total new budget authority of $55.7 billion for programs and activities of the U.S. Department of Agriculture--except for the Forest Service, which is funded by the Interior appropriations bill--the Food and Drug Administration, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and expenses and payments of the farm credit system. This is $6 billion more than the fiscal year 1998 enacted level; it is $1.9 billion less than the President's request level; it is $192 million less than the House-passed bill, and it is $1.1 billion less than the Senate-passed bill level. 
The changes that were made in conference on mandatory funding requirements account for the overall increase from the fiscal year 1998 enacted level, principally reflecting a $2.6 billion lower estimate for Food Stamp Program funding requirements, higher Child Nutrition Program expenses, and a $7.6 billion increase in the payment to reimburse the Commodity Credit Corporation for net realized losses. The conference report also provides an additional $4.2 billion in emergency appropriations to assist agricultural producers and others who have suffered financial hardship due to adverse weather conditions and loss of markets. 
Including congressional budget scorekeeping adjustments and prior year spending actions, this conference agreement provides total discretionary spending for fiscal year 1999 of $13.651 billion in budget authority and $14.050 billion in outlays. These amounts are consistent with the revised discretionary spending allocations established for this conference agreement under the Budget Act. 
It was a very difficult conference. As Members may recall, a number of legislative provisions were added to the bill when it was considered in the Senate in July. Not only did the conference committee have to reach agreement with the House on these issues, but it had to resolve funding differences within a more constrained discretionary spending allocation for the conference than originally established in the Senate bill. 
Special recognition is due and deserved by the ranking member of the subcommittee, my distinguished colleague from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers. In addition, the chairman of the House subcommittee, Congressman Skeen from New Mexico, and ranking minority member of the House subcommittee, Congresswoman Kaptur from Ohio, turned in hard work and cooperated with our efforts to make this conference agreement possible. 
The report includes credit relief for farmers, a 6-month extension of the Northeast Dairy Compact, sanctions relief for exports to India and Pakistan, a waiver of the statute of limitations for certain discrimination claims filed against the Department of Agriculture, and a number of other legislative provisions that were included in the Senate and House-passed bills. 
In addition, at the request of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees, chaired by Senator Lugar here and Congressman Smith in the House, the conference report includes a moratorium on the rulemaking authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over swaps and derivatives, as well as language requested by the administration authorizing the creation of an Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs position at the Department of Agriculture. That change also had the approval of the legislative committees with jurisdiction over that subject. 
During consideration of the bill in the Senate, an amendment was adopted providing increased funding for the President's Food Safety Initiative. A major portion of this additional spending was offset by an `assessment' on the purchasers and importers of tobacco. This was subsequently determined by the House Ways and Means Committee to be a `tax,' and therefore off limits to the Appropriations Committee and was not included in the conference report. I am pleased to report to the Senate, however, that the conference report provides increased funding of $51.9 million for activities and programs which are part of the administration's Food Safety Initiative. 
In addition, the conference report provides $609 million for the Food Safety and Inspection Service, an agency critical to maintaining the safety of our food supply. That is $20 million more than the fiscal year 1998 level, and $460 million more than the President requested in his budget. 
As most of my colleagues are aware, one of the major differences between the House and Senate-passed bill was a House bill provision to prevent fiscal year 1999 funding for the new Competitive Agriculture Research Program established by the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998. I did not support the proposal to remove or prevent the funding going forward as directed in that legislation. However, with a total discretionary budget authority allocation for the conference that was $64 million below the level we had for the Senate bill, it was a House position that the Senate conferees had little choice but to accept. 
Without that offset, drastic cuts would have been necessary in funding for other discretionary programs and activities in the bill. In view of this 1-year delay in funding for the new Agriculture Research Competitive Grant Program, the conference provided increased appropriations for existing agricultural research programs. 
Here are some examples: There is an appropriation of $782 million for the Agriculture Research Service. That represents a $38 million increase from the 1998 fiscal year level, and it is $14 million more than was included in the Senate-passed bill. 
There is total funding of $481 million for research and education activities of the Cooperative Research, Education and Extension Service. That is $50 million more than the fiscal year 1998 level, and it is $48 million more than was in the Senate-passed bill. Included in this amount is a 7-percent increase from the fiscal year 1998 level for payments under the Hatch Act, cooperative forestry research, payments to the 1890 and 1994 institutions, including Tuskegee and animal and health disease grants. 
Also included is a $22.1 million increase for the National Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program. 
In addition, the bill recommends $434 million for extension activities which preserves the 3-percent increase recommended by the Senate for Smith-Lever formula funds, as well as extension payments to the 1994 and 1890 institutions, including Tuskegee University. 
Approximately $36.1 billion, close to 65 percent of the total new budget authority provided by this conference report, is for domestic food programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These include food stamps; commodity assistance; the special supplemental food program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); and the school lunch and breakfast programs. The Senate receded to the House-recommended appropriations level for the WIC program because recent data on actual participation rates and food package costs indicate that this amount should be sufficient to maintain current program participation levels in fiscal year 1999. 
For farm assistance programs, including the Farm Service Agency and farm ownership and operation loan subsidies, the conference report provides $1.1 billion in appropriations. 
Appropriations for conservation programs administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service total $793 million, $9 million more than the House bill level and $1 million more than the level recommended by the Senate. 
For rural economic and community development programs, the conference report provides appropriations of $2.2 billion to support a total loan level of $6.2 billion. Included in this amount is $723 million for the Rural Community Advancement Program, $583 million for the rental assistance program, and a total rural housing loan program level of $4.25 billion. 
A total of $1.2 billion is provided for foreign assistance and related programs of the Department of Agriculture, including $136 million in new budget authority for the Foreign Agricultural Service and a total program level of $1.1 billion for the P.L. 480 Food for Peace Program. 
Total new budget authority for the Food and Drug Administration is $977 million, $11.5 million more than the level recommended by the House and $24.5 million more than the Senate bill level, along with an additional $132 million in Prescription Drug Act and $14 million in mammography clinics user fee collections. Included in the appropriation for salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration is a $20 million increase for food safety. 
For the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, $61 million is provided; and a limitation of $35.8 million is established on administrative expenses of the Farm Credit Administration. 
Titles XI-XIII of this conference report provide emergency relief to agricultural producers and others who have suffered weather-related and economic losses. As Members will recall, a number of amendments were adopted to this bill when the Senate considered it in July to address disaster-related requirements with the understanding that additional relief would be necessary once actual losses were determined by the Department of Agriculture and a supplemental request was submitted by the Administration. No request was submitted to the Congress until September 23. On September 23, the Administration submitted a $1.8 billion budget authority request to support $2.3 billion in emergency agricultural programs. In the interim, the Republicans released a $3.9 billion relief package to assist agricultural producers. This emergency agricultural relief package is included in this conference report, along with additional emergency supplemental appropriations, to make a total of $4.2 billion in emergency assistance available. 
A total of $1.5 billion is made available to assist producers who have been hit by crop losses in 1998, and an additional $675 million for producers who have suffered from multiple-year crop losses. Also included is $175 million for emergency livestock feed assistance, and $1.65 billion to assist producers with market losses. In addition, the conference report provides temporary recourse loans for honey and mohair; $5 million for cotton indemnity payments; an increase of $25 million for the Food for Progress program to help move more grain out of the country; and expanded non-insured crop assistance for raisin producers. Additional supplemental emergency appropriations provided by the conference report include the $40 million to cover additional costs to the Farm Service Agency of administering this assistance, $10 million for the Forestry Incentives Program; and $31 million in subsidy appropriations to fund an additional $541 million in farm operating loans. 
Madam President, this conference report was filed on Friday and was passed by the House of Representatives that day by an overwhelming vote of 333 yeas to 53 nays. Senate passage of this conference report today is the final step necessary to send this fiscal year 1999 appropriations bill to the President for signature into law. 
I urge my colleagues to adopt this conference report. Many of our farmers and ranchers are facing the worst crisis in agriculture that they can remember. The economic collapse in Asia has resulted in lost markets. Producers in some states have suffered severe weather conditions. Others have been hit hard by crop diseases. The farmers need help now, and it is time to quit playing politics with disaster relief and adopt this conference report. 
Madam President, this is the last Agriculture Appropriations bill my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Arkansas, will manage in the Senate after serving on the Appropriations Committee for 20 years and this Subcommittee for 13 years. Senator Bumpers has been an advocate of American agriculture and a proponent of the programs in this bill to improve the quality of life and help bring jobs to rural areas. His expertise and many contributions to this process and this bill will indeed be missed. 
In summary, let me point out, Madam President, that there has been raised the specter of a Presidential veto over this conference report because of the inadequacy of the provision relating to disaster assistance payments. I am very disturbed by that suggestion, and I hope that it is more rumor than promise. I know the President spent some time on Saturday in his weekly radio address speaking to that subject. 
I recall that 2 weeks ago, I was asked to deliver the Republican response to the President's weekly radio address, and my subject was the need for a more aggressive and meaningful disaster assistance program for farmers. 
I think everyone can agree that both the President and the Congress have been speaking out and making very clear the fact that we need a helpful, sensitive, generous program of disaster assistance to help deal with the realities of weather-related disasters that have struck many parts of the country, market loss problems because of the Asian economic crisis, and other factors that have worked together to make this a very difficult year for agriculture. 
The question is, Are we going to resolve this in a way that is consistent with the legislative process that makes sense for farmers, that serves to establish policies that are thoughtful and consistent with the needs of American agriculture, or are we going to continue to treat this as a political football and just kick it around and have us skirmish every day or every week over this issue, leading to delay, leading to uncertainties, leading to anxieties? Farmers in America certainly deserve better. 
I would like just for a moment or two to think back on the date when we had the bill on the floor of the Senate and the subject of disaster assistance was first raised. We adopted in the Senate a sense-of-the-Senate resolution calling on the President and the Congress to work together to come up with a proposal that would meet the needs for emergency action to respond `to the economic hardships facing agriculture producers and their communities.' The Senate adopted that on July 15 by a vote of 99 to 0. 
The next day, there was an amendment offered by the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, and others who suggested we establish a $500 million indemnity program to compensate farmers for income losses that had been suffered due to various adverse conditions--weather and otherwise--throughout the country, although mainly the benefits were directed to the upper plains and other selected areas, not countrywide benefits or a program designed to be national in scope. 
During my remarks on that occasion, I recall on the Senate floor saying that we needed to have the President and the Department of Agriculture get involved and provide the Congress with a complete and accurate assessment of the funds that were needed for a program of this kind. We hadn't had a proposal from the administration for any specific benefit program for agriculture, although there had been meetings on the Hill with farm groups, with Senators and Congressmen trying to, first, get the facts and get a sense of what the agriculture leadership throughout the country thought would be an appropriate response by the Federal Government. 
There was no question at the time we were debating the bill that there was great interest in developing a disaster assistance program to meet the needs of American agriculture. As a matter of fact, during the discussion, I asked Senators if they had any better ideas, if they had suggestions for anything other than this $500 million indemnity program, and no one came forward to offer any amendments and no one expressed opposition to adopting that amendment. We checked with the legislative chairman in the Senate, and others, and without objection, we suggested that the Senate adopt the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota on a voice vote, and that is what we did. We accepted the amendment. 
After that was done, it became clear that through gathering information, that the situation was more widespread. I remember going to Georgia, for example, with the distinguished Senator from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell. I had an opportunity to meet with farmers in southern Georgia and became convinced that we had a problem that was bigger than the upper plains and Texas. Everybody knew about the drought in Texas and the severe complications that were resulting from that for agriculture producers and ranchers in that area. 
But I do not think it was well known that in south Georgia, which had had a series of weather-related disasters over a period of years, the agriculture sector there was really hurting. And the $500 million indemnity program, suggested by the Senators from North Dakota and others, was not going to be sufficient to deal with that problem and others as well. 
I know in my State of Mississippi, for example, when I was home right after we adopted this bill in July--we had a break during the August recess--I had an opportunity to visit some areas of my State that were devastated because of isolated weather patterns that had ruined corn crops in the northwest part of Mississippi, and others had been damaged to the extent that diseases were infesting the crops. Aflatoxin was attacking the corn crops. 
There was no provision in any Federal disaster assistance program for yield losses, for crop losses. Those who were suggesting an indemnity program based on lifting loan caps had to realize that was not going to help somebody who had a total crop failure. It would not help them a bit. 
So we came back, started working on a new proposal, got with the leadership of the House and Senate, and asked the administration they were going to request supplemental funding. They did come back with a $1.8 billion supplemental budget authority request to support $2.3 billion in emergency agricultural programs, without a lot of specificity about how those benefits would be determined, how the eligibility would be determined, who would administer the program. But, nonetheless, it was a step in the right direction, and I applauded the President for responding in that way. 
But based on that supplemental request--and working with the knowledge that other Members had generated from their States--we proposed to the conference committee a $4.1 billion disaster assistance program, and it was accepted in the conference committee with some changes. We accepted some amendments proposed by House Members in conference. We added some money proposed by the Senate in response to specific amendments that were urged in conference to the managers' proposal. So the end result was the conference committee agreed to provide emergency benefits totaling about $4.2 billion. 
So I come to the Senate today very pleased to be able to report that, instead of a $500 million indemnity program that the Senate adopted as a way to deal with the crisis in agriculture, working with farmers, producers, and ranchers from around the country, and other Members of the Congress, including the House, we now have a conference report that is much more generous, much more responsive to the real needs that exist in our country today in production agriculture, and designed to more nearly bring farmers to a point where they can continue to operate without going broke, without the devastating effects that would have been the reality of the situation had not this package of changes been agreed upon. 
We hear now that the Democratic leadership has urged the President to veto the bill. And I got a letter suggesting that he would if the conference agreement on disaster assistance was inconsistent with the proposal just recently made by the Democratic leader of the Senate to remove the loan caps under the current farm program for the commodities that are subsidized, in effect, by the Federal Government--no ifs, ands, buts about it. 
The letter said--and I took this up with the Secretary of Agriculture to be sure I understood that that was the meaning--that the President said he would veto the bill if the conference report was inconsistent with a proposal made by the Democratic leader to remove the loan caps for those commodities that are subsidized by the Government. 
I am very disappointed by that. I certainly hope that there is room for the President to change his mind on that subject, because it seems to me that rather than argue over whether or not this program is really going to do a good job and is thoughtfully crafted to try to put farmers back on their feet who have been devastated by bad weather and market conditions beyond their control, it just seems to me that this is not an appropriate response for the President to be making, given the other opportunities for positive things. 
Here are some examples of positive things that I think could be done which are beyond the jurisdiction of this committee today that brings you this conference report. The House of Representatives just passed recently a tax bill making a lot of changes in the Tax Code, but I specifically recall that some of those tax changes are designed to benefit farmers and farm families, and I am told that we are not going to have a chance to vote on that tax bill here in the Senate because we cannot get the bill cleared to bring up. We cannot get the House-passed tax bill cleared. 
So in order to bring it up, the majority leader would have to move to the consideration of the bill, the motion would become debatable, and then in order to get the bill on the floor for consideration and debate and passage, 60 votes to invoke cloture would have to be undertaken because the Democrats are promising to filibuster the bill. 
Here are the changes that it bothers me we will not even get a chance to approve that would help farmers. 
There is a 5-year net loss carryback of losses that you can carry back and set against income for 5 previous years. That is in the House-passed bill. The House-passed bill makes permanent income averaging, which permits farmers and ranchers to average income, high years against low years, and even out the tax burden, which is very beneficial to many. 
There is a provision that makes deductible, to 100 percent of the cost, health insurance premiums by those who are self-employed. If you are in agriculture and you have a farm and you are your own boss, under this change you will be able to deduct 100 percent of the cost of your health insurance. That helps farmers. That helps farm families. 
There is also an acceleration of the exemption for death taxes and gift taxes. One of the most difficult things facing agriculture today is the obligation to come up with cash money to pay the Federal Government so-called inheritance taxes on the death of a family member who has an interest in the land or the other property that goes into making up the decedent's estate. 
We have passed rules that phase in some higher exemptions for small farms and for businesses. What this House-passed bill does is accelerate the phasing in of those exemptions. That would be a big help to many farm families who are going to have to liquidate assets in real estate to pay death taxes. 
Another thing that this administration has been slow to react to is the trade problems that we are having in this hemisphere, with Canada, with Mexico, and beyond, barriers to trade so that our farmers and our exporters are having to deal with unfair tariff situations and other difficulties that are erected to keep America from selling what we are producing in the world marketplace and at the same time importing, in violation of some existing rules, I am told, some foodstuffs, live cattle, from other countries. 
Finally the administration is beginning to act. We see the Trade Representative engaging Canada in trade talks now about steps that can be taken to solve the problems that have developed in that area. 
But we were hearing this on the Senate floor and urging the administration to take action. Being the chief negotiator in the executive branch, the President has an obligation to assume some leadership. Frankly, there has been a breakdown in leadership on that subject. 
We hope we haven't waited too late to make changes and reach agreements and work out problems in the trade area for the farmers who have suffered this year. That is one of the reasons why we felt it necessary to include direct payments that are bonus payments under the transition. 
We think the market transition program to compensate producers directly for income losses due to the economic crisis and trade problems that we have is very important. The administration does not propose and has not suggested that as an appropriate step to aid America's farmers. 
I make those comments, Madam President, not to pick a fight with anybody here on the floor of the Senate today, but to simply express my concern that we not see this bill held up, delayed, postponed, vetoed, whatever may happen to it, because of an interest in being able to say the Democrats are for a $7 billion disaster program, the Republican bill is only $4 billion. I bet it will be the same folks who said we want $500 million in an indemnity program to help meet the needs of the agriculture crisis. That is what the story was in July. We all agreed at that time that was probably temporary, that more needs to be done. So I am not belittling that suggestion. It was the suggestion on the floor of the Senate at the time and no one had any better idea at that time. 
Since then it seems we have been engaged in a show of one-upsmanship. The Republicans then come up with, with Democrat input in many cases, this $4 billion program of disaster assistance. Now, all of a sudden, that is not enough; we need $7 billion. 
How much has the President requested? I have the exact amount: $1.76 billion in budget authority has been requested by the President for agriculture producers and ranchers. That will support $2.3 billion program level. The other suggestion is removing the loan caps. Then CBO is called on to answer the question, what will that cost? The answer is that will probably cost--and it is speculation, it is a guess, nobody knows because nobody knows what commodity prices will be in the future--it is guessed it will be $5.5 billion. 
The proponents of that proposal say we are for spending $5.5 billion plus $2.3 billion, so we are for spending almost $8 billion. So this is a more generous plan. What is not disclosed is the effect that policy change of raising the loan caps will have on prices of those commodities next year or the next. The fact is there are many who tell us that we are buying into a program that is going to have a continuing depressing effect on market price of these commodities that are covered by the loan programs. 
I don't know if that is true or not. I don't think anybody could have guessed that corn and wheat prices would have been as low as they are right now a year ago. So nobody knows what the prices are going to be in the future. I am told they will be lower because of that change in policy. So are we doing farmers a favor by making that policy change? 
It is really not a question, in my view, of who is willing to spend more money on farmers, the Republicans or the Democrats. Both are being very generous. That is the fact. Both are being very, very generous in terms of where we started, existing programs, precedent, previous disaster benefit efforts. The fact is the Democrats are in favor of making a policy change and substituting a change for an existing farm bill provision that set up the market transition payments and the phasing in to a market economy. We are in the second year of that farm bill. There are 3 more years left under the authority of the 1996 bill. I m hopeful that we can find a way to provide the benefits to American agriculture producers without rewriting or trying to rewrite portions of the 1996 farm bill. So we have a difference of opinion on that. 
Let me simply conclude my remarks by thanking everyone who helped us write this conference report. It has been a very challenging experience. I don't know that we had a more contentious or at least long drawn out conference on agriculture appropriations since I have been in the Congress. I don't recall having any more difficult time putting the bill together. We had a lot of disagreements that were discussed, but we worked them all out. We have a conference agreement. That is the good news. The other body has passed the conference report by a very large vote.

As he also noted, there are a number of medical, insurance and public policy issues involved, All these issues need to be considered, as well as the concerns of all members of the hearing health care team, including the Audiologists, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery and the International Hearing Society. 
Whether in this Congress, or the next, I am committed to doing what is necessary to enable this body to understand these issues, and to determine the best way to address them, for the benefit of children and others, who need hearing health services.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the `Homebound Elderly Relief Opportunity Act of 1998' (HERO). This measure addresses a very serious concern: the future of home care within the Medicare system. 
For Mississippians, home health has had a two-fold benefit: Home care serves to reduce costly hospitalization stays while enhancing the patient's quality of life through continued stay in the familiar home setting. 
Additionally, in a rural state like Mississippi, home health has enabled health care to be delivered to the immobile and elderly who are often miles and hours from the nearest hospital or clinic. 
Despite these obvious benefits, home health is very expensive, however. With Medicare and government expenditures, it is not always a question of `What we should afford?' but `What we can afford?' 
Congress answered these questions with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which has brought fiscal responsibility back to government. BBA 97 dealt with among other issues, Medicare, and in turn home health, probably the fastest growing expenditure within the program. The work of Senator Roth and the Finance Committee has helped insure some stability in home health expenditures, so that a good thing does not quickly become a bad thing and bankrupt the trust fund. However, instead of saving this vital Medicare benefit, HCFA's application of the Balanced Budget Act to home health--through the use of the Interim Payment System--has threatened its very existence. In so doing, HCFA has ignored both equity and the elderly, particularly in rural America. 
The Senate has not completely ignored the home health crisis: Sixty-eight of my colleagues have made statements which appear with their photographs on a recent industry poster proclaiming the ills of HCFA's interim payment system and its threat to the continuation of home health services. 
Five of my colleagues--Senators Grassley and Breaux; Senator Bond; Senator Collins; and Senator Kennedy have each introduced bills to adjust or eliminate IPS. Senator Bond has been the Senate champion of saving home health. His Senate Bill 2354, of which I am cosponsor, provides a direct, honest response to the HCFA-created nightmare. His bill would impose a moratorium on IPS from fiscal year 1998 forward until HCFA develops the prospective payment system, the only sure way to solve the home health expenditure issue in a fair manner. However, the Moratorium Bill's cost has been scored by CBO to be in the many many billions. While we must save home health, we cannot do so in a way that jeopardizes all of Medicare. We must find a compromise. That is the purpose of introducing HERO today. 
The HERO Bill is an effort to correct the essential problems with the interim payment system and to create a better bridge to the prospective payment system which we all hope will be developed and implemented soon. I believe it provides the best opportunity for success with respect to Government spending, Medicare reimbursement, and protecting beneficiaries. 
It establishes budget limits for Medicare home health expenditures for 1999-2002 with the same savings levels currently projected by the Congressional Budget Office under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 provisions. If expenditure estimates exceed the budget limits, payments to providers will be limited to regional levels on an equitable basis. Finally, it insures access to home care for all qualified Medicare beneficiaries. 
Overall, this bill provides one last opportunity in this session for all home health beneficiaries to receive the Medicare benefit to which they are entitled and for the providers of those services to be fairly reimbursed. It corrects the essential flaw in the original payment reform which rewarded the inefficient and punished the efficient providers and failed to account for the variation in the types of patients served by home health agencies. However, this bill operates with budgetary and operational safeguards to insure that the home health benefit stays on its steady course. 
Mr. President, Congress must reform IPS immediately before even more reputable home health agencies are forced out of business and more seniors are forced to go without care or leave their homes for more expensive hospital or nursing home care. I urge Senators to support this bill.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the issue we are debating this morning is not new to the Senate. In May of this year, the Senate voted on a motion to invoke cloture so that we could proceed to consider the American Missile Protection Act. That motion was not successful. The vote was 59 in favor and 41 against. Therefore, we fell one vote short of invoking cloture so the Senate could proceed to debate the American Missile Protection Act. 
We have another chance today, Mr. President, to go on record in favor of considering this bill. So it should be put in context what we are voting for and what we are not voting for. We are not voting to pass the bill without any debate. That is not the issue. We are voting to proceed to consider the bill. Now let us put in context what the facts are today as compared with last May when we fell just one vote short of voting to consider this bill. 
At the time we voted in May, India had just tested--that very day--for the second time, a nuclear weapons device. We were not aware that India was going to conduct that test. Our intelligence community was surprised. All the world was surprised. 
We used that example to urge the Senate to change our current policy on national missile defense, because the current policy is that we will make a decision to deploy a national missile defense system if we learn that some nation has developed the capacity to put us at risk, to threaten the security of American citizens with a ballistic missile system. 
So the assumption is that our intelligence community and our resources for learning things like this are so sophisticated and so reliable that we will be able to detect this, that we will have an early warning, that we will be able to know well in advance of any nation having the capability of inflicting damage or destruction on America's soil, through a ballistic missile system, in enough time that we could deploy a national missile defense system. 
Another consideration is that we have not yet developed a national missile defense system. We have various programs that are being tested in various stages of development--theater ballistic missile defense systems--that can defend us against regional attacks, shorter-range attacks. But this bill is talking about a national ballistic missile defense system and whether or not our policy should be to wait and see if other countries develop the capability to put us at risk and then decide--then decide--whether we should work to deploy a system to protect against that kind of threat. 
What has changed since the vote in May is that not only did Pakistan proceed to test a nuclear device--we were not sure they were going to do that--they also had just recently tested a missile system that we did not know they had. We had been told a few months earlier that they had a missile system that was in the 180 mile range. They tested one that had a range of about 900 miles without our knowing they had the capability to do that, without our knowing that they had that missile. But they had acquired either the missile, the component parts, or the design from other countries or another country--according to press reports, North Korea was involved in that--and they were able to actually launch that across that distance, and it was a surprise to our intelligence community, to our country and to the world. 
Those events occurred about the time we voted in May. Since then, look what has happened. Iran has tested a longer-range missile than we expected them to have. North Korea has tested and has fired a multiple-stage ballistic missile. 
We had discussed the fact that that was possibly under development, the Taepo Dong missile. We are calling it the Taepo Dong I because we are told that there is a Taepo Dong II under development. That has been publicly reported in the press. 
The missile that was tested the other day by North Korea, the multiple-stage missile, was fired over Japan. There was evidence that the missile actually crossed the territory of Japan. Do you realize, Mr. President--I know Members of the Senate are aware--that we have some 37,000 Americans deployed in South Korea as a part of a defense stability effort in that region, and we have more than that in Japan, in the Okinawa area? 
The whole point is that if you consider all of that, we have 80,000 Americans who are at risk now because of the proven capability of North Korea and its new advanced missile capability. We have gone to great lengths in the last few years to dissuade North Korea from proceeding to develop nuclear weapons. We were very concerned that they were proceeding to do just that. Some think that they have made substantial progress in doing just that. 
Incidentally, the Taepo Dong II that I just mentioned has the capacity of striking the territory of the United States. Many troops and military assets and resources are located in Alaska. According to press reports, the Taepo Dong II would have the capacity to destroy that area, as well as striking Hawaii. 
Now, the issue is, do we proceed with the wait-and-see policy of this administration, or do we today vote to proceed to consider legislation that will change that policy, that will say as soon as technology permits, the United States will deploy a national missile defense system that will protect it against ballistic missile attack, whether unauthorized or accidental or intentional. We have all worried about accidental and unauthorized launches from China and Russia. We know those countries have the capability of striking us. But think about this other fact: What else has changed recently? 
The United States has observed the Russian Government slowly deteriorate to the point that the command and control structure of the military is seriously in question. Who really controls the armed forces of Russia to the point that you can rely upon the good intentions of the Yeltsin government not to target U.S. sites with their missile systems, their intercontinental ballistic missiles, the most lethal and accurate of any other country in the world, with multitudes of warheads, nuclear-tipped warheads? We are sitting here hoping and assuming that we can continue to work with Russia and whatever government does come out of the struggle for power there to continue to destroy nuclear weapons under Russian control rather than to build them up and make them more accurate and lethal. 
By the way, it is not like they have dismantled the nuclear weapon systems in Russia. They exist. They are lethal. They are capable of striking anywhere in the United States they might decide to strike, and we are glad that they don't have any intention of doing that. But they have the capability of doing that and there could be an unauthorized or accidental launch and we have absolutely no defense against that kind of attack. We have been operating under the assumption that we can assure them we will retaliate--we have the capacity to--and we will destroy any country who attempts to strike us in that way. That has been the system for defense that we have had. 
We have had no defense. The defense is that we will destroy you if you attack us in that way. That doesn't work with North Korea or Iran or some other rogue states, leaders, and terrorists who have announced that it is their stated goal to kill Americans and to destroy America and to build missile systems to do that or to sell missile systems to those who want to do that. North Korea said just that. An official stated publicly that they are in the business of selling missile systems. They need the money. That was the explanation. We know that is true. They have sold missile systems; they have sold component parts. Russia has people who are cooperating in Iran right now, and have in the past, to develop systems that could inflict great damage not only in that region but beyond. 
Now, some are saying that we already have authorization and funds in the pipeline to develop these missile systems to protect us--interceptor missiles--and we read about the testing that is going on of theater systems. But we have no program that has as its goal the development and deployment of a missile defense that will protect the United States against unauthorized, accidental, or intentional ballistic missile attack. 
That is what this legislation addresses. It has two parts. The first is recitation of all of the facts that we have been able to gather through hearings over the last 2 years in our Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services. We have had hearings. We have published a report called Proliferation Primer. It has been widely distributed. It documents the fact that throughout the world there is a growing capability for the use of ballistic missiles. 
We talk about how it is happening and what people are saying who are in charge of those countries who are involved in this. It clearly, in our view, justified our asking this Congress to legislate a change in our policy to carry out now the express recommendations of the Rumsfeld Commission, which has, since our vote in May, given its report on the state of affairs regarding the ballistic missile threat to the United States. It was concluded in that report that our intelligence community does not have the capacity for making the early warning assessment that is contemplated under current administration policy. 
The Director of Central Intelligence has admitted in previous statements to the Senate that there are gaps and uncertainties in the information that his agency can obtain in making decisions about whether or not countries are developing or have the capacity to deploy ballistic missile systems that put our Nation at risk. Now that assessment and that description of the situation has been borne out by those recent developments. 
Admiral Jeremiah made a recent study of our intelligence agencies in the wake of some of these events, and he reported a similar problem. 
Given those facts, Mr. President, it seems clear to me, the cosponsors of this legislation, and 59 Senators, that the time has come to change the policy from wait and see to proceed as soon as technologically possible to deploy a national missile defense system to protect the security interests of the United States and its citizens. There is no higher responsibility that this Government has--no higher responsibility, no priority any greater--than the security of U.S. citizens. We are putting that security at risk, Mr. President, under the current policy. It is as clear as anything can be. 
The time has come today--this morning at 9:45 a.m: to vote to proceed to consider this proposal, which simply calls for the deployment, as soon as technology permits, of a national missile defense system. 
Mr. President, I urge Senators to vote in support of the motion to invoke cloture.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition, reluctantly, to this amendment because I agree very strongly with the fact that customers and residents of an area where a post office facility is located that is considered for relocation, consolidation, or closing, ought to have an opportunity to have a say-so in that process. 
For over a year, our subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the legislation involving the Postal Service, has been working closely with officials at the U.S. Postal Service to try to improve the processes. I can tell you that we have received a lot of cooperation, and I am convinced that we will continue to receive cooperation in improving this process and showing some sensitivity to political concerns and to local interests that are affected by these decisions. 
The Postal Service's continued efforts are appreciated very much by me. I think it would be a mistake for the Senate to legislate a new set of requirements or procedures that the U.S. Postal Service would have to follow. It would have the effect of undoing a lot of the good work that has been done recently when we have tried to work with them on this issue. 
In fact, Postmaster General Henderson has recently placed a moratorium on the closing of small post offices. This is an important issue. I agree with that. It deserves the attention of the Congress. But it is also a complex issue, one that should receive the careful consideration of the legislative committee in the due course of business, not by the adoption of an amendment, with 10 minutes of debate on each side, attached to an appropriations bill. 
This amendment would add a lengthy procedural set of requirements for all facility replacements, relocations, and closings. If a fire destroyed a postal facility, for example, necessary replacement would be delayed, as this new process--if we adopt it--ran its course. For each facility change, the postmasters would have to write to each customer explaining what, why, and when the action was planned. A public hearing would then be required, with testimony received from persons served by the facility. The Service would then have to respond in writing to any proposal of an alternative, giving reasons for rejecting such proposal. And then if one postal customer objects, the proposed action could be appealed to the Postal Rate Commission, causing additional delay. 
The effect of this amendment would be to seriously slow down the facility modernization program of the U.S. Postal Service. The Service has over 35,000 facilities around the country, and 8,000 of these facilities were modernized or improved during the last year. 
The Service has just recently published in the Federal Register new requirements that it is imposing on itself for consultation with local leaders and customers on all facility projects. The projects must be publicized in the local newspaper and a public hearing held to explain the proposal. Additionally, local public officials receive at least a 45-day notice before the Postal Service solicits for a new site. The new processes should provide ample opportunity for public input in a responsible and orderly way. I think they should be given a chance to work. 
I urge Senators to reject this amendment.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think we are at a point now where we can ask the question, What is the will of the Senate? Because that is the question. We have an amendment here that proposes a new program of spending based on an emergency of about one-half billion dollars. I think that is the number. Five-hundred million is the total projected cost of the bill, but it is based on an emergency that is declared in this legislation to exist in agriculture. We understand the President has agreed that there is an emergency, not specifically that this amendment describes that emergency, but that a response should be made by the Government to deal with this problem. 
Now, I know that there are Senators who are wondering, well, what are the criteria? How are farmers going to be declared eligible to participate in payments under this program? There are questions that are very legitimate and, frankly, this legislation does not tell us much about that. It is leaving a lot of discretion in the hands of the Secretary of Agriculture. That is very clear. And this amendment could be subject to the criticism that it is too much, there is too much discretion. I am confident the department would have to issue regulations and describe some program payment benefit scheme that farmers would have to be governed by in terms of applications and eligibility. 
So there are some legitimate questions that can be asked. I am willing to listen to the advice of other Senators and be governed by the will of the Senate on this issue. I do not want to reject this out of hand and say that it is not a good amendment. I think it is based on a legitimate interest in helping deal with very real problems that exist in certain parts of the country, primarily in North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, where half the payments are projected to occur under the amendment, but there are other States as well. We know that Texas, Oklahoma, and Colorado would be eligible. We know that southern-tier States, parts of States in the Southeast, North Carolina, in addition to South Carolina; there are some parts of my State, I am told, that would benefit from the legislation. 
So it is time now in the consideration of this amendment for Senators to take a look at the proposal and come to some consensus on what to do about this. We can accept the amendment on a voice vote, the managers could accept the amendment, if that is the will of the Senate, or if some Senators want to have a record vote on the amendment, we could do that. I had been told earlier that this amendment would probably be subject to a budget point of order in that it would violate the Budget Act. But because of changes the drafters, the authors of the amendment have made within the language, I am advised that the Budget Committee staff director has told us there is no violation of the Budget Act. That could be confirmed by a statement from the chairman of the Budget Committee, and I would like for him to tell us that formally before we make a decision on whether a point of order would be made on the basis of the Budget Act. 
Those are my reactions to the proposal, and I will await other Senators coming to the floor to let us have some suggestions and guidance about how to proceed at this point.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, last night, after we had our last recorded vote, there were two amendments which we discussed and recommended to the Senate that we accept and they were accepted, one of which was offered by the Senators from Florida. Senator Graham offered an amendment, it was cosponsored by Senator Mack, and it dealt with disaster problems that exist in Florida because of the recent wildfires that we are all familiar with because we saw these vividly photographed on television. For days and days, fires raged throughout the State of Florida. As a result of that, the Senators are asking that emergency funds be made available to compensate victims of that disaster who were involved in agriculture. I invite the attention of the Senators to the record of the discussion of that issue last night. 
The proposal was to make available funds from the account that has been described by the Senators from North Dakota. There is no indication right now, from the Department of Agriculture, whether or not the disaster fund that is discretionary with the Secretary has been depleted to the extent that replenishment is necessary in order to compensate the victims in Florida. What I said during the discussion of the amendment involved an assurance that we would receive from the Department of Agriculture and the President a supplemental request for funds to replenish that discretionary disaster fund of the Secretary's, so that appropriate disaster relief could be made available to agriculture producers and others who are eligible for those funds. That satisfied the Senators from Florida, and, on that basis, the amendment was accepted by the Senate. 
I am prepared to make the same suggestion to the Senate on this amendment. There is no question that there are differences, however--one of which is that farm producers would have to show that, out of 3 of the last 5 years, there had been declarations declaring disasters, either by the Secretary of Agriculture or the President, in the areas where eligibility would be considered to have been established. 
At least that is what I understand the amendment provides. 
The point is this: The year is not over. This fiscal year that we are appropriating money for right now begins on October 1. We don't know what the full needs for agriculture producers around the country will be by the time we get to the beginning of the fiscal year. 
I am suggesting that it may be appropriate to take this proposal to conference with the House and await the receipt from the President or the Secretary of Agriculture of specific requests for supplemental funds beyond that requested in the budget that has already been submitted by the administration for next year that they foresee will be needed to replenish the Disaster Assistance Discretionary Fund of the Secretary to compensate disaster victims for their losses. 
There are other programs available to provide benefits, Senators realize. There are crop insurance programs, there are other assistance programs that are authorized in the 1996 farm bill. 
As I understand it, this does not create a new disaster assistance program, and because it doesn't, it is not subject to a budget point of order. 
I am mentioning that idea that I have as an alternative way of considering this and would like to have the benefit of other Senators' thoughts on it, particularly those who chair the legislative committees on the budget and on agriculture legislation. It may be we can work out some way to take this amendment to conference. If that is not possible, then the question will be whether we move to table the amendment and bring this issue up later as a freestanding bill--that is a possibility. This legislative session doesn't end with the passage of this agriculture appropriations bill. There may be other opportunities to assess the disaster situation around the country. 
I thought since the similarity between the amendment offered by the Senator from Florida last night which was accepted by the Senator, and the presentation of the amendment which we have heard now from the Senators from North Dakota were so similar, that it presented us with the same alternative that we exercised last night. 
Let me read what I said on the floor of the Senate last night:  
. . .the Department of Agriculture advises us that they cannot at this time verify whether available disaster money has been depleted. I understand this has been a devastating disaster for Florida and that other areas of the country have also been affected by various disasters. We will work with the administration and the House conferees to address the needs of the areas affected by these recent disasters and to determine whether these needs are being met through available funds. 
It is my hope that the Department of Agriculture and the Office of Management and Budget are assessing the need for additional funding to meet the needs resulting from these most recent disasters and that the President will soon submit to the Congress requests for supplemental funds which are determined to be required. 
I am prepared to suggest to the Senate that on that basis, we take this amendment to conference, but I will not make that suggestion without further discussing my idea with the appropriate legislative committee chairmen.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are now moving toward the point where we are wrapping up the consideration of amendments on the agriculture appropriations bill. A number of Senators have advised the managers that they do not intend to offer amendments that they had originally proposed to the bill. We are encouraged by that, and with some effort I think the Senate can complete action on this bill very soon. We are awaiting the arrival in the Chamber of Senators who have suggested that they will offer amendments. We encourage them to come to the floor, offer those amendments, and let's debate them. If we can agree to them, we will recommend that to the Senate. We appreciate very much the cooperation and assistance of all Senators who have been helpful to us in this effort.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have suggested to the Democratic manager, on the other side, that this amendment ought to be accepted. But I understand that there are some Senators who have objections to certain provisions of the resolution. 
My observation is that at the beginning of the debate on this bill there was a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, which we approved unanimously on a recorded vote, that talked about the plight of agriculture, the problems in production agriculture, the low prices in some commodities, disasters that occurred in some parts of the country. It is a very uneven situation in 
agriculture right now. But the serious problems are serious. There are serious problems that need the immediate attention, as that resolution said, of the Congress and the President. This resolution spells out what some of those specific things are that can be done by the Congress and the President to relieve problems in production agriculture and strengthen our agricultural economy. 
So I applaud the Senator from Iowa for going further than the sense-of-the-Senate resolution in getting into the details of some specific ideas that he has for improving the plight of farmers and those involved in the agriculture sector. I intend to support the resolution. I recommend the Senate approve it. There will be some others who will have other ideas, and they are here on the floor to speak to them, but I suggest to Senators, if you do want to be heard on this resolution, you should come to the floor and express yourself on the resolution, because I expect we will vote on it--whether it is a voice vote or a record vote--and that could occur soon. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I join my friend from Arkansas in thanking the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for his comments today. It is always a pleasure to hear him recount the history of our country. In doing so, I can't help but remember the time and effort and diligence he put to the task of writing the `History of the U.S. Senate,' which we have in our offices and others have had an opportunity to enjoy and appreciate over the last several years. It is one of the remarkable acts of scholarship that has been turned in by a U.S. Senator and probably ranks No. 1 in the list of books written by active Members of the U.S. Senate, 
for all of which I think we owe a deep expression, and sincere expression, of gratitude to the Senator from West Virginia.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this is an interesting part of the President's budget. When we reviewed it, we noticed, first of all, that over $400 million in new user fees were proposed by the President to be assessed on the food and poultry processing plants all around the country to generate money to pay for the inspections that are performed in those plants by Federal employees. This was a proposal for a change in the law and the legislation. 
Our committee, of course, doesn't have jurisdiction to change the law. We simply appropriate the money, consistent with existing law. And so without the jurisdiction to make those changes, our committee could not consider that as a part of our bill. The legislative committees in the House and Senate have not acted on these proposed user fee impositions, and so there are no funds available to be allocated, as the President proposed, to pay for the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture. 
Nonetheless, our committee approved and suggested in our legislation to fund increases in the Food Safety and Inspection Service's account. So our appropriation that is recommended by this committee for Food Safety and Inspection Service activities amounts to $605,149,000, as compared with the administration's request for funding the Food Safety and Inspection Service of $149,566,000. That is more than $350 million in additional funding that this committee has proposed than what the President recommended be appropriated for that activity. 
Now, when you generate that kind of fund in your proposed budget, you have an opportunity to spread those proposed dollars around and spend it elsewhere. That is what the President has done, and that has made up for his so-called Food Safety Initiative--and more. The Food Safety Initiative--so-called `new initiative'--calls for the expenditure of about $100 million in new funding added to a variety of different programs in the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration. 
Our committee is not critical and not, in any way, opposing these increased expenditures in the initiatives that the President has requested. Our budget allocation didn't give us the luxury, though, of an additional $350 million. Our allocation doesn't presume any increase in funding for discretionary programs this year--no increase. We are all operating under the Balanced Budget Act restrictions, under the allocation that is provided to subcommittees like the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. So if we increase something, we have to take the money from other accounts. 
So we did provide not only the full amount needed to continue the inspections of meat and poultry inspectors throughout the country, with no new increase--no new user fees, no new taxes on those plants. But we also provided increases in funding for the Agriculture Research Service, Food Safety Research Program, and for the Food and Nutrition Service, Food Safety Grant Program. These are additions over last year's levels. We were able to find other offsets in the budget to accommodate those increases. 
So I suggest that the committee has been responsive to the need to continue to upgrade the quality and the aggressiveness of our Food Safety Research and Inspection Programs. We think, of course, that there can be more done, it can be a more efficiently operated system. 
For that reason, some of us on the Governmental Affairs Committee are actively participating in the investigation that is chaired by the distinguished Senator from Maine, Senator Collins, who is looking into the issues presented on the imported foods--fruits and vegetables, primarily--that have to be inspected under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration. She has done a wonderful job leading the staff of that committee to try to find out what the options are for improving those activities, making sure that they are doing as good a job as can possibly be done to accommodate the needs resulting from the huge increases in imported foodstuffs that are coming into the country. These are enormous challenges. 
I don't think anybody has the magic solution to the problem. I think on both sides of the aisle we are very interested in solving the problems that are presented. We have heard some very impressive speeches made today on that subject. We can continue to make speeches. But I think we should continue to work together--that is what I suggest we do--with the administration, with the Congress, to try to do the best possible job. 
I think the American people can be reassured that an enormous amount of effort and an enormous amount of money is being invested to achieve that goal. If you add up the total of all of the dollars that are appropriated, we are spending more money to not only inspect the meat and poultry that is being processed in this country, but fruits and vegetables as well. Research and education programs, how to handle foodstuffs, and at the farm on how to produce the foods so they will be free from contamination, an enormous amount of effort is being invested. 
So we hope this amendment can be accepted by the Senate, frankly. Offsets have been identified in a number of areas. We have tried to get the administration's reaction to these offsets. We haven't heard from them on some of them. We have checked with the Congressional Budget Office to see if this amendment violates the Budget Act. We have been assured that it does not. 
So because we are going to have to continue to work to resolve our differences with the House, there may be some adjustments in which the House insists. But we will work very hard to make sure that when we come back from conference to the Senate with our conference report that it will reflect a genuine effort and a sizable investment of discretionary funds in the food safety area, both for the Department of Agriculture's activities and the Food and Drug Administration's activities. 
Mr. President, I know of no other Senators who have requested an opportunity to speak on the amendment. I am prepared to go to a vote and suggest that we agree to the amendment. 
Incidentally, I have been authorized to express the support for that recommendation from the Senator from Arkansas who is the ranking member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee.

We are trying to get in touch with the legislative committee. We understand it is a legislative subject, not appropriations at all. It doesn't ask for spending any more money or any less money, but it imposes a burden on an industry, and we are trying to find out what the implications are. You can offer it.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, in deciding on the offsets for this amendment, one of the offsets for $5 million in savings is from funds that would be used by the Department of Agriculture for information technology. These funds are provided through the Commodity Credit Corporation. I have a letter from the Secretary of Agriculture responding to that offset and suggesting that the Department supports it. I want to be sure that we understand one provision in this letter and its implications. He says: 
The statute of limitations waiver is one of my highest priorities in this legislation, and this amendment and its offset have my support. If enacted, USDA will not seek to restore the computer spending reduction through future appropriations. 
With that understanding, Mr. President, I am able to support the amendment. It has been my intention to assist the author of the amendment in his effort to get this passed in the Senate. 
What it does is to waive, as a legal defense, the statute of limitations that had run on claims that were going to be filed, or that had been filed by certain persons who claim to be the victims of discrimination by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
This amendment does not guarantee that everybody who has a claim on the basis of discrimination is going to win or is going to prevail if the Department decides to resist. It gives the Department, though, an opportunity to negotiate those claims, to make decisions about which ones are meritorious and which ones are not. 
But it does not permit the Department to use as a defense the fact that the statute of limitations has run. It was a peculiar and unique statute of limitations when it was first granted under the authority of previous legislation. It permitted claims to be filed on this basis within a window of opportunity of about 2 years. Most of them fell within this 2-year period. 
Some farmers did not understand that they had to file a claim in writing and go through certain steps in order to keep that statute from running, and so there was a lot of misunderstanding about the fact that this statute had been imposed and limited to the duration within which claims could be filed. 
Some lawsuits have been filed now contesting the statute. This is an effort to say to those claimants that we are not going to let you have your claim fail on the basis of not having complied with that early 2-year statute of limitations. So that is going to be removed. Your claim will be decided now on its merits. And that is up to the Department; and that is up to the claimants. 
That is my understanding of the amendment. I congratulate the Senator for his initiative and his hard work in getting us to this point. We support the amendment and hope the Senate will approve it.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I express my sincere appreciation to all Senators for their assistance and cooperation in the consideration of the agriculture appropriations bill. In particular, I thank my distinguished colleague and good friend from Arkansas, who has served for 20 years as a member of this committee and was helping manage the agricultural appropriations bill for the last time in his Senate career. He has been not only a very good friend but very helpful, thoughtful, intelligent and effective as a Senator in this capacity, helping shape this legislation during the time we have had the opportunity to work together as members of the Appropriations Committee. 
I am going to miss him very much. The Senate is going to miss Dale Bumpers. He is one of the most astute, articulate and effective Senators serving in the Senate today. 
I want Senators to know, too, that at my request, this bill includes a general provision to designate the United States National Rice Germplasm Evaluation and Enhancement Center in Stuttgart, AR, the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center. 
In my judgment, Senator Bumpers is the father of this center. He has helped guide the development of the research there in this important agriculture sector. I think it is very appropriate and I was pleased that the subcommittee included that in our committee print. It was approved by the full committee and is included in the bill that was passed by the Senate. 
Mr. President, I also say that without the wonderful assistance of members of our staff and the other members of our subcommittee, the passage of this bill would not have been possible. 
I particularly praise the hard work and effective work of the chief clerk of our subcommittee, Rebecca Davies. Those who have assisted her have also turned in exemplary performances, and I appreciate very much all of their work. They are: Martha Scott Poindexter, Rachelle Graves, Hunt Shipman, who is a member of my personal staff and legislative assistant for agriculture and other issues, and our summer intern, Haywood Hamilton, from Albin, MS, who we are glad to have with us in our office this summer. 
Those who worked closely with Senator Bumpers on the Democratic side: Galen Fountain, his chief assistant on this subcommittee we have come to know and appreciate over a period of time, and we are grateful for his excellent assistance; Cornelia Teitka, who is a designee allocated to us as a resource from the Department of Agriculture, has been very helpful in the handling of the legislation; Ben Noble and Carole Geagley also have assisted them from Senator Bumpers staff. We thank them all. We appreciate very much everyone's good efforts in the work on this bill.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, at the request of the majority leader, I am pleased to make the following announcement concerning the schedule of the Senate today. 
This morning, the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the agriculture appropriations bill. It is expected that Senator Grassley will offer an amendment which will be considered by the Senate. Following disposition of the Grassley amendment, it is hoped that Members will come to the floor to offer and debate any remaining amendments to the agriculture appropriations bill so that the Senate can complete action on this legislation by early afternoon. 
Following disposition of the appropriations bill, the Senate may resume consideration of the VA-HUD appropriations bill or begin the legislative branch appropriations bill. The Senate may also consider any other legislative or executive items cleared for action. 
Therefore, Senators should expect rollcall votes throughout the day and into the evening during today's session.

Mr. COCHRAN. I say to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, I appreciate very much his going forward and offering this amendment. We have been discussing the amendment and the problems that he identifies as emergency problems because of drought and other problems throughout the agricultural sector. We are very sympathetic to these problems and the need for Congress and the President and the Department of Agriculture to act in a positive way and in an effective way to address these problems and to try to help solve them. 
We have been advised there may be a problem with the Budget Act in getting an amendment, as drafted, approved in the Senate without having the amendment subject to a budget point of order. We have discussed this with the chairman of the Budget Committee. And there are other Senators with whom we have discussed the problem as well. 
There is a lot of concern on both sides of the aisle that we have a bill for agriculture appropriations that takes into account all of the problems we have in the country, and that we respond in a thoughtful way. We are continuing to work on this issue. I want Senators to know that I hope we get it resolved so we can approve an amendment of some kind to provide relief, such as that sought in the amendment of Senator Conrad. 
But while we await further negotiations on this subject, I agree with the Senator that we probably should suggest the absence of a quorum. Some Senators are away from the Capitol right now who want to be involved in this discussion. I expect we will be able to make progress on it in the early part of the afternoon. 
If there are other amendments that can be offered by Senators, we would encourage Senators to come to the floor to offer those amendments. We could set aside this amendment for that purpose to receive other amendments. And some of them may be agreeable. We are willing to work with all Senators. We appreciate the assistance we have had from many today indicating a willingness to reach agreement on proposed changes to the bill. I am hopeful we can complete action on the bill today, and I pledge to Senators that I will work very hard to try to help make that a reality. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am delighted the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, the distinguished Senator from Indiana, has had an opportunity to make the case against this amendment offered by the Democratic leader, by Senator Harkin, and by others. It is just as clear to me as anything can be that the weight of the evidence is against the passage of this amendment by the Senate. 
One other point that I do not think has been made enough is that the purpose of this legislation we are dealing with today is to appropriate money to fund the Department of Agriculture programs, the FDA, and CFTC as well. We are not here to really pass judgment on the legislative authority for the Department's expenditure of money. This amendment, offered by the Democratic leader, purports to and intends to rewrite legislative language that was approved by the Congress in the 1996 farm bill and was signed by the President and implemented through regulations and administrative actions by this administration. 
Our committee has the responsibility of determining how much money is needed to carry out that farm bill and what authorities we have in law to spend the funds that have been allocated to our subcommittee under the budget. So our responsibilities are really limited by law. If we decided to start rewriting provisions of the farm bill of 1996, that would be a never-ending ordeal for the Senate to put itself through. For that reason, the Senate ought to reject this first amendment that seeks to start that process. This is the first amendment offered to this bill that seeks to rewrite legislative authority of the Department of Agriculture to administer a farm program. If we start down this road this morning on this amendment, it may never end. 
Think about this. When we were writing the farm bill of 1996, we had the best information, advice, and counsel from experts on agriculture programs at our hearings in the Committee on Agriculture. The House went through the same exercise. The administration was actively involved. There was give and take. There was compromise. But, in the end, we developed a consensus of what ought to be done to put our country on a firm footing of legal authority for programs that would support agriculture. So the end product was the 1996 farm bill. If we start trying to undo it and rewrite it piecemeal, section by section, we are going to have the biggest mess on our hands you could ever dream of. 
So the Senate ought today to vote for the motion to table, which I will make in due course, when time has expired or when all time is yielded back on this amendment. I hope the Senate will reject this amendment.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are getting to the point where I think the Senate should seriously consider preparing for a vote on a motion to table this amendment. I know the time continues to exist on both sides, but I am hopeful we can yield back whatever time has not been used as soon as everybody who wants to talk has had a chance to talk. 
We don't want to cut anybody off. I am not going to do that. I am just expressing the hope that if everybody has had their say on this amendment, and we have had arguments on both sides--we had a very strong, convincing argument by the distinguished Senator from Indiana, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee; we have had discussions on the Democratic side by four Senators that I recall speaking in support of the amendment; Senator Daschle talked in support of the amendment yesterday when he offered the amendment--so I am hopeful that those who want to speak will come to the floor and speak on this amendment and then we will have a motion to table and a vote. 
I think the time expires sometime a little after 2 o'clock. We had 3 hours on the amendment. That is just a request. I hope Senators will respond to that request so we can make progress to complete action on this bill today.

With the authority of the majority leader and with the permission and consent of the minority leader, I ask unanimous consent that during the consideration of the agriculture appropriations bill, the following be the only first-degree amendments in order, subject to relevant second-degree amendments, and following the disposition of the amendments, the bill be advanced to third reading and the Senate proceed immediately to Calendar No. 430, the House companion bill. 
I further ask that all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of the Senate bill as amended be inserted, the bill be advanced to third reading and passage occur, all without intervening action or debate. 
Finally, I ask that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, and the Senate bill be placed back on the calendar.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think it is very clear from the unanimous vote we had on the resolution with which we started the debate on this legislation that all Senators agree our agriculture sector is under tremendous pressure and the Congress and the President ought to take immediate action to respond to these needs in the agriculture sector because of low prices in some areas, because of adverse weather conditions in other areas, because of a decline in demand resulting from the Asian economic crisis. Some of our strongest customers and markets are in that area of the world. 
So I think we have all gone on record as agreeing we need to use our best efforts, we need to mobilize our agencies of Government to take on the responsibility of helping to develop access to new markets, to try to help expand old markets so that we can sell what we are producing and create a better prospect for profit in agriculture in the production sector. 
So I don't think we have seen a situation in the last several years when there was any more reason to have a Market Access Program and to invest in an effort to expand these markets and make them more accessible to U.S. agriculture exports. 
The purpose of the Market Access Program, which we began in 1985, was to help expand foreign markets. Since then, agriculture exports have doubled. Last year, agriculture exports amounted to $57.3 billion, which resulted in a $21.5 billion agriculture trade surplus, providing jobs for approximately 1 million Americans. 
When we had our hearings in our agriculture appropriations subcommittee this year, we had representatives from the administration before our committee talking about the Foreign Agricultural Service programs. I am going to read the Senate something from the statement of one of those officials. 
He said: 
The outlook for U.S. agricultural exports is heavily influenced by competitive pressures that differ by commodity and can affect price and/or quantity of sales. One of the primary sources of this pressure is the rising value of the U.S. dollar, especially against the currencies of our major competitors. This has the effect of making U.S. exports more expensive to our customers relative to those of our competitors. 
Then there is a discussion in another part of this witness' statement about what some of the competitors are doing to try to enlarge their share of the world market for their products: 
We continue to face stiff competition in markets around the globe. Our annual review of the export promotion activities of the two countries that account for our major competition found that, just like the United States, many of our competitors have ambitious export goals. The EU and other countries assist their producers and small businesses to develop foreign markets through activities similar to our Market Access Program and Foreign Market Development Program. 
He goes on to say that in the EU countries, it is estimated that $400 million in 1995 and 1996 would be spent for market promotion: 
In Australia, Canada and New Zealand, those governments have strong governmental promotion agencies and rely heavily on their statutory marketing boards to carry out market development activities for producers of specific agricultural products. 
With this information and with the understanding of the success of many of these countries that are competing with us for market access and market goals, it would be the height of folly, in my judgment, to abandon one of the most successful programs that we have had to assist our agriculture producers in finding new markets and expanding those markets. We have had almost every year since I have been managing this agriculture appropriations bill an effort to either reduce the amount of money we were spending on market access promotion or to eliminate the program entirely. 
In the writing of the 1996 farm bill to try to deal with some of the criticism that had been directed toward this program, it was reformed and changed so that this year for the first time only small businesses and farm cooperatives will be eligible to have the benefits of this Market Access Program. 
There had been criticism that only the big, wealthy companies were benefiting, only brand names were being advertised. It was a way for big companies to avoid having to pay their own advertising costs. 
Let me explain that. Because of the reforms that have been made and the experiences that many have had in the program, the evidence is very compelling that this program has been working by attracting attention to the fact that American-made products do have high quality. Not only the raw agriculture commodities that are sold, but those that are processed and manufactured--some of those qualify and are eligible for participation in this program. Let me just give one example.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I know of no other Senators who want to debate this amendment. 
Let me just state for the information of all Senators the plan, as I understand it, that most who are involved have agreed upon, and that is to have a vote on a motion to table the Lugar amendment, which will be made by Senator Stevens at 6 o'clock, and following that, a vote on a motion to table the Bryan amendment, which I intend to make. We will have the yeas and nays on both of those amendments. 
It is the suggestion of the managers that if the Lugar amendment is not tabled, that that be the pending business following the vote on the motion to table the Bryan amendment. I don't want to speculate on how the vote on the motion to table the Bryan amendment will come out. The last time we voted, it was 59 to 40 in favor of tabling the amendment. That vote occurred on July 23, 1997, and it was an amendment to reduce the Market Access Program by $20 million. The vote No. was 199. 
So I am making that as an announcement to the Senate. If anyone has any comments to the contrary or observations to make about it, we will be glad to consider those comments and observations.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator will yield, it is our hope, given the fact that only one amendment really has been debated--and that is the Dodd amendment up to the point of 8:45 under the order--that a vote will occur on a motion to table the Dodd amendment, which will be made by the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee. That will take with it, if it is agreed to, the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas in the second degree. Then, that would be the only vote ordered to occur right now. We still have four other amendments that have been cited as in order to come up tonight: The Torricelli amendment, the Johnson amendment, the Graham amendment, and the Kerrey amendment. If the Dodd amendment is tabled, there won't be a need for the Torricelli amendment, as I understand it, and that would be withdrawn. 
Then we think we can work out an agreement to accept the Johnson amendment, which is the third amendment, and the Graham amendment on disaster assistance. But we would have to have a vote on the Kerrey amendment. That could occur tonight, or tomorrow, whatever the pleasure of the leadership is.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, with some reluctance, I oppose the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Nebraska. I do so because the industry is not for this amendment. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association has written a letter in opposition to the amendment. And just one word of that letter says the following. They refer to the Daschle amendment. This is the same amendment dealing with mandatory live cattle price reporting: 
These amendments are not fair and equitable to beef producers, and many of these provisions are counter to our producers' policies.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the American Meat Institute points out in a letter to me that this amendment is not a good idea in a free economy, and you don't need a pilot program to learn that. It does not add information so much as it burdens industry and compromises legitimate business interests. 
In the Department of Agriculture, there is opposition to the amendment. They say that it reports already 75 percent or more of the 40 to 50 percent of boxed beef sales that comply with the reporting criteria. The Department estimates that more than two-thirds of the live negotiated cattle sales are reported. 
I might conclude by pointing out that no other segment of agriculture has to undergo mandatory reporting of all private business transactions. This S8231pilot program will only add more burden on the industry and it compromises legitimate business interests. 
I suggest that the amendment should be defeated.

I understand this has been a devastating disaster for Florida and that other areas of the country have also been affected by various disasters. We will work with the administration and the House conferees to address the needs of the areas affected by these recent disasters and to determine whether these needs are being met through available funds. 
It is my hope that the Department of Agriculture and the Office of Management and Budget are assessing the need for additional funding to meet the needs resulting from these most recent disasters and that the President will soon submit to the Congress requests for supplemental funds which are determined to be required.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the pending amendment is the resolution that was offered by the Democratic leader and others which is a recitation of some of the challenges and problems that face those who are involved in production agriculture throughout America. Several Senators have taken the floor to point out some specifics that back up the suggestion made in this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. 
Other Senators have added their comments in the form of other resolutions. We have already adopted on a voice vote a resolution offered by the Senator from Texas dealing with the problems of the drought that is confronting agriculture producers in that State. 
We have another amendment that has been brought to my attention that will be offered by the Senator from Florida, maybe both Senators from Florida, on the subject of the problems of agriculture that have been caused by the wildfires and the other disasters that have occurred in that State. 
So it is no secret that we have plenty of problems out there. There may be disagreements on exactly how to approach the difficulties. They are not all the same. Some are weather related; some are not. Some have to do with market conditions in various parts of the world. So it is a complex and wide range of problems facing the Senate. We are being put to the test today, to come to some decision on these issues. 
I encourage Senators who have comments to make on this subject to come to the floor and express their views. This is a good time to do that. At some point, we will have to either agree to this amendment or consider an amendment to it and move on to other issues. 
So any Senators who would like to comment on that at this point, I encourage them to do so. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I listened very carefully to the excellent remarks of the distinguished Senator from Kansas. I think he put in perspective the challenges that face American agriculture, particularly out in the northern plains. But he also, I think, put in proper perspective the legislative history and the effort that was made, on a bipartisan basis, and with the approval of this President, to authorize farm programs that meet the modern needs of farmers, do not solve all the problems, but within the context of Federal legislation give farmers an opportunity to operate their farms in the context of a global economy, within the limits of the Federal budget that has been constrained in recent years, and with a predictability about the future, with rights of flexibility, with rights of choice on the part of farmers as to what they plan and how they manage their farm operation. 
The distinguished Senator has been a very important leader in agriculture and I think, in listening to his remarks, it is clear to all of us why he has been chosen and why his advice is so often taken here in the U.S. Senate and when he was chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, and why he has been such an effective leader throughout the country on agriculture issues. It also shows us that we are in a situation now where we have to make a choice. 
We have before us a resolution offered by Senators Harkin and Daschle stating the problems in some sectors of the country in agriculture and calling on the Congress and the President to take action in response to these problems. I support the general tone and the general sense that is contained in that resolution, and I hope the Senate will work its will soon and adopt this resolution. If it has to be modified, let's modify it and then move on to specific amendments. We have a list of amendments. 
As we started the consideration of this bill, which we had been advised Senators wanted the Senate to consider, there were about 50 amendments. We have worked our way down to a point now where it is a little less than 40. We have sent out hotline requests to Senators' offices to let us know what their intentions are in terms of specific amendments. Give us the benefit of the suggestions. Let us look at them. Senator Bumpers and I will try to accommodate Senators' requests where we can, and get the reaction of the administration to other suggestions Senators make for amendments and work our way through those amendments to final passage of the bill. We would like to get that done tonight if we could. It is probably not realistic to expect to complete action within the next 2 hours. But I would like to do that. Then we could turn to other appropriations bills tomorrow. 
The majority leader has already indicated that we will not be in late tonight. Certainly we ought to be able to finish this bill at least at an early hour tomorrow. But to accommodate the requests and the interests that we all have in moving along expeditiously on the passage of appropriations bills, we need to have the cooperation of Senators. The first order of business is to deal with this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. 
I have suggested to some Senators on this side of the aisle that if they have suggestions for changes in that resolution, let us know about it, and we will take them up with the authors of the resolution and see if we can pass that resolution within the next several minutes. I hope we can do that.

His comments to the Senate are very helpful as we put in perspective what our challenge is and what our options are for responding to these very real problems in agriculture.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join the distinguished Senator from Arkansas in cosponsoring this amendment. He has identified the problem. It really ought to be labeled the `truth in budgeting amendment,' because it requires the administration now to acknowledge when a proposal is made for user fees to be approved by Congress. In the absence of such approval by the legislative committee, in the legislative process a submission has to then show how much money should be appropriated from the Treasury through the appropriations process, 
not to continue to assume that there is this pot of money there that has been generated by the enactment of user fees. I think this will help everybody understand the process better. And we certainly welcome this change in the law as proposed by the distinguished Senator from Arkansas. 
We know of no objection to the amendment on this side. We urge that it be approved by the Senate.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to vote against the motion made by the Democratic leader to waive the Budget Act. This is an amendment that is almost the biggest program in the entire bill that is contained in the agricultural appropriations bill that is before the Senate. We don't have the authority as an Appropriations Committee to write the legislative language to create a program of this kind, and that is what the Democratic leader and his cosponsors on his side of the aisle seek to do. 
There is funding in the bill, Senators should know, for the Food and Drug Administration's program targeted to dealing with the problem of underage smoking. Mr. President, $34 million is appropriated in the bill for the FDA's program to deal with that, and that is consistent with the existing legal authority which this committee has to operate under and respect. 
Supporting the Budget Committee chairman's appeal to the Senate, I urge Senators to vote `no' on the motion to waive.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think it is a good idea that at the beginning of this debate on agriculture appropriations we acknowledge there are some serious problems in the agriculture sector of our economy. There is no quarrel with that, and on both sides of the aisle I think Senators are prepared to acknowledge that we have an obligation to understand this fully and to do what we can within the constraints of the Budget Act and the constraints of the law. We appropriate funds to make sure that the Department of Agriculture has the resources to take all appropriate action to help deal with these problems. 
We realized when we began work on the agriculture appropriations bill that we did not have enough money to do everything we would like to do for rural development, for nutrition assistance, for agriculture research, for export promotion, and the wide range of activities that go into the programs administered by the Department of Agriculture and the related agencies that are funded in this bill. 
It is a bill that was fully supported by Members on both sides of our subcommittee and in the full Committee on Appropriations. We didn't have a dissenting vote anywhere along the way for the appropriations bill that we brought to the floor and that is pending before the Senate right now. We have tried to make sure that every possible effort is made, as we deal with the question of how much money to put in one account or the other, to do the best possible job that we could, and I think this bill is going to pass that test. 
We were glad to have the strong and helpful support of the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers, who is the senior Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee for the 
Department of Agriculture, and other Senators who worked with us as well. This sense-of-the-Senate resolution, if Senators will notice, outlines a number of things that are suggested for changes in either current law or the efforts that the administration could take to help deal with this problem which the distinguished Democratic leader outlined. 
It may very well be that we can make some changes to this and have a bipartisan sense-of-the-Senate resolution. That would be my hope, and I suggest to Senators that we make that effort. 
Since we have just seen this proposed resolution, I am hopeful that we can set it aside, take some time with those who are interested in helping make sure that we do accurately state the problem and the observations that the Senate has as a collective body of Republicans and Democrats in dealing with the problems, and can pass it without any objection on either side. That would be my hope, and that is what I intend to suggest the Senate do. 
We have some other amendments that we are going to have to offer. Many of these amendments are proposed by Senators who are not members of the Appropriations Committee, but we have now had an opportunity to review them and we are prepared to recommend that a number of amendments be accepted. 
The distinguished Democratic leader indicated that he would have no objection in setting aside this amendment if we wanted to go to other amendments, and so at this point I am going to ask unanimous consent that the pending sense-of-the-Senate resolution be set aside and I be permitted to send an amendment to the desk on the subject of crop insurance.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the clerk withhold reporting of the amendment. I have been advised, contrary to my understanding with the Democratic leader, there are some Democrats who could not agree that that amendment be set aside now. So I do not insist that the amendment be reported. Let me state what this amendment will do when it is offered. 
This is an amendment that increases appropriations in the bill for the Agricultural Research Service and the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service to fund additional agriculture research activities. 
It also increases the total appropriations for the Rural Community Advancement Program and earmarks funding for a community improvement project in Arkansas. 
It also adds a general provision to the bill to eliminate for fiscal year 1999 the surcharge on the administrative fee in excess of $50 per crop per county authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Protection Act. 
The proposed changes will also place some enrollment limitations on the Wetlands Reserve Program. The amendment is designed to make available to the Crop Insurance Program additional funds that were contemplated by the agriculture research bill that was passed by the Senate and signed by the President earlier this year. It is that legislation that we are suggesting be attached to this legislation to help carry out the provisions in the law that we now have had enacted as a result of the bipartisan effort in the Agriculture Committees of both the Senate and the House. 
It is that amendment that we would like to propose to the Senate while we work on reaching an accommodation with Senators on both sides of the aisle on the sense-of-the-Senate resolution with respect to the problems in the agriculture sector of our economy.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment increases appropriations in the bill for the Agricultural Research Service and the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service to fund additional agricultural research activities. Specifically, the amendment provides an additional $300,000 to increase scientific staffing at the Cropping Systems Center at the New England Plant, Soil, and Water Laboratory in Orono, Maine, to develop production and disease management systems. This research will increase potato production efficiency, viability of small farms and enhance water quality in the Northeast Region. 
It increases the total funding provided in the bill for special research grants funded through the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service by $1,300,000 to fund the following new research grants at the levels specified: 
Chesapeake Bay agroecology (Maryland) 
 $300,000 
Designing Food for Health (Texas) 
 $250,000 
Infectious disease research (Colorado) 
 $250,000 
Scallops Research (Connecticut) 
 $250,000 
Urban aquaculture (Massachusetts) 
 $250,000 
The amendment also increases the appropriation for the Rural Community Advancement Program by $3,400,000 and earmarks funding for a community improvement project in Eastern Arkansas. 
Finally, the amendment adds a general provision to the bill to eliminate for fiscal year 1999 the surcharge on the administrative fee in excess of $50 per crop per county authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Protection Act. 
The additional costs of the changes proposed by this amendment are fully offset by a further restriction on new acreage enrollments in the Wetlands Reserve Program for fiscal year 1999. This proposed change would place a 120,000 acre limitation on new acreage enrollments versus the 140,000 limitation currently recommended in the bill. 
I ask that this amendment be favorably considered by my colleagues. 
Let me say by way of further explanation, in describing the amendment, the reason we have to make this change in the Crop Insurance Program is that we wanted to remove a 10-percent surcharge on the administrative fee imposed by the Agriculture Research Extension and Education Reform Act. That was the bill that we had earlier passed which provides a lot of new, mandated expenditures for agriculture research. This surcharge, that I have referred to, would require farmers to pay as much as a 400-percent increase above the 1998 administrative fee. This is not a minimal administrative fee as farmers had been promised. 
So this amendment will remove the surcharge, and that is the purpose of getting this amendment offered at this early stage in the bill, so there will not be any question about whether or not there will be an opportunity for participation by farmers in the Crop Insurance Program because of these prohibitive costs. We think this is an important change to be made in that law and will help provide the opportunity to deal with disaster assistance under the Crop Insurance Program. 
My understanding is that this amendment has been cleared on both sides. I will defer to my friend from Arkansas for any comments he would like to make on this amendment.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment, as I stated, is designed to eliminate the subsidy appropriation for Farm Service Agency credit sales of acquired property and transfer this amount to subsidize the cost of additional farm ownership direct loans. 
The amendment increases the subsidy appropriation for farm ownership direct loans by $3,260,000 to fund an additional $21,777,000 in loans. This will fund an estimated total farm ownership direct loan level of $85,649,000 for fiscal year 1999 versus the $63,872,000 level now proposed by the bill. 
I have been advised by the Department of Agriculture that the Farm Service Agency credit sales loan obligations are currently lower than anticipated and the full amount requested for fiscal year 1999 will not be required. Any funding needed for credit sales of acquired property for fiscal year 1999 can be made available through the agency's loan programs. Given this, the amendment proposes to move this money to increase available funding for farm ownership direct loans.

Mr. COCHRAN. There has been some misunderstanding, I think, in conversations I have had with fellow Senators about this amendment. What it does not purport to do is to tell the States how to certify or what criteria to use in the certification process for secondary school teachers. This amendment is directed to the universities and the colleges that have departments of education and that grant degrees in education, and it seeks to insist that as a part of the education of secondary school teachers there be a requirement that there is a subject matter major included as part of the learning experience for these teacher candidates. So it doesn't purport to set out new rules to impose on States in the certification process. 
That is another subject, and we could talk about that in a separate debate. But this subject talks about what kind of quality learning experience do we want our secondary school teachers to have. Some can go through the education departments in colleges and universities--at least in 18 States, or 16 States. Thirty-two require that there be subject matter majors of education degree candidates. But the other States, you can go through an education department learning experience and get a degree and then be a candidate for certification and teach in the secondary schools of the State without ever having a major field of study in an academic subject like English or history or math or science. 
It seems to me that it makes eminently good sense to suggest as a matter of national policy that our education schools throughout the country insist upon an academic major for the graduates in the education schools. And that is all this amendment does. 
The Senator from New Mexico talked about a number of other subjects that he thought ought to be considered by State governments, and they deal in large part with certification items. But the committee has already sorted through those suggestions. They have included some in the managers' package before the Senate, and they have not included some. But this is a very narrow amendment. 
Of all the suggestions my friend from New Mexico makes, this one, to me, is one that ought to be approved by the Senate without any question whatsoever. It is certain that those who teach in the high schools of our country ought to be well versed, well grounded in some academic subjects, not just in teaching methods or teaching techniques or other courses--the relationship of the school with the community. 
We have all, in our common experience, had knowledge of the courses that are taught in many of the education schools. Many of them are important, and they are valuable. But we do not want teachers coming through those colleges and universities with only courses in method and technique and the relationship of the school to the community and the other subjects that they are taught in the education departments. And we are not being critical. I am certainly not. My State of Mississippi, I am glad to see, is one of the 32 States where the academic major is required of teacher candidates who are graduating from the departments of education in our college and university system. 
So I hope Senators will look at this amendment carefully and support it. To me, it is a very important step in the right direction of improving the overall quality of all of our teachers in secondary schools throughout the country.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to present for the Senate's consideration S. 2159, the Fiscal Year 1999 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. This bill provides fiscal year 1999 funding for all programs and activities of the United States Department of Agriculture--with the exception of the Forest Service--the Food and Drug Administration, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and expenses and payments of the farm credit system. 
As reported, the bill recommends total new budget authority for fiscal year 1999 of $56.8 billion. This is $7.0 billion more than the fiscal year 1998 enacted level, and $740 million less than the President's fiscal year 1999 budget request. 
Changes in mandatory funding requirements account for the overall increase from the fiscal year 1998 enacted level, principally reflecting lower estimated Food Stamp and higher Child Nutrition program expenses, along with a $7.6 billion increase in the required payment to reimburse the Commodity Credit Corporation for net realized losses. 
Including Congressional budget scorekeeping adjustments and prior-year spending actions, this bill recommends total discretionary spending of $13.715 billion in budget authority and $14.080 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1999. These amounts are consistent with the Subcommittee's discretionary spending allocations. 
Let me take a few minutes first to summarize the bill's major funding recommendations. 
For the Food Safety and Inspection Service, appropriations of $605 million are recommended, $16 million more than the fiscal year 1998 level. These additional funds are necessary to maintain the current inspection system and to continue to implement the Hazardous Analysis and Critical Control Point meat and poultry inspection system. 
For farm credit programs, the bill funds an estimated $2.4 billion total loan program level, including $489 million for farm ownership loans and $1.8 billion for farm operating loans. 
Total funding of $922 million is recommended for the Farm Service Agency, $11 million more than the 1998 level. Increased funding is provided to maintain non-Federal staff years at the level requested in the budget, preventing reductions beyond those already planned. 
For agriculture research, education, and extension activities, the bill provides total appropriations of $1.7 billion. Included in this amount is a reduction from fiscal year 1998 of $35.2 million for Agricultural Research Service buildings and facilities, a $24 million increase for research activities of the ARS, and a $12 million increase in funding for the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, which includes a 3-percent increase in base formula funds. 
For USDA conservation programs, total funding of $792 million is provided, $5 million more than the 1998 level. This includes $638 million for conservation operations, $101 million for watershed and flood prevention operations, and $34 million for the resource conservation and development program. 
USDA's Foreign Agriculture Service is funded at a level of $136 million. In addition, a total program level of $1.1 billion is recommended for the Public Law 480 program, including $221 million for Title I, $837 million for Title II, and $30 million for Title III of the program. 
The bill also provides a total program level of $2.2 billion for rural economic and community development programs. Included in this amount is $700 million for the Rural Community Advancement Program, an increase of $48 million from the fiscal year 1998 level; and a total $1.5 billion program level for rural electric and telecommunications loans, $92 million more than the 1998 level. 
The Committee has devoted adequate resources to those programs which provide affordable, safe, and decent housing for low-income individuals and families living in rural America. 
Estimated rural housing loan authorizations funded by this bill total $4.3 billion, a $65 million increase from the fiscal year 1998 appropriations level. Included in this amount is $1.0 billion in section 502 low-income housing direct loans and $129 million in section 515 rental housing loans. 
In addition, $583 million is recommended for the rental assistance program. This is the same as the budget request level and $42 million more than the 1998 appropriation. 
Over 65 percent of the bill's total funding, $37 billion, is provided for USDA's domestic food assistance programs. This includes $9.2 billion for child nutrition programs; $3.9 billion for WIC, including $15 million for the farmers' market nutrition program; $141 million for commodity assistance; and $23.8 billion for the food stamp program. 
For those independent agencies funded by the bill, the Committee provides total appropriations of $1.0 billion. Included in this amount is $61 million for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and $953 million for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Total appropriations recommended for the FDA are $27 million more than the 1998 level, reflecting the full increase requested in the budget for FDA rental payments and an additional $4 million more than the request level for buildings and facilities. In addition, the bill makes available $132 million in Prescription Drug User Fee Act collections, $15 million more than the fiscal year 1998 level. 
I would like to point out to my colleagues that the discretionary spending allocations for this bill are approximately $200 million in budget authority and outlays below a freeze at the 1998 levels. To provide the selected increases I just cited and to maintain funding for essential farm, housing, and rural development programs, several mandatory funding restrictions are included in the bill. Modest limitations are imposed on Food Stamp program commodity purchases and on acreage enrollments in the Wetlands Reserve Program, and restrictions are imposed on fiscal year 1999 funding for the Conservation Farm Option Program and the Fund for Rural America. 
In the case of the Fund for Rural America, it was a choice between providing adequate appropriations for research and rural development--the increases in funding recommended for agriculture research and rural development, including $48 million for the Rural Community Advancement program and $24 million for ARS research--or allowing the Administration to decide how to spend funds for selected rural development and agriculture research purposes. 
I also want to remind my colleagues that the President's budget for programs and activities under this Subcommittee's jurisdiction assumes new user fees will be enacted and generate a net total of over $650 million in collections to offset the discretionary spending increases proposed by the President. While relying on savings from new user fees and other legislative proposals may allow the President to claim discretionary spending levels which conform with those set forth in the bipartisan budget agreement, appropriations cannot be reduced until these legislative proposals are acted on by Congress and enacted into law. 
However, that is not the case and this bill assumes none of the user fee savings proposed in the budget. Consequently, the savings assumed in the President's budget are not available to this Committee to offset the discretionary spending increases and new initiatives proposed by the Administration. Many of these proposals have merit and are ones I might support. However, this Committee must comply with the discretionary spending levels in the Bipartisan Budget Agreement and we have had to make some difficult decisions as a result. We have worked hard to maintain funding for the programs and activities funded by this bill as close to the 1998 program levels as possible, providing increases necessary to maintain essential personnel levels and to meet increased subsidy costs where necessary to sustain 1998 loan levels. 
Also, despite recent reports, food safety continues to be a high priority of this Committee. The bill recommended to the Senate provides the funds necessary to ensure that American consumers continue to have the safest food in the world. This bill makes no reductions in appropriations for USDA and FDA food safety activities. In fact, the bill continues the enhanced levels provided last year for activities defined to be part of the Administration's food safety initiatives. This includes the additional $24 million for FDA food safety initiatives and $9 million for USDA food safety initiatives provided for fiscal year 1998. In addition, the bill includes $3.6 million of the increase requested in the fiscal year 1999 budget for USDA food safety initiatives. Not included in the President's food safety initiatives but equally important to the continued safety of our nation's food supply is based funding for the Food Safety and Inspection Service. This bill provides fiscal year 1999 appropriations of $605 million for the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), $455 million more than the Administration's requested level and $16 million more than the 1998 level. With the appropriations for FSIS inspection activities included, this bill recommends total appropriations of $806.3 million for FDA and USDA food safety activities for fiscal year 1999, as compared to the President's $380.6 million appropriations request. This does not include enhanced funding of $50.7 million for FDA food safety initiatives which the President proposes be funded through new user fees. 
Mr. President, in closing, I remind Senators that this will be the last time that my good friend from Arkansas and the distinguished ranking member of the Subcommittee, Senator Bumpers, will manage this appropriations bill. Senator Bumpers has been a valued member of the Appropriations Committee for the past 20 years and of this Subcommittee for the past thirteen years. The work of the Subcommittee reflects his intimate knowledge of the programs and activities. Senator Bumpers has been an advocate of American agriculture and a proponent of programs to improve the quality of life and help bring jobs to rural areas. His many contributions to this process and this bill will continue on after his retirement from the Senate, but his leadership and participation in the work of the Committee in the future will be missed, particularly by this Senator. 
Included in this bill is a general provision to designate the United States National Rice Germplasm Evaluation and Enhancement Center in Stuttgart, Arkansas, the `Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center.' The Senator from Arkansas has been an effective advocate of agricultural research and is the father of this ARS research center. I believe it is most appropriate to name this facility in his honor. 
Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Bumpers, as well as all other Members of the Subcommittee for their support and cooperation in putting this bill together. 
Mr. President, I believe the bill represents a balanced and responsible set of funding recommendations within the limited resources available to the subcommittee. I ask my colleagues to give it their favorable consideration. 
Mr. President, I urge Senators to notice in our bill some important efforts to contrast the process that we followed to appropriate these funds with the proposal the President made when he submitted his budget request for the Department of Agriculture and related agencies. 
A great deal of attention has been called to the President's request for additional funding of so-called new initiatives in certain areas covered by this bill. To propose these new funding levels, these so-called new initiatives, the President has had to assume that funds would be generated for those purposes by the enactment by the Congress of user fees. These cover Food Safety and Inspection Service activities. They also cover Food and Drug Administration activities. 
The Congress has not enacted these user fees, and there is no expectation that Congress will through the legislative committees that have jurisdiction of these subjects. Therefore, that has led to the appearance that the committee, in its action to bring this bill to the floor, has not appropriated funds that the President has requested for these so-called new initiatives and additional spending programs. 
We have not been able to accommodate the President's request because the allocation of funds to this subcommittee is insufficient to cover both the funding of the programs that we have had to fund in the bill, the continuing programs of research and extension and education which I have described so far, many of which are above the President's requested level, but the additional funds that he presumed would be available to this committee from user fees are not available to the committee, and therefore, for some accounts, it may appear that the committee is not funding those activities at the levels the President promised to secure the funding. 
I think that explanation will serve to alleviate some concerns that I have heard expressed. One was expressed in the meeting of our full committee when this bill was under consideration, that we were going to put in jeopardy in some way, by having the funding levels that we had for food safety, the safety of school lunch food that is consumed by students at school. We have actually increased the programs that help safeguard the food supply well over and above what the President had requested. 
He has suggested that funds be allocated to some so-called new initiatives, but he didn't request that we have inspectors in our poultry and meatpacking plants, as we have to have under current law, to inspect those processes and those plants to be sure that the food is packaged and processed in a way that is safe and will result in wholesome, nutritious food supplies for our country. We funded that. We have actually increased the funding above last year's levels, so that we wouldn't have to close any of these plants or shut them down for any periods of time that would be required if we had not come up with this funding. 
I assure Senators that we have taken great care to make sure that the funds are there for this next fiscal year for these food safety programs, including the so-called HACCP program, the new program that has been under development for the last several years in which this committee has cooperated to fund, so that it can bring to the challenge of food safety the latest in technologies and understanding and information so that we don't have to worry that we are not doing enough to help protect the food that is consumed in the United States. 
I must say, too, that I think our producers and those who work to bring us this food supply have to be given great credit for the success they have had in producing a reasonably priced, wholesome, nutritious food supply for our country and, beyond that, millions and billions of dollars in excess of what we need in our country for export in the world marketplace. 
Senators will also know that one of the areas of emphasis in this legislation is the funding of programs to help make sure that our exporters and our farmers are treated fairly in the international marketplace, that we continue to endeavor to break down barriers to fair trade for American agriculture products. 
This morning, we had an opportunity to meet with representatives of a number of national farm organizations who were here in the Capitol to discuss the problems in certain sectors of agriculture in certain regions of this country. The meeting was actually convened by Senator Conrad Burns of Montana and Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas. The majority leader was President--was present--he may be President, not yet; he may be President later. Senator Dick Lugar, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, was present. 
We had 12 or 14 Senators involved in this meeting to find out what the suggestions were for helping to deal with some of these problems of low prices on the farm in certain areas and in certain commodities, and problems in trade, problems with tax laws that operate to the detriment of many who own and operate our Nation's farms. It was a good meeting. 
I say to Senators that this bill addresses many of the problems that were identified in that meeting this morning. So it is responsive to the concerns that we hear. 
We do need to do a more aggressive job to take up for our Nation's farmers both at home, in terms of regulations and tax policies which make it hard to operate or more expensive, and in terms of trade policies and national initiatives, to be sure that we have an opportunity to sell what we produce in the international marketplace at competitive prices, so there can be profit in agriculture and we can continue to reap the benefit in our country and our economy, in all aspects of our economy that are related and involved with agriculture, of a healthy, vibrant agriculture economy. 
We have all heard how many jobs depend upon our farmers, how many people are in the processing businesses, the value-added processing of food products, the transportation, the inputs that go into the farming operations in every rural community and every State in this great Nation. It is a huge business enterprise. And it deserves the sensitive support of the policymakers in Washington and a department of agriculture that cares when there is a problem on the farm and moves quickly to try to deal with it. 
I think this legislation is consistent with those aims and those goals and those interests that we all have here in the Senate. I am hopeful that Senators will review the bill and give it their full support. And I hope Senators who have suggestions for changes in the bill will come to the floor and present those suggestions, and we will consider them in a very careful and sympathetic way. 
We just as soon there not be any amendments. We think this is a good bill. We hope Senators will agree with us. We do have some committee amendments, and we have recommendations that have been cleared on both sides of the aisle for changes in the bill after the bill was considered in our committee.

Mr. COCHRAN. This is a revised comparative statement of new budget authority which corrects two errors in the `FY 1999 Estimates' column in the same table printed in the committee report that accompanies the bill. 
Mr. President, I must also observe, before yielding the floor, that my good friend from Arkansas, who is the distinguished ranking Democrat on the subcommittee on agriculture appropriations, is helping manage this bill this year, and it will be his last opportunity to exercise this important responsibility. 
He has chosen not to seek reelection in the State of Arkansas for another term in the Senate. And I must say that it pains me to contemplate going through the process of developing and helping to write an agriculture appropriations bill without his intelligent and thoughtful assistance. He has been a good friend to me since I have been in the Senate. We have worked closely together on a number of issues, not only in agriculture, in rural development, but in other areas as well. 
I pointed out earlier in my statement that in recognition of his outstanding service for the people of Arkansas in the U.S. Senate, and particularly for his work on agriculture research issues, there is included in this bill a general provision to designate the U.S. National Rice Germplasm Evaluation and Enhancement Center in Stuttgart, AR, the `Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center.' 
The distinguished Senator from Arkansas has been a very effective advocate of agriculture research funds for this ARS Research Center. I think he is the father of that center. I believe it is most appropriate to name this facility in his honor. 
Also, I want to express my appreciation to him and the members of his staff, and the other members of the subcommittee on both sides of the aisle, for their assistance and support and cooperation in developing this legislation. I hope the Senate will approve it.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is with a feeling of profound sadness that I advise the Senate that former Mississippi Congressman Thomas G. Abernethy died last night in Jackson, MS. He was 95 years of age. He served with great distinction in the U.S. House of Representatives for 30 years, and he was deeply respected as an influential and prominent political leader. 
Tom Abernethy was born in Eupora, MS, on May 16, 1903. He attended the University of Alabama, and the University of Mississippi, and graduated from the Law Department of Cumberland University in Lebanon, TN, in 1924. 
He was elected mayor of Eupora, MS, in 1927, and in 1929 he moved to Okolona. He continued to practice law there and was elected district attorney in 1936. He was elected to Congress in 1942. 
Tom Abernethy became a close friend and an adviser to me. I sought his advice on matters involving agriculture, the Natchez Trace Parkway, and many other issues of importance to me and to our State. I always found his advice and counsel very valuable and helpful. 
I extend to his children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren my sincerest condolences.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, often we rise on the floor of the Senate to pay tribute to a former Member of Congress or former Member of the U.S. Senate who has passed away, talking about their career and their contributions to our country. 
Today I rise to pay tribute to a former Member of Congress from my State of Mississippi who will reach his 95th birthday on Saturday. Thomas Gerstle Abernethy is the last surviving member of our State's delegation of his generation that was very distinguished, indeed, and included in the House of Representatives: Jamie Whitten, Frank Smith, Arthur Winstead, John Bell Williams, and Bill Colmer. In the Senate at that time, Jim Eastland and John Stennis represented our State. 
For 30 years, Thomas Abernethy was viewed as a prominent and influential Member of Congress from our State, and indeed he was. He was a member of the Agriculture Committee. He was not reticent or bashful in any way. He often spoke on the floor of the House on a wide and varied range of subjects, with intelligence, energy, and in a conscientious way to serve the interests of our State. He truly was an influence in national affairs in the Congress. 
He was born in Eupora, MS, on May 16, 1903. He attended the University of Alabama and the University of Mississippi and graduated from the Law Department of Cumberland University in Lebanon, TN, in 1924. He was admitted to practice law in the State of Mississippi that same year and began practice in his hometown of Eupora in 1925. He was elected mayor of Eupora in 1927. Then in 1929 he moved to Okolona, MS. He continued to practice law there, was elected district attorney, the prosecuting attorney for several counties in that part of the 
State of Mississippi, in 1936. He served until he was elected to Congress in 1942. That was the 78th Congress that convened on January 3, 1943, a turbulent time in the history of our country. For three decades, until his retirement in 1973, Thomas Abernethy served with distinction as a member of our House delegation. 
One of the highlights of his career politically came very soon after he was elected to Congress. Our State, during the census of 1950, was reapportioned and lost a Member of Congress. He was put in a congressional district by the State legislature's reapportionment plan, with one of the most senior and best known members of the State's delegation at that time, John Rankin. Many expected that John Rankin would defeat Tom Abernethy in the Democratic primary in 1952. But as it turned out, Tom Abernethy won that race and he served for 20 more years as a member of our House delegation. 
He retired the same year that I was elected to the House with two other new Members of our House delegation--David Bowen, who replaced Tom Abernethy; and Trent Lott, who replaced the retiring Bill Colmer. 
Interestingly enough, Tom Abernethy became a close friend and advisor to me. I sought his advice on matters involving agriculture, the Natchez Trace Parkway, and other issues of importance to me and to our State. I always found his advice and counsel very valuable and helpful. 
When I became a candidate in 1978 for the Senate, Tom Abernethy continued to be my friend and advisor, for which I was very grateful. I will always recall accompanying him to his hometown of Okolona during that campaign, meeting with friends of mine and his who had decided to become active in my campaign for the Senate. I could tell that he enjoyed that occasion. I enjoyed it very much too and benefited greatly from his support throughout that campaign. 
Today, I'm pleased to advise the U.S. Senate that Tom Abernethy is going to be celebrating his 95th birthday on Saturday. I encourage those who remember him as I do and appreciate him as I do to wish him well on his birthday on Saturday. I congratulate him for his conscientious and effective service to our State and our Nation as a distinguished Member of Congress and as a wise and valued citizen in his role as a former Member of Congress. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is critically important that the United States be able to protect its troops in the field from ballistic missile attack, and this includes modern ballistic missiles of increasing range and sophistication. To do that, we need both lower tier systems like the Patriot and more capable, upper tier systems like the Theater High Altitude Air Defense, or THAAD, and Navy Theater Wide. 
It is disappointing that the THAAD system has not yet achieved a successful intercept in its test program. Given the program's history of lengthy delays between flight tests, it is unlikely that a sufficient number of tests can be conducted in fiscal year 1999 to enable the program to enter into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development, or EMD, phase. Accordingly, I understand the rationale for the amendment offered today which would remove an additional $250 million from the THAAD Program. While I am disappointed that the program's lack of progress has brought about this decision, I believe the action proposed by the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee to be reasonable. And, along with everyone else, I call on the Government and the contractors supporting the program to do everything they can to ensure future success. 
Let's not forget, however, that we have test programs to find and solve problems. We would move our weapons systems right from the drawing board to the field if we never expected to uncover problems during testing. While we would prefer there to be as few problems as possible, test programs are conducted to wring these problems out of our weapons systems. We should not be too quick to overemphasize the results of any one test. 
The level of scrutiny being applied to the Demonstration and Validation phase of the THAAD Program is higher than that applied to any other program in its Dem-Val phase that I am aware of. In fact, the scrutiny it is undergoing is more like that normally found in the EMD phase of a program. This intense scrutiny will ultimately be beneficial in helping us get this system fielded as soon as the technology is ready. Given the EMD-like scrutiny in the THAAD Dem-Val program, Congress should examine the Department of Defense plans for the structure and length of its EMD program. It is important for this program to be long enough to ensure the THAAD system ultimately produced is the right one, but not so long as to leave U.S. forces vulnerable for a minute longer than technologically necessary. 
The need for missile defense doesn't disappear because of a single flight test. Given the results of the most recent intercept attempt, it is reasonable to delay provision of THAAD EMD funding beyond fiscal year 1999. Additional reductions, however, are not warranted.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the distinguished Senator from Texas for her kind and generous remarks. I agree with her that we need to do everything we can to study the test results, translate that into solving the problems we have in these systems for theater weapons that we have to protect our troops that are already being programmed--there are already deployment decisions that have been made, even though we haven't completed the development and the testing phase. 
I hope we can see some successful tests soon and we urge the contractors and the Department to work as hard as they can to see that is done.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the International Postal Services Act of 1998. This bill would amend section 3621 of title 39 of the U.S. Code, dealing with the authority of the Board of Governors of the U.S. Postal Service to establish rates and classes of postal services, by subjecting international postal services to review by the Postal Rate Commission. 
At present, the Board of Governors' and Postal Rate Commission's authority to collect and review Postal Service data on costs, volumes, and revenues extends only to domestic mail. Therefore, the regulators and Congress, and the public, cannot require data to support statements by the Postal Service that international mail is covering its attributable costs. 
Allegations have been made that the Postal Service uses its revenues from first class mail to subsidize its international postal services. The Postal Service denies this, and reminds its competitors that the Postal Reorganization Act prohibits the Postal Service from using the revenues from one service to reduce the price of another. 
When Congress drafted, and later passed, the postal Reorganization Act of 1970, no specific language was included that would grant the Postal Rate Commission jurisdiction over international postal services--as it was granted for all domestic postal services. I believe this was an oversight by Congress, and I believe it would be best if, for the purposes of establishing classes and rates for mail, international postal services were to be treated the same as domestic postal services are treated. 
I invite Senators to consider this proposal and support this effort to bring harmony to the treatment of international and domestic postal services.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it should be noticed by those who are interested in the subject of missile defense that what we are actually debating and deciding this morning is whether or not the Senate should proceed to consider the bill that has been introduced by me and the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye. 
This bill is not going to be voted on up or down today; what we will have a vote on at 11:30 is whether or not to proceed to 
consider the bill. When the majority leader decided to call up this legislation, there was an objection made to proceeding to consider the bill. So under the procedures of the Senate, the majority leader, who is in charge of making decisions about the schedule of the Senate and how we take up legislation in the Senate, was obligated to file a motion to proceed to consider the bill. That motion is debatable. 
Under notice from the opponents of the bill, it was clear that motion would be debated at length. So to get to the bill, it was decided by the majority leader that a cloture motion should be filed on the motion to proceed, bringing debate on the motion to a close. If we get 60 votes on that cloture motion, then we can proceed to consider the bill and it can be open for amendment, and Senators who have alternative ideas, or think that the current policy is the policy we should have for missile defense, can make those points and the Senate can consider those views. But until this cloture motion is approved, we can't get to that point. We can't get to the point of considering this bill on its merits and considering any amendments which Senators would have. 
So I am trying to put in context what is before the Senate, what the issue is here. The issue this morning is whether or not the Senate thinks this is a matter of such seriousness and consequence to our national security that we ought to consider it, that we ought to debate it, that we ought to let the Senate work its will on a proposal to change our policy with respect to national missile defense. I can't think of a more interesting and serious time, given the events which are occurring in the world today, for the consideration of this issue. It is on everybody's mind, Mr. President, because of the tests which have been undertaken in India of a nuclear warhead. India now announces to the world they are prepared to use this as a part of their nuclear weapons arsenal, that they have it available, and that they are a nuclear weapons state. This is a dramatic change in the situation in India. It is a dramatic change in the security interests of the entire world. 
At this time, we find the United States relying upon a policy with respect to missile defense of developing a national missile defense system in two stages, unlike any other defense acquisition program that we have ever had, or that we now have. We have a technology program--one that is developing the capabilities to have an effective defense system, but we do not have any policy with respect to ever putting that system in the field, or to integrating it into our national defense structure. That decision hasn't been made. We are suggesting in offering this bill that the time has come for the United States to say to the world we are going to develop and deploy a national missile defense system. 
We are going to protect the security interests of the United States and the territory of the United States. As a matter of national policy, the Federal Government is going to obligate itself to undertake to protect the security interests of the citizens of the United States and the United States itself from ballistic missile attack. It seems to me that is an obligation that is very clear for us, in moral terms, as a government. 
With India having a missile capability of a range of about 1,400 miles already, according to recent reports that are available to the Senate, Pakistan having tested for the first time on April 6 a new medium-range missile with a range of 1,500 kilometers, and India announcing that it is concerned that Pakistan is a covert nuclear weapon state, although it hasn't announced that, we are seeing evidence that around the world--in North Korea, in Iran, and, of course, in Russia and China--there are nation states that are developing, or now have, longer range missile capabilities than ever before. Some have the added capability of nuclear weapons and, some have other weapons of mass destruction that can be delivered with those long-range missile systems. And the United States is defenseless against attack from long-range ballistic missiles. 
It has been our policy up until now to have the capacity to destroy any nation that would think about using a nuclear weapon against us. Russia and the United States have had over a period of time this mutual assured destruction relationship: If you destroy me, you can be assured I will destroy you. That confrontation and that balance of power has prevented any use of a missile system or nuclear weapon against the territory of the United States, even though that is not a very happy relationship to have. 
Now, we hope, we are moving toward a better and more stable relationship, but there is still always the chance of an unauthorized launch even from Russia. We are working to destroy and build down the weapons stockpile. That is good. But we are not yet to the point where there is no risk. This is not a risk-free relationship with Russia. There could be an accidental launch. If there is, we have no defense whatsoever. 
With respect to China, it is certainly unlikely that we are going to have any missile attack from there. Nonetheless, there is an emerging long-range missile system capability in China that is growing more sophisticated, that is going to continue to grow and develop more lethality and longer ranges, and it presents a threat--unlikely, but, nonetheless, there could be an unauthorized or accidental launch of a missile from China. 
Already we are seeing the North Koreans developing--and already deploying--some medium-range missile systems. They are now developing, we are told, a missile with a range of 6,000 kilometers. That missile could reach Alaska. It could reach Hawaii. Who knows what their plans are for continuing to develop missiles with increased ranges. 
We found out, through a year-long series of hearings that we conducted last year in our Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services, that it is much easier now than ever before for nation states who want to improve and develop their missile systems, and to give them longer ranges, to do so with the access they have to information from the Internet and to experts in Russia and other nation states where they already have the capabilities. 
Iran provides an example of the surprises we face. One surprise occurred when we found out that Iran had acquired the technology, the components, and the expertise to put together a medium-range missile system. They are in the process of doing that now. One State Department official said that they could have that missile system available by the end of this year. 
Last year, when we had the Director of Central Intelligence before a committee of the Senate talking about the advancements that had been made in Iran, he said that he thought--this is in 1997--that it would be up to 10 years before Iran would have 
medium-range missile system capability. Then he sent word up, that because of new developments and the acquisition of expertise and components from Russia, Iran had made surprising advances and they would have the capability to deploy such a system much sooner. It is because of gaps and uncertainties, he said, that you can't predict when people are going to get these technologies and other equipment from foreign sources, or how quickly they can develop an ICBM threat--you just can't predict that. 
So we have seen in Pakistan now, in India, of course, in China, Russia, in Iran, and in North Korea solid evidence of what we are talking about today. And that is that there is in the world today a real threat to the security of this Nation because of the emerging capabilities and technologies for developing and deploying long-range missiles, that there are available in these countries weapons of mass destruction that can be carried by these missiles over long ranges, and that it is time for the United States to acknowledge this threat and say as a matter of policy that we are going to deploy a national missile defense system. 
That is what this bill says. It doesn't set out what kind of architecture the missile defense system should have or any deadlines for doing it. We would rely upon the orderly processes of authorization and appropriation, as we have for all other defense acquisition programs, to determine how soon it is developed and when it is deployed. But what we are saying today is that, as a matter of policy, we are going to deploy a national missile defense system. 
I think it is also important to notice that this does not require a violation of any existing arms control agreement. In our early discussions of this legislation, we heard others say that this puts in jeopardy the ABM--the antiballistic missile--agreement. It does not. That agreement contemplates that a party to the agreement could have a national missile defense system. It permits a single site for interceptor rockets. We have been proceeding under the current administration plan that this is the kind of a system that would be developed, and eventually, if--under the administration's policy--a threat is perceived to exist, then an effort would be made to deploy the system. 
So the real difference in what we are presenting to the Senate today is that this is a policy that is announced to the world and to rogue states that may be saying, `Look, the United States is defenseless. We have an opportunity to put some pressure on them by developing a missile system that is capable of striking the United States. We can coerce them, intimidate them, and blackmail them because they are not at this point considering deploying a defense against intercontinental ballistic missiles.' We would end that kind of thinking in nations who may be taking that approach by saying, `Yes, we are. You are not going to see the United States any longer taking a wait-and-see approach.' And that is what the administration's policy is--to wait and see if a threat develops. 
We are saying, `Mr. President, you have signed Executive orders over the last 4 years, starting in 1994, saying that the United States is confronted with a national emergency because of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missile systems around the world.' The President has acknowledged that, and he signed Executive orders that say that. But now it is time to say we are going to do something about it, we are going to do something to protect our security interests against this national emergency that exists. Up until now, we have said we will wait and see if there is a real threat. That puts us at risk here in the United States. 
I am saying that we had better get busy. We had better get busy and develop and deploy a system. It would be much better for all of us if we deployed a system that may be a year or two years early getting to the field than waiting until it is a year too late. 
That is the issue and it is important given what is happening in the world today, given the fact that our intelligence agencies were not able to even detect that this test in India was about to take place, given that they weren't able to detect, as far as I know, that Pakistan was going to test, or even had, the new missile they tested in April, and given they weren't able to detect that Iran was going to be able to put together a medium-range ballistic missile within 1 year rather than within as many as 10 years. The latest assessment was as many as 10 years; now it is perhaps within 1 year. 
These are not the only surprises, they are just the most recent ones. Some of us have known about these surprises before now, but now the whole world knows about them. They are acknowledged at the highest levels of our Government. If we can't detect that India is about to test a nuclear warhead, if we can't detect that Pakistan has a missile system that has a range five times greater than what we thought they had, if we can't detect that Iran is developing a medium-range missile with technology and components imported from other countries, and they will be able to put that in the field as many as 9 years earlier than we had thought 1 year ago, then we need to change our policy and quit assuming that we are going to be able to detect the development of an intercontinental ballistic missile system somewhere in the world that can threaten the territory of the United States. 
That is the point of this legislation. We can't be sure. And if we can't be sure that we can detect the threat, we need to be prepared to defend against that threat. The Senate ought to consider this issue, and so today we are going to vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to consider that issue. I urge the Senate to vote to invoke cloture. We don't need to drag out a debate on a motion to proceed to this issue. Sure, there are other things that are on the schedule for today, and the leader has committed to taking up other bills after this vote, but I am optimistic that we will have enough Senators who understand the seriousness of this and the urgency of this for us to turn to the missile defense bill. I hope Senators will consider this, and I am happy to yield to other Senators. 
I know the distinguished Senator from Michigan is in the Chamber. We have had a number of Senators who have asked for time. I hope my friend from Michigan will allow me to yield to the Senator from Oklahoma, who has another commitment at 10 o'clock, for whatever time he may consume between now and 10 o'clock. 
Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, there are two criticisms of this bill that I have heard during the debate from the opponents. The distinguished Senator from Michigan says that the bill should include the words `treaty compliant' and that it is therefore vulnerable to criticism and ought to be rejected. The distinguished Democratic leader says the bill uses the phrase `effective national missile defense system.' He says `effective' is not defined in the bill. 
Well, my suggestion is, if amendments ought to be offered to this bill we should vote for cloture so that we can get to the bill and amendments will be in order. Criticizing the bill because we are not considering amendments at this time is begging the question. The question is, should the Senate turn to the consideration of the American Missile Protection Act? We are suggesting yes. But the Democrats objected. 
It is like when President Clinton, 2 years ago with the authorization bill before the Congress, held the bill up, held it up arguing over missile defense because there was a provision in it that suggested we ought to have a national missile defense, we ought to develop and deploy. They changed the words finally to `develop for deployment,' and then that was taken out of the bill in conference. 
The point is this administration is taking a wait-and-see attitude, wait until there is a threat. The reality is the threat exists now. We need to debate this issue. We need to debate this bill. The Democrat leadership are opposing that. We hope the Senate will vote cloture. Let us proceed to the consideration of the American Missile Protection Act. If Senators have amendments, suggestions, that is when they will be in order. They cannot be considered now until we invoke cloture. I hope the Senate will vote to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to consider the bill.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me say, first of all, that I appreciate very much the majority leader calling up the missile defense bill on yesterday. At his authorization and direction, a cloture motion was filed on the motion to proceed to consider that bill when an objection was raised by the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee and the ranking Democrat, Senator Levin, on the International Security, Proliferation and Federal Services Subcommittee that I chair. 
Last year, we had a series of hearings looking into the growing proliferation problem in the development of weapons of mass destruction and missile systems to deliver those weapons by countries that many in our Nation probably weren't aware were developing the sophistication in long-range missile systems that were being developed. 
I think yesterday the announcement in India of the detonation of a nuclear device as a test confirms once again what a dangerous environment we are in, in terms of proliferation of capabilities, of having nuclear weapons, of having missile systems that can deliver those weapons over a long range. To put that in context yesterday, Pakistan, just a few weeks ago, tested a new missile that our security analysts and our intelligence agencies weren't aware that they had--another example of how we cannot predict with any degree of certainty or accuracy how soon countries are going to develop missile systems, nuclear weapons with the capability of delivering those weapons systems over long ranges. The Pakistani missile that was tested was a 1,500-kilometer range missile--five times greater in capability than a report that was filed by the Defense Department said that Pakistan had in November of 1997. Think about that. 
We get an annual report from the Defense Department using the intelligence capabilities of our CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency--all of the resources that our country has, to put together this report for the Congress. And in November of 1997 they said that Pakistan had in its inventory a 300-kilometer range missile, and then in April they test a 1,500-kilometer range missile. What has happened? They have had assistance from other countries. Some say it was China who provided the technology and wherewithal to come up with this new, longer range missile. Some say it was North Korea. Pakistan says it was developed from within with their own technology, their own scientists. 
Whatever the reason and however this came to be, it is alarming, and now we see India reacting to that new development by testing a nuclear weapon that is twice as powerful as the atomic bomb that was used in World War II by the United States against Japan. 
The point is, this is a very, very dangerous situation that we see developing in that part of the world, but in other countries, too. In Iran. We have seen demonstrated in Iraq the capacity to almost put a satellite in orbit with a missile launch vehicle 10 years ago. That surprised the United States. That surprised our intelligence-gathering agencies. 
I am hopeful that the Senate will notice that the time has come for us to stop playing politics with missile defense and national security and work together in a bipartisan way to develop and deploy, as soon as technology permits, a national missile defense system to protect the security of the United States. 
We will have that vote on cloture, as the majority leader pointed out, on Wednesday--cloture on the motion to proceed to consider the bill, not on the bill itself. It will still be open for amendment. It will still be open for debate by Senators who want to discuss this issue, but I hope the Senate will invoke cloture so that we can proceed to consider the bill, to discuss the issue further, particularly in view of these developing events that confirm what a dangerous proliferation situation we find ourselves in in the world today, and we are defenseless against long-range or intercontinental ballistic missiles.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Lugar from Indiana, and my good friend from Kansas, the distinguished Senator who was formerly chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, in asking the Senate today to support this conference report. 
Senators may remember that when the 1996 farm bill was written, it reauthorized agriculture research programs for only 1 year. There was included in the committee report a suggestion that there be a thorough reevaluation made by the committees of jurisdiction of the way the Department of Agriculture awarded grants to colleges and universities around the country and funded research programs at Agricultural Research Service facilities. That study was undertaken throughout 1997. I think it began in March of last year. The committee held a series of hearings and reviewed suggestions and options for improving these programs. This conference report is the product of that study and that carefully developed improvement to the Agricultural Research Service programs that are funded by the Department of Agriculture. 
I am convinced that we will do a better job under this conference report of identifying the priorities in production agriculture, in food production, and in management of our resources in agriculture than we ever have before under the way we were handling the funding of these programs. 
That is the driving force behind this conference report. The reason it is so important for the Senate to approve this conference report is that it puts this in place now. 
Mr. President, if that were all this legislation accomplished, 
some may say that this legislation is unnecessary, but it does more. It also provides $600 million over the next five years for new competitive agricultural research grants at federal laboratories and colleges and universities. 
Our appropriations process is beginning at this point. We have the job of allocating, under the discretionary funding allocations that our appropriations subcommittee will receive, funds for these agriculture research programs. With the guidance of this legislation, it will be a much more coherent process and an orderly process, and I can't contemplate what a mess we would be in if this conference report were not agreed to. 
Under current law, about $200 million of the delivery expenses for catastrophic crop insurance must be provided annually in the agriculture appropriations bill. This legislation would provide full mandatory funding for those expenses over the next five years. This conversion from discretionary to mandatory spending will ensure that farmers will not have to be concerned with the uncertainty of annual funding bills and whether catastrophic crop insurance protection will be available in the coming growing season. 
In addition to the support this bill has from the agriculture community, it also enjoys support from those interested in the provisions which will bring parity between the Food Stamp Program and the Supplemental Security Income Program for those immigrants legally residing in the United States. This was an important component of the compromise we reached with the House of Representatives.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this legislation was introduced by me and the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, last month. It is legislation that would change the policy of our country with respect to the deployment of a national missile defense system that would protect our Nation against limited ballistic missile attack. Since its introduction, 48 other Senators have joined us as cosponsors of the legislation, and the Senate Armed Services Committee has reviewed the legislation and reported it for the consideration of the Senate. The committee report is available as Calendar Order No. 345, and I invite the attention of Senators to the report. 
The legislation was produced because of the findings of the Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services, which I chair, which conducted hearings over the past year looking into the threat caused by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means for delivering those weapons of mass destruction, particularly missile systems. 
We had numerous expert witnesses who talked about the basics of how missile systems are developed, how the Atlas system was developed in our own country. General Bernard Schriever, who was the manager of the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile program, told of the challenges faced by those who worked to build this first long-range missile system for the United States almost 50 years ago. He told of how, with the passage of time and the development of new technologies and communications systems and the easy access to scientific and technical information, those hurdles that were so difficult to overcome back then are now not difficult at all; that nation states who are intent on developing the capacity to deliver weapons of mass destruction over long distances now can achieve those results not with a 10-year program, but almost overnight if they have the determination, are willing to commit the dollars necessary to acquire the component parts, and have access to outside assistance in the form of either components or technical expertise. 
You can see evidence of that and why that is really a new concern for us as a country without a national missile defense system, without the capacity to defend ourselves against an accidental launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile, or an unauthorized launch from another country possessing these systems, or from a rogue nation which puts all of these ingredients together without our being able to detect it and threatens the security of this country. 
So this is an effort to change our national policy from the current 3+3 program of the administration, which is to develop within 3 years, starting in 1997, a national ballistic missile defense capability, and then, if a threat is perceived to exist thereafter, to deploy such a system within 3 years from the date that the threat is perceived to exist. That is the 3+3 program of this administration. We are seriously concerned that this is inadequate to meet the threat that currently exists. 
First of all, the 3+3 program assumes that there is no threat at this time to the security of the United States or to the citizens of the United States. The legislation we have introduced says that there is a threat, we are vulnerable. There could be--although it might be unlikely--an accidental or unauthorized missile attack from Russia or from China, both of whom, as we know, have intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities right now. 
There is also an emerging threat that exists right now, because of events that have occurred over the last several years that we have not been able to detect or discover through our intelligence gathering agencies. I am going to cite some examples. And I invite the attention of Senators to the bill itself, which recites a series of facts that were uncovered during the course of the hearings our committee conducted last year. 
The case of Iran is a good example. When that country was provided missile components from Russia, we realized that they were capable of acquiring new expertise not discernible by the Central Intelligence Agency. As a matter of fact, during testimony that was provided to the Senate, the Director of Central Intelligence indicated that it was anticipated that Iran would not be able to develop a medium-range missile system for some 8 years or 9 years into the future. 
Now, 1 year after that testimony was delivered to the Senate in 1997, the Director of Central Intelligence suggested that because of outside assistance obtained by Iran from other countries, it appears that they would be able to deploy a medium-range ballistic missile much sooner than had been earlier predicted. Even though the Director of Central Intelligence did not say exactly when that capability could be fielded, a State Department witness told the Senate that, within a year or a year and a half, that missile system could be deployed by Iran. 
So what had been viewed as a threat which could occur 8 or 9 years in the future, now, according to testimony recently received, it is clear it could be fielded some 7 or 8 years earlier than had been anticipated as recently as a year ago. 
Another example is the case of Pakistan, which recently--a month ago, April 6--tested a ballistic missile with a range of 1,500 kilometers. If you look at a report that was made available to the public back in November of 1997 on proliferation issues, it suggests that Pakistan has missiles at this time with ranges of 300 kilometers. Now we see them test a missile last month with five times the range of what was said to be in their arsenal back in November, 6 months ago. 
These are two examples of why the Director of Central Intelligence has said that he is not able to predict with any degree of certainty when other nations, rest-of-world countries, will have intercontinental ballistic missile capability--because of `gaps and uncertainties.' He used that phrase in his testimony to the Senate. 
Another example of these surprises involved Iraq. You will recall that Secretary Cohen, then Senator Bill Cohen, made comments on the floor of the Senate about the surprise that had occurred when Iraq was able to launch a vehicle that almost put a satellite in Earth orbit and--not only that--demonstrate the capability of using missiles with much longer ranges, with much more sophistication than anyone in our country had anticipated. That was an example of a surprise to our intelligence agencies, who had not anticipated that those capabilities had been developed in Iraq. 
Iraq surprised us in other ways. With the purchase of Scud missiles from North Korea and improvements that were made in Iraq, almost overnight the world was confronted with a nation state that had a lethal missile capability; was threatening its neighbors and others; 
was developing weapons of mass destruction which could be carried as warheads by these missiles; was threatening others with destruction, suggesting that if it had a missile system that would reach the United States, it might use it. Actual threats were being made about catastrophic damage being inflicted on the United States by Iraq. 
Fortunately for the defense of our security interests in that region, the Army had been developing the Patriot missile defense system to protect troops in the fields. It was a short-range system; that was really all we had. When the Persian Gulf war broke out, Americans were able to see that this system was effective. It was not the best or the most perfect system you could have because many of the Scud rockets got through. Some of them broke up over Israel. Some of them inflicted property damage all around the region. Twenty-eight soldiers were killed in Dahran. United States troops were killed with those missiles because we were unable to protect their security at that time. We didn't have a system that was good enough to be perfect or fail-safe. There are risks. 
But here we are now almost 10 years later and what have we done to improve the capability to protect the citizens of the United States against threats that we have heard from others--which the bill recites--and against the emerging sophistication and range of new missile systems that are under development in other parts of the world? We have gotten ourselves, I think, in the mindset of thinking about Russia and China as the only nations that we have to worry about who have intercontinental ballistic missile capability. We have had with Russia a relationship that has kept either one of us from using our missile weaponry and we are very grateful for the fact that we have come through this period of confrontation with the old Soviet Union without having a catastrophic tragedy as a result of these weapons of mass destruction. 
But now we can't just focus our attention on Russia and China. We have to consider what is going on in the rest of the world where there are `gaps and uncertainties' in our ability to know exactly what is going on with respect to weapons development and missile development. But what we know is what we have been able to observe. And what we have observed is a steady and in some cases a rapid acceleration of capability and sophistication in countries that do not consider themselves friends of the United States. Some have talked about threatening us with missile attacks, destroying the United States. Other comments have been made by people like Muammar Qadhafi. Others who have expressed their anger toward the United States do not share our values. 
We have to consider this to be a serious threat. The administration's policy is a wait-and-see policy. Let's do research and let's proceed with the development of a missile defense system, but let's wait and see if there is a threat to our security interests posed by intercontinental ballistic missiles, and then we will proceed to deploy the missile defense system. 
You listen to anyone who has observed the funding process, the request for appropriations and authorization to proceed to the development of this program, and everybody agrees that there hasn't been enough money put in the program to reach a point where you will have a system deployment. The administration assumes we will have developed a defensive missile system within 3 years. We are into that now, looking at the second year of that program, and the Secretary of Defense has already sent up a request for additional moneys over and above what the President had said they would want for the program, admitting in a letter he has written in response to this legislation that there had not been robust enough funding to achieve that result. 
I don't think you can find anybody who says that they are really going to complete this. They have now awarded a contract to a lead system integrator to develop a program pulling together all the component parts that had been under separate research and development, to try to make a coherent system that could be 
deployed. But I don't know of anybody who believes that can really be done in 3 years. 
What we are trying to say to the Senate and to the administration with the filing of this bill and calling up this legislation is that we need to get serious. This is a threat which exists now. It is emerging in other nation states--some rogue states--and we are not doing enough to protect the security interests and the safety of American citizens with the current policy. It is immoral to sit back and do nothing or to do no more than talk about it. 
If you look at the executive orders that have been signed by the President over the last 5 years, he has said repeatedly that we are confronted with a national emergency as a result of ballistic missile developments and weapons of mass destruction that we find going on in the world today--a national emergency. 
I wonder what would be the judgment of the historians who would observe us in this situation. We are coming upon the end of a fiscal year where it is projected we will have a budget surplus of $30 billion--some say it may go as high as $50 billion--and we wake up one morning to a ballistic missile threat that is very real, or a ballistic missile attack that is made against our country. The American people are going to say what were we doing. And the administration said we asked for 3 billion dollars in this fiscal year. That doesn't sound much like a national emergency to me. 
What I am beginning to realize is that if you talk like you are concerned about the problem and you sound sincere about wanting to do something about it or solve a problem, that that is enough. You don't really have to deliver. That is the political situation that I think we see today. We are hearing rhetoric, we are hearing promises, we are hearing a plan announced to get us to a point where we will have a ballistic missile defense system, but when you cut through all the talk and all the orders declaring it to be a national emergency, all of the budget requests, all of the testimony before the hearings and you find out what is really going on, you see a program that has already been described as a `rush to failure,' because of the architecture, the way it is constructed, the way the program is managed, all of the reasons that we have seen described in glowing terms by those who say we are doing the right thing, we are doing just enough to keep us on a steady course so we can protect the security of the country. 
I don't believe we are doing enough. I don't believe we are managing the program in a correct way, and I don't think we are going to get to a point where we have the capacity to protect our security or the safety of American citizens at a time when there is a threat that we have to be concerned about. I think we need to be concerned now. That is what this legislation does. 
I hope that Senators will look at our proposal. It says simply that it is the policy of the United States to deploy a system to defend our country against a ballistic missile attack as soon as the technology is available. That is all this bill says. 
The Congressional Budget Office was asked to assess the cost of the legislation. They say that passage of this legislation has no cost impact. The progress of the program to develop and deploy a system would depend upon the annual authorization and appropriations process, like any other acquisition program. And that is the point. This program has not been treated like any other acquisition program, and that is the problem. That is why it is a `rush to failure.' It is a rush to act like you are doing something, but not really accomplishing what you are saying you are setting out to accomplish. You are experimenting. You are conducting some tests on various component parts, whether it is communications, missile systems, guidance systems, the interceptors that are needed, the sensors that are necessary. 
All of those things are being tested. Some are considered successful; some have been considered unsuccessful. We had testimony from General Lyles, who runs the Ballistic Missile Defense Office, who said that they have learned something from all of these tests. To that extent, all of the tests have been successful in that we build on the knowledge gained. Some of the critics who say it is a bad idea to have the capacity to defend our country against ballistic missile attack say that unless you have a perfect test that shows an interceptor hitting an in-coming missile, it is a failure, and it proves that we don't know how to do it. 
Well, look back to 1991, when the Persian Gulf war occurred, when we saw Patriot missiles intercepting Scud rockets. Some of the Patriots were intercepting and blowing the Scuds up, or were near hits. The fact is that some of those interceptor missiles were working even then. We have proven that we can hit a bullet with a bullet. We have the technology to do that today. What we don't have is the will to deploy a system to defend our country. 
Now, let me say something about the relationship with Russia and the ABM Treaty. Some are saying, `Well, doesn't this mean you are backing out of the ABM Treaty?' You have a treaty with Russia that says each will not develop a defense system against the ballistic missiles of the other. Well, first of all, the ABM treaty doesn't have anything to do with some of these nation states who are developing their own sophisticated and long-range weapons systems. We don't have a treaty with them. We don't have a mutual-assured destruction arrangement with them. We don't have any defense against their missiles. Even under the ABM treaty, there is an opportunity to deploy a single-site missile defense system, and it is under that premise that our program has been developed up to this point--with a view that, if in the minds of those who defend the current policy a threat is perceived to exist at some future date, then we will deploy a system that is compatible with the provisions of the antiballistic missile agreement with Russia. 
The treaty also permits that agreement to be amended. Whenever it is considered to be in the national interests of either country, negotiations can take place. As a matter of fact, our President was urged by the Senate to commence negotiation for the purpose of amending the agreements. We know that the administration has undertaken demarcation talks to try to distinguish between theater ballistic missile defense systems and the national ballistic missile defense system contemplated by the ABM Treaty, so that we can proceed to develop theater defenses like the Patriot, Navy Upper-Tier, the Airborne Laser system of the Air Force, and the Theater High Altitude Defense Area Program of the Army--looking at the different options that we have for protecting our troops and limited areas against ballistic missile attack. And so the ABM Treaty has some relevance in the debate, of course; but it is not an impediment to the adoption of this bill. It would not contravene or in any way fly in the face of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. 
Some are beginning to realize that inevitably, at some point, we may have to discuss with Russia further amendments to the ABM Treaty. Russia may consider those amendments to be in their interest, too. They are located in close geographical proximity to some of these other countries that we have already mentioned. Not to suggest that there is any threat now, but there may be. Later, the Russians may have reason to agree with us that this is not only in our mutual interest, but it is in their individual interest. And so this is not a referendum on the ABM Treaty. We do not seek to amend it or withdraw from it, or violate it by the passage of this legislation. 
I am hopeful that after Senators review the report of the Armed Services Committee, the fact that the committee has recommended the approval of this legislation, and the findings that were made by our subcommittee, some of which are recited in the language of the bill itself, that it will be the will of the Senate 
to adopt this bill and to say to all--the American citizens who may be worried about the vulnerability that we find ourselves in now, and those who may be contemplating stealing a march on the U.S. by developing quickly a long-range missile capability that could be used to threaten, intimidate, blackmail, or coerce our leadership--that we are not going to sit idly by and wait and see any longer. We are going to do what is necessary to develop and deploy a national missile defense system against limited ballistic missile attack. So don't waste your money, don't get carried away and go on a spending spree with a national program to develop a weapons system that is going to intimidate the United States, because we are not going to be intimidated. We are not going to be defenseless any longer. 
And, finally, this is not a vote today to deploy a system now. It is a vote today to say it is our policy to deploy a system when it is technologically possible, when an effective national missile defense system can be deployed. 
So I hope that Senators will agree with this. Fifty Senators are sponsors of this legislation. I urge its adoption by the Senate.

Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, and I don't want to object, but I had hoped we could conclude this debate here and I would withdraw this motion. I know of no Senators coming over to speak, unless the Senator from Oregon is seeking to speak on this motion to proceed to the bill. I heard there were other Senators who were interested. If the Senator will permit me a couple of minutes, then I will withdraw this motion and he can proceed as in morning business. But right now, the business is the motion to proceed to consider this missile defense bill. It won't take long, I assure the Senator, if he will indulge me.

Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I would like to make one closing point that I think should be made regarding the nature of the threat that exists now from other nations that are rapidly increasing both the range and sophistication of their missile systems. I talked about Iraq, our experience in the Persian Gulf war, what we have known about the capability which they developed very quickly after the purchase of systems from North Korea. We talked about Iran and the medium-range Shahab-3 and -4 systems that they are developing. We talked about Pakistan's testing last month a 1,500-kilometer-range missile, when 6 months ago the Defense Department's report on proliferation around the world said that Pakistan had only a 300-kilometer-range missile and a shorter-range missile in their arsenal. No mention was made of any longer-range missile. 
But I have neglected to point out what is happening, and what we know has happened, in North Korea, which has led to an assessment that they are developing missiles with much greater ranges than that. There is under development the Taepo-Dong 2 missile with a 6,000-kilometer intercontinental capacity, which would put within its range portions of Alaska and Hawaii. 
These are facts. These are reports that have been made public. We know that they have already deployed systems that are of shorter range than that, creating a very unstable and stressful situation because of the missile threat in that region of the world. We are kidding ourselves if we continue to assume that there is no emerging threat. These threats have emerged, they exist now, and they show the capacity of nation states to develop, with their own technology, their own technicians, weapons systems that are going to have longer and longer ranges and the capacity to deliver weapons of mass destruction. 
That is the reality. And when a CIA Director says that he cannot predict when rest-of-the-world nations will have intercontinental ballistic missiles because of `gaps and uncertainties'--when we don't have the capacity to make those findings and projections--it seems to me that the facts are clear, and the facts are serious. They should cause us great concern and convince the Senate that it ought to take action in the passage of this legislation, and change our policy of `wait-and-see' to one of `deploy as soon as the technology is ready.' It is going to be in our interests to deploy a system 1 year sooner than it is needed rather than 1 year after it is needed. 
Madam President, I had notified other Senators that we were going to withdraw the motion to proceed to consider this bill. There will be other opportunities to talk about it when it comes up on Wednesday, if a vote on cloture is ordered then, or Senators may talk about it as in morning business during the remainder of this evening. But if other Senators do not wish to talk on the subject, it is my intention to withdraw the motion.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the order has been entered for the consideration of the conference report on the agriculture research bill. As Senators may remember, when we passed the 1996 farm bill, the research programs were only authorized to the year 1997. This allowed the committees of jurisdiction to undertake a reevaluation of the way in which Federal dollars are allocated to research facilities that are operated by the Department of Agriculture and that are used for grants for research and extension service activities at colleges and universities throughout the country. 
As a result of that review, this legislation was produced. It improves the way those funds are allocated. It targets those funds to the highest priority subjects for agriculture research in our country. It is this Senator's hope that the Senate will approve the conference report and we can proceed to consider other related legislation. 
I point out the fact that we are in the appropriations process now for the next fiscal year. The passage of this 
conference report will facilitate the handling of the appropriations bill for the Department of Agriculture and other departments of the Government. If we are sent back to rewrite the bill in conference on a motion to recommit, it will slow down the process. It will make it more difficult to achieve the kind of coherent funding procedure that we would otherwise be able to enjoy.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, when the distinguished Senator from Georgia brought this problem up and I had a chance to look at some of the information, the GAO audit showed there are 3,000 audits of this kind performed each year. Of those audits, the report showed that 47 percent of them took place in Southern States. 
I looked further and saw that the GAO found that there were more random audits that took place in my State of Mississippi than in all of the States of New England combined. I couldn't believe that. I wondered why on Earth is that and then we find out that it is the working poor who are being targeted by these random audits. 
The numbers are just startling. Between 1994 and 1996, 94 percent of random audits were performed on individual taxpayers who earned less than $25,000 per year. If you think about that, these are people who probably don't normally retain a lawyer or maybe even a CPA or other tax advisor in the preparation of their audits. 
So what the amendment would do, which I cosponsor with the Senator from Georgia, is to require the IRS to give notice of why they are conducting an audit of taxpayers like this. It raises a question of just obvious unfairness. On its face, it is unfair and it ought to be changed.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Health Care Claims Guidance Act. I am pleased to have the distinguished Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Hollings), join with me as an original co-sponsor of the bill. This measure addresses a very serious concern: the government's misuse of the False Claims Act and the need to distinguish Medicare fraud from unavoidable billing errors. 
Health care fraud has no place in health care practice. Health care fraud costs taxpayers many millions of dollars that should be spent on patient care. In addition, government agencies must be able to use all of the tools at their disposal to prosecute aggressively those who willfully engage in fraudulent practices. 
It is equally important, however, that government resources be used to go after genuine wrongdoers, rather than health care providers who may have overbilled the government for Medicare services through innocent clerical errors or interpretive mistakes. 
Recently, the Department of Justice has embarked on a program to utilize the False Claims Act to prosecute provider billing errors. Until 1994, government agencies, hospitals, and physicians acted together, cooperating in most instances, to make sure all parties were treated fairly in Medicare billing disputes. Sometimes providers were underpaid, sometimes they were overpaid. Either way, they and the government would review and settle claims at the end of each quarter or each year. But, the government has abandoned this practice with doctors and hospitals and has begun a campaign to coerce and extract money improperly from the providers. 
In the State of Mississippi, and across the Nation, health car providers have received `demand' letters from U.S. Attorneys' offices, many not even from their own State, asserting that the doctors and hospitals may be guilty of fraudulent billing. These letters threaten the imposition of treble damages plus fines of $5,000 to $10,000 per claim unless a quick settlement is reached, often within fourteen days of the letter. In some cases, the demand letters have been sent based on alleged overbilling of minuscule amounts. 
Providers should certainly do all they can to minimize errors, and when discrepancies are discovered, the correct amounts should be paid to the Government with interest. 
But, with the filing of large numbers of claims each year, and the volume of Government rules, regulations, and directives--some of which are conflicting--that providers must follow, it is impossible to be error-free. Hospitals and health systems submit nearly 200,000 Medicare claims a day. To ensure the accuracy of those claims, they must comply with the 1,800 pages of law, 1,300 pages of regulations interpreting the law and thousands of additional pages of instructions. In addition, they are required to work with 41 intermediaries--mostly insurance companies--that have their own procedures that hospitals must follow as part of the billing process. The same level of law, procedures, and instructions also apply to physicians. 
The current practice of the Department of Justice, using the False Claims Act, assumes that hospitals, health systems, and doctors are guilty of intentionally filing erroneous claims when errors are made. This, in my view, is simply not right. 
The Health Care Claims Guidance Act we are introducing would amend the False Claims Act to distinguish between fraud and mere mistakes. It would apply only to claims under federally funded health care programs, and would have no effect on other False Claims Act prosecutions. 
The legislation does not change the criminal portions of the False Claims Act. Neither does it change the qui tam, or `whistle blower' provisions of the law. And it in no way would impede the Department of Justice or any other Government agency from zeroing in on true fraud and prosecuting those who commit fraud. No other Federal laws would be affected, including changes made by Congress in 1996 in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The changes would apply only to health care claims for Federally funded programs such as Medicare and CHAMPUS. This legislation would not 
prevent the Government from receiving any money that is rightfully due. In all cases, overpayments would be reimbursed with interest. 
What this legislation does is to distinguish Medicare billing fraud from honest billing mistakes. The bill does these four things: 
It imposes a `de minimis' standard. Under the standard, as defined by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Medicare overpayments to providers of less than a specified percentage would result in penalties of no more than the amount of the claim plus interest. 
It establishes a `safe harbor' for health care providers that submit a claim based on advice given by fiscal intermediaries and carriers. Such hospitals would be subject to fines limited to actual damages and interest, not treble damages plus $5,000 to $10,000 per claim. 
It raises the burden of proof required under the act from a `preponderance of the evidence' standard to a `clear and convincing evidence' standard. 
And lastly, it establishes a `safe harbor' for health care providers that have adopted effective, good-faith compliance plans in which they are, if found to be in violation of the False Claims Act, subject only to actual damages plus interest, rather than treble damages plus $5,000 to $10,000 per claim. 
Mr. President, although Congress 2 years ago gave Federal agencies additional tools to go after health care fraud--such as expanded authority under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act--the Department of Justice has nonetheless decided that the use of the False Claims Act guarantees `easy money.' 
The Health Care Claims Guidance Act stops this abuse of the law and provides a clear and simple way of distinguishing between those claims that are fraudulent and those claims that result from human error. I urge Senators to support this bill.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, a little more than 20 years ago, Congress enacted legislation which created the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. The legislation enjoyed broad bipartisan and bicameral support. The legislation I am introducing today will provide permanent authorization for the Center so that the Center may continue its work to preserve and share the collections of traditions which exemplify the diverse heritage of millions of ordinary Americans. 
The collections of the American Folklife Center contain rich and varied materials from my state of Mississippi and every state in the Nation. These materials document the diversity of the folk traditions of the many people who make up our nation. The Folklife Center serves as a national repository of traditional culture and is used by scholars from around the world as well as schoolchildren, teachers, and genealogists. 
The Congress has charged the American Folklife Center to preserve and present American Folklife for future generations. Providing the Center with permanent authorization will give the Center the security it needs to carry on its good work, continue its educational services, and strengthen its world-class collections. Permanent authorization will also allow the Center to engage the public's support of its collections through long-range planning and fundraising. 
American folklife is the traditional expressive culture shared within the many familial, ethnic, occupational, religious, and regional groups in the United States. It is the very basis of family and community life. I hope we can permanently authorize the Folklife Center so that these wonderful collections will be available to future generations.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am re-introducing a bill that I originally introduced last fall--the Postal Financing Reform Act of 1998. This bill is designed to do three things: allow the Postal Service to deposit funds in private sector institutions, invest in open markets--with Treasury approval of investment choices, and allow the Postal Service to borrow from private credit markets. 
For almost two decades now, the Postal Service has been self-supporting. With a yearly budget near $60 billion, and just $100 million appropriated to provide free mailing for the blind, free overseas voting, and reduced postage rates for certain nonprofit mailers, continuing U.S. Treasury control over Postal Service banking, investing, and borrowing is no longer necessary or justified. Nonetheless, when I first introduced the Postal Financing Reform Act last fall, specific concerns were raised by some in the postal community, and I agreed to make changes that were suggested. The Postal Financing Reform Act of 1998 incorporates these changes. Specifically, the revised 1998 Act reverts back to existing law bill language that would have potentially allowed the Postal Service to invest in its private sector competitors, and to benefit from an increased borrowing ceiling at the U.S. Treasury. 
Current law prevents the Postal Service from obtaining the most favorable combination of prices and services and results in added operating costs. Under this new approach, the Treasury Department would retain much of its current oversight, but it would no longer be the sole provider of certain financial services to the Postal Service. 
The Postal Financing Reform Act of 1998 proposes four significant changes to current law. First, section two of the bill amends Title 39 of the U.S. Code to authorize the Postal Service to deposit its revenues in the Postal Service Fund within the U.S. Treasury or any Federal Reserve banks or depositories for public funds. The requirement to obtain the Secretary of the Treasury's approval before any funds be deposited elsewhere would be eliminated, just as this approval is no longer necessary for other quasi-public agencies like the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). 
Section three continues the provision of existing law which requires that the Secretary of the Treasury approve any investments the Postal Service may make in non-Government securities. At the same time, it would permit the Postal Service to invest in U.S. Government obligations on its own accord, without unnecessary constraints, thus enabling the Postal Service to take advantage of favorable conditions in the Government securities market. 
Section four removes the control of the Secretary of the Treasury over the Postal Service's financial borrowing decisions. The Postal Service would still be required to consult with the Secretary regarding the terms and conditions of the sale of any obligations issued by the Postal Service under section 2006(a) of Title 39, and the Secretary would still exercise a power of approval over the timing of a sale of obligations. 
Finally, section five of the bill removes the ability of the Postal Service to require the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase Postal Service obligations. It merely permits the Secretary of the Treasury to buy Postal Service obligations upon the Postal Service's request. 
I have heard from many sources that reforms in the Postal Service should be made. Though I have decided to refrain from undertaking comprehensive reform, I have selected instead a simple, straightforward correction of an out of date practice that would reduce costs and help hold down future rate increases, without increasing risk to the taxpayers. 
Those who believe the Postal Service should operate as efficiently as possible, thus reducing fees charged to consumers, should support this bill. So, too, should those who profess to see the Postal Service treated more like a business. 
I think it is time to act on this issue. I invite Senators to consider this proposal for reform and support this effort to ensure a more efficient and financially sound U.S. Postal Service.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I support the amendment of the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Kempthorne, expressing the Sense of the Senate that funding for the Market Access Program should be fully maintained. 
The Senate has on several occasions debated funding for the Market Access Program. Most recently, on July 23, 1997, the Senate voted 59-40 in favor of tabling an amendment to reduce the Market Access Program from $90 million to $70 million. The Senate, recognizing the importance of this program, firmly rejected the suggestion to reduce it by even $20 million. I hope the Senate will, by an even greater margin, express its support that the budget should not assume the reduction of this program. 
The Market Access Program is one of the few tools that the Department of Agriculture has to combat the unfair trading practices of other countries. Since its inception in 1985, the Market Access Program and its predecessors, the Targeted Export Assistance Program and the Market Promotion Program, have assisted nearly 800 U.S. cooperatives, trade associations and corporations in promoting their products overseas. 
Our agricultural exports have more than doubled--from $26.3 billion in 1985 to a forecast level of $58.5 billion in 1998. In large measure this moderate increase, even in the face of the Asian currency crisis, signifies the results of efforts we have made since the mid-1980's to enhance our export competitiveness and develop new markets overseas. 
In fact, it is remarkable that the value of U.S. exports will increase slightly over last year and are only slightly below record 1996 levels even with the dire situation in Asian markets. U.S. farmers are particularly vulnerable to the instability of key Asian markets which account for 40 percent of our exports. The Market Access Program and other export programs are crucial to our farmer's ability to compete in a global marketplace.

<TEXT>
Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, this bill was introduced by Senator Inouye and me on March 19. After we sent a letter to all Senators inviting cosponsors, we received a very positive response. I am pleased to advise the Senate that with the addition of Senator Enzi, there are now 40 cosponsors of S. 1873. 
This bill would make it the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as technologically possible an effective national missile defense system capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack, whether accidental, unauthorized or deliberate. 
We believe this policy is necessary because of the growing proliferation threat. The proliferation threat includes both weapons of mass destruction and long-range ballistic missile delivery systems. 
The fact is that determining how quickly the United States 
will be facing an ICBM threat from a rogue nation is difficult to estimate. The Director of Central Intelligence recognized this point last year when he said to the Senate, `Gaps and uncertainties preclude a good projection of exactly when `rest of the world' countries will deploy ICBMs.' 
That `gaps and uncertainties' exist is not an indictment of our intelligence agencies. We have many fine and dedicated people in the intelligence community who have devoted their professional careers to obtaining information about and analyzing proliferation. But it is extremely difficult to predict accurately just how quickly technology will move forward and will be made in certain countries. 
Predicting the rate of technological advance would be difficult even if rogue states were to accept no outside assistance in their pursuit of mass destruction weapons and missile delivery platforms of ever-increasing range. But adding the knowledge now available in the information age to anyone with a computer and a telephone line to the fact that some nations are actively assisting pursuit of these capabilities makes for a situation in which predictions can be outdated soon after they are made. 
Take, for example, the case of the Shahab-3 and Shahab-4, two intermediate-range ballistic missiles Iran is pursuing with substantial help from Russian organizations. Last Friday's Washington Times carried an article entitled `Pentagon Confirms Details on Iranian Missiles.' It describes this situation, and I think it is very alarming. 
It is no secret that Iran is pursuing these missiles. The Shahab-3, with a range of 1,300 kilometers, will be capable of striking U.S. forces throughout the Middle East and our close allies in the region as well. The Shahab-4, with a range of 2,000 kilometers, will be able to reach into Central Europe. 
We all understand that neither of these missiles will have the range to strike the United States unless they are launched from some kind of a mobile platform, like a ship. But the important point is that these missiles are proceeding at a much more rapid pace than anticipated just last year, and the reason these missiles can be ready sooner than we expected is because of Russian expertise provided to Iran. 
In February the Director of Central Intelligence testified to the Senate: 
. . . since I testified, Iran's success in getting technology and materials from Russian companies, combined with recent indigenous Iranian advances, means that it could have a medium-range missile much sooner than I assessed last year. 
Madam President, the very kind of outside assistance that is speeding this Shahab-3 along so rapidly could also contribute in a similar way to the acquisition of long-range ballistic missiles by rogue nations. These kinds of nations are interested in ICBMs because they make the United States vulnerable to coercion or intimidation in time of crisis. It is a vulnerability that disappears when an effective national missile defense is deployed. 
That is why we have introduced the American Missile Protection Act of 1998. America should end its ICBM vulnerability as soon as the technology is available. 
Madam President, given the uncertainties about just when other nations will possess ICBMs, it only makes sense to be clear now in our commitment to deploy defenses against these systems as soon as the technology is ready. If the choice is to deploy a national missile defense capable against a limited threat 1 year too soon or 1 year too late, let it be 1 year too soon. The lesson of the Shahab-3 is that even the best intentioned estimates can be wrong.

Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, at the end of this month, my long-time good friend, John Perkins, will retire from service as a member of my personal staff. He has served as press secretary in my office since August 1979. 
Our friendship dates from the 1940s when we were students in elementary school at Byram Consolidated School near Jackson, MS. We also were members of the same Boy Scout troop. 
John got his first newspaper job when we were in high school. My father was our principal, and he and our football coach were asked to recommend a stringer for the Jackson, MS, papers to report scores and highlights of our football games. The person they recommended was John Perkins. The year was 1953, and John was in the ninth grade. 
From that beginning, he went on to serve on the student newspaper staff at Millsaps College where he graduated with a major in history in 1961. After college, he served in the U.S. Army Reserves, and then became a docket and reading clerk in the Mississippi State Senate. 
He attended graduate school in journalism at the University of Mississippi and worked in press relations for the Charles Sullivan campaign for Governor, in our State, in 1963. 
He then held a series of newspaper jobs covering a range of subjects from sports to local governments at the Jackson Daily News and the Meridian Star before being named managing editor of the Daily Corinthian in 1965. The next year John returned to the Meridian Star as managing editor and political writer. 
He was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives for a 4-year term in 1967 and was an active member of the coalition that successfully worked for passage of Governor John Bell Williams' highway program in the House. 
When David Bowen was elected to Congress in 1972, he recruited John Perkins to come to Washington as his press secretary. As a member of our State's delegation in the House, I had the opportunity to observe the work of all the press secretaries from Mississippi. And soon after I became a Member of the Senate, I invited John to join my staff. 
I have enjoyed very much working with him for these 18 1/2 years. Our State and Nation have been well-served by the diligence, dedication and commitment to excellence of John Perkins. He has put forth his best efforts to reflect credit on me, our State, and the U.S. Senate, and he has succeeded. 
He will be missed by us all, but we intend to stay in close touch and continue the close friendship that began 50 years ago. 
Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The Tree Assistance Program (TAP) provides assistance for the cost of replanting, reseeding, or repairing damage to trees, including commercial trees, orchards, and vineyards. 
This assistance has been extended to producers in past years. Funding for this program was not included in the Administration's disaster funding request. However, based on discussions with Members from the affected States and the Department, there is an apparent need for this program. This program is not intended to duplicate assistance for tree losses covered by programs of the United States Forest Service.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment provides $222,000 to cover the cost of additional boll weevil eradication loans. This will correct a shortfall in the fiscal year 1998 appropriation due to an interest rate subsidy miscalculation. The additional amount provided by this amendment will maintain the fiscal year 1997 $40 million loan level in fiscal year 1998. 
These loans are used to enhance the funding of the Boll Weevil Eradication Program and are made to the participating States' individual Boll Weevil Eradication Foundations. The applications for the loans are not made until April when the need for the actual money during the planting season can be determined by farmers. This procedure is in response to the Farm Services Agency's concerns that the funds be utilized when received rather than deposited for future use. At a recent Mid-South Boll Weevil Action Committee meeting, the committee agreed that applications will be made for the use of approximately $40 million and this money will be needed in fiscal year 1998. 
Again, I wish to reiterate that this amendment is only for a small amount and is necessary to maintain this program at its current level.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bill to make it the policy of the United States to deploy a national missile defense system as soon as technology permits. I am pleased that the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, is joining me as cosponsor of this legislation, the American Missile Protection Act of 1998. 
A new type of ballistic missile threat is emerging in the world today, one that derives not from a cold war strategic balance but from the increasing proliferation of ballistic missile technology, from the stated desire of some nation states to acquire such delivery systems, and from their evident progress in doing so. Last year, the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services held a series of 11 hearings examining proliferation-related issues. The evidence from those hearings forms the basis for the findings in this bill. 
First, we found, and this bill recites, that the threat of weapons of mass destruction delivered by long-range ballistic missiles is among the most serious security issues facing the United States. There is widespread agreement on this. For the last 4 years, the President has annually declared that the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, and the means of delivering such weapons, constitute `an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.' And the Senate said in legislation in 1996 that `it is in the supreme interest of the United States to defend itself from the threat of limited ballistic missile attack, whatever the source.' 
The second finding in the bill is that the long-range ballistic missile threat to the United States is increasing. The leaders of several rogue states have stated their belief that missiles capable of striking our territory would enable them to coerce or deter the United States, and they have declared their desire and intent to acquire these delivery systems. Ballistic missiles are increasingly the weapon of choice. They were used only once between World War II and 1980, but thousands have been fired in at least six conflicts since 1980. Furthermore, the clear trend is toward missiles with greater range. For example, since the early 1980s, North Korea has progressed from having to purchase 300-kilometer-range Scud missiles to developing its own 6,000-kilometer-range ballistic missile, 
which the intelligence community says may be capable of striking Alaska and Hawaii in less than 15 years. Iran's progress in developing extended range missiles has been dramatic and sudden, posing a new threat to U.S. forces in the Middle East. 
The technological advances of the information age have made vast amounts of previously classified, arcane technical information available to anyone with Internet access. Advances in commercial aerospace have made once-exotic components and materials commonplace and more easily obtainable, and the demand for space-based telecommunications has vastly increased demand for space launch vehicles. These developments mean that the technical information, hardware, and other resources necessary to build ballistic missiles are increasingly available and accessible worldwide. 
So, too, is scientific and technical expertise from Russia and China, which have been primary suppliers of equipment, materials, and technology related to weapons of mass destruction. Efforts by the administration to stop such assistance from these two countries have not been successful. 
America's well-known vulnerability serves to feed this growing threat. As long as potential adversaries know we cannot defend ourselves against these weapons, they have every incentive to acquire or develop them. 
The third finding in the bill is that the ability of the United States to anticipate the rate of progress in rogue ballistic missile programs is questionable. In the past, the United States has been surprised by the technical innovation of other nations, particularly with respect to ballistic missiles. There are many reasons for this, including help from other nations and the willingness of some states to field systems with lower accuracy requirements than would be acceptable to the United States. In both cases, the result can be progress that is more rapid than expected. Just 2 months ago, for example, the Director of Central Intelligence stated, `Iran's success in getting technology and materials from Russian companies, combined with recent indigenous Iranian advances means that it could have a medium-range missile much sooner than I assessed last year.' 
That year, last year, in 1997, Mr. Tenet testified that Iran could have such a missile by 2007, the year 2007. While he didn't say how much sooner than 2007 when he testified recently, State Department officials have testified since then that Iran could develop this missile this year, 9 years earlier than had been predicted only a year ago. 
Iran's rapid progress demonstrates how external assistance can affect the pace of missile programs. And, of course, predicting the amount of outside assistance any nation will receive is nearly impossible. The CIA has recognized this difficulty, stating recently to the Senate that, `gaps and uncertainties preclude a good projection of exactly when `rest of the world' countries will deploy ICBMs.' 
This bill's fourth finding is that the failure to prepare a defense against ballistic missiles could have grave security and foreign policy consequences for the United States. An attack on the United States by a ballistic missile equipped with a weapon of mass destruction would be catastrophic, inflicting death and injury to potentially thousands of American citizens. Even the threat of such an attack could constrain American options in dealing with regional challenges to our interests, deter us from taking action, or prompt allies to question America's security 
guarantees. All of this would have serious consequences for the United States and international stability. 
The fifth finding is that it is imperative for the United States to be prepared for rogue nations acquiring long-range ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction. The Senate, in its resolution of ratification for the START II treaty, declared that `. . . because deterrence may be inadequate to protect the United States against long-range ballistic missile threats, missile defenses are a necessary part of new deterrent strategies.' Former Defense Secretary Perry said in 1994 that we have an opportunity to move from `mutual assured destruction' to `mutual assured safety.' And in 1997, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy testified in the Senate that we `are quite willing to acknowledge that if we saw a rogue state, a potential proliferant, beginning to develop a long-range ICBM capable of reaching the United States, we would have to give very, very serious attention to deploying a limited national missile defense.' Mr. President, our Nation's interests will be served better being prepared 1 year too soon rather than 1 year too late. 
This bill's sixth and final finding acknowledges the United States has no defenses deployed against weapons of mass destruction delivered by long-range ballistic missiles and no policy to deploy such a national missile defense system. We have only a policy to wait and see. 
The bill in its final paragraph provides, `It is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as technologically possible, a National Missile Defense system capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack (whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate).' 
This policy statement accomplishes two things. It sends a clear message to any rogue state seeking ballistic missile delivery systems that America will not be vulnerable to these weapons indefinitely. And, second, it affirms that the United States will take the steps necessary to protect its citizens from missile attack. That is what the bill is. That is what it says. 
Now, let me briefly say what it is not. It is not a referendum on the ABM Treaty. It does not prescribe a specific system architecture. It does not mandate a deployment date, only that we deploy as soon as the technology is ready. It is not a directive to negotiate or cooperate on missile defense programs. It does not initiate studies or reports. Nor is it a declaration that the only weapon of mass destruction threat to the United States is from weapons delivered by long-range ballistic missiles--other delivery methods are also of concern but we have programs in place to defend against those threats. This bill is designed to deal only with the accelerating proliferation threat. 
In his State of the Union Address President Clinton said, `preparing for a far off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser than ignoring the thunder 'til the clouds are just overhead.' He wasn't talking about national missile defense, but his words do apply precisely to this dilemma. We are hearing the thunder now, and the time has come to declare to our citizens and to the world and to demonstrate by our actions that the United States will not remain defenseless against ballistic missiles. That should be our policy and this bill states that it is our policy.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I make the following announcements at the request of the majority leader. 
Tomorrow, the Senate will resume consideration of the NATO expansion treaty, with amendments to the resolution of ratification being offered throughout the day. It is expected that Senator Hutchison of Texas will offer an amendment tomorrow, and any other Senators with amendments are encouraged to contact the managers with their amendments. As earlier stated, it is hoped that the Senate will be able to make considerable progress on the treaty. 
In addition, the Senate may consider any other legislative or executive business cleared for Senate action, although, as previously announced by the majority leader, no rollcall votes will occur during Friday's session. 
The next vote will occur at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, hopefully in relation to an amendment to the NATO treaty. Also, the second cloture vote scheduled for this evening was postponed to occur on Tuesday, March 24, in an effort to work on an agreement for an orderly handling of the bill. Therefore, a second cloture vote will occur on the Coverdell A+ bill on Tuesday if an agreement cannot be reached in the meantime.

Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, we have had a good debate, a prolonged debate, on S. 1173, the surface transportation bill, or the highway bill, as it is known in my State of Mississippi. It is now time to pass it and get to work on a conference report with the other body to meet the May 1 expiration of current law. 
There is a tremendous backlog of road, bridge and highway projects in every state. Some have estimated that our national investment in highways per vehicle miles of travel decreased by 56 percent during the last 25 years while vehicle travel has increased by 123 percent. This illustrates the problem and explains why we have such a serious need to address this legislation and complete our work so the states can start work on the projects this bill will fund. 
I am very pleased that the bill allocates the money on a much more fair and equitable basis than the current formula. Mississippi will get over 90 percent, at least, of the highway tax contributions it makes to the trust fund. That is a lot better than the 83 percent my State is now receiving. 
I'm also pleased that the bill gives the states more flexibility to spend the money they get from the trust fund on road, highway and other transportation projects that they identify as their priorities rather than having to abide by federal priorities that don't coincide with state needs. 
In Mississippi 29 percent of our major roads are in poor or mediocre condition and 39 percent of the State's bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. 
These conditions contribute significantly to highway accidents which have increased 6 percent during the last 4 years. In addition to the loss of life, these accidents cost Mississippi's citizens $1.3 billion per year, or $500 for every resident, for emergency services, medical costs, property damage and lost productivity. 
Another relevant statistic is that 77 percent of all fatal accidents were on two-lane roads and only 14 percent were on roads with four lanes or more. Money that is spent on highway improvements, such as adding lanes and shoulders, will save lives. It is also good economics. 
I'm confident the flexibility provided in this bill will help Mississippi solve some of its special and most serious highway and transportation problems, especially the completion of our comprehensive four lane program. 
Mississippi has been working for over ten years to implement this program. According to the Mississippi Department of Transportation, projects remaining to be put under contract include 30 miles of US 45, 17 miles of US 49 West, 69 miles of US 61, 25.4 miles of US 82, 54.6 miles of US 84, 24.6 miles of US 98, 58 miles of State Road 25, 33 miles on State Roads 57 and 63, and 10 miles of State Road 302. All of US 72 is now under contract and all of US 78 is now open to four-lane traffic. 
The specific provision of the bill that helps us in this way gives states the flexibility to use up to 22 percent of their trust fund allocations for any projects that fall within title XXIII of the U.S. Code, which covers all highway programs. 
There are other provisions of this legislation that are of special interest to our efforts in Mississippi to ensure that roads, highways and bridges on federal lands within the States are improved. Additional funding added to the bill as part of the committee amendment will provide $850 million in additional contract authority over 5 years for the three elements of the Federal Lands Highway Program. 
Funding for Parkways and Park Roads will increase by $70 million per year for fiscal years 1999-2003, and funding for Public Lands Highways by $50 million per year during the same period. This ought to provide funding to bring the Natchez Trace Parkway closer to completion and ensure some much needed improvements are made to roads in our national forests and wildlife refuge areas. 
Another provision of this bill that is of major interest to me and my State is the additional $450 million for funding NAFTA Trade Corridors. 
The I-69 Trade Corridor Highway, which will run from Canada down through the Mississippi Valley to our border with Mexico, will provide significant economic benefits to the entire region through which it passes. We expect our State of Mississippi will be one of the states through which I-69 will pass. 
Without this investment, the transportation infrastructure of the Mid-South region cannot accommodate the needs associated with increasing trade and commercial traffic. Growth in North American trade, as well as trade between the U.S. and the rest of the world, is supported by recent trends and current projections, particularly in the agricultural sector. 
U.S. agricultural exports, which were valued at $26.3 billion in fiscal year 1986, increased to $54.2 billion in 1995 and to nearly $60 billion in fiscal year 1996. We also consistently export more agriculture commodities and food products than we import. 
A recent USDA Agricultural Outlook publication projected `robust growth' in global demand for agricultural products in international commodity markets through the year 2005. It also predicted that U.S. high-value agricultural exports will continue to show strong growth, generally outpacing bulk exports and accounting for a growing share of U.S. farm exports. 
Every state in the I-69 Trade Corridor exports agricultural products and commodities, sharing in export-generated employment, income, and rural development. These exports generate economic activity in the non-farm economy as well. USDA estimates that each $1.00 received from agricultural exports in 1995 stimulated another $1.38 in supporting activities to produce those exports generating an estimated 895,000 full-time civilian jobs, including 562,000 in the non-farm sector. 
Trends in agriculture exports and the potential for their growth suggest that additional investment in transportation resources, particularly in the I-69 Trade Corridor, will provide a favorable return to the economies of all the States and communities along the route. 
Madam President, I commend the members of the Committee on Environment and Public Works who have worked hard to provide more funding for our transportation needs and to ensure a more equitable distribution of funds to the States, and I especially congratulate, our distinguished majority leader for his effective leadership in helping to produce a good and fair bill. This bill ought to receive an overwhelming vote of approval. 
Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing, at the request of the Administration, a bill to provide for the correction of retirement coverage errors under chapters 83 and 84 of title 5, United States Code--specifically, current and former federal employees who should have been placed in the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS), but were misclassified as Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or CSRS Offset. 
The federal government's transition from CSRS to FERS began in 1984. As government agencies carried out the complex job of applying two sets of transition rules, mistakes were made, and thousands of employees were placed in the wrong retirement system--many learning that their pensions would be less than expected. The Administration's proposal, `The Federal Retirement Coverage Corrections Act,' would provide employees with a choice between corrected retirement coverage and the coverage the employee expected to receive, without disturbing Social Security coverage law. 
I think this bill deserves the careful consideration of the Senate. As Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee with jurisdiction over the subject, I will try to ensure a thorough review of all the options for dealing with this issue. 
Among the provisions of the bill, are the following:

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Domenici in sponsoring the 1998 Character Counts Week resolution. As an original member of the Character Counts Coalition here in the United States Senate, it has been my honor to cosponsor Character Counts Week every year since 1994. 
In the past we learned the Golden Rule and were taught how to act by our parents and teachers or at Sunday School, and the community helped reinforce acceptable conduct. Today, because there are so many who don't have a chance to grow up in that kind of environment, we must develop alternative ways of teaching and learning how to behave in a free society. 
Former United States Deputy Under Secretary of Education, Dr. Peter R. Greer, wrote an article, called `Teaching Virtue,' published in Education Week, February 4, 1998. In his article, he describes his experiences in developing effective curriculum for teaching ethics and character in kindergarten through grade twelve. He found that one of the most troublesome aspects for teachers to overcome was their reluctance to identify right and wrong. He also found that teaching virtues had to be a school-wide and a community-wide commitment. 
The Character Counts! Coalition began as an effort to put values education at the top of the national agenda. The values are called `Pillars of Character,' and they are: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. 
The core elements of good character reflect a consensus that was reached by eminent and diverse educators and youth leaders who thought the pillars would be widely understood, accepted and effective. 
The Coalition is made up of over 180-member organizations who collectively pursue the goal of teaching that character does count and is essential for our nation's survival and success. Included in this group are the American Association of School Administrators, American Red Cross, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Little League Baseball, 4-H, National Honor Society and many regional and community-based organizations. They are all working to build awareness of the pillars of character and to encourage their teaching `from the family room to the school room to the locker room.' 
In my state of Mississippi, Ocean Springs is a Character Counts Community. The Chamber of Commerce sponsors programs that stress the importance of making good character traits an intrinsic part of the lives of students, teachers, administrators, and citizens. 
The Ocean Springs Character Counts Business Club members display Character Counts stickers in their windows and help raise funds for the Chamber of Commerce. Each year, those funds are used for programs and materials to train teachers in the Ocean Springs public schools on better ways to incorporate character education into their regular curriculum. 
The programs are designed for repetition and emphasize action and behavior. Youngsters are encouraged to express their thoughts about character through essays, poems, songs, artwork, posters or videos. 
I am very proud of the people of Ocean Springs, Mississippi. They understand that teaching good character begins at home, but it must be reinforced at school and by the entire community. 
Character Counts! Week is October 18-24 this year. I hope that communities will use this as a time for new and renewed commitments to character education. 
If we all practiced what Character Counts teaches, America would be better indeed.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of the Senate the fact that one of our finest and brightest and best-liked members of staff, from the State of Mississippi, is leaving the Senate and going back to Mississippi at the end of this month to join one of the leading law firms in our State. I am talking about John Lundy, who is chief of staff for my distinguished State colleague, Senator Lott. 
John Lundy came to Washington in 1987 to work as a legislative assistant on the House side of the Capitol. He distinguished himself right away with his hard work, his ability to get along with staff members and Members of the House on both sides of the aisle, as well as work effectively with Senate staffers from our State and Members of the Senate. 
He had a lot to do with the writing of the 1990 farm bill as a member of the staff of Larry Combest, Congressman from Texas, who is a Member of the Agriculture Committee in the House. 
John is originally from Leland, MS. He graduated from Mississippi State University in 1983 with a degree in agricultural economics. After graduation, he went to work as a research assistant at the Mississippi State University Delta Branch Agricultural Experiment Station in Stoneville, MS, near his hometown of Leland. He then worked for a while as a loan officer with a farm credit institution in the Mississippi Delta. 
When he joined Senator Lott's office, he became someone with whom I had an opportunity to work closely over the years. When Senator Lott was elected majority leader, he made John Lundy his chief of staff. John has been one of my favorites and a good friend to me and to all of the Members of our delegation. We are going to miss him and his lovely wife, Hayley, very much, and their daughter, Eliza. They are moving to Jackson, as I indicated, toward the end of this month. 
But I wanted to take this opportunity to let other Senators know about his decision to go back to Mississippi and to congratulate him on his distinguished service here in the U.S. Senate as a member of our staff and the House of Representatives staff as well, and to wish him all of the best in his new undertaking. I am confident that he will be a tremendous success in his new association with the law firm in Jackson. 
We wish him well. We will miss him. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able to present for the Senate's approval today the conference report on H.R. 2160, the Fiscal Year 1998 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. 
The conference agreement provides total appropriations of $49.7 billion. This is $4.1 billion less than the fiscal year 1997 enacted level and $2.6 billion less than the level requested by the President. It is $964 million less than the total appropriations recommended by the Senate-passed bill and $146 million more than the level recommended by the House bill. 
Including Congressional budget scorekeeping adjustments and prior-year spending actions, this conference agreement provides total discretionary spending for fiscal year 1998 of $13.751 billion in budget authority and $13.997 billion in outlays. These amounts are consistent with the revised discretionary spending allocations established for this conference agreement. 
Both the House and the Senate passed this bill at the end of July. The conferees met and completed conference on September 17. I believe it is a credit to all members of the conference committee that we were able to reach a conference agreement quickly. Special recognition is due the ranking member of the subcommittee, my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers; the chairman of the House Subcommittee, Congressman Skeen of New Mexico; and the ranking member of the House Subcommittee, Congresswoman Kaptur, for their hard work and cooperation in making this possible. 
It was our intent that the conference report on this bill would be adopted by both bodies of the Congress and sent to the President prior to the October 1, 1997, start of the fiscal year. However, it was the decision of the leadership to withhold Senate approval of this conference agreement until further progress was made on the FDA reform bill, which reauthorizes fees to expedite FDA's prescription drug review and approval process. 
The conference agreement on this appropriations bill was adopted by the House of Representatives on Monday, October 6, by a vote of 399 yeas to 18 nays. Senate adoption of this conference report today is the final step remaining to allow this measure to be sent to the President for signature into law. We have every indication that the bill will be signed by the President. 
Approximately $37.2 billion, close to 75 percent of the total new budget authority provided by this conference report, is for domestic food programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These include food stamps; commodity assistance; the special supplemental food program for Women, Infants, and Children [WIC]; and the school lunch and breakfast programs. This is roughly the same as the House bill level and $923 million less than the Senate level. The difference from the Senate recommended level is principally due to the fact that the Senate receded to the House on the transfer of funding Food and Consumer Service studies and evaluations to the Economic Research Service, and accepted the lower House bill level for the Commodity Assistance Program based on the Department of Agriculture's revised estimate of program need. In addition, the Senate receded to the House level of $100 million for the Food Stamp Program contingency reserve, $900 million less than the Senate bill level. 
For agriculture programs, the conference report recommends a total of $6.9 billion, $57 million more than the House bill level. This amount includes $1.2 billion for agricultural research and education, $423 million for extension activities, $430 million for the Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service, $589 for the Food Safety and Inspection Service, $703 million for the Farm Service Agency, and $253 million for the Risk Management Agency. 
For conservation programs, the conference report recommends almost $790 million, $30 million more than the House bill level but $36 million less than the amount recommended by the Senate. 
For rural economic and community development programs, the bill recommends $2.1 billion, $47 million more than the House level and $9 million more than the Senate bill level. Included in this amount is $652 million for the Rural Community Advancement Program, nearly $8 million more than the Senate bill level, and the Senate bill level of $535 million for the rental assistance program. The conference report also provides a total rural housing loan program level of $4.2 billion. 
For foreign assistance and related programs of the Department of Agriculture, the bill recommends $1.7 billion, including $131 million in new budget authority for the Foreign Agricultural Service and a total program level of $1.1 billion for the Public Law 480 Food for Peace Program. 
The Food and Drug Administration receives one of the largest discretionary spending increases over the fiscal year 1997 level. Included in the appropriation provided by the conference agreement for salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration is $24 million for food safety and $34 million for youth tobacco prevention. These are the full amounts requested by the Administration for these initiatives. 
Mr. President, there is no reason to continue temporary stop-gap funding for the programs and activities funded by this bill. As I indicated earlier, this conference report was filed on September 17 and was adopted by the House of Representatives on October 6. Senate passage of this conference report today is the final step necessary to send this fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill to the President for signature into law. I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of this conference report.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, funeral services will be held today in my State for Walter Grey Hemphill, Jr., a World War II hero, who was also a very close personal friend. 
He was best known in our community as a former star athlete at Byram High School, who was recruited to play football at the University of Mississippi in 1941, as a successful coach and teacher at his alma mater, a respected vice president and general manager of Deviney Construction Co., an active member and chairman of the deacons at the First Baptist Church of Byram, and as a past worthy patron of the Order of the Eastern Star. 
While most of his friends knew that Walter Grey Hemphill, Jr., had been a veteran of World War II, few were aware of the details of his combat experiences. The fact that he was one of the true heros of the Battle of the Bulge was not something he talked about very easily. 
The citation he received awarding him the Silver Star for valor in battle described his bravery under fire and his willingness to risk his life to save the lives of his fellow paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division in the fighting near Bastogne, Belgium, in December 1944. He destroyed a German gun emplacement with an explosive charge at close range while under heavy enemy fire. His courageous action saved the lives of the members of his unit, but he was seriously wounded in the process. He received two Purple Hearts and spent over a year in hospitals recovering from his injuries. 
After the war, he returned to the University of Mississippi and, although unable to play football, he earned his bachelor and master's degrees and became my high school world history teacher, as well as my football, basketball, and baseball coach. He was also our close neighbor whose friendship I enjoyed and appreciated. I'm confident that the lessons I learned from him on the athletic fields, in the classrooms, and in our neighborhood provided me with a firm foundation of values, attitudes, and work habits that made future academic and professional success possible. 
I will always remember and be grateful for his generous acts of kindness, his fair but firm discipline, and his thoughtful leadership. 
He is survived by a dear and loving wife, Elsie, and a devoted daughter, Patricia Windham, to whom I extend my sincerest condolences.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Postal Financing Reform Act of 1997. This bill gives the Postal Service the authority to deposit funds in private sector institutions, invest in the open market, and borrow from private credit markets. 
The statutory restrictions of current law on postal finances, borrowing, and purchasing were designed for a Postal Service that required regular infusions of appropriated funds to maintain public service levels. For almost two decades now, the Postal Service has been a self-supporting system. 
The maintenance of U.S. Treasury control over Postal Service banking, investing, and borrowing is no longer necessary or justified. Current law prevents the Service from obtaining the most favorable combination of prices and services and results in added operating costs of over $100,000,000 annually. Under this new approach, the Treasury Department would retain much of its current oversight, but it would no longer be the sole provider of certain financial services to the Postal Service. This bill makes the relationship between the Treasury and the Postal Service similar to the relationship other government sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have with the Treasury. 
The bill I am introducing includes four main sections--those being sections 2 through 5. Section 2 amends title 39 of the United States Code to authorize the Postal Service to deposit its revenues in the Postal Service Fund within the U.S. Treasury or any Federal Reserve banks or depositories for public funds. The requirement to obtain the Secretary of the Treasury's approval before any funds deposited elsewhere would be eliminated. 
The third section terminates Treasury control of Postal Service investments. This will permit the Postal Service to invest any excess funds either in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the Government of the United States, or in such other obligations or securities as it deems advisable, provided that such investment is determined to be closely related to Postal Service operations by the Postal Board of Governors. By providing the Postal Service with an opportunity to invest in U.S. Government obligations or other obligations on its own accord without unnecessary constraints, this section of the bill would permit the Postal Service to take advantage of favorable market conditions, and give it the ability to make equity investments which fit its business strategies. 
Section 4 removes the control of the Secretary of the Treasury over the Postal Service's financial borrowing decisions. The Postal Service would still be required to consult with the Secretary of the Treasury regarding the terms and conditions of the sale of any obligations issued by the Postal Service under section 2006(a) of title 39, and the Secretary would still exercise a power of approval over the timing of a sale of obligations, in much the same manner as the Treasury acts as a traffic cop with regard to the timing of obligations issued by other government-sponsored enterprises. 
Finally, this bill removes the requirement of the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase up to $2 billion in obligations of the Postal Service. This section would still permit the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase Postal Service obligations, but only upon mutual agreement between the Secretary and the Postal Service. Removing this put on the Treasury would be consistent with the purpose of directing the Postal Service borrowing to the private sector where it would be able to take advantage of a broader market. This section would also make Treasury purchases of Postal Service obligations exempt from the various borrowing limits in title 39 of the United States Code thus enabling the Postal Service and the Treasury by mutual agreement to address an unforeseen emergency situation. Such exempt purchases would themselves be capped at $2.5 billion of outstanding obligations at any one time. 
I invite Senators to consider this proposal for reform and support this effort to ensure a more efficient and financially sound U.S. Postal Service.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I would like a clarification of an item included in the fiscal year 1998 Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and independent agencies appropriations bill. 
The item on which I would like clarification was included under the Economic Development Initiative Program section of the bill and provides a grant of $1,000,000 to the city of Jackson, MS. The conference report states that the grant should be used for training facilities and equipment for a downtown multimodal transit center, phase II. The conference report incorrectly identifies what the grant is to be used for. In fact, the grant is for the acquisition and rehabilitation of facilities and related improvements for a downtown multimodal transit center, phase II, in the city of Jackson, MS. 
These funds are specifically to be used for the aquisition and rehabilitation of a trolley barn, downtown employee shuttle park and ride lots, and a long-term intermodal passenger parking lot. This funding will help revitalize an area of the city of Jackson that has been federally designated as an enterprise community. 
It is my understanding that the conference report incorrectly identified the purpose of the economic development initiative grant and that congressional intent for the $1,000,000 grant to the city of Jackson, MS, is for the purposes as I have described them. Would the chairman clarify this understanding?

Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee with funding jurisdiction for the Food and Drug Administration, I am compelled to state my opposition to the appropriations mandate in this bill. While this bill reauthorizes prescription drug user fees for the next 5 years, it also states that the FDA cannot assess those fees unless the appropriation for FDA salaries and expenses is at least equal to the appropriation for fiscal year 1997, adjusted for inflation. 
The Appropriations Subcommittee will continue to balance the needs and requirements of all agencies and activities under its jurisdiction within the total amounts available for discretionary appropriations. Any member of the Senate who disagrees with the committee's recommendations is free to seek to change the allocation of resources proposed in the bill. 
However, annual appropriations decisions should not be predetermined by the establishment of arbitrary appropriations `floors' and `ceilings' in authorization bills. In this particular case, the bill seeks to dictate that FDA's salaries and expenses appropriation be `held harmless' against inflation--that for each of the next five fiscal years, the appropriations be at least equal to the current appropriations level, adjusted for inflation. If not, FDA cannot assess prescription drug user fees. 
Madam President, I am certain that each agency and program which receives appropriations would like to secure a similar protection against inflation. However, this is unrealistic in the current budget environment and inconsistent with the levels available for discretionary appropriations under the bipartisan budget agreement. 
Industry paid fees are expected to supplement rather than supplant FDA spending for drug approvals. For this reason, I understand the industry's desire to make sure that FDA maintains its current level of effort relative to the drug approval process. However, as I indicated, it is unreasonable to attempt to guarantee FDA protection against inflation at the possible expense of other programs and activities. It would be difficult for me as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee of jurisdiction to predict what agency or program restructuring might occur over the next 5 fiscal years, what a program or agency's future resource requirements might be, or the fiscal constraints the subcommittee might face in each future year. 
Mr. President, it could be that the minimum mandated appropriations level in this bill is met in each of those years. However, it is just as likely that it would not be. The Appropriations Committee will continue to do its work by considering the needs of every program and agency within its jurisdiction within the total resources available to it. It will not feel constrained to meet the proposed appropriations `trigger' for the collection of prescription drug user fees if it remains in this bill. 
I do not think it is the intent of the Labor and Human Resources Committee or the Senate to set an arbitrary mandate that might result in a situation during the course of the next 5 years where these fees may not be collected. I believe this would undermine the existing drug approval process and run counter to the interests of the federal government, the industry, and the American public. The issues and concerns I raise are similar to those expressed by Senators Gregg and McConnell in the additional views they incorporated in the committee's report accompanying S. 830. 
Madam President, I am hopeful that the committee take this issue seriously and will work in conference to remove this appropriations mandate and possible impediment to the continued success of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. 
Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the U.S. Senate lost one of its most colorful and well liked staff members last Thursday night when my administrative assistant, Wiley Carter, died. His sudden and unexpected death at 61 years of age following surgery at a hospital in Jackson, MS, has deeply saddened us all. He began his work with me as manager of my campaign for reelection to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1974. In that turbulent election year, with his good assistance we received over 70 percent of the vote. After the election, Wiley joined my congressional staff in Mississippi where he served as my liaison to local governments and case worker. Two years later he became a member of my Washington staff and soon thereafter became my administrative assistant. 
During these 23 years of close association, I developed a deep appreciation for Wiley Carter. His warm good nature was constant, his loyalty never failing, and his enthusiasm an ever present inspiration. He was adept at handling constituents' problems, and he reminded all of us by his example that one of our highest priorities was to help solve the problems of the people of our State and to treat everyone who called on us with respect and courtesy. He really loved his job. He loved people, he loved politics, he loved campaigns, he loved Mississippi State University, but most of all he loved his family. He cared about his children and his efforts to support and assist them in every possible way were well known. 
One experience with Wiley and his wife Gwen, and their children and extended family, is particularly memorable for me. We were all in Starkville, MS, together, celebrating the donation of his political memorabilia and papers to the Mississippi State University library. The love the family members felt for each other was obvious to me, and the pride they had in seeing Wiley's career celebrated with such ceremony, well attended by many friends, was evidence of their deep appreciation of him. And he loved every minute of it, as he should have. 
One of his former classmates said to me, `Where did Wiley get any papers? When he was in school at State he didn't have any papers.' Of course there were a lot of clippings and photographs and letters that had accumulated over a career dating from the organization of the Mississippi Young Democrats, in the 1950's, and the Carroll Gartin and John Bell Williams campaigns for Governor, to the present. 
The skills he developed along the way led our mutual friend, Bill Simpson, to say to me recently, `Wiley Carter in my book is the best street politician in Mississippi.' I didn't know whether that was such a high compliment or not until I told Wiley what Bill had said to me, and Wiley said, `You know, that's one of the best compliments I've ever gotten.' 
In this day of cynicism about politics and government, more Wiley Carters would be good to have; people who devote their energy to doing their best to make our Government respond to the needs of ordinary people and respect the opinion of average citizens. 
Wiley engendered good will wherever he went. He warmed our 
hearts and he put a smile on our faces. 
Without Wiley, life will not be as interesting and political campaigns won't be the same either. He would say, for example, `In a campaign, if you haven't heard a rumor by noon, you ought to start one.' Wiley organized a war room before Lee Atwater and James Carville made the term famous. He was so well liked by so many in Mississippi, and here in Washington, too. A Capitol Hill policeman, Andy Anders, was one of the first Washington friends of his I called on Friday morning. Andy had taken his vacation a few years ago to come visit Mississippi at Wiley's suggestion, and Wiley gave him the royal treatment. They walked up to the State Capitol. The Legislature was in session. He introduced him to Gov. Kirk Fordice, the Speaker of the House, and many others. Of course, Andy was impressed and delighted. That says a lot about Wiley, and his capacity and his sense of duty to reciprocate true acts of friendship and kindness. 
There will never be another one like him. We are all so fortunate that we have had the benefit of his unique insights into human nature and his example of loyalty to his friends and family.

Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, what is the situation with time? Has all the time been used by the proponent of the amendment?

Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam President, one comment at the outset has to be made in response to the Senator's statement quoting from an Associated Press article which suggests I said yesterday that the effort to bring this amendment to the Senate on a second vote violates the rules of the Senate. I said no such thing yesterday. I have just completed reading my remarks as reflected in the Congressional Record of yesterday's proceedings of the Senate, and that is not contained in my remarks. 
What I did say was this, and I will read it again for emphasis. `So what I am suggesting, Mr. President, as respectfully as I can, is that this is an unfortunate effort to go around the practices and the procedures that have been established for this purpose to facilitate the orderly consideration of appropriations bills, and the Senate ought to reject this effort.' 
Now, let me elaborate on that. The procedure being used by the proponent of this amendment creates an unfortunate precedent. If it is rewarded by a majority of the votes on his amendment, that precedent will permit a vote on an amendment to a bill after third reading, 
and, after a unanimous-consent agreement has ripened, as an order limiting amendments on a bill. Using the tactic employed by the distinguished Senator and my friend from Iowa should not be rewarded by the Senate and such a precedent should not be established. 
The reason I am making that point as strongly as I can, and repeating what was said yesterday in the 10 minutes we had to discuss this issue, is that we had worked out a procedure for considering appropriations bills here in the Senate in advance of their being considered by the House. We had markups, in subcommittees and the full committee, of appropriations bills that had not yet passed the House. That is a departure from procedures that had been used as a matter of custom and practice in the past. The reason was to accelerate and expedite consideration of these bills so that we would not get into a situation of winding up at the end of the fiscal year, or right on the brink of the beginning of a new fiscal year, not having passed all appropriations bills because of the slowness of that earlier procedure. 
This was working fine. But one little nuance to permit that to work is that when the House-passed bill is received in the Senate, we have to get unanimous consent to hold it at the desk, and then call it up, substitute the Senate action on the appropriations bill for the language of the House-passed bill, and have it passed as amended by the Senate action. We have already had third reading of the Senate bill; we have already adopted all the amendments; we have had orders limiting those amendments; and then the Senator decides to use this opportunity. Under the Senate rules, he is right. Under the Senate rules, any Senator can object to a unanimous-consent request, and that is what he did. The difference is that it was understood that when we completed action on the Senate bill, we would then take up the House-passed bill, substitute the Senate action on it, adopt it, and go to conference. So it was at that little point in the procedure that the Senator decided to use a new tactic, and that is why we are having to vote another time, a second time, on an amendment that was disposed of during the consideration of the agriculture appropriations bill. 
We passed the bill on July 24. Here we are in September having to vote on an amendment virtually the same with a different offset. The offset is described as defective and flawed in a statement made by Senator Domenici that is in the Record of yesterday. I invite the attention of Senators on that subject. What it does, in effect, is instead of spending money in this next fiscal year, we will postpone it to the following fiscal year, and that is scored by CBO as an offset. Are you kidding? There is a statutory maximum to spend, a mandate for computer operations to be funded at the Department of Agriculture. So the offset, while the CBO scores it--and we continue to live under this very interesting obligation to honor, cherish, and obey the decisions of CBO on these issues, the wisdom of the Senate or the will of the Senate notwithstanding--we are bound to respect the CBO decision on whether or not this is an effective offset of the new spending. 
The arguments about whether you are for or against smoking--really, we are all for doing everything possible to persuade young people, minors, not to smoke. That is not the issue here. This program by FDA provides some funds to States to help enforce State rules and laws and Federal regulations on sales of tobacco to minors. Only a few States are even getting this money. I mean, the whole point of this argument suggests that the substance of the amendment deals with that issue in some important or dramatic way. It does not. 
The point is, this money, this account, will be negotiated in conference. All Senators understand that. The House has a higher number than the Senate has. We have higher numbers for other things like agricultural research and some other important initiatives protecting farmers, trying to do something about production agriculture and the efficiency and the yields that our farmers can achieve on their crops to remain globally competitive. This is a big bill. It has WIC money, which is very important. A lot of nutrition programs are funded in this bill at higher levels than the House recommends. 
So, what I am saying is that we don't agree with the House on every part of the bill. That is why we are going to conference. But to permit this procedure to prevail and have us vote on the same amendment we have already disposed of, I think should be rejected. We are not going to be able to continue the procedures we followed if we reward this strategy, this tactic, this use or abuse of the procedures that we have been following.

Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I have made the arguments that I intended to make. If Senators are interested in a little more detailed discussion of the procedures and why I think it would be such an unfortunate precedent for us to reward the strategy being used by the proponent of the amendment, I invite attention to yesterday's Record. 
Let me just say one other thing about the effort to resolve this issue. We have plenty of room within the amount provided by the House in its version of this bill and the amount provided by the Senate in the bill that passed the Senate 99 to 0 to negotiate an appropriate level of funding for the FDA's program. We are not suggesting that this program ought not be funded, that assistance ought not be made available to States which need the assistance. But has it occurred to anybody that the States are bringing lawsuits and collecting from the tobacco companies money to do this very thing? Our State of Mississippi is the first to obtain a cash settlement with the tobacco industries, and it can use the money for a wide variety of purposes: to help defray expenses, medical expenses, that have been paid out to those who have suffered health problems because of smoking, antiteenage smoking campaigns and efforts and initiatives--and that is what this program is. Here we are asking people around the country to use their tax dollars to go to States, whether they have brought law suits, whether they have taken action--these are applicants for funds under a new FDA program that has just begun. 
So, I am saying there is more to this than is being discussed. There is more to this than is being admitted. Florida has just now undertaken to consummate a settlement that is similar to the one in Mississippi, and there will be others. Where has been the Department of Justice? Where is the Federal Department of Justice on these issues? Where is the proposal of the administration on these issues? We are asked to spend more taxpayer dollars, but I am not sure it is for a coherent, comprehensive way to deal with the overall issue. That is what I am suggesting. The States are doing a much better job and a much more aggressive job getting after this than we are. And an amendment is being suggested here to solve all those problems. Well, that is just not an accurate reflection of the facts, is it, Madam President? 
So I urge, when we make a motion to table the amendment, once all time has been used or yielded back, that the Senate vote for the motion to table to permit us to continue to consider appropriations bills in this orderly fashion so that we can expedite their consideration and be fair to all Senators who offered amendments when the Senate considered the bill. I thank the Senators very much for their careful attention to this discussion. 
Madam President, if all time has been used----

Mr. COCHRAN. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. President, let me say at the outset, when we started the consideration of appropriations bills this year it became important that we work out an arrangement whereby we proceed to consider bills even though they may not have passed by the House. And as all Senators know, it is the past custom, and the practice has been that appropriations bills originate in the House, they come to the Senate, and they are amended, and then they go to conference to work out the differences. 
Because of the crush of the time and the negotiations on a budget resolution and for a number of other reasons, it was considered appropriate for the Senate committee to proceed to consider original legislation on appropriations here in the Senate, for the subcommittees to mark up bills and the full committee to report out bills, whether or not the House had passed the bill or even met in the Committee on Appropriations to act on legislation. 
Consistent with that procedure, it was assumed that it would be appropriate at the conclusion of the Senate's action on an appropriations bill to obtain unanimous consent to hold the bill here, and that upon receipt of the bill as passed by the House, the Senate's action on the bill would be substituted for the House-passed bill. That it would then be considered as passed, conference would be invited, and we would proceed to work out our differences in conference. 
The Senate has passed 10 appropriations bills, all but two were Senate-originated bills; the House has passed only 7 appropriations bills. The process was working just fine, and with the cooperation of all Senators, until the agriculture appropriations bill was considered and action on the bill was nearly completed. Our leadership sought to get unanimous consent to substitute the Senate-passed bill, to insert it as an amendment to the House-passed bill when that bill was received. We could not get unanimous consent because the distinguished Senator from Iowa had offered an amendment, as other Senators had, during the course of consideration of the bill. The amendment had been disposed of, but he wanted to offer it again in a different form. So to do that, he objected. 
It was discovered that unanimous consent had to be obtained under the procedure we were using. So if he objected, he could hold up passage of the House bill, offer his amendment again, reconfigure it, and have the Senate vote on it again. That is what has happened. 
I think the Senate should reject the amendment on the grounds that the procedure is one where we will have to either stop considering Senate appropriations bills until the House has acted, or at the beginning of the consideration of an appropriations bill either get unanimous consent in advance to taking up amendments, or take some other action that would keep from happening what the Senator from Iowa is trying to make happen now. That is, on the whim or on the action of any individual Senator, to force this Senate to vote on all the amendments again or versions of the amendments that were defeated when we were considering the Senate bill. This becomes a terribly unwieldy and impossible procedure to follow. 
We have certain understandings all the time about how things will be done here in the Senate. There are certain procedures and rules that are institutionalized. After third reading, you cannot offer any more amendments, for example. I don't know of anybody that has tried to overturn or undo that rule. There are other procedures that have become a part of the practice of the Senate in doing business. The reason for the rule on third reading is that at some point there has to be an end to the offering of amendments. No one objected to the procedure we were following on the other appropriations bills; there was no alternative proposed; everybody agreed it was fair; it was serving the purpose of expediting action on appropriations bills; it was not a problem with the House; no one objected and said they were not going to permit the Senate to act on appropriations bills until the House has completed its action. We heard nothing like that from the House leadership. 
So what I am suggesting, Mr. President, as respectfully as I can, is that this is an unfortunate effort to go around the practices and the procedures that have been established for this purpose, to facilitate the orderly consideration of appropriations bills, and the Senate ought to reject this effort. The Senate ought to vote down this amendment. Tomorrow morning, after all time has been used under the unanimous-consent request, I will move to table the Harkin amendment. I urge the Senate to vote to table the Harkin amendment. 
It is the same amendment, in effect, that was offered and argued before the Senate on July 23. A motion to table that amendment was made and agreed to by the Senate on a record vote. Then, after amendments had been considered, a unanimous-consent request was made by our leadership, jointly supported, to limit the remaining amendments to a stated number. This was after the Harkin amendment had been defeated on a motion to table. The Senator should have asked, if he wanted to offer another amendment on this subject, that he be permitted to do so under that unanimous-consent request. And there was no request that he be permitted to do so. There were a few amendments left to be considered at that time, and so the Senate heard that request. There was no objection, and so it was ordered that the remaining amendments on the bill be limited to those stated in that order. The Harkin amendment was not one of them. No amendment to be offered by Senator Harkin was one of them. 
He or any Senator under that situation should be stopped from urging a right to offer another amendment then after that order was entered. After the order was entered, then we voted on the bill, as amended, and it passed 99 to 0 on a rollcall vote. Now, after that has happened, the Senate is obliged to consider this amendment in order to get unanimous-consent to receive the House-passed bill, which was adopted on the same day the Senate adopted its bill. We have to consider this amendment before the Senate again and have the Senate act on it in exchange for a unanimous consent agreement that we can then substitute the Senate-passed bill, as amended, for the provisions of the House bill and go to conference. 
I hope the Senate will not encourage this kind of activity in the future and make it impossible for us to proceed as we have been proceeding by acting favorably on the Harkin amendment. The Senate has to vote down the Harkin amendment or vote for a motion to table, which will be made tomorrow.  
Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. COCHRAN. I hope everybody will read Senator Domenici's remarks in the Record tonight. They refer to the fact that the offset this amendment proposes really isn't anything more than a temporary, 1-year offset. In order to achieve the savings that are purported to be added to the FDA account by this amendment being offered by the distinguished Senator from Iowa, a limitation on the use of Commodity Credit Corporation funds is imposed. But that is only for 1 year. In other words, that deserves some consideration, as Senator Domenici indicates. I agree with him. 
In addition, if $47 million in Commodity Credit Corporation funds is really needed for the Department of Agriculture to operate and maintain its computer systems in fiscal year 1998, as the Department indicates, those funds will have to be reprogrammed from other accounts, putting pressure on possibly the Farm Service Agency or other USDA agencies. 
I am focusing on and I hope the Senate will focus on why we are going to have to reject this effort to undermine the procedure we have, or either change the procedure. We had a procedure that seemed to satisfy everybody. And now there is an effort to undermine it completely. It ought to be rejected.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which will correct the abuses of Federal tax policy associated with the Reachback Tax provisions of the Coal Industry Health Benefit Act of 1992 (the Coal Act), while guaranteeing the solvency of the Combined Benefit Fund established by that Act. 
The legislation will also guarantee retiree health care benefits to approximately 75,000 retired unionized bituminous coal miners, their spouses or widows, and dependents. These coal mine retirees have received uninterrupted health care benefits which are among the best available to any group of retirees. 
The Coal Act also bestowed a windfall on one class of companies at the expense of another class, by shifting 62 percent of the cost of these retiree health benefits from the companies which had contracted to pay for them. Those costs are now shouldered by Federal transfers and private employers, who had no contractual obligation for retiree health care. 
Since its passage as part of the National Energy Policy Act, the Coal Act has been the subject of debate in both houses of Congress and tens of millions of dollars has been spent on litigation filed in the Federal courts by companies subjected to its retroactive taxation. Every case has been lost, however, as the courts have ruled that Congress has the power to tax and that it is up to Congress to make or change tax law. 
Mr. President, this confiscatory measure is called the Reachback Tax, because it reached back, over the decades and branded for taxation hundreds of companies, or their former owners. Many of those companies had been out of the unionized coal business for decades. Many identified by the Social Security Administration as liable for Reachback Taxes, are nothing more than skeletons of business entities holding the dwindling assets of former small enterprises. 
Some reachback companies were taxed because they, or a related party, had signed a UMWA multi-employer contract sometime between 1950 and 1988. When the contracts expired, however, each of the reachback companies had fulfilled its obligations to the union and the union members. There were no continuing ties between the reachback companies and former employees, and certainly no promises of lifetime benefits to those former employees, much less their dependents. Furthermore, the union had no claims pending against these companies for retiree health care. 
Mr. President, the Reachback Tax, passed without benefit of hearings or debate, has brought economic disaster to hundreds of innocent American companies, and hardship for tens of thousands of their workers. It has caused a favored class of companies to receive what they admit is a $130 million annual savings in retiree health benefit costs, and transferred that burden to companies--small and large in more than 30 States. 
The payment of this Federal tax is an unfair burden on all of the reachback companies. For every beneficiary assigned, the reachback companies have a liability of approximately $2,400 per year, stretching to the year 2043. No reachback company was prepared to absorb such an expense, nor should it have been. Obviously, jobs have been lost and job-creating projects have been delayed or canceled, and new products and the opening of new markets have been sidetracked because of the Reachback Tax. 
When the 102d Congress passed the Reachback Tax in the fall of 1992, it handed the UMWA Combined Fund Trustees the statutory responsibility to collect every cent of every premium due from every reachback company. It also conferred on the Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service the statutory responsibility to impose $100 per day, per beneficiary penalties on every reachback company which does not pay those premiums. Furthermore, the Department of Treasury's Office of Tax Policy reports non-paying reachback companies are liable for billions of dollars in penalties. 
Mr. President, billions of dollars are due the United States Treasury, yet the Treasury and IRS have not moved to collect these penalties. And, despite this financial threat, some 60 percent of all the reachback companies have ignored their statements, unwilling or unable to comply with a Federal law they view as unjust. 
Mr. President, the Reachback Tax was promoted during the conference on the Energy Act as an emergency effort to avoid an advertised deficit in the UMWA health benefits fund, and as necessary to save the retirees from an imminent suspension of health care benefits. However, the deficit never materialized. Instead, the General Accounting Office, the private firms Towers Perrin, Deloitte & Touche, and the UMWA Combined Benefit Fund trustees have confirmed a huge surplus in the fund. 
The legislation I am introducing today will statutorily guarantee that those surpluses continue through the life of the fund, as several new and permanent cost containment measures by the fund managers have dramatically lowered its expenses below original projections. Furthermore, the number of beneficiaries in the closed pool continues to decline because of mortality. 
Statutory relief is the only relief available to these reachback companies. It is needed immediately. I urge Senators to join in support of this legislation to mitigate an unintended impact of well-intended legislation.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume to remind Senators that this is an issue that came up during the welfare reform debate. The President proposed repeal of these startup grants during last year's welfare reform debate. 
In addition, the Democratic substitute welfare reform bill and the Republican welfare reform bill contained a provision to repeal these grants. Funds were taken from the grant program to expand the school breakfast and summer food service programs. 
Additionally, the Senate voted on a similar proposal to the Wellstone amendment on the Department of Defense authorization bill on July 9 and defeated it by a vote of 65 to 33. 
The question is not whether we need to do more in terms of acquainting students and school districts and parents with the availability of these important nutrition programs. The question is: Do we need Federal dollars that could otherwise go to the feeding programs themselves to be diverted for that purpose, or do we need to divert, as the Senator suggests, funds from other parts of this appropriations bill which are needed for other matters? 
Our suggestion is that we try to do a better job of working with local school districts, with parent groups, with the schools themselves, to make sure that all students are aware of the availability of these programs. 
We have increased funding for all of the food nutrition programs as a whole. The WIC program, for example, has over $200 million increased funding in this bill to guarantee that the current participation rate will not be compromised as a result of our effort to reduce spending and balance the budget. 
We are protecting those who are vulnerable. We are protecting those who need assistance to meet their nutrition needs in this budget. 
This is a sensitive bill on this subject, and I urge all Senators to vote against this amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time. 
I move to table the Wellstone amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

Let me, for the information of Senators, remind them that we have other amendments that were stated in the order as subject to votes beginning at 10 o'clock this morning with 2 minutes for debate between each amendment, which will be stacked with time equally divided. 
Those amendments under the order are the Wellstone amendment; the managers' package, which was adopted last night; the Bingaman amendment on CRP, which we are advised will not be offered; the Robb amendment on farmers' civil rights, which we hope will be resolved on a voice vote. We have proposed an 
alternative to the Robb amendment which is under consideration now, we are told, and a Johnson amendment on livestock packers' issues. We are advised that that will not be offered. 
So, with the vote on the motion to table the Wellstone amendment, and if we do not need a vote on the Robb amendment, then we will move to final passage immediately after the vote on the motion to table the Wellstone amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I am happy to hear the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Virginia, and I am encouraged by his attitude to try to work this out so that we will not have to prolong the time of Senators this morning on a rollcall vote if it is not necessary. We think that this is a matter of importance as well, and we hope that adequate funds can be made available so that there can be in the office of civil rights in the Department of Agriculture funds needed to carry on this important work.

 Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, As chairman of the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services, which has jurisdiction over postal matters, I would like to comment on Representative Molinari's Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act, H.R. 1585, passed by the House on July 22, 1997. This bill is similar to the Feinstein amendment included as part of the Senate's fiscal year 1998 Treasury/Postal appropriations bill, S. 1023, in that it would raise money for breast cancer research through a new, specially designed postage stamp--generally referred to as a semipostal--which would be purchased on a voluntary basis and as an alternative to regular first-class postage. 
H.R. 1585 differs from the Feinstein amendment in three respects. The rate of this semipostal would be determined in part, by the Postal Service to cover administrative costs and the remainder by the governors of the Postal Service to direct research. The total cost would not exceed the current cost plus 25 percent. In addition, following the 2-year period beginning on the date which the stamp would be publicly available, the General Accounting Office would report to Congress with an evaluation of the effectiveness and appropriateness of this method of fundraising and a description of the resources required to carry out this bill. Finally, the Postal Service would have the authority to decide when the stamp would be available to the public and would have up until 12 months after the date of enactment to make it available. 
Though this is a well-intentioned bill, and breast cancer research is a highly worthwhile cause, the idea of using the Postal Service as a fundraising organization for social issues is just plain wrong. If we start here, where do we stop? The list of diseases is endless. Requiring the Postal Service to issue a semipostal stamp for breast cancer would place the Postal Service and Congress in the very difficult position of determining which worthy organizations should receive Federal assistance in fundraising and which should not. 
The concept of semipostals has been around for years. Some nations issue them, however most do not. The European experience with this kind of stamp has shown that they are rarely as beneficial to the designated organization as would be expected. Consider the example set by our neighbor Canada. In 1975, the Canadian Postal Corporation issued a series of semipostal stamps to provide supplementary revenue for the Canadian Olympic Committee. It was reported that while the program received exceptionally good promotional and advertising support, it fell short of its intended revenue objective. Demand for the semipostals throughout Canada was reportedly insubstantial. The program--viewed as a failure--concluded in 1976. More recently, the Canada Post issued a semipostal to support literacy. With a surcharge of 5-cents per stamp, it raised only $252,000. After raising only a modest amount of money, combined with a tremendous administrative expense, Canada Post says they will not issue another semipostal. 
There is a strong U.S. tradition of private fundraising for charities. Such a stamp would effectively use the United States Postal Service as a fundraiser, a role it has never before taken on. The Postal Service's job--and expertise--is mail delivery. Congress should be mindful that the postage stamp pays strictly for postal operations. It is not a fee for anything but delivering the mail and the cost of running the service. In fact, section 3622 of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 precludes charging rates in excess of those required to offset the Postal Service's costs of providing a particular service. In other words, the Postal Service does not have the authority to put a surcharge on a postage rate that is cost and overhead driven. There is simply no legitimate connection between the desire to raise money for a cause, and maintenance of the Postal Service's mission of providing universal service at a universal rate. 
The goals of H.R. 1585 are laudatory. But, Mr. President, as I previously indicated during Senate consideration of the Feinstein semipostal amendment, the Postal Service should not be doing fundraising.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to present for the Senate's consideration today S. 1033, the fiscal year 1998 Agriculture, rural development, Food and Drug Administration, and related agencies appropriations bill. 
This bill provides fiscal year 1998 funding for all programs and activities of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, with the exception of the Forest Service, the Food and Drug Administration, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and expenses and payments of the farm credit system. 
As reported, the bill recommends total new budget authority for fiscal year 1998 of $50.7 billion. This is $3.2 billion less than the fiscal year 1997 enacted level, and $1.6 billion less than the President's fiscal year 1998 budget request. 
Reductions in mandatory funding requirements account for the overall decrease below the fiscal year 1997 enacted level, principally reflecting lower Food Stamp and Child Nutrition Program costs due to the enactment of welfare reform. Even with these reductions, $38 billion, or approximately 75 percent of the total $50.7 billion recommended by this bill, will go to funding the Nation's domestic food assistance programs in fiscal year 1998. These include the Food Stamp Program; the national school lunch and elderly feeding programs; and the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children [WIC]. 
Including congressional budget scorekeeping adjustments and prior-year spending actions, this bill recommends total discretionary spending of $13.791 billion in budget authority and $14.039 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998. These amounts are consistent with the subcommittee's discretionary spending allocations. 
The committee continues to place priority on increasing food safety to ensure that American consumers continue to have the safest food in the world. 
The bill provides $591 million for the Food Safety and Inspection Service, $17 million above the fiscal year 1997 level. This will enable the Food Safety and Inspection Service to maintain the current inspection system and to provide the needed investments required to implement the new hazard analysis and critical control point [HACCP] meat and poultry inspection system. 
In addition, the bill provides the increased funds requested as part of the President's $43 million governmentwide food safety initiative. This include the full $1.1 million proposed for the Food Safety and Inspection Service, the $4 million increase proposed for Agricultural Research Service food safety research, and $24 million in addition funds for food safety initiatives of the Food and Drug Administration. 
For agriculture research, the bill provides total appropriations of $1.6 billion, approximately $37 million below the fiscal year 1997 level. Included in this amount is a reduction of $62 million, reflecting termination of funding for buildings and facilities of the Corporate State Research, Education, and Extension Service; and a $27 million total increase for agriculture research and education activities. 
The total amount provided for the Agricultural Research Service continues funding for most of the agency's current research activities, and approves nearly $24 million of the increased funding requested to meet priority research needs, including research focusing on human nutrition, food safety, emerging diseases, and genetics resources. This additional amount includes $5 million for the survey of food intakes by children and infants required in response to the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. 
The recommended funding for the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service includes a $2 million reduction in funding for special research grants, an increase of $1.8 million for pesticide clearance, and $100 million, a $6 million increase above the 1997 level, for the National Research Initiative competitive grants programs. Appropriations for formula programs, including the Smith-Lever and Hatch programs, are maintained at 1997 levels. 
For farm credit programs, the bill funds an estimated $2.9 billion total loan program level, including $460 million for farm ownership loans and $2.4 million for farm operating loans. 
Total funding of $912 million is recommended for the Farm Service Agency, $44 million less than the 1997 level. The Department has worked in 1997 to achieve program efficiencies. As a result, we are assured that the funding recommended in this bill will prevent further personnel reductions during fiscal year 1998. 
The committee also has given increased attention to the need to provide affordable, safe, and decent housing for low-income individuals and families living in rural America. 
Estimated rural housing loan authorizations funded by this bill total $3.5 billion, a $60 million net increase above the fiscal year 1997 appropriations level. This includes funding to support $1.0 billion in section 502 low-income housing direct loans and $129 million in section 
515 rental housing loans. In addition, a total appropriations level of $541 million is recommended for the rental assistance program. This is the same as the requested level and $48 million more than the 1997 appropriation. 
The budget also proposed that an additional $52 million be provided to convert Housing and Urban Development Agency [HUD] section 8 rental assistance to USDA-financed rental assistance. While this proposal may have merit and yield long-term savings, the committee was not able to afford this further increase within its discretionary spending allocation. As an alternative, we would encourage the administration to work to fund this proposed conversion through the section 8 housing program. 
For USDA conservation programs, total funding of $828 million is provided, $57 million more than the 1997 level. This includes $730 million for conservation operations, and $47.7 million for the resource conservation and development program. 
USDA's Foreign Agriculture Service is funded at a level of $136.7 million, and a total program level of $1.1 million is recommended for the Public Law 480 program. 
The bill also provides a total level of $2.1 billion for rural economic and community development programs. Included in this amount is $644 million for the Rural Community Advancement Program authorized in the 1996 farm bill, consolidating funding for 12 existing rural housing, utilities, and business cooperative programs of the Department of Agriculture. 
The bill, as recommended, also appropriates $3.9 billion for the WIC Program and provides up to $12 million for the farmers market nutrition program. The recommended WIC appropriation level is $122 million above the 1997 level and will be sufficient to maintain the current average WIC Program participation level in fiscal year 1998. Also included in the bill is a provision to ensure the continuation of infant formula WIC Program rebate savings, and to provide the authority requested by the administration to give the Secretary of Agriculture discretion in allocating WIC funds. 
Further, the bill restores funding for the Pesticide Data Program, and provides the increased funds needed in fiscal year 1998 to conduct the Census of Agriculture. 
It also includes the full $202 million required to pay agents' sales commissions under the crop insurance program. Under current law, this shifts these costs from the mandatory to the discretionary side of the ledger beginning in fiscal year 1998. This places an added demand on the limited discretionary dollars available to the subcommittee. We have accommodated this new requirement, in part, through a limitation on the export enhancement program. This is a short-term fix. I am hopeful that this will not become a permanent burden on discretionary spending, and that a long-term legislative solution will be found to pay for this expense. 
For those independent agencies funded by the bill, the committee provides the budget request level of $60.1 million, an increase of $5.0 million above fiscal year 1997 level, for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It provides a $34.4 million limitation on administrative expenses of the Farm Credit Administration, as requested in the budget. And, it recommends total appropriations of $913 million for the Food and Drug Administration, $25.5 million more than the fiscal year 1997 level. This increase includes the full $24 million requested for FDA food safety initiatives and the $1.5 million increase requested for FDA buildings and facilities requirements. 
Only 27 percent of the total funding recommended by this bill is discretionary, subject to the annual control of this subcommittee. As I indicated previously, this bill accommodates increased funding required for such programs as WIC, crop insurance delivery expenses, rural housing, food safety, and other pressing program needs. 
Mr. President, arriving at these funding recommendations always requires a number of difficult decisions. I would like to thank the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Bumpers, as well as all other members of the subcommittee for their support and cooperation in putting together this bill. 
Mr. President, I believe this bill represents a balanced and responsible set of funding recommendations within the limited resources available to the subcommittee, and I hope Senators will support it. 
Mr. President, for the information of Senators, this bill is consistent with the allocations under the Budget Act that have been made to this subcommittee. We have worked very hard to identify the priorities that Senators have suggested and were in hearings on the budget proposals submitted by the President during the last several months. 
This has been an effort which has involved the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Bumpers, all of the members of our subcommittee, and our staffs. And all have contributed very substantively to the work that has led to the presentation of this bill today. 
We have increased funding for some of the areas where we thought there was justification for doing more in discretionary spending to help improve the services provided by the Government, such as in food safety, in agriculture research to make our farms more efficient and farming more profitable. We have increased funding to maintain the current participation caseload in the WIC Program, for example. And there are other areas. 
But I mention those three to illustrate that the committee has identified priority areas where we have provided increases. But overall, this bill reflects a reduction in spending from last year's level and a reduction in proposed spending for the next fiscal year below the request submitted in the President's budget. 
So we are trying to do our part to reduce the deficit and to control spending and to make those hard choices that are necessary if we are to in fact balance the budget. We think that the bill reflects a fair and thoughtful balance among the various needs that are sought to be met in this appropriations bill. 
We hope that Senators who do have suggested amendments will come to the floor soon during the consideration of this bill so that we can complete action on the legislation today. The leader has suggested that votes will probably not occur before 4 o'clock so that if there are amendments which require votes we are going to ask unanimous consent that those votes be stacked to occur beginning at 4 o'clock. And it is my hope that at the same time we can vote for final passage on the bill at that time or following votes on amendments. 
So with that in mind, I am very happy to yield the floor for the purpose of any amendments that Senators may have or for any comments any Senator, and especially the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, the ranking member of the committee, might have.  
Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, there are several amendments which have been brought to our attention that we know will be offered by Senators. We invite those Senators to come to the floor now and present their amendments for the consideration of the Senate. Some of them we expect to recommend approval; others we will have to oppose. We hope that we can begin that process soon so we can complete action on all amendments so that we can have votes on those amendments and final passage of the bill at 4 o'clock this afternoon. That is our goal. We need the cooperation and assistance of all Senators in order to achieve that goal. 
Let me say, in connection with the provisions of the bill, some of which the Senator from Arkansas mentioned specifically, I am particularly pleased we were able to continue funding for a lot of the traditional programs of the Department of Agriculture, which, because they are not new, because they do not seem innovative, are often overlooked or taken for granted. One that comes to mind is the Extension Service. We have seen a lot of changes in the Extension Service over the years, and we have tried to give that service the funds they need to carry out what many consider to be services and benefits that are not often applauded or recognized. 
We have seen so many new developments in technology and in modern science that we are able now to utilize in our rural communities and on our farms that have really elevated the standard of living in rural America to a point that is really quite impressive. We need a lot of things done that have not been done, but that is one of the agencies that, in my judgment, has done a great deal to help make life more livable, more enjoyable, and enrich the lives of many people every day because of the work that has been done. 
Another area that seems to me important to mention is the protection of our environment, our soil and water resources. The funds for conservation programs are increased because of the growing importance of developing new technologies, new ways to deal with pests and other problems in production of agriculture in an environmentally sensitive way. All of that is reflected in this legislation--those ambitions, those goals, and the importance of protecting the safety and health of those who live in rural America. 
We think the research activities done by the Agricultural Research Service also merit special mention. There are a lot of new things being undertaken by agricultural research scientists that offer great promise in terms of food safety, in reducing the necessity for using some products on our farms that many consider to have the potential for harming health and human safety. We are trying to make these changes and these improvements in agriculture possible through the development of new discoveries and new applications of science in agriculture. That is the agency that the Federal Government has charged with the responsibility of concentrating in that area. 
We also are developing, in concert with the legislative committees in the House and Senate, a level of funding of over $100 million for a comprehensive research effort that is new and recently authorized in the farm bill that was passed 2 years ago. We are hopeful that this will mean a more coherent approach to research and a more effective approach. Some worry about our spending too much money for so-called basic research and not enough money for applied research. The line between those two efforts has been blurred, and, in some cases, it is hard to distinguish between one kind and another. We appreciate the input we have received from those throughout the country who have presented information and have made their views known to the committee on that subject. 
This bill reflects an effort to bring together the best suggestions that we have had on that subject to have a more effective and more successful research effort for the betterment of our country. 
With the hope that other Senators will come to the floor and present amendments or suggested changes or comments on this legislation, I am prepared to yield the floor.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we have looked at the amendment proposed by the distinguished Senator from Kansas. I must say, it is targeted to a very narrow issue, and it seeks to withhold only $4 million of a $64 million account which is appropriated or recommended for appropriation in this bill for the administration of the Risk Management Agency that has a responsibility for administering the crop insurance program. 
I am not going to oppose this amendment. I sympathize with the goal. I sympathize with the effort to get the attention of the administration to do something that was required of them in the 1994 act of Congress. I am hopeful the Senate will approve the amendment and that this will help achieve the goal of the distinguished Senator from Kansas. 
Let me also say, too, I am very grateful for his generous comments about the work of our subcommittee and the efforts we have made to present a bill that reflects the needs of our country in connection with agriculture and agricultural production and all of those other activities that are funded in the legislation. He is very kind to point out that we have worked hard. He has been a big help, too, in certainly helping us understand the provisions that were contained in the last passed farm bill, which he had a great deal to do with writing as chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. We are lucky to have him in the Senate, and we appreciate his continued advice and counsel and assistance in these matters.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Bumpers. This amendment contains two technical changes to the competitiveness provisions of the domestic cotton program. This amendment has been scored by the Congressional Budget Office as having no cost. I am informed that the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee has no objection to the amendment. 
The original provisions in the law were designed to ensure that U.S. cotton is competitive in both domestic and overseas markets. The program has worked well, but changes made to the program in 1991 and 1996 have had unintended consequences. 
The amendment I am offering would address those problems by doing two things. First, it makes it possible for the various components of the program to work simultaneously to ensure that we do not rely too much on cotton import quotas to make domestic cotton competitive. Second, it slightly increases a ceiling that unduly restricts the availability of the step 2 certificate program. By capping loan rates in the 1996 FAIR Act, Congress unintentionally restricted the operation of the cotton competitiveness program. The amendment eases the restriction slightly, but would not affect loan rates. 
Mr. President, this is an amendment that has been cleared on both sides of the aisle. I know of no objections to it. I know of no Senators who want to speak on the amendment.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this has been a very vigorous and informative debate, in my judgment. I have no parochial interest in that our State does not grow tobacco. We have no program for tobacco, for any of the producers of agricultural commodities in our State, but I am persuaded by the arguments that have been made by the Senator from Kentucky about the economic consequences of this amendment, and that is bolstered by the letter the distinguished Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford], mentioned that had been received by me today from the Secretary of Agriculture which points out the detrimental effect that the amendment offered by the Senator from Illinois would have on agriculture producers in the United States if it were to be passed by the Senate. 
So I am constrained to oppose the amendment of the Senator from Illinois, but I am also troubled very much by the second-degree amendment that has now been offered by my good friend from Kentucky which limits the application of the crop insurance program to farmable acreage of less than 400 acres. And that is troubling because so many of our farmers in my State and elsewhere throughout the country have more than 400 acres under cultivation, and this would be discriminatory in a different kind of way. So I am troubled by that amendment and I do not want to see that passed. 
So I am in a position and I think the best course of action for me as manager of the bill is to move to table the underlying amendment. If that motion to table passes, then it takes both the underlying amendment and the second-degree amendment with it as I understand it. 
So at this point, knowing that debate has been occurring for a little over an hour now and with the knowledge that we will set this aside, not to vote on it now but at a time to be determined later, I now move to table the underlying amendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. COCHRAN. For the information of Senators, this amendment modifies the amendment previously agreed to, that had been offered by me for Senators D'Amato and Sarbanes regarding rural housing. 
Mr. President, we hope to continue to consider amendments of Senators so we can proceed to complete action on this bill today. We now have two votes that have been set to occur beginning at 4 o'clock this afternoon. 
There are, to our knowledge, at least two more amendments that are going to be offered that will probably require rollcall votes. What we would like to do is to stack votes on those amendments immediately following the votes that have now been ordered, and then have final passage of the bill. 
To do that, we need to have the cooperation of all Senators who are interested in the passage of this bill and those who have amendments to the bill. We hope they will come to the floor as soon as possible to offer their amendments. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I understand that we have 2 minutes, equally divided, on the motion to table the Durbin Amendment. I made the motion to table. The Durbin Amendment seeks to do away with crop insurance payments for tobacco farmers and any disaster assistance payments that might fall due under the law. I moved to table it. It carried with it a second degree amendment by the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford], which limits crop insurance payments to farms 400 acres or smaller. 
So, as you may see, unless we table the Durbin amendment, you are going to cause a lot of disruptions in agriculture for two reasons. I hope that the Senate will vote to table this amendment. This is an agriculture appropriations bill. Both of these amendments would change the law, not funding levels. Let's stick to the purpose of our bill and please vote to table the Durbin amendment.

<DOCNO>105-cochran-ms-3-19970723</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the issue here was joined with the offering of the amendment by the distinguished Senator from Iowa. It is an amendment related to the Food and Drug Administration's funds for an antismoking regulatory program that has been developed and put out by the Food and Drug Administration. The issue is whether or not there is sufficient funds in the FDA account to help pay the cost of this regulatory program. 
Some Senators may not be aware of the fact that we have increased in this legislation the proposed funding for FDA by over $20 million. As a matter of fact, I think the total is around $30 million--$24 million for the FDA account for this next fiscal year. This is in comparison with this current year's funding level. So there are funds available to carry out the additional food safety initiatives that the Food and Drug Administration has proposed. There is a specified $4.9 million available, the same amount as last year, for the FDA's smoking regulatory program, or antismoking regulatory program. 
One thing that has to be kept in mind, I think, to try to understand, get a perspective on this issue is that litigation is underway. There was a lawsuit filed in North Carolina. Some of the regulatory initiatives of the FDA were upheld and some are on appeal. 
Mr. President, the other aspect of this issue is that there has been a negotiated settlement among attorneys general and the tobacco industry that involves the commitment of the tobacco industry to make certain payments to help pay health costs and Food and Drug Administration activities in connection with the use of tobacco and trying to convince people that smoking tobacco is bad for you. 
This bill does not in any way try to adversely affect or take away from any initiative of that kind. We did say, when we were discussing this legislation in the subcommittee and at the full committee, that we assumed some funds could be made available from the tobacco industry to help pay costs that might not be fully funded in this legislation, costs of the Food and Drug Administration. So we see nothing wrong with making that assumption in our bill. The Harkin amendment imposes an assessment on tobacco companies that would cause funds then to be created that could then be given to the FDA for additional program costs. 
The Senator from North Carolina has offered a second-degree amendment changing the source of the funding from the assessment to an ethanol assessment, so that the funds would come from the ethanol program, in effect, for the antismoking program of FDA. And so there is where we stand now. 
The yeas and nays have been ordered on the Helms amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered on the Harkin amendment. And so that is the situation as I understand it. There was a suggestion that one way to deal with this is to put it before the Senate in the form of a motion to table the Harkin amendment. 
Now, I could make that motion, but I do not want to make that motion and cut off the right of Senators who want to speak on this issue. And I understand from the Senator from Iowa that he might want to speak further on it. The Senator from Rhode Island is a cosponsor of the Harkin amendment and he wanted to speak. So I am reluctant to make that motion. But it would be my hope that we could resolve the issue in that way. If that is not satisfactory to the Senate, the Senate can work its will. But that is the suggestion that I have for dealing with the issue, of wrapping it all up in one vote, if the motion to table is approved. If the 
motion to table is not approved, then we have a vote on the Helms amendment and we have a vote on the Harkin amendment. So that is my suggestion for how we can wrap it all up.

Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
One part of the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Nevada suggests that foreign corporations should not be eligible for funds under this provision of our bill. 
Our bill does not contain any language relating to this program because we are not limiting the spending of funds that are directed by the legislative language in the farm bill. The last farm bill that was passed directs that funds be made available by the Department of Agriculture for this program in the amount of $90 million. Our bill does not limit the use of those funds. It does not any further restrict the use of those funds. 
The amendment the Senator has offered will change existing legislative language. I want to read the amendment. 
Funds made available to carry out this section shall not be used to provide direct assistance to any foreign for-profit corporation, or the corporation's use in promoting foreign-produced products. It shall not be used to provide direct assistance to any for-profit corporation that is not recognized as a small business concern described in section 3(a) of the Small Business Act, `excluding a cooperative . . . an association described in the first section of the act,' et cetera--`... a nonprofit trade association.' 
So the whole point is that this program has been reformed, reformed, and reformed. The Senator from Nevada just cannot be pleased that this program continues to be authorized and funded and funded. Our committee is simply letting the funds be used, as directed by law, by the Department of Agriculture. 
So what he is suggesting is cut the funds that are directed by law to be spent by the Department of Agriculture on this program, and to further restrict them with additional legislative language. 
What amount of reform is going to be enough? I mean it gets to the point where I suggest we are nit-picking this program now. Once upon a time there were charts in here with McDonald's hamburger signs saying that they were benefiting from this program, and we were appropriating money that was being used by huge corporations to increase their sales. All the program was ever designed to do was to combat unfair trade practices overseas in foreign markets where we were trying to compete for our share of the market in the sale of agriculture commodities and food products. We were giving the Department of Agriculture money. It was called the Targeted Export Assistance Program first. Then it was the Market Promotion Program. Now it is the Market Access Program. We can't even get the right name so that it is acceptable. So the Senator continues to make changes. 
I think we ought to just say this program is working. It is increasing sales of U.S. farm-produced commodities in overseas markets. There is a limited amount of money available. It is prescribed by law. 
Everyone here had a chance to debate the farm bill. We had a chance to debate all of the limiting language that any Senator 
wanted to offer. And that was done. It is over with. It is not being abused anymore, if it ever was. It is not being subjected to any kind of abuse that I know anything about. 
So my suggestion to the Senate is to table this amendment and get on with the consideration of the rest of the bill. It is not necessary to adopt it to seek any reforms that need to be made. 
So I am hoping the Senate will reject the amendment and vote for the motion to table. 
Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I yield myself the additional 10 minutes. 
I was just handed a chart that shows how much money comparatively is being spent on export or market promotion by the European Union as compared with how much we are spending in the United States of taxpayer funds for the same purpose. 
I do not have one of these big charts on an easel, and I don't know if everybody can see this, but this big colored part of the chart here is how much is spent by the European Union, and it is $10.11 billion. This is this year. You cannot see anything on the other side except white, but if you look very, very carefully, you can see just a little bit of a line here and it is $0.15 billion. And the Senator is trying to cut that further. 
Now, think about it. The European Union is spending more money promoting the sale of wine than we are spending as a nation in our Federal programs on all of our United States-produced commodities and foodstuffs that are being sold in the overseas markets. Think about it. And this program is available only to trade associations, cooperatives and small businesses. Think about it. 
Now, this is getting ridiculous. We have changed this program every time it has come up, or changes have been attempted every time it has come up. It has been reformed and modified and refocused. We are trying to give the Department of Agriculture some funds to use in situations where our exporters are being denied access to markets or are being unfairly treated in some way by barriers that are being erected to prevent the sale of United States-produced agriculture foodstuffs and commodities. 
Whose side are we on, for goodness sakes? Think about this. We are being asked to cut the program more and to limit it more so it is tied down tighter than you can imagine. 
Finally, I think those who ask for access to these funds, these market access program funds are going to finally give up. It is going to be so much red-tape, so many new rules and regulations, that it is going to take a whole firm of lawyers to figure out how to get some of these funds to use if you need them. 
I am hoping that the Senate will say OK, enough is enough. In the farm bill of last year--year before last--language was used to try to define as carefully as could be the authority for using these funds, and the amount of money was not given any discretion at all in terms of the appropriations process. It was directed in the farm bill that $90 million be spent or made available to the Department of Agriculture to spend under these tightly constricted and restrained definitions. Now the Senator is saying the appropriations bill, because it does not limit the expenditure of these funds that are directed, ought to be amended so that it will, and that there ought to be further limitations on the spending. I say I think enough is enough. We have reformed the program. 
There is a coalition of exporters that has written me a letter again saying that the Senate, they understand, may have to consider another amendment to further reduce or eliminate funding for the Market Access Program. A similar amendment was defeated last year, they point out in this letter. The program has been substantially reformed and reduced; it is targeted toward farmer-owned cooperatives, small businesses and trade associations; it is administered on a cost-share basis with farmers and ranchers and other participants; they are required to contribute as much as 50 percent toward the program costs; on and on and on. 
Here is a list of all of those who are a part of this coalition, double-spaced columns here, a whole page of U.S. agriculture producers and growers trying to sell our share in the world market. Exports have become so important to U.S. agriculture. There are markets out there that are growing and expanding. There are opportunities for us. They create jobs here in the United States for our U.S. citizens. Vote for America for a change. Vote against this amendment.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the kind remarks of the distinguished Senator from Minnesota in connection with the fact that the program discussed by him, and which is the subject of his amendment, was not in any way reduced in funding by the action of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee or the full Committee on Appropriations. As a matter of fact, we tried very hard to identify needs in the nutrition area, including the school lunch programs, child nutrition programs, food stamps, Women, Infants and Children feeding program, and others. I think Senators will notice that there are substantial increases in funding for WIC, for example, to make sure there is a full participation permitted next year, and that means we had to add $200 million more to that account to help guarantee that no one participating in the WIC Program now would be denied eligibility or participation due to a lack of funding next year. 
And in every other way, we tried to look at the evidence before the committee that we had available to us during our hearings to assess the needs and to make available the funds that we thought were necessary to help make sure that all Americans have access to a nutritious diet, that the food supply is safe, and that, in every respect, we continue to make sure that people in our society do not have to go without food. 
Having said that, the Senator is correct in that there are still a lot of unmet needs, there are still a lot of problems. We can identify areas of the country that have special needs. I am sympathetic to those needs and assure all Senators that this committee will continue to try to work to alleviate those needs. 
The amendment addresses language that was adopted by the Senate and eventually contained in legislation signed by the President that modified a lot of the programs that do provide assistance to individuals. In the welfare reform effort, there were a number of the laws that were modified, some under the jurisdiction of our Agriculture Committee--this was one of them--that were made necessary through the establishment of spending ceilings in certain program areas. 
Our committee had the unwelcome task in many cases of identifying programs that could be helpful in some areas of the country but, for various reasons, maybe the States or local school districts, it was thought, could do the things that the Federal Government had previously been trying to do. And this is one area. 
Outreach is very important. School districts, local communities, State governments all have resources, all have very dedicated people leading them in elected positions and in every way are available to help deal with problems that the Senator from Minnesota has discussed. 
I do not know what the disposition of the legislative committee will be on this amendment, whether it will suggest that it ought to be accepted or resisted. We are consulting with the leaders of the legislative committee, and we understand that they will continue to look at this and maybe tomorrow when we return to consideration of this amendment in the morning when we convene, there may be a better understanding of what the response will be at that time. 
But at this point, I am willing to let the Senator continue to discuss his amendment if he likes. He has the right to do that under the order that has been entered, and we will be happy to continue to work with him on this and other issues that he is interested in.

I would note that the bill before us does not allow the collection of Mammography Standards Act or PDUFA fees in the absence of authorizing legislation from the Labor Committee being approved by the Congress and signed into law. Further, I am well aware of the Senator's efforts to bring a bill reauthorizing PDUFA and modernizing the FDA to the floor and strongly agree that reform of the Agency and PDUFA reauthorization must go forward together. I look forward to debating these issues in the full Senate in the near future.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources be granted permission to meet during the session of the Senate on Wednesday, July 23, for purposes of conducting a full committee hearing which is scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. The purpose of this hearing is to broadly examine three aspects of natural gas issues into the next century. Specifically, the committee will look at world energy supply and demand to 2015, what percentage of that will be filled by natural gas, and how this could be impacted by other large scale energy projects, such as nuclear, that are being developed in Asia. Second, the committee will examine the role of Government in large scale gas projects in foreign countries, what type of assistance the U.S. companies competing for overseas projects receive from the U.S. Government, and what can be done in the United States to make American gas more globally competitive. The third aspect for consideration will be the emerging gas field development technologies that are making natural gas more economical to market.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services, which has jurisdiction over postal matters, I must point out that the Feinstein amendment would require the U.S. Postal Service to issue a special postage stamp. 
Such a special stamp--generally referred to as a semipostal--would sell for 1 cent above the basic first-class letter rate, with most of the differential going to fund breast cancer research. Though this is a well-intentioned amendment, and breast cancer research is a highly worthwhile cause, the idea of using the Postal Service as a fund-raising tool is not a good one. The list of diseases that should be given added research funds is endless. Requiring the Postal Service to issue a semipostal stamp for breast cancer would place the Postal Service and Congress in the very difficult position of determining which worthy organizations or research programs should receive fundraising assistance from the Postal authorities and which should not. 
The concept of semipostals has been around for years. Some nations issue them, but most do not. The European experience with this kind of stamp has shown that they are rarely as beneficial to the designated organization as expected. Consider the example of Canada. In 1975, the Canadian Postal Corporation issued a series of semipostal stamps to provide supplementary revenue for the Canadian Olympic Committee. It was reported that while the program received exceptionally good promotional and advertising support, it fell short of its intended revenue objective. Demand for the semipostals throughout Canada was reportedly insubstantial. The program--viewed as a failure--concluded in 1976. More recently, the Canada Post issued a semipostal to support literacy. With a surcharge of 5 cents per stamp, it raised only $252,000. After raising only a modest amount of money, combined with a tremendous administrative expense, Canada Post says they will not issue another semipostal. 
There is a strong U.S. tradition of private fund-raising for charities. Such a stamp would effectively use the United States Postal Service as a fundraiser, a role it never has had. The Postal Service's job--and expertise--is mail delivery. Congress should be mindful that the postage stamp pays strictly for postal operations. It is not a fee for anything but delivering the mail and paying the cost of running the service. In fact, section 3622 of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 precludes charging rates in excess of those required to offset the Postal Service's costs of providing a particular service. In other words, the Postal Service does not have the authority to put a surcharge on a postage rate that is cost and overhead driven. There is simply no legitimate connection between the desire to raise money for a cause, and maintenance of the postal service's mission of providing universal service at a universal rate. 
This is an effort to bypass the legislative process with an amendment on an appropriation bill and even though the Feinstein amendment's goals are laudatory, it should be rejected.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee for his work in bringing this bill to the Senate. 
While I commend the chairman for his efforts, I have concerns about the trends in the funding levels that are being proposed for the Mississippi River and tributaries projects, particularly those in the Yazoo Basin of Mississippi. 
The President's budget proposed a 20-percent reduction from last year's level for Mississippi River and tributaries construction projects. The budget also proposed cutting projects in the Yazoo Basin by over 50 percent. As the committee has indicated in its report that accompanies this bill, this reduction, along with others in operations and maintenance and investigations, is unacceptable. 
Mr. President, Congress addresses flooding and other natural disasters as they occur around the country. The victims who have suffered damages derive benefits from supplemental disaster assistance legislation, as we saw just recently. This year, it was the Dakotas and other States. A few years ago, it was in the Midwest when the Missouri River flooded, and nearly every year, there is some degree of flooding in the Yazoo Basin in the State of Mississippi. The lower funding levels that are being proposed for projects to control flooding in the Yazoo Basin result in more delays, higher construction costs, and more damages occur year in and year out from floods in this region of the country. It will also result in increased spending on disaster assistance instead of funding long-term solutions to the flooding that occurs in this area. These delays will only increase the likelihood and the severity of flooding in the future and damages that result from those floods. 
Incremental funding for these and many other Federal construction projects is a reality of the current budget environment. But incremental funding results in cost increases over the life of a project that has been authorized and that has been partially funded in the past. It will cost $54 million as a result of even a ten-year funding cycle on the three main projects just in the Yazoo Basin alone--the Upper Yazoo project, the Upper Steele Bayou project, and the Big Sunflower River Maintenance project. That amounts to a 20 percent cost increase. 
Mr. President, I will continue to work with the committee and the subcommittee to identify the levels of funding necessary to maintain project schedules that are more realistic and more cost-effective in the future. I hope that we can reach agreement and convince the administration that it needs to recognize the inevitable consequences of these budget cuts that are, year-in and year-out, submitted to the Congress on these projects. 
My friend from New Mexico has done an excellent job, a masterful job in dealing with all of these pressures and cross-currents of interests that flow to this committee and are involved in the development of this legislation. And so I am proud of the work product that he has produced, and we support it. I am voting for it. We hope that by working together we can continue to identify ways to assure adequate funding levels for these projects that have been authorized for a long, long time. 
Read the book `Rising Tide,' which talks about the beginning of the effort to get the Federal Government's resources involved in the Mississippi River and tributaries project. It is on the best-seller list now and I invite everyone to read that book. There are projects which I have identified in this project definition that are still not completed, and that flood was in 1927. We continue to, incrementally, piecemeal, see these projects increasing in real costs because of the failure to address them in a more aggressive way. 
That is the point of my statement. People are beginning to wonder--are these projects ever going to be finished? They have a right to raise the question. If they are not finished, the flooding that occurs every year is going to continue to be an annual disaster for the folks in this region.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, to refresh the memory of Senators about this amendment that is now the pending business, at an early stage in the consideration of this authorization bill I offered an amendment for myself and on behalf of the distinguished Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] to modify the administration's existing policy relating to the export by U.S. companies of supercomputers in the global marketplace. 
The reason this amendment was considered important for the consideration of the Senate on this bill is that it, first of all, involves exporting technology that no other country in the world has. Unlike many of our arms sales, defense equipment or technology sales around the world, whether to friendly allies or those who may not be so friendly, computer technology has evolved here in the United States to the point that we have the corner on the market. No one can compete with us in many areas of supercomputer technology. The Japanese have developed an impressive capacity in this area as well. 
But one thing has come to our attention in the subcommittee that I chair on Governmental Affairs, the Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation and Federal Services. We have had a series of hearings that began the first month of this year. We have had at least one hearing every month. And we have explored one aspect of weapons proliferation. 
It was at a hearing that we had recently on the exporting of technology that we learned that the United States was a proliferator of weapons technology that was threatening the security of the United States, and putting at risk United States servicemen, servicewomen, other interests, and other assets and interests throughout the world, because we were giving countries like Russia and China and others the capacity to improve the lethality, the accuracy, and the capabilities of nuclear weapons systems through the exporting of technology that they were using to simulate tests, which they would not otherwise be able to do, and to upgrade the quality and accuracy of their missile delivery systems and weapons systems. 
This does not make good sense. Japan's export control policy is more restrictive than our policy. The President came into office after a campaign which involved a lot of discussion about changes in the world security situation. We all rejoiced in the past two administrations when so much progress was made in terms of reducing the threat to the security of the United States because of the changes going on in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. 
The fact is, that we were able to relax somewhat when those weapons systems were no longer targeted at us. But the fact remains that there is a tremendous potential threat, not only in Russia but some of the other states of the former Soviet Union for the development at some future date of an attitude that may 
put our security relationship at greater risk than it is today. And so we do have an interest in refraining from doing those things ourselves that end up unwittingly or carelessly investing in others the capability to develop modern, more lethal, and more dangerous weapons systems that could threaten our security interests. 
One other aspect of this is that part of our hearings have been involving the sale of weapons systems by countries like Russia and China. We had a whole series of witnesses come before our committee talking about this as a problem now, selling missiles, for example, to Iran, selling nuclear weapons technology to countries like India and Pakistan and others. 
But we see emerging around the world a new capacity on the part of many of these countries that we do not trust at all to have those kinds of systems that can inflict great damage, destroy assets that we have, and people, troops that we have in the Middle East or in South Korea, sailors who are on ships around the world who are now vulnerable to cruise missiles in the Mediterranean that we never had to worry about before because of this proliferation of missiles and technologies and weapons systems. 
So that is the big issue here. So that is why we have suggested that the administration's new policy--when they came into office they said we are going to open up and take the controls off of our exports so we can take advantage of the new security situation around the world, let our businesses enjoy a more relaxed atmosphere. That is all fine. But what we have learned in the last 18 months of this new policy--it was put into place in October 1995--the new policy has resulted in supercomputers coming into the possession of the Chinese Academy of Sciences which has a component that is involved in the modernization of the Chinese nuclear weapons program and systems. They now have seven supercomputers that came from the United States that they are using, they potentially are using, to develop a more modern weapons capability in nuclear weapons. 
The Russian chief of atomic energy boasted recently that his operation, the group of people he has under his control in his laboratories--Chelyabinsk 20 and Arzamas 16--these are locations where they do work on nuclear weapons systems in Russia that they now have a supercomputer capability previously unknown, compliments of the United States. 
This is a sad state of affairs because of a policy that is much more relaxed now. And I want to describe the details of it. That is why we have these 90 minutes reserved here so Senators will understand how serious a threat this is and what it means in practical terms. 
We have seen the administration develop this new policy that identifies countries in categories. They call it a four-tier system. 
Tier 1 countries are our best friends, NATO Allies. There are no restrictions. Tier 2 are those countries where it is more lenient still. Tier 3 and Tier 4. Tier 4, there is a complete embargo on the exporting of computer technology of all capability. You cannot sell computers under our new system to these Tier 4 countries. They are Iran, Libya, North Korea, Cuba, a couple of others. 
Tier 3 are those countries where, depending upon the capability of the computer, there are restrictions. There are no restrictions for the PCs, the personal computers, no restrictions. But when you get up into these high-end computer systems there are restrictions, you have to get an export license from the Department of Commerce. And the way you decide whether you need a license or not is to decide if the end use of the computer is going to be for a military purpose or a civilian purpose 
or if the user is a military entity or a civilian entity. 
The problem with the administration's policy is the Commerce Department does not tell our exporters whether the end use or the user is military or civilian. They leave it up to our exporter to find that out for themselves. That is the problem. That is what this amendment is about. We are trying to change one part of this policy to require the Federal Government to approve the sale--in the case of these countries in Tier 3, China, Russia, and a number of others--where the potential for use of this technology for military purposes has become so apparent and real. 
Now, I am not suggesting that our computer companies are carelessly and negligently and wholesale selling these high-end computers, these advanced computers, without careful analysis of who their customers are. Some of them are making a very conscientious effort to ensure that. But what they cannot do and they do not have the capacity to decide, that in the reality of this new situation there are front companies being developed--in the case of China, for example, in Hong Kong and maybe other places, as well, and I cannot discuss all of this because some of it is classified--but there are companies that have been established, whether by governments or government-related industries, who are able now to purchase U.S. computers because they are a civilian company, and then turn around and sell it to a company that is affiliated with one of these governments. That is what has happened, apparently. 
So do we want to continue to leave to the capabilities of a computer exporter the responsibility of making these determinations, by understanding what is a front company and what is not? They do not have the resource to do that. Our intelligence community, however, and the resources of our Federal Government are much more nearly able to make this kind of determination. 
Under Secretary Reinsch at Commerce talked about this policy at hearings in our committee, and you could tell that Commerce realized that changes had to be made in the way they were monitoring and supervising and implementing this new policy. After our hearing, they started making changes. They started putting out a list, for example, of entities around the world that they think are suspicious enough or they have evidence enough so they can say you cannot tell this entity or that entity in these Tier 3 countries because we know that puts at risk the potential use of this technology for nuclear weapons purpose or other weapons of mass destruction purpose. So they are making some changes. The fact is they left a lot of things off the list, they left a lot of entities off the list that we know in the past have purchased or wound up having these technologies. 
So it creates a situation where a change needs to be made right now. This is the change that we think is best. We are pleased to have the cosponsorship on this amendment of distinguished leaders in the area of proliferation here in the Senate. Senator Thurmond, who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee, supports our amendment. Senator Warner supports our amendment. Senator Glenn, who has previously served as chairman of this proliferation subcommittee and chairman of the full Committee on Governmental Affairs, and been a leader in this effort his entire career in the Senate, and he announced yesterday--and put a statement in the Record, which we invite Senators to look at--that he is supporting this amendment. Senator Durbin of Illinois was in the hearing and has taken an active role in trying to understand and deal with this emerging problem. It has emerged full-blown into one of the most serious threats to our Nation's security, and it has been done because of the way this policy has played out and the way the problem has increased. So we think that Senators ought to look carefully at this. 
Let me just say this chart tries to explain how a small area of the computer industry and the hardware that are involved are affected by this amendment. The diagonal lines here that say Chelyabinsk-70 and Arzamas-16 are nuclear weapon labs in the Soviet Union, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences that we know wound up with United States computers that can be used now throughout China for the purpose of developing new modern weapons of mass destruction. This represents numbers of total computers, 6.34 percent of the total U.S. computer export markets affected, and targeted only those computers going to those Tier 3 countries with lethality or capability of 2,000 MTOPS to 7,000 MTOPS. These are millions of theoretical operations per second. That is how you measure the capability or speed of computation of computers. That is the way the Commerce Department has broken this down and divided up these up so that they reflect the capabilities of these computers. A PC has a capability of 250 MTOPS. We are talking about advanced computers, very expensive, and, of course, the computer industry is competing with each other to make these sales. 
This is another point: If you were running a big computer company--IBM, Cray computer, whatever the names are--you do not want to have to go to the Secretary of Commerce and tell them you are thinking about making a sale or you have a customer on 
your screen that you think you can sell a big, heavy-duty, new, modern, expensive computer to, you do not want to tell anybody about it. If you are a salesman, you do not want that word out on the street. You do not want somebody at Commerce looking into it and asking a bunch of questions of you. You would like to go in and make the sale. If the customer is ready to buy your computer, you want to go in, sign the deal, and make the sale. Of course, you have a responsibility under the new policy to satisfy yourself about who the end user is, what the end-use purpose is, and so you hurry to get that done. No matter how conscientious you are, you might not do as good a job with that, particularly if you have a competitor who is trying to make the same sale. 
So we are in a situation where the competition of the U.S. market and economic system is working against our interests in protecting our national security and maybe taking a little bit more time and understanding what the potential is for this sale in terms of coming back at us in a new, advanced missile that has capabilities never before possible because of U.S. computer manufacturers selling in these markets to the countries that have the money to buy them. You are talking about the big countries. I am particularly concerned about Russia and China, specifically. We are developing, we hope, better relationships with both countries. We are working to improve our relationships around the world, make this a more stable, safer, peaceful world. That effort has to continue. 
What we are doing today, in calling it to the attention of the Senate today, is not at all designed to sour or make that process more difficult, but we have to recognize that this is still a dangerous relationship in many respects. These are the countries that have the greatest capability in the world today, and past attitudes among some in those countries that do not have our interests at heart, do not have our security uppermost in their mind, who may be capable of diverting some of these technologies for uses such as the development of new generations of weapons of mass destruction which not only they but some of their friends end up with in the due course of business. 
I have gotten calls and we have had visits from some in the computer industry saying this amendment is not necessary; it is not necessary to put this in the law. Why don't we just change the policy? Well, we can't change the policy. We are the Congress. The executive branch makes policies. They issue regulations. 
One of the Senators asked me in a formal colloquy yesterday why we needed to put this in a bill. Well, it is the only way that Congress has available to it to participate in the policymaking process in helping to do our part to ensure that our Nation's security is protected. We cannot issue a regulation, we cannot modify a policy other than doing it the way we are doing it right now. 
Now, the Senator from Minnesota, who is my good friend, has an alternative. He wants to do things other than change the policy. He wants to ask GAO to investigate it. We are already having GAO investigate this and gather more information. We are continuing to discuss with GAO other areas where we might get information that will be more helpful to the Congress in understanding what our options are. He suggests that Commerce ought to publish a list of prohibited purchasers. That list is good for as long as the ink is drying, but no further. What if a change occurs and they have not gotten a new list out with 
modifications, and you see nobody is on the list with the name of a company that you have been contacted by and you make the sale or you try to make the sale, and you decide this is a civilian company. There was nobody in uniform who came to see you, so your assumption is that it is a civilian. Well, the names change, these identities change, the purposes of companies change, the contacts and relationships of companies, particularly in this part of the world we are talking about, can change. 
So you are going to invite them to start changing things. If they see they are on the list, they will probably dissolve their corporation if their purpose was to be a front for the People's Liberation Army, and some of these companies are. How is an innocent U.S. exporter to know? You cannot have all these agents and assets to detect this kind of thing on the payroll of the company. But the U.S. Government has resources, and they have a better opportunity to make these determinations. 
What we are simply saying is--not as the Senator from Minnesota wants us to do, which is nothing. His amendment just absolutely guts the effort to change the policy. It says there will be no change in policy as we are suggesting here. There will be no change. We will leave it up to the Commerce Department to improve its policy by making a list, and we will ask the GAO to look into this more. That is not good enough. I am hoping the Senate will vote down the Grams amendment and support the Cochran-Durbin amendment. 
The cosponsors, I hope Senators will consider, who are on this bill right now, and I do not have a last count, but we are well into the double digits. Around 20 Senators have cosponsored this amendment. It is a strong statement of support for change that is needed now to protect our Nation's security. If we fool around and argue about this and are mealymouthed and don't want to hurt anybody's feelings or scare any of the computer companies, they don't want to get Congress to agree on any sale and they want to use their best efforts--I am not suggesting they don't, but they don't have the capacity, they don't have the expertise, they don't have the reach, the broad reach of the U.S. Government and its intelligence community to make these determinations. 
So for these few computers with MTOPS between 2,000 and 7,000, for these few countries in tier 3, we are suggesting that any sale has to be first approved by the Commerce Department to ensure that the end use is civilian and that the end user is civilian and not military. That is all this is. Every other computer sale and administration policy can continue without any new restraint whatever. 
I am hopeful the Senate will review this situation carefully, Mr. President. 
I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee for his contribution to the understanding of this issue and for his cosponsorship personally of the amendment and his announcement that the distinguished Senator from Maine, Senator Collins, is now a cosponsor of the amendment. This indicates that we have a broad base of cosponsors for the Cochran amendment, which means, if you are for the Cochran amendment, you would vote against the Grams and Boxer substitute for the Cochran amendment, because their amendment undermines the effort to impose a change in the current policy to require simply that our Department of Commerce approve sales of computer technology and computers by U.S. firms to overseas customers that have a computing capability of between 2,000 MTOPS and 7,000 MTOPS, if they are certain kinds of countries called Tier 3 countries, to ensure that they are not military users or that the computers will not be put to a military use. 
The problem with the current policy is that the Department of Commerce is leaving it up to the U.S. exporters to make this determination now. Some have gotten into trouble because some, like Silicon Graphics in California, are now under a grand jury investigation because of sales made to questionable users in violation of the current policy. The question is whether they knew or should have known that the end use was going to be military or the end user was going to be military; whether they exercised that degree of diligence required by the current policy. 
Do we want to continue that kind of policy that puts at risk all of our computer companies when engaged in these international sales? I say no. It is time to put the onus, not on the computer company trying to make a sale abroad, but on the Department of Commerce, which has the responsibility of administering its own policies. But they are shifting their burden to the exporter, away from the Government, and this is causing difficulty. It has resulted in seven very sophisticated, high-end supercomputers being used now by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, an arm of which is involved in the modernization of the Chinese nuclear weapon program and capabilities. In Russia, the chairman of the equivalent to the Atomic Energy Commission there, boasted that they now have a supercomputer with a potential previously unknown, because of U.S. technology exports to Russia. That is the entity that modernizes and maintains the nuclear weapons of Russia. 
What we are unwittingly doing by carrying forward and going forward with this policy with no change, which is what the Grams amendment basically suggests, it says make a list, tell everybody who they should not sell to--you cannot do that. You cannot possibly make a list and put down all the fronts for the People's Liberation Army or others who might be involved in either developing new weapons of mass destruction or exporting the technology for these weapons: North Korea, Iran, other countries and nation-states that we know now are developing more and more sophisticated and lethal weapons of mass destruction capability, with delivery systems. We know that is going on. 
Here we are providing the technology to do simulations that they cannot do now without our technology. They cannot buy this. They cannot buy this from any other country except the United States. And we are leaving it up to U.S. exporters, saying our policy depends upon the good intentions and the capabilities of our U.S. civilian companies to determine these end uses and end users, who they are, what they are going to do with the technology, whether or not they are going to transship it to some other entity. 
There are facts on the record, as a result of hearings held in our subcommittee that has been looking at proliferation issues all year, that are overwhelming and completely persuasive on this point. This policy ought to be changed. The only way 
Congress can influence change is by adopting a change, by doing so in this amendment. We cannot issue a regulation. We cannot make an administrative policy change here in the Senate. We can ask them to do it. We have already done that and it has not resulted in the change that is necessary. It is simply if you were a suspicious end user, we want the Department of Commerce to certify that it is OK to make that sale. 
The Senator from California correctly discusses whether or not some of our closest allies are going to be adversely affected by this amendment. Israel has been purchasing computer technology under existing policy with licenses from the Department of Commerce. That is going to continue. That is not going to change. There is not going to be any slowdown in the process if someone is a trusted ally or friend. We don't even require licenses for our NATO allies. They are Tier 1 countries. But the Tier 3 countries--that includes China, Russia, and a lot of other countries--do have to have the approval of the Department of Commerce under our amendment if the computer capability is within a certain range. 
These are not PC's. The Senator from Missouri, and my dear friend, suggests that this is like the PC's on our desk, at our workstations in our offices. He is talking about the Pentium server, that is the network, the hardware for the entire network. I know he did not mean to misrepresent it, but you have to understand what he's talking about. He has acted like an attache walks into Radio Shack and buys one of these computers that has an MTOPS speed and capability that would be described in this amendment. That is not true. You cannot do that. 
First of all, an attache could not afford it. These are expensive. The fact is, we are talking about only 6.34 percent of the total supercomputer sales that would be affected by this amendment. Mr. President, 95 percent of all of the sales have been approved within 30 days that do require licenses. The Senator from Minnesota said it is over 100 days you had to wait to get approval. That is not borne out by the facts, by the testimony before our subcommittee by the people at the Department of Commerce. 
So I am hopeful that Senators will think carefully about what we are trying to do. I know the computer companies are putting a lot of pressure on, sending everybody messages and phone calls and the rest. I would not want to have to go through another process. But we are talking about only such a small part of the market, a small part of those manufactured workstations and other large pieces of hardware that have the potential to be used to upgrade lethal weapons systems and missile systems to make them more accurate, to make them more lethal, to make them competitive with the U.S. arsenal that is designed to protect us. And we are going to put at risk our own system of national defense? We can't do that. 
Mr. President, I urge Senators to vote against the Grams-Boxer amendment and then vote for the Cochran-Durbin amendment.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume consideration of S. 936, the defense authorization bill, and begin 90 minutes of debate on the Grams second-degree amendment to the Cochran amendment regarding supercomputer export controls. At approximately 11 a.m. the Senate will vote on or in relation to the Grams amendment, to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the Cochran amendment. Following that, the Senate will continue consideration of amendments to the defense authorization bill with rollcall votes occurring throughout the day. 
As the majority leader announced last night, the scheduled cloture vote will be postponed temporarily today, and an assessment will be made later today of the progress being made on the defense bill. With the cooperation of all Members, that cloture vote may not be necessary if good progress is made on the bill. 
It is the intention of the majority leader that action on the defense authorization bill be completed this week. Senators should anticipate a busy session today that will extend into the evening. Work is anticipated as well on Friday, if necessary, to finish this important legislation. That announcement is made by me at the request of the majority leader for the information of all Senators. 
Mr. President, as contained in this announcement, there is now 90 minutes that is available on the Grams amendment. If the Chair wants to make the announcement, I will yield the floor temporarily for that.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, based upon statements made by Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration William Reinsch, it is highly unlikely that personal computers capable of more than 2,000 MTOPS will be available by next year. At a recent hearing Secretary Reinsch said, `high-end Pentium-based personal computers sold today at retail outlets perform at about 200 to 250 MTOPS,' and at another hearing, this one before my subcommittee on June 11, he also said that `computer power doubles every 18 months, and this has been the axiom in the industry for I think about 15 years.' The math is straightforward; if top-end PC's are capable of 250 MTOPS today, 18 months from now they'll be capable of 1,000 MTOPS; and 54 months from now--in 4 1/2 years--they'll be capable of 2,000 MTOPS. Fifty-four months from now is not, contrary to the claims of some computer manufacturers, the fourth quarter of next year.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, according to the Department of Commerce, from the period January 25, 1997, through March 1997, 1,436 supercomputers were exported from the United States. Of that number, 91--or 6.34 percent--went to Tier 3 countries, some of which went with an individual validated license. We know, based upon statements by Russian and Chinese Government officials, that some of these supercomputers are in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a military facility in Chungsha, China, and in Arzamas-16 and Chelyabinsk-70. Arzamas-16 and Chelyabinsk-70 are both well-known nuclear weapons development facilities in Russia; the suggestion by exporters that these high performance computers would be in either of these locations and not be doing nuclear-related work appears to be somewhat self-serving and contrary to common sense. According to Russia's Minister of Atomic Energy, these supercomputers are '`10 times faster than any previously available in Russia.' The Chinese Academy of Sciences, which has worked on everything from the D-5 ICBM to enriching uranium for nuclear weapons, hasn't been shy about its new supercomputing capabilities, saying that its American supercomputer provides the Academy with `computational power previously unknown' available to `all the major scientific and technological institutes across China.' American high performance computers are now available to help these countries improve their nuclear weapons and improve that which they are proliferating.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the current policy is established in regulation, and regulation has the force and effect of law. For Congress to participate in the policymaking process it must pass legislation. Furthermore, the pace of technological advancement is such that, at some point in the future, it is entirely possible that the 2,000 MTOPS level--which is the administration's current floor--will have to be raised. That is why, on July 7 on the Senate floor, I said that if, 4 or 5 years from now, industry's optimism proves to be correct, I will be pleased to return to the floor and offer legislation adjusting the 2,000 MTOPS level.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment will not in any way reduce the number of American high-performance computers going to Tier 3 countries. It does not change the administration's standards for making the exports; all that is changed is the question of who makes end-use and end-user determinations for Tier 3 countries. In fact, at least eight high-performance computers have been exported to Tier 3 countries with an individual validated license since this policy started. Only entities that shouldn't be receiving these supercomputers in the first place won't, because of closer scrutiny by the executive branch, receive them under this amendment. So, the suggestion by some manufacturers that this amendment would somehow reduce their market share is an argument that has no basis in fact.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, Japan has a more restrictive export control policy than does the United States. I support making the Department of Commerce export licensing process more efficient, though a more efficient process cannot come at the expense of national security concerns, which must be adequately addressed in the process. I would note, as well, that more than 95 percent of export licenses considered by Commerce are currently approved in 30 days or less.

Mr. COCHRAN. If the distinguished Senator would yield, I appreciate very much not only his question but also his very helpful involvement in this issue and cosponsoring the amendment. 
But he gets to the central point of the debate here. It is not that this amendment sets any new levels of prohibition or granting authority for export sales. It does not change any of those levels. The level that is established by the administration is the 2,000 MTOPS level. We do not change that for tier 3 countries, as demonstrated in the chart I showed a while ago. 
We were told in our hearing that 250 MTOPS is about the current power of a PC which is sold in the market here in the country now. And that under the so-called Moore's Law that doubles every 18 months. So it would be 4 1/2 years before you get to a level where you would even reach the 2,000 MTOPS level which is the trigger level for tier 3 countries that have to have a license if the end use or the end user is military. If they're civilian, you do not have to have a license at all. 
What this amendment changes is who determines the end use or the end user. Our amendment says it should be the administration's responsibility. Current policy is that exporters have the responsibility of making that determination. That is the only thing we change.

Mr. COCHRAN. Our information, derived at our hearings through expert witnesses, was that we have the highest capability of any country in the world in terms of supercomputer manufacturing technology. We manufacture the state-of-the-art supercomputers. We do not have any competitors. Japan manufactures some high-performance supercomputers but their export policy is more restrictive than ours. They require licensing, we do not. 
What we are suggesting here is that the policy of our administration is flawed in that it ought to make the determination in those questions where end use and end user is relevant as to whether you can or cannot make the sale, the Government ought to monitor and verify that this sale is permissible. And it applies to only 6.34 percent of the total computer sales of all American exporters in the export market.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it gives me a special pleasure this morning to welcome our guest Chaplain who has delivered the opening prayer, Dr. Charles E. Poole. 
He is currently serving as pastor of the First Baptist Church of the city of Washington, DC, but he and his family will be moving soon to Mississippi where he has accepted the call to serve as pastor of my church, Northminster Baptist Church in Jackson, MS. We are delighted to have this very special person come to our State and serve in this way. We appreciate very much his being our guest Chaplain this morning and delivering such a fine prayer. 
Dr. Poole earned his undergraduate degree from Mercer University in Macon, GA, and graduate degrees in divinity from the Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, NC. 
Before he became pastor of the First Baptist Church in Washington, he served for several years as the pastor of the First Baptist Church of Macon, GA. He was also on the board of trustees of Mercer University in Macon for 5 years. He is an outstanding clergyman who is well respected here in the Washington area. His sermons and other writings have been published and very favorably received. 
He and his wife Marcia have two children, Joshua and Maria. We are looking forward to getting to know all of them better. 
We thank him, on behalf of all Senators, for his contribution to today's session.

He worked very effectively to help establish a new relationship between our two countries and in the process created a bond of friendship and mutual trust that will serve us well as we build on that well-laid foundation. 
He is now writing a book on the United States-Vietnam relationship and because of his experience and intelligence, I'm sure it will be an important contribution to our understanding of this unique subject. 
Before he left he discussed his impressions of the current situation and recent events at a meeting of the United States-Vietnam Trade Council on April 7. It gives such an encouraging assessment of the possibilities for the future in that country Senators should take note of it.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the comments of my good friend from Minnesota in support of his second-degree amendment. I must say that the language of the amendment is appealing in some respects, particularly the suggestion that the General Accounting Office ought to be asked to conduct a review of this situation and the apparent risk to our national security caused by the export policies of this administration with respect to the sale of supercomputers and its technology to foreign purchasers. 
There is some question in my mind about the efficacy of the last part of the amendment particularly, because in our hearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee the administration officials talked about the fact that the reason they did not publish and make available a list of end users or potential purchasers of these computers at this time was because of diplomatic considerations and the questions about whether it puts in jeopardy our intelligence-gathering capabilities and a number of other issues that concerned them enough so that they do not now make available this list even privately to exporters of supercomputers. 
So to require them to publish it in the Federal Register and to make it available to the general public is probably something that ought to be reconsidered and not approved by the Senate. They should not be compelled to do that. It seems to me that the reasons they gave in our hearing for not doing it even privately was enough and sufficient in my mind to raise questions about whether we should compel them to do it publicly. 
But looking back at the earlier complaints and the comments from my friend about the Cochran-Durbin amendment, let me say that this is not an effort on our part to roll back regulatory policy with respect to military end users. 
It is an effort to change the procedures and to put the onus and the responsibility for determining whether a sale is permissible or consistent with national security concerns on the administration rather than on the sellers of the computers. 
Computer companies do not have the capacity to make determinations on their own about the use to which the computers they are selling in the international market will be put, or the relationships between prospective purchasers and governments, particularly in the case of China or Russia. The U.S. Government, though, has the capacity, through its contacts worldwide, to do a much more reliable and accurate job of assessing whether or not someone would be a purchaser who would use these computers to enhance the lethalness of nuclear weapons or missile technology to put our own citizens at risk, the lives of Americans at risk, in a way that they would not otherwise be, but for the sale of our computer technology. 
So it is for that reason and that reason alone not to prevent the sale to legitimate purchasers who will use it for civilian or other appropriate purposes. It is in those situations where there is very real concern based on knowledge that we have about the potential harmful use--harmful to our own interests--that we ought to have the power, we ought to have the process reserved to the Federal Government to prohibit that sale in those selected situations. 
Right now the policy of our Government is to prohibit the sale of this category of computers if it is for the purpose of being used for a military use or sold to a military organization. It is prohibited under current law, under current regulations. So the suggestion that the Senator makes that we are imposing new restraint on trade in this amendment is not true insofar as it concerns the sales for military purposes. 
Current policy simply says to the exporters, if you know it is going to be used by a military organization, you cannot sell it--2,000 to 7,000 MTOPS speed computers cannot be sold under current U.S. law and under current regulations. So this amendment that we are offering does not impose a new definition that restrains the sale of computers. It simply says that the Commerce Department is going to give you the OK. Once you tell us who you will sell it to, they will tell you whether it is permissible or not. That is all we are saying. 
The current policy is it is up to the exporter to decide whether this is a military end use or an end user. If they sell it to someone they knew was a military end user, they violate the law right now. The problem is a lot of exporters, the people in the business of manufacturing and marketing supercomputers, do not have the capacity to make this determination. 
Also, there are motivations that are different. They are in the business of making money. They are in the business of selling as many as they can. The stockholders of these companies want to see sales go up, and so when there is a close question--we are not questioning anybody's motives here today--but where there is a close question and you really do not know for sure, the temptation is to go on and make the sale, particularly if there is really no hard evidence there. 
Now, there have already been those cases where there is enough evidence that people have sold computers to end users who are military organizations or who are involved in nuclear weapons programs, that they are now under investigations by a Federal grand jury. This is serious business. That could have been prohibited, maybe, if you had the Commerce Department saying, `OK, it is fine, go ahead and make this sale. Here is your license.' Then the civilian marketer is off the hook. The Commerce Department makes the decision. That is the issue. 
Do we leave it up to the honor system that has been developed by the Clinton administration, which is not working--46, we thought it was 46, but it turned out to be 47 as a result of the hearing we held of new information of these computers that are in the hands of Chinese entities and we do not know what they are being used for. Or if our Government knows, they cannot tell us in a public hearing session. We have to go behind closed doors to find out what they really know. 
From what we can talk about right now, we know that this policy ought to be changed, and for the business of `this is not the right place, this is not the right time,' and the jurisdictional question--well, the Commerce Department has jurisdiction over commerce issues, the Banking Committee has some jurisdiction, our Governmental Affairs Committee has jurisdiction over compliance with nonproliferation treaty provisions. We are constantly monitoring the question of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in our committee, and we came upon this information through the exercise of our oversight responsibilities. 
It is a matter of some urgency, in our view, that this matter be addressed, and we think the U.S. Senate will agree with that. I think we have suggested a very modest but a very necessary first step in the process of reform of our policies over exporting computers. This administration came into office having made a promise to the computer industry that they were going to make some dramatic changes in the rules so that they 
could sell more computers in the international marketplace. That is fine. That is fine. But they have adopted a policy that is not working. It is not working to protect our national security interests, which is important. It is working in that it has helped sell a lot more computers and a lot of people have gotten rich under this new policy. I do not have a problem with that. No complaints are being made about that. But it was supposed to be a policy that both enhanced our ability to compete in the international computer market but at the same time protected our national security interests. It worked on the one hand, but it has failed on the other. 
We now see the Atomic Energy Minister in Russia, whose name is Mikhailov, bragging in a public forum about the new supercomputer technology they have bought from the United States that is 10 times more powerful and sophisticated than anything they have had before. This agency is in the business of modernizing the nuclear weapons that the Russians have. 
We have this Nunn-Lugar builddown program supposedly trying to dismantle these weapons of mass destruction, and we are very actively involved with the Russians in that regard. But at the same time, to be selling them the technology to make the weapons, they are more accurate, more lethal, capable of destroying potential adversaries like the United States, it seems we are working at cross-purposes with ourselves. We are trying to work to keep down the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and here we are, in this instance, contributing to the proliferation of more lethal nuclear weapon systems. Certainly that is true in the case of Russia and China. We know that. We know that. 
So what do we do about it? Nothing? Have some hearings? Have the GAO spend another year looking at things? We agree GAO ought to look at this. We are asking them to do that, too. They have already begun some work at our request. I agree with the Senator that we need to do more, but to just say the Senate should not act on this suggestion, this is a modest first step. It is not a suggestion for comprehensive reform at this time. We need more information. We need to do more work to decide on the details of a comprehensive, workable policy than is on the books now and administered by our Commerce Department. 
So, but for the provisions of the amendment offered by the Senator that I have suggested caused me some concern, I would like to be able to support the amendment so that we could then go on and vote to approve the amendment as amended, but I cannot do that at this point. I hope the Senate will not agree to the amendment. 
I know under the announcement that was made earlier today on behalf of the majority leader, there will be no votes on amendments today. They will be set aside and we will come to them later. So there will not be a vote today. Knowing that there will not be, I will not push the issue any further, except to suggest to the Senate that this is an issue that ought to be debated, considered carefully, and we ought to vote for this amendment that I have offered with the cosponsorship of Senator Durbin. 
Incidentally, I asked the other day, after we had described the amendment, that Senator Abraham be added as a cosponsor. I have now been asked to seek unanimous consent that Senator Lugar be added as a cosponsor. I make that request at this time, Mr. President.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on the 11th of June, my Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services of the Committee on Governmental Affairs held a hearing on the subject of proliferation and U.S. dual-use export controls. The hearing focused almost entirely on the subject of U.S. exports of high-performance computers, also known as supercomputers. 
In preparing for and conducting this hearing, we learned that the administration's policy on supercomputers, which are an integral component for developing, producing and maintaining nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, and practically all advanced weapon systems, could put American lives and interests at risk. 
I am offering this amendment as a necessary first step to staunch the flow of American-made supercomputers to countries and places they should not be going. 
On October 6, 1995, President Clinton announced a new export control policy for supercomputers which decontrolled supercomputer exports to a great extent. He said that he had `decided to eliminate controls on the exports of all computers to countries in North America, most of Europe, and parts of Asia.' Continuing further, `For the former Soviet Union, China, and a number of other countries, we will focus our controls on computers intended for military end uses or users, while easing them on the export of computers to civilian customers.' 
There is, of course, a delicate balance that must be struck between presenting U.S. national security by controlling dual-use exports and promoting exports. We must be careful not to place American manufacturers in a position where they cannot export goods that other countries are exporting, though, of course, our national security interests dictate that some goods cannot be sold to some countries no matter how irresponsibly other countries behave. For example, the willingness of some Western European countries to work with Libya to construct a chemical weapons complex does not justify the involvement of United States companies in similar ventures. 
President Clinton's October 6, 1995, announcement liberalizing U.S. export controls on supercomputers established four country tiers to guide American exporters, at the same time eliminating restrictions on the export of computers capable of less than 2,000 million theoretical operations per second-- this is referred to as an MTOPS--for all except tier 4 countries, it is unrestricted if the computers are capable of less than 2,000 MTOPS. Whether it makes sense to decontrol computers capable of up to that level is one of the issues which should be studied more extensively. I will ask the General Accounting Office to do so. 
Country tier 1, consisting primarily of NATO allies, effectively establishes a license-free zone for U.S. high-performance computer exports. Computers of unlimited capacity under this policy can be exported to any tier 1 country without regard to the identity of the end user or the intended end use. 
The policy for country tier 2, which includes countries such as South Korea, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic, allows unlicensed exports to any country within this tier of computers capable up to 10,000 million theoretical operations per second. And the policy continues the virtual embargo against those nations--the terrorist nations such as Iran, Iraq, Syria, and North Korea--that comprise country tier 4. There are many deficiencies in this new policy, Mr. President. 
Our amendment addresses what we consider to be the most significant deficiency in need of immediate attention. It is a problem specific to the part of the policy pertaining to country tier 3 which I want to describe now. The policy announced by President Clinton for tier 3 countries, which include Russia, China, and some others, is based entirely upon the questions of who the end user will be and for what end use the supercomputer is intended. End use and end user are the critical factors for tier 3 exports. 
The tier 3 policy requires an export license to be granted by the Department of Commerce under only two circumstances: First, if the computer to be exported is capable of 2,000 MTOPS and is going to a military end use or end user; and second, if the computer to be exported is capable of 7,000 MTOPS and is going to a civilian end use and end user. This policy requires no export license for manufacturers who want to sell supercomputers capable between 2,000 and 7,000 MTOPS to buyers in tier 3 countries when there is to be a civilian end use and end user. It is the exporter--not the Department of Commerce, not the U.S. Government--who is given the latitude under the policy for determining whether the purchaser's representations are accurate, that it is not a military end user and will not use the supercomputer for a military purpose. 
The Clinton administration policy further requires American exporters to act on the honor system, policing themselves and deciding themselves whether or not the end user is going to be a military entity or will be putting the supercomputer to a military use. 
Unfortunately, some companies have already been tempted to take a chance. Maybe they were not sure; maybe they were tempted by the profits of the transaction. Whatever the motivations and the understandings or lack of information, or for whatever the reason, we have known that some transactions have involved the sale of supercomputers, without objection from our Department of Commerce or our Federal Government to those who may be putting computers to a military use, or maybe military entities themselves. 
We know now, for example, based on statements from the Russian Minister of Atomic Energy and from United States Government officials, that there are at least five American supercomputers in two of Russia's nuclear weapons labs: Chelyabinsk-70 and Arzamas-16. Minister Mikhailov of the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy has not been reluctant to proclaim what these high-performance computers will be used for, and he said in a speech in January they will be used to simulate nuclear explosions, and that the computers are, in his words, `10 times faster than any previously available in Russia.' 
Four of the five supercomputers we are aware of publicly in Russia's nuclear weapons labs came from Silicon Graphics, a company in California, I think. According to the CEO, Edward McCracken, it was his company's understanding that the computers were for environmental and ecological purposes. It may be that Silicon Graphics was unable to determine whether a Russian nuclear weapons lab was going to be the military end user or if its supercomputers would be put to a military end use. But it seems from the statements made by the Atomic Energy Minister in Russia that they certainly are available to them for those purposes. 
We also know at least 47 high-performance computers have been exported without licenses to the People's Republic of China. One of the computers sold also by Silicon Graphics is now operating in the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is a key participant in military research and development, and works on everything from the DF-5 ICBM--which, incidentally, is capable of reaching the United States--to uranium enrichment for nuclear weapons. There can be no question about the Chinese Academy of Science's status as a military end- user. 
According to the Department, its new Silicon Graphic Power Challenge XL supercomputer provides it with computational power previously unknown, which is available to all the major scientific and technological institutes across China. We can only hope that some of these institutes in China are using the supercomputer's technology for peaceful purposes, but we cannot help but suspect that some may be a part of the weapons development program in China, which is on a fast track to modernize their nuclear weapons system and capabilities and their missile technologies and all the rest. 
At our recent hearing, we had the benefit of testimony from the Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration, William Reinsch, who said that the Clinton administration doesn't know if any of the supercomputers in China or Russia are being used for weapons-related activities, but the Commerce Department is in a difficult position. You have to appreciate how difficult it must be to have the responsibility for both promoting exports and controlling exports, and that is the dilemma that this Department is in. But we have to realize that nuclear weapons labs are potential end users and have been shown already by the evidence before our committee that they have obtained American supercomputers and they may be put to a military end use. 
In 1986, the Department of Energy published an unclassified report entitled, `The Need for Supercomputers in Nuclear Weapons Design.' The report's conclusion included this statement: `The use of high-speed computers and mathematical models to simulate complex physical processes has been and continues to be the cornerstone of the nuclear weapons design program.' These computers continue to be important to the design and production of nuclear weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction and delivery systems. 
I do not see how we can tolerate the continuation of a policy that makes it easier for Russia and China to modernize their nuclear weapons and delivery systems. We ought not to be in the business of helping them to improve the quality of our weapons, their technology, their delivery systems, particularly when there is evidence of proliferation from those countries to other countries. 
This amendment, I want to point out, does not include a comprehensive revision of our export control policy. It is targeted to one specific part of the policy. We hope that with the findings that are obtained from the General Accounting Office study and our further studies in our subcommittee, which is reviewing this entire issue and proliferation problems generally, that we will be able to come up with and work with the administration and hopefully develop a consensus agreement on a modification of our export policy. 
We think the time is here, it is now, when we need to stop the unrestricted flow of these supercomputers to potential users all around the world that can threaten our Nation's security and put at risk American citizens. It is not like some other country has these systems available for sale on the market. They do not. We are the state-of-the-art producer of the supercomputers. Japan has the capacity to produce supercomputers as well, but their export policy is more restrictive now than ours is. So we are the culprit, if we are putting in the hand of military end users and military weapon system producers in other countries technologies that are superior to what they have now and that can be used to make more lethal their nuclear weapons and their missile systems. We are putting in jeopardy the lives of our own citizens. 
I am hopeful that this amendment, in concert with other efforts that we are making, will help improve our capacity to monitor these exports and require license in those situations where we think this export might present a proliferation problem, because we know from previous experience in Russia and China, as well, private companies have demonstrated that they do not have the adequate restraints to make determinations about where and how their exports are distributed into other country's hands. We know that transshipments are occurring. We also know that it is difficult to verify in a country like China what the private company that may be the purchaser of a supercomputer really intends to do with it once they have it. It is difficult to get access, to get information, and so a private company has a very difficult time developing an information base on which it can really make a conclusion about the end use or the end user. That is another reason to change this policy. The Commerce Department is going to have to do a better job of compiling information about those who are in the market worldwide for these supercomputers and making this information available to our exporters and the companies that have these supercomputers for sale. 
Mr. President, I encourage the Senate to look very carefully at this proposal. I hope that the amendment will be agreed to. Senator Durbin and I were involved in questioning witnesses before our subcommittee just recently on this subject, and we are convinced that this is a policy that has to be changed, and the time to change it is right now. 
Our amendment does not in any way change the policy President Clinton announced in October 1995, though it is my judgment that the entire policy is in need of serious evaluation and revision, and I will also be asking the General Accounting Office to assist me in this evaluation. Our amendment requires the Department of Commerce, in concert with other parts of the executive branch, to determine whether an entity in a tier 3 country is a military or civilian end-user, and whether the end-use will be for a military or civilian purpose. By their exports to Russian and Chinese nuclear weapons labs, private companies have demonstrated that they do not do an adequate job of making this determination. Government has the resources and information available to make the best determination possible, and should step in to ensure that America's national security is not being compromised for sake of a more profitable quarter. 
In a country like the People's Republic of China, how can any private company have the resources to determine whether an end-user is military or civilian? 
Some suggest that the process can be left unchanged, but that the Commerce Department can do a better job of helping industry make the proper end-use and end-user determination by publishing a list of end-users to which high performance computer exports are prohibited. I disagree with this suggestion. Any published list would necessarily be incomplete, for a complete list would compromise U.S. intelligence sources and methods. Any published list would also serve as a marketing tool for the world's proliferators, making their job of finding specific clients easier. And, any published list would be only too easy to manipulate by both the purchaser and the exporter who may not be willing to operate under the honor system. If, for example, Chelyabinsk-70 is on the list of prohibited locations, does that mean that a Chelyabinsk-71, not on the list, can receive U.S. exports of high performance computers? What's to stop an exporter like Silicon Graphics from accepting the convenient suggestion that, `yes, Chelyabinsk-70 does nuclear weapons work, but at Chelyabinsk-71 we conduct only environmental research.' 
Publishing a list could reduce, but not eliminate, the problem we face, though in so doing other serious problems would be created. Congress needs to change the current process so the Government--with the most access to information with which to make the most informed determination of military end-use and end-user--makes the decision on whether to ship these computers to countries who are modernizing their weapons and delivery systems and engaged in proliferation of these technologies. America should not be participating in the qualitative upgrade of Russian and Chinese proliferant activities. 
The Commerce Department maintains that President Clinton's supercomputer export control policy is working. Commerce continues to make this claim despite the fact that the administration's policy has allowed American supercomputers to be shipped to Russia's and China's nuclear weapons complexes, and who knows where else. If this policy is working, what would a policy that wasn't working look like? Would there be more supercomputers in Russia and China, or would we know absolutely that our supercomputers were in Iran, North Korea, or other terrorist states? 
The cold war's end does not decrease the need for the continued safeguarding of sensitive American dual-use technology. While there may no longer be a single, overarching enemy of the United States, there is little doubt that many rogue states, and perhaps others, have interests clearly contrary to those of the United States. Helping these nations--or helping other nations to help these nations--to acquire sensitive dual-use technology capable of threatening American lives and interests makes no sense. 
I thank Senator Durbin for his work with me on this issue, and look forward to continuing to work with him to get to the bottom of this problem. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this amendment.  
Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Successful Reading Research and Instruction Act. It establishes a panel that will include parents, scientists, and educators to conduct a study of the research relevant to reading development and advise the Congress of its recommendations for disseminating its findings and instruction suggestions to those who would like to have them. 
Reading is the skill students must master to meet life challenges in a confident and successful manner. For a child, breaking the code of written language not only opens academic opportunities; it is a cornerstone to building high self esteem. Both reading and self esteem affect the knowledge and experiences that form a child's character and future. 
Teaching children to read is the highest priority in education today. Many teachers and parents I've talked with are frustrated and confused about what method of reading instruction is best. Every American should be concerned that 40 to 60 percent of elementary school children are not reading proficiently. Even more disturbing is research that shows fewer than one child in eight who is failing to read by the end of first grade ever catches up to grade level. 
Success in reading is essential if one is to progress socially and economically. In fact, most of the federally funded literacy programs are targeted to helping adults learn to read because the education system failed them, and more than likely, failed them at an early age. 
This indicates that we need to start solving the problem of poor readers at the beginning, instead of working backward. It seems to me that the first step to finding a solution is to seriously analyze sound, rigorous research on the subject. 
Mr. President, at a hearing on April 16, of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, I brought to the attention of the Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, research by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development mandated by the Health Research Extension Act of 1985, and asked that he use such research in the development of federally supported reading 
programs. This research is ongoing, in a collaborative network with multidisciplinary research programs to study genetics, brain pathology, developmental process and phonetic acquisition. NICHD has spent over $100 million over the past 15 years, and has studied approximately ten thousand children. 
On June 11 of this year, when officials from the National Institutes of Health came before the same appropriations subcommittee, I asked Dr. Duane Alexander, the Director of NICHD, about this study. Dr. Alexander's testimony about the research confirmed what I suspect most teachers already know--at least 20 percent of children have difficulty learning to read. But the research also suggests that 90 to 95 percent of these can be brought up to average reading level. 
As a result of this research, techniques for early identification of those with reading problems and intervention strategies are now known. But administrators, teachers, tutors and parents are not aware of the key principles of effective reading instruction. The NICHD findings underscore the need to do a better job of teacher training, as researchers found fewer than 10 percent of teachers actually know how to teach reading children who don't learn reading automatically. 
I am surprised that the Department of Education hasn't looked to this study and found a way to effectively get the information to teachers, schools, parents, and most importantly, teacher colleges. 
What scientists have learned from their studies of reading hasn't been passed on to the teachers who are teaching, so parents are telling us their kids aren't reading. It is time we put all this experience together; come up with suggestions for dealing with the problems and, if schools, teachers, parents or higher education institutions want the information, let's make it available. 
This is a proposal to develop answers that are based on scientific, model based research. I think it can be a helpful beginning for successful reading instruction.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation designating the U.S. Post Office facility located in Taylorsville, MS, as the `Blaine H. Eaton Post Office Building.' 
A native of Smith County, Mississippi, Mr. Eaton attended Jones Junior College from 1932-34 and was named Alumni of the Year in 1984. He also attended the University of Mississippi and George Washington Law School. 
He began his professional career as a farmer and cotton buyer for Anderson-Clayton Co. and in 1942, he became the first executive secretary to my predecessor in the Senate, U.S. Senator James O. Eastland. Blaine Eaton served our Nation in the U.S. Navy from 1944 to 1946. Upon returning home from the war, he was elected to serve in the Mississippi State House of Representatives, and he effectively served the people of Smith County for 12 years. His leadership as chairman of the Highway and Highway Finance Committee resulted in the successful passage of the Farm-to-Market legislation that is still benefiting Mississippians today as the State Aid Road Program. After leaving public office in 1958, Blaine became the manager of the Southern Pine Electric Power Association. His outstanding service and accomplishments were recognized by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association with the Clyde T. Ellis Award for distinguished service and outstanding leadership. 
Although retiring from his professional career in 1982, Blaine remained active in community service and enriched the lives of many by volunteering his time and leadership abilities to such organizations as the Lions International, the Hiram Masonic Lodge, the Southeast Mississippi Livestock Association and the Economic Development Foundation. He was also a loyal member of the First Baptist Church of Taylorsville where he taught Sunday School classes for 25 years. 
With the death of Blaine Eaton in 1995, our State lost one of its finest citizens. Designating the Taylorsville Post Office as the `Blaine H. Eaton Post Office Building' will commemorate the public service of this extraordinary Mississippian who dedicated his life to the betterment of the community and State he loved so much.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, several days ago a former staff member of mine in Hattiesburg, MS, brought to my attention a speech that was made at the University of Southern Mississippi to the honors college by Dick Thornburgh, former Attorney General of the United States. It was on the subject of `business crime goes international.' In the remarks, former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh talks about the international problems that are created for U.S. businesses by criminal conduct in other countries--extortion, bribery in connection with Government contracts, and the like--and options for dealing with this in a more effective way to help enhance U.S. competitiveness throughout the world. It was such an excellent speech that I ask unanimous consent to have the speech of Dick Thornburgh printed in the Record.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Budget Resolution assumes reductions in spending of $290 billion over the next 5 years. To accomplish this goal we, of course, must adopt changes in federal programs. 
The Governmental Affairs Committee has received reconciliation instructions requiring $4.8 billion in savings over a 5-year period be obtained from programs under our committee's jurisdiction. Most of this committee's programs involve Federal employees and retirees. 
In March, the President sent his budget proposal to Congress in which he recommended $6.5 billion in savings from Federal employee and retiree benefit programs. Included in the President's proposal was $1.7 billion to be saved by delaying annual cost-of-living adjustments for Federal retirees. As chairman of the Subcommittee with jurisdiction over this subject I opposed that proposal, and so did the chairman of the full Committee, Senator Fred Thompson. 
The President's Federal employee-related proposal had four basic components: 
First, the President proposed delaying the receipt of civilian Federal retiree cost-of-living adjustments from January until April through the year 2002, which would have cost the typical Federal retiree $726 over the next 5 years. 
I thought the proposal was unfair since it singled out Federal civilian retirees for this change. No other group of retirees was treated this way. 
Most Federal retirees are not wealthy people. Most are like other Americans who have retired from private sector jobs and are just barely making ends meet. The average yearly income for a Federal retiree--after taxes and out-of-pocket costs of health care and life insurance premiums--is $14,864. This hardly allows for a comfortable lifestyle, considering the average Federal retiree faces annual living costs of $22,098. 
Our subcommittee opposed the singling out of Federal civilian retirees for a COLA delay, and this position was adopted by Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Thompson in his Annual Views and Estimates report submitted to the Senate Budget Committee. I was very pleased that Budget Chairman Domenici agreed with us and not the President. 
Second, the President's budget also assumed a savings starting in January 1999 be achieved by requiring employees to pay a greater share of their health care premiums. 
Under current law, the Government pays, on average, 71 percent of the premiums of the health insurance plans in which Federal employees and retirees enroll. That calculation is based on 60 percent of the average premium of the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program's Big Six health insurance plans. 
In 1990, Aetna--one of the Big Six high-option plans--dropped out of the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program. In order to prevent enrollees' share of the premium from rising, Congress enacted legislation establishing a proxy plan. The President's budget proposal allowed for the expiration of the proxy plan, thereby shifting approximately $4 billion of health care premium costs from the Government to the employee over 5 years. 
The Federal Employee Health Benefit Program, unlike Medicare, is not facing a fiscal crisis. In fact, it works so well, I believe we should use it as a model for future health care reform. However, I do not think the President's willingness to simply accept conversion to a Big Five-based formula by default, thereby lowering the government's share of the premium to about 67 percent, is equitable. Doing so would not only shift substantial costs to enrollees but it would allow for the continued use of an outdated formula. As subcommittee chairman, I intend to propose a new formula-- 
possibly based on a weighted average of all plans--which will maintain the current rate of contributions to the FEHB plans by the government and its employees. 
Regardless of any change in the FEHBP formula, it is possible health insurance premiums will increase over the next year due to medical inflation and federally mandated increases in basic coverage. Congress should not aggravate the situation by shifting an additional $4 billion in costs onto enrollees. 
Third, the President's budget plan also increased Federal agency contributions to the retirement fund for civil service retirement system employees by 1.51 percent beginning October 1, 1997 and ending September 30, 2002. Currently, agencies match employee contributions of approximately 7 percent. 
Fourth, the President recommended an increase in Federal employee retirement contributions--0.25 percent of base pay in 1999, another 0.15 percent in 2000, and a final 0.10 percent in 2001--adding up to a total of 0.50 percent increase. The higher contribution rate would expire on December 31, 2002. 
I believe the President's proposed Federal employee budget package goes far beyond fairness. President Clinton has advocated a disproportionate contribution by those who have been asked to give again and again over the past several years. Federal employees and retirees across the country know there is no justification for the President's proposed package of changes--and it does not serve the interest of fairness to the Federal workforce. 
The Federal Government may be the largest employer in the Nation, but it is far from being a model employer. You might ask, what is the Federal Government offering its workforce in order to attract and retain qualified personnel who can respond to the challenges of providing efficient, effective service to the American people? Federal employees have witnessed the slow erosion of their pay and benefit package over the last several years. 
Because of the requirements of the budget resolution some changes must be adopted. As we work toward the goal of achieving the $4.8 billion in savings required of our committee, Federal employees will have to share the burden of deficit reduction, but they will not be singled out to accept burdens not imposed upon other Americans. 
Without question, public employees play an important role in our society. The hope is that by offering a balanced and fair compensation package, we can continue to attract and retain a talented and skilled workforce to deliver federal services. The reconciliation package which I will work to develop will have that as a goal as well as deficit reduction.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, in 1950 when William Faulkner accepted the Nobel prize for literature, he said that man would not only endure, he would prevail. 
I recalled of those words this morning when I was coming to the Chamber to describe my impression of Senator Strom Thurmond. He has not only survived and set a record because of his endurance but he has prevailed and set an example that all of us can study with profit. His character, his integrity, his commitment, his energy, his enthusiasm for his work and for the Senate, his respect for our Government and our country and its people, and his devotion to duty all set him apart. So it is not just because of his tenure that I praise him this morning but it is more importantly for all of these other qualities that have made him so special and so much appreciated as a Senator. 
I have felt it to be a real honor to serve in the Senate with Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. He truly is one of the most outstanding Senators who has ever served. And he has been easy to get to know and easy to like, easy to work with because of his cordiality, his warmth, and his willingness to be helpful. He can also give you good advice and be persuasive in a way that makes you want to do what he wants you to do. 
I recall going to the well of the Senate to vote when he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and I had planned to vote against his position on an amendment. He grabbed me by the arm and began holding it with his famous firm grip, and he said, `Now, you ought to do what's right on this' and started talking to me. And in that little while I realized I was going to vote with him and not the way I had thought I was going to vote when I went to the well of the Senate. I later told somebody that I had been `Thurmonized.' That's when you are talked to in a fashion that is very persuasive, very courtly and charming, very distinctively like Strom Thurmond can talk to you. 
We have worked closely on agriculture matters. We have worked to ensure that the farmers of South Carolina and those involved in their specialty crops, such as the peach orchard owners, have the kind of investment in research that is necessary to maintain our technological edge, and our productivity, so that we can be competitive in the global markets. He is the farmer's friend. He has said on a number of occasions, and I have heard him say it, `We have to be sure we do right by the farmers; they're very important to this country.' 
He has the same kind of attitude towards those who serve in the military, and as chairman of the Armed Services Committee he has done as much as anyone, more than most, to help ensure that we have a military which is well equipped, well trained, and is second to none in the world. By reason of his own personal experiences, he knows what it takes in a time of crisis to prevail. He has been a wonderful example in so many ways. He has been devoted to his family. I can recall his talking to the then majority leader, Senator Byrd, about getting out early one night so we could go trick or treating with our children. And he was, of course, in his seventies at that time. But he wanted to be sure that family time was made available, and we got out early that night, I recall, because of the insistence of Senator Thurmond that we have time to spend with our families on Halloween night. 
There are many other things that come to mind, personal recollections. I never will forget being invited by him when I was a brand new Senator, to come to Charleston, SC to address the annual dinner of the Hibernian Society. He told me all about what to expect. He said, `The main thing to remember is don't talk long.' He said, `They don't want a long speech.' 
Well, I took that to heart. I didn't talk long. And what I really came to realize when he was introducing me was that the people there were interested in his introduction a lot more than they would be in my speech. He brought the house down. They were there to hear vintage Strom Thurmond, and he was terrific. He started describing me as he introduced me. He said, `He is the first person to ever win statewide office in the State of Mississippi on the Republican ticket.' Well, they cheered. And he said, `And he thinks just like we do. He believes in balancing the budget.' And they cheered and hollered. And then he said, `And he believes in a strong national defense.' And they jumped up and hollered again. And after a while, I realized my speech following this was not going to be worth giving; they were being entertained, but they were also showing their respect, their love for their Senator, Strom Thurmond. I was delighted to be invited and honored to be the speaker, and I did not talk long. It was a very successful experience because of that. 
It was a great pleasure working with Senator Thurmond on the Judiciary Committee during my first 2 years in the Senate, which was a very interesting time of transition. Another part of the genius of Strom Thurmond is to manage transition. The President talks about making change our friend. Strom Thurmond has been doing 
that for so long it is second nature. And the fact is he has been able to not only manage transitions and help ease the pain of transition for this country in so many different areas that he has been a true leader of our country in that respect. He is a wonderful example and a wonderful man, and it is a great privilege for me to be able to speak today in his honor.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I congratulate and commend my friend and colleague from Mississippi for his wonderfully eloquent statement, and for taking time, today, to pay tribute to a very special friend. Twenty-five years ago, Jonna Lynne Cullen came to my office in Jackson, MS, to congratulate me on my election to the Congress. She and my wife, Rose, along with my distinguished colleague the majority leader, were classmates at the University of Mississippi just 13 years before that. She told me, when she came to the office, all about the process of organizing the House of Representatives and offered to assist me and my staff as I began my job as the new U.S. Congressman from the Fourth Congressional District of Mississippi. Her advice and counsel to me were very helpful, and I gained more respect for her, for her insight and her knowledge, as time went on. 
As a member of the staff of the House Rules Committee, she was where the action was. She was where you knew what legislation was coming up and what the process was. And she was a great source of information and encouragement for me, as someone who had never worked as a member of the staff or had been closely involved in the workings of the Congress before my election in 1972. 
Her appreciation of the Congress was contagious, and so was her enthusiasm. Everyone I knew liked her. In time, her capabilities and dedication were rewarded with an offer to work at the White House. At the Office of Management and Budget, she helped guide to passage some of the most important budget reforms ever adopted. During her career as a member of the staff of the House, and in the Executive Office of the President, she was one of the most dependable, conscientious, and effective employees who has ever worked at either place. 
Since then, she has been involved in a wide range of activities, most of which have been related to business or Government. She began her own business, J.L. Gourmand, Inc., to manufacture and market her Pesto Plus products. She organized women's groups to support other entrepreneurs and professional women here and around the world. She traveled to other countries to help explain to those with new democracies how best to guarantee the blessings of self-government. And she developed her considerable talent with water colors as a painter of flowers, which are collected and appreciated throughout the National Capital area and in the houses of her friends and admirers all across the country. And that is a lot of houses, because she has many friends and admirers. 
All of her friends, and I am so pleased and privileged to have been one of her close friends for the past 25 years, wish we could see a modern miracle make her well because nobody could be a better or more unselfish friend than Jonna Lynne Cullen. 
With our good wishes we also send to her our thanks for all she has done and all she has given to make the Congress and the country so much better off, because of her good work and her well-lived life.

Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, last week I received a letter from the distinguished Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar] on the subject of a task force which he had been asked to chair convened by the Council on Foreign Relations on the subject of Russia, its neighbors, and an enlarging NATO. 
Senator Lugar's letter discusses the highlights of the findings and agreements that were reached by this impressive task force made up of experts on foreign policy and national security. I think it is important for the Senate to consider and review carefully the task force report and the information in that as we are beginning serious consideration now in the Foreign Relations Committee and soon in this Chamber proposals for the enlargement of NATO. We have already had other agreements which have been widely publicized this week--the 
charter or the framework between Russia and the United States on the subject of NATO enlargement. So it is very timely, in my view, for us to begin to get all of the information and all of the viewpoints that we can from those who deserve respect on these issues so we will be fully advised as we are called upon to make decisions on proposals from the administration. 
In his letter, Senator Lugar points out that `The Task Force reached a strong bipartisan consensus that the enlargement of NATO and improved NATO-Russia relations need not be incompatible.' First he pointed out that the goal of this task force `was to determine whether Russia's concerns could be managed and its internal transition bolstered without stopping or slowing NATO enlargement. The Task Force also looked,' he said, `at the security concerns of the Baltic states and Ukraine.' 
He says the Task Force `agreed that it is in the United States interest to try to achieve both' enlargement of NATO and a strengthening of NATO-Russian relations. So we also should `negotiate from a position of strength and not allow the NATO Alliance to be held hostage in any manner by Moscow. We strongly caution,' he said, the Task Force said, `that NATO's core mission of collective defense of its members--both old and new--not be diluted in any manner.' 
Other highlights include an urging of the administration and NATO allies `to take very specific steps, to reassure the Baltic states and Ukraine that they will not be left in a security no-man's land.' 
And in conclusion, he says the Task Force recommends endorsing `NATO's decision to add new, `full' members at the Madrid summit in July 1997, and suggests the Alliance remain open to the possibility of adding more new members in the future.' 
The Task Force said, and he quotes from their findings: 
We believe that the goal of NATO's enlargement with Russia should not be to provide compensation for enlargement. Rather, it should be to forge a new NATO-Russia relationship that builds on opportunities offered by a new Europe, a Russia in transition and an adapting NATO. 
The Task Force recommended also `To engage Russia, negotiate a formal NATO-Russia charter,' which is being done, `and a consultative mechanism that offers both sides incentives to cooperate on shared problems,' and to `Update Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty,' which we approved this week. 
In conclusion, he points out that the Task Force suggests that we,  
Reject vigorously any efforts by Moscow to dictate the terms of Baltic or Ukrainian relations with NATO. The Task Force urges the administration and the Alliance to offer special assurances to the three Baltic states and Ukraine, including confirmation that NATO's open-door policy applies to all Partnership for Peace states; increased efforts to include all four countries in Partnership for Peace planning and training exercises; affirmation that the United States shares the aspirations of the Baltic states to become full members of all European institutions; and conclusion of a NATO-Ukraine agreement to deepen practical consideration over the coming years.

Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I took time to comment and read some excerpts because in my view this is excellent work, and Senator Lugar ought to be strongly commended for his leadership not only in chairing this traffic force on these important issues but in his work on the Foreign Relations Committee in connection with NATO enlargement, United States-Russia relations which are the subject of this work. 
Madam President, I am pleased to cosponsor Senate Concurrent Resolution 5, which was introduced by Senator Roth, supporting the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, because I believe the NATO alliance will be strengthened by including new members and that its capacity to contribute to stability and freedom will be enhanced by such expansion. 
Senate Concurrent Resolution 5 specifically mentions four nations: Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia, which should be considered for membership in the alliance, but I do not think the consideration of the Foreign Relations Committee should be limited to those countries. Serious consideration should also be given, in my opinion, to Romania, and maybe to others as well. 
The Romanian Government has a record of cooperation with the United States and Western nations. During the Persian Gulf crisis, for example, Romania supported U.N. resolutions imposing sanctions against Iraq and voted to authorize the United States and other nations to enforce the sanctions and liberate Kuwait. In 1993, Romania supported continuation of a 30-year U.N. embargo against Cuba, and its military forces participated in the U.N. action in Angola in 1995. 
Romania also supported the U.N. trade embargo against the former Yugoslavia, and following the Dayton accords, it deployed a 200-troop battalion to assist in the NATO-led IFOR mission. Romania has participated in many Partnership for Peace exercises and was the first nation to sign the Partnership for Peace framework document in 1994. 
The Romanian Government has sought entry into several Western economic and security alliances. In 1993, Romania became an associate member of the European Union, and in 1995, it submitted an application to become a full member of the EU. In 1994, Romania became a member of the Council of Europe. 
The people of Romania strongly support joining the NATO alliance. A recent European Commission poll of 20 Eastern and Central European nations shows a higher percentage of Romanians favoring membership in NATO than any other prospective new member's citizenry. 
Since the fall of Romania's Communist government in 1989, the people of Romania have made great progress to achieve the goal of democracy, by showing respect for the rule of law, moving to a free market economy, and imposing civilian control over the military. By the end of 1996, Romania had completed a round of elections at all levels of Government, including both Parliamentary and Presidential elections. Observers from the Council of Europe classified the November Presidential elections `reasonably fair and transparent,' and it should be noted that they resulted in the first peaceful transfer of power since 1937. The current political situation is particularly remarkable when compared with the regime which held power in 1989. 
In addition to strengthening the elements common to democracies worldwide, the Romanians have directly confronted and worked to abate both internal and external ethnic conflicts. In March of this year, the Prime Minister outlined steps the Government will take to ease domestic ethnic tensions. In an effort to discourage ethnic conflict with the 
Hungarians living in Romania, the Government negotiated and signed a treaty with Hungary. The ruling party coalition includes the party most closely associated with ethnic Hungarians. I understand also that the Romanians are nearing the end of treaty negotiations with Ukraine over remaining border issues. Both of these cases demonstrate a willingness to settle disputes with its neighbors in a peaceful way. NATO Secretary General Solana has cited the programs that Romania, among other nations, has made toward resolving outstanding bilateral differences. 
Including Romania in NATO would enhance European security. Romania's military forces are among the largest in Europe. Of the countries currently being considered for NATO membership, only Romania and Poland have army, navy, and air force capabilities. 
On the day their Minister of Defense was sworn in, he declared that one of his administration's highest priorities would be to prepare Romania's military for interoperability with existing NATO structures. As a result, Romanians have undertaken strenuous efforts to update their military equipment and improve their ability to operate in concert with the forces of other nations. 
Perhaps the most concerted efforts of the Romanian people have been devoted to improving their economy. The results of the last election demonstrated a preference for leaders who favor privatization, freer markets, and a continuation of reform. Within 3 weeks of the decisive Presidential election, senior representatives from the International Monetary Fund, the European Union, and the World Bank traveled to Bucharest to finalize the details of a comprehensive reform package aimed at reducing inflation, cutting the deficit, and speeding privatization. This plan for reform--released in February--will be challenging for the Romanian Government and its people over the next few years, and the Government has planned certain countermeasures during the transition, such as a strengthening of the welfare program in anticipation of temporary unemployment. However, it appears that Romania is committed to this economic plan. 
In August 1996, the United States granted MFN status to Romania, and this year our Department of State reported that 80 percent of Romanian farming and 70 percent of retail sales are being generated by private enterprises. This spring the International Monetary Fund announced a $400 million loan to Romania. To supplement this IMF assistance and support the Government's reforms, the European Commission has pledged $140 million. Indicators such as these all offer assurance to foreign investors, whose contributions are important to the growth and stability of Romania's economy. 
Madam President, I am impressed and encouraged by the progress Romania has made, and I urge serious consideration of Romania for inclusion in NATO. I hope the Foreign Relations Committee will conduct a full and careful review of Romania's political, economic, and military strengths when it considers legislation on NATO expansion. 
Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased the administration has decided not to contest condition 9 in the resolution of ratification now before the Senate. That condition makes the advice and consent of the Senate a condition precedent to the addition of parties to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. 
Any agreement between the administration and the Government of Russia or other states that were part of the Soviet Union which purports to enlarge the ABM Treaty by adding new parties must be submitted to the United States Senate and a resolution of ratification approved by the Senate before it will have the force and effect of law. 
There are important reasons why it is necessary for the Senate to insist on its constitutional role in treaty making in this resolution. The administration has announced its intent not to submit a memorandum of understanding on succession to the Senate for advice and consent to ratification, and it purports to transform the ABM Treaty from a bilateral agreement into a multilateral accord. 
The addition of new parties to the ABM Treaty clearly would have serious national security implications for the United States. It would make it much more difficult and time consuming to negotiate other changes in the treaty that may be considered necessary in the future to protect our security interests. 
Unless the Senate insists on fulfilling its advice and consent responsibilities with respect to the ABM Treaty, there may be a mistaken view taken by the administration that a demarcation amendment being negotiated now with Russia could likewise be the subject of an executive agreement without the benefit of Senate ratification. 
I am concerned that by our inaction the Senate could be forfeiting its constitutional role in the making of treaties. It should be clear that no treaty or material change in a treaty can be entered into by our government without the consent of the Senate. That is what the Constitution says, and that is what condition 9 says, and that is what the Senate says today as it provides advice and consent to ratification of the amendments to the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, Federal employees have enjoyed flexible work schedules since 1978. It is time to give private sector employees the same options. Today's work rules are too inflexible, and this legislation changes that to meet the needs of today's working families. 
The bill provides employees with several options in determining their work schedules. 
First, workers would have the option of paid flexible leave. An employee might choose to work 35 hours one week and 45 hours the next, and still receive a full paycheck. 
Second, an employee could set 2-week schedules totaling 80 hours in any combination. This would not change the 40-hour work week, as some have said. The Family Friendly Workplace Act simply adds a section to the Fair Labor Standards Act to create options for employees who want flexible work schedules. In addition, this cannot be forced upon an employee. It must be agreed to by the employee and the employer. 
Third, employees could choose to take time and a half off instead of overtime. Up to 240 hours of comptime could be banked. Employees would also have the option of cashing out accrued hours for overtime pay at a later date. 
No employee would be required to participate in any of these programs, and coercion or intimidation by the employer with respect to participation is prohibited. Strict penalties in this bill ensure that these arrangements will be voluntary. Let me reiterate that all of these options are 100 percent voluntary for workers. Nothing would change for employees who want to work a standard schedule. Employers would still have to pay time and a half for any overtime hours put in by an employee in any week, if that is what the employee wants. 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 1960 just 39 percent of women who had children between the ages of 6 and 17 were in the work force. Today, 76 percent of mothers with school-age children are working. This increase of working families is not compatible with the one-size-fits-all workplace laws enacted in the 1930's. 
I urge my colleagues to support giving working families the opportunity to balance their work and family obligations by supporting this legislation.

Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think we should make it clear at the outset that those of us who are supporting this resolution as reported by the Rules Committee favor looking very carefully at our current campaign laws. The Federal Election Campaign Act sets out some very strict rules and guidelines and laws with respect to how our Federal election campaigns ought to be conducted. Some of us agree that those laws can be improved and are in favor of making changes. For example, I think one of the clear deficiencies in current law is the failure to require disclosure from all of those who spend money in the Federal election campaign process. There is no law against participating. We like to have full participation by all American citizens, by all of those who are eligible to vote in our country, and we need to continue to examine the process to see if we are doing a good enough job of trying to get everybody's involvement in the process. So there are a lot of things that we can do to improve the system. 
But I hope that our friends who are urging immediate vote on a single proposal, certainly ought to allow a full debate to occur and a free exchange of ideas. This Committee on Rules has had a number of hearings under the leadership of the distinguished Senator from Virginia on this subject. And in this resolution there is a provision that further campaign reform issues will be examined by the Rules Committee, in the context of this resolution on this investigation. 
Having said that, I think we do need to support, though, the passage of this resolution now so investigation can move forward. The Governmental Affairs Committee is charged under this resolution with responsibility of conducting an investigation into illegal activities surrounding the 1996 election campaigns. We do not single out the President's reelection campaign. We say the campaigns that were conducted in 1996, the challenge of the Republican candidate, the campaigns of all Members of Congress, the campaigns of those Senators who were up in the last cycle--all are to be the subject of the investigation by the Governmental Affairs Committee into illegal activities. 
Further, if any Senator is found to have engaged in illegal activity, that is to be directly referred to the Ethics Committee for prompt attention and review. 
What are these facts that support and are the basis for the resolution? I think it is important for us to look at what the facts are, to look at what the allegations are, some of the charges that have been made. One of the individuals who was mentioned by the Senator from Utah is John Huang. It is said by reports that he raised more than $3.4 million for the Democratic National Committee. Where did this money come from? That is a fair question. That is a very legitimate question, and it ought to be answered by this investigation. 
John Huang was given a security clearance while he was still working for a private enterprise, the Lippo Group, and before he started to work at the Department of Commerce. A legitimate inquiry by this investigation committee is: Why did he get a security clearance before starting a job with the Department of Commerce? And he kept his security clearance, even after he left the Department of Commerce and went to work for the Democratic National Committee. Another legitimate inquiry is: Why did someone who is a full-time fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee need a security clearance? Or why was he permitted to have a security clearance? 
During his tenure with the Commerce Department and at the Democratic National Committee, he had several visits with officials of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China. A legitimate inquiry: What were the purposes of these visits? Which Chinese officials at the Embassy did he visit and why? 
Another person who was mentioned by Senator Hatch, as involved in the reports and who was involved actively in the election campaign of 1996, is Johnny Chung. Johnny Chung is said to have donated a total of $366,000 to the Democratic National Committee. A legitimate inquiry: Where did Chung get this money? Another reported fact: Johnny Chung visited the White House more than 50 times, despite the fact that the National Security Council staff had issued a memo describing him as a hustler, and warning officials at the White House of that. Why did Johnny Chung have such free access to the White House? That is a legitimate inquiry. Who did he see when he went to the White House on these occasions, and for what purpose? One day, during a radio address by the President of the United States, Johnny Chung brought six Chinese officials with him to be spectators, and to witness the President's radio address, 2 days after giving a $50,000 check to a senior White House official to pass on to the Democratic National Committee. 
Charlie Trie is another person who has been mentioned today. Charlie Trie was a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton's legal defense fund. He is said to have raised more than $600,000. What were the sources of these donations? What did he expect in return, if anything? Charlie Trie visited the White House more than 23 times. Who did he see when he was there? What were the purposes of his visits? Charlie Trie arranged to have Wang Jun, a Chinese arms dealer, attend a White House event with the President. 
These are legitimate subjects of inquiry into an investigation into possible illegal conduct in connection with the 1996 Presidential election campaign. It seems to me that these are not only questionable activities that raise questions about purposes of fundraising, but connections with a foreign government which was very actively involved in developing new trade relations with our country, in testing our relationship with other countries in that region of the world, and just this past weekend there were new revelations in connection with the fact that the Chinese Government was said, by our own Federal Bureau of Investigation, to be targeting Members of Congress, 
to influence for the purpose of enhancing China's position with respect to legislation and national policy here in the United States. 
The question that is legitimate for us to undertake to answer in this investigation is what connection do these associates of the Democratic National Committee or the President--John Huang, Charlie Trie, Johnny Chung, and others--have with this effort by the Chinese, if any? These are legitimate inquiries. 
Has there been a revelation or a discussion or a briefing at the White House by the FBI on these same subjects? And when did those briefings occur? Before these people were given free access to the White House? Or later? Or when? 
Did these activities on the part of the Chinese Government become common knowledge at the White House? If they did, who knew about it? Somebody is bound to have known about it. You don't have this kind of seemingly unlimited access with high-level officials in our administration without somebody knowing why they were there. 
What were their interests? One, of course, was a Department of Commerce official interested in trade, organizing trade missions all around the country. But not only that, Mr. President, let me show you a chart, for the purpose of information for Senators, reflecting information that may be close as a circle of interest. 
Here we have the three persons I was talking about where there is clear evidence of a lot of fundraising activity, a lot of access with the White House and with top officials in the administration, one working at the Department of Commerce. This is John Huang, who was former top U.S. Lippo executive. Lippo is the Indonesian conglomerate already described by Senator Hatch and others. He was a top Democratic National Committee fundraiser. He had a top-secret security clearance at Commerce--even before, we have now learned--and had almost unlimited White House access. 
Johnny Chung visited the White House at least 50 times, brought several Communist Party officials, Chinese Government officials, to the White House, and maintains business relationships in China. 
Charlie Trie, Little Rock restaurateur, has visited the White House from 20 to 30 times; owns a home and restaurant in Beijing. 
All three participated in very productive fundraising activities for the Democratic National Committee or the President's legal expense fund. Approximately $4.5 million was raised by these three individuals for the Democratic National Committee. The Democratic National Committee said it is returning $2.2 million of those contributions. For the President's legal expense fund, Charlie Trie raised $639,000, all now ruled by the lawyers as returnable and should be returned. 
Then look at this. These are interesting connections as well. Does this form a link, the link to China that gets the foreign government involved in our election process? It seems to me clearly to indicate a reason to go forward immediately with the passage of this resolution and to go forward with this investigation to find out what the facts are. But here are what some of the allegations are in the reported facts that we can verify with an investigation. 
Wang Jun, the foreign arms dealer who was brought to the White House, chairman of Poly Technologies, a Chinese arms manufacturer. He is also chairman of CITIC, which is the largest state-run business in China. He visited the White House on February 6, 1996, as a guest of Charlie Trie. 
Ng Lap Seng, a member of CPPCC. This is the Chinese Government's national advisory board. He has multiple business interests in China, Hong Kong, and Macao. He is partners with Charlie Trie in San Kin Yip International Trading Co. 
And the Lippo Group, which was discussed in some detail by Senator Hatch. Mochtar and James Riady are the family members who have large interests, if not controlling interests, in the Lippo Group. Lippo has vast business interests in China, business partners with China Resources, a Chinese Government-owned entity. 
The CP Group, this is the largest foreign investor in China, $2 billion investment, 130 joint ventures. Chairman Dhanin serves as economic adviser to the Chinese Government. Dhanin visited with President Clinton in the White House on June 18, 1996, arranged by Pauline Kanchanalak through John Huang. 
The connections are with Huang, Chung, and Trie with investors, leading industrialists in China, in Indonesia, all with Chinese ties, all with very big stakes in the outcome of Government policies here in the United States and legislation here in the United States, and, apparently, Members of Congress were selected to be supported or encouraged or lobbied, or whatever happened, and we don't know what happened. We don't know if anything happened, but we need to find out what steps were taken to try to influence decisions in this Government by the foreign government. 
The question about whether passing a bill to reform campaign finance law cures all that, of course, begs the question. That is not the question, and it is certainly not the answer. The question is, What are the illegal activities that are involved in these transactions, if any? That is not only an appropriate area for inquiry by this U.S. Senate, it is mandatory, it is a duty, it is a mandatory responsibility, it is a duty we have. 
So I urge my colleagues to adopt this resolution. It is a product of an effort to try to resolve differences that some on the other side of the aisle have had with the effort that we initiated in the Governmental Affairs Committee to put together a resolution to define scope and a budget and a process. 
But I have confidence, Mr. President, in the chairman and the ranking Democratic member, Senator Thompson and Senator Glenn, who are totally dedicated, in my view, to a fair but full inquiry of the allegations that are apparent and are begging to be investigated so that we can find out what the facts are. 
If laws need to be changed, we can recommend changes in the law. If we simply need to disclose whether people are innocent of the charges that have been made against them, that is an important part of the responsibility, too. To clear those whose names may have been tarnished by published reports that we have seen in the newspapers and heard in the broadcast media, that is part of the obligation of this committee as well, which I think will be taken very, very seriously. 
So I am hopeful that the Senate will approve the resolution, Mr. President. I congratulate the chairman for his leadership in this.  
Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, first, I commend the distinguished Senator from Utah for his great leadership on the floor of the Senate in support of this resolution to require a balanced budget. 
Let me just say, we have heard Senators come to the floor and point out that this puts in jeopardy the Social Security beneficiaries of America. We have heard others claim that this amendment forces us to consider investments in capital spending the same as operating expenses, as a matter of budget policy. We have heard one thing after another used as excuses for voting against this resolution. 
But let me say, I am for protecting Social Security beneficiaries. I am for doing whatever we need to do to help ensure that those who depend on Social Security can be confident that they are going to get the benefits to which they are entitled, whether this resolution passes or not. And for budget policy, you just have to look at the plain language of this resolution. It says: 
The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation which may rely on estimates of outlays and receipts. 
We are not giving away the power to decide budget policy and mechanics and whether you have a capital budget or another kind of a budget. 
The point is, this is national policy, if this passes, that we will live within our means. It is just as simple as that and just as nonscary as that. 
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

 Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to reauthorize seasonal base plans for Federal milk marketing orders. 
This program encourages dairy farmers to stabilize their milk production seasonally. This results in more stable production in the fall and winter, when there is an economic disincentive for dairy farmers to produce milk, and thereby ensures stable milk prices to consumers. 
Mr. President, this is a matter of fairness. Seasonal base plans were instituted under the Agricultural Act of 1933. Currently, seasonal base plans are included in five Federal milk marketing orders that affect producers in 25 States. Without extension of this authority expeditiously, dairy producers in those five orders who adjusted their production last fall will receive lower average prices while those who made no adjustments will receive higher average prices. 
This is not a new issue to my colleagues. In fact, during consideration of the fiscal year 1997 Agriculture Appropriations Act, the Senate approved the extension of seasonal base plan authority until the year 2002. The 1996 farm bill requires the Secretary of Agriculture to submit a reform plan for Federal milk marketing orders by 1999 and this bill reauthorizes the base excess plans until 1999. This will ensure that the market environment the Secretary was directed to reform exists until he has a chance to submit his plan. 
I hope my colleagues will support this legislation.
