Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the bankruptcy reform bill that we have just proceeded to and to say that this is a very important reform bill. 
I want to commend Senator Chuck Grassley for the work he has done on this bill and to specifically talk about one part of this bill which was very important to me. That is the homestead exemption that is a part of the Texas Constitution. 
I worked with Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch when this bill was coming to the floor earlier this month to make sure that, by the time the bill was finished, it would take into account those States that have constitutional provisions, as my State does, which provide for some sort of homestead exemption. 
In my home State of Texas, we have had a homestead exemption under our bankruptcy laws and in the constitution since the 1840s, actually; this is not something that has come about lately. But because many farmers and ranchers were very worried about losing their livelihoods if they ever got into a temporary situation--they were worried that they would lose their ability to maintain their families and their livelihoods--so we have a constitutional provision. It was important to me that we keep it. 
The first bill that passed out of the Senate did not have that. But I had the assurance of Senator Grassley that he would work with me to make sure that a State like mine would not be overrun on this very important point. And, in fact, Senator Grassley is true to his word. I cannot say enough good things about the fact that he kept his word to the letter. We were able to come to an agreement that kept the Texas constitutional provision for the homestead exemption intact. That is in the bill that will go forward. 
I hope we will be able to pass this bill, send it to the President, put it on his desk, and that he will sign it. But if in fact that isn't the case, I hope we will be able to work on this next year to have real bankruptcy reform so that people will not be able to willingly walk away from their debts, but nevertheless that will also take into account that there are States which have constitutions about which we feel very strongly, that this is a part of our heritage. It is one that I will work tirelessly to see continued. 
Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer. I appreciate very much the opportunity to work on this with Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch. I hope we will prevail either in the next few days or in the next year. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. 
Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to really follow on what the distinguished Senator from New Mexico was saying, because I think he laid out very well the problems that we are facing with our military today. No one questions the job our military is doing. They are doing their jobs well. But it is clear that we are losing our experienced people. 
As the Senator from New Mexico has just pointed out, we are losing our experienced pilots, we do not have enough parts to keep the airplanes running, and the Army had its worst recruiting year last year since the late 1970s. 
At the time that we are looking at mission fatigue, our troops being overdeployed away from their families on missions that are not security threats to the United States, we are now seeing a mixed message from this administration about yet expanding their responsibilities. 
We were told in the last few weeks that NATO is contemplating airstrikes in Serbia. This is, of course, a terrible and tragic situation in Kosovo. And, clearly, we want to try to do everything possible to curb atrocities that are happening and may happen in the future in Kosovo. But, Mr. President, a superpower cannot fling around the world without a plan, without a thought, and have credibility. 
I ask the question of the administration, Have we done everything we can do at the bargaining table with Mr. Milosevic? Have we put every economic sanction that can be put? Have we isolated this country to the extent that we can--as we have also tried to do with Iraq--to show this leader that he cannot continue to act in an irresponsible manner toward human beings in his own country and get by with it? 
Have we done everything we can do first? If we have--and I don't think we have--if the administration makes the case that we have, then, and only then, should we be considering other options. 
Mr. President, if we are going to bomb another country because of a civil conflict, a sovereign country that is in a civil conflict, have we thought through what the exit strategy is? Have we thought through what our responsibility is going to be for doing that? I haven't seen a plan. I haven't seen any kind of `after plan' after bombing. Yes, we have talked about bombing. But if we are bombing for the purpose of saying to Milosevic, `You must withdraw your police so that the Albanians who live in Kosovo can come out of the hills and go into their homes,' how is that to be enforced? 
We have been told by administration officials that there would not be American troops on the ground unless there is a peace agreement, something to enforce. Yet yesterday the Secretary of Defense opened the door on American troops on the ground with NATO forces. Yet we haven't seen a plan. We haven't seen what the American role will be. We have certainly not been consulted to determine if the United States is ready to expand its mission in the Balkans. 
We were told we would be out of Bosnia a year ago. We were told a year and a half ago, we were told 2 years ago that our mission in Bosnia would be complete when the parties were separated and the elections had been held. The parties are separated. The elections have been held. Yet American taxpayers have spent $10 billion in Bosnia, and the President is now saying there is an `unending mission' there. He has refused to put a timetable on it. This week the President has asked the U.S. Congress for $2 billion more for Bosnia in a supplemental appropriation, as if this were an emergency. Why didn't the administration put this in the budget? He says it is an unending mission, yet we have an emergency appropriation. 
I conclude by saying we cannot fling ourselves around the world without a clear strategy and a clear role for the United States. I am looking to the President for leadership and I haven't seen it. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, on October 1, 1958, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created. No other Government agency better represents the hopes and experiences of our Nation during the course of its existence than NASA. To recall why that is so, let's look back to where we were 40 years ago. 
In October 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial satellite. Many have claimed this had a `Pearl Harbor' effect on the American people and galvanized public opinion in favor of an aggressive U.S. space program. Americans believed that the Soviet Union had gained a significant technological advantage over the United States--bomb shelters were built at an even more rapid rate as we turned our attention to the space race. 
Then-Senator Lyndon Johnson, from my state of Texas, said that the launch of Sputnik was `* * * a new era of history dawning over the world.' He warned a Texas audience that, `The mere fact that the Soviets can put a satellite in the sky * * * does not alter the world balance of power. But it does mean they are in a position to alter the balance of power.' 
Shortly thereafter, Senator Johnson introduced legislation to create NASA and harnessed the energies, talents, and aspirations of a nation embarking on a bold, new enterprise. The act reflected a remarkable unanimity by the American people and a commitment to science and exploration. 
NASA wasted no time in bringing America into the space race. Shortly after it was formed, NASA conducted several exciting programs that launched us ahead of the Soviet Union in our quest to conquer space. 
One of the most important initiatives involved human space flight--Mercury's single astronaut program, Project Gemini's operations and Project Apollo to explore the Moon. These names conjure up strong images of fearless astronauts doing the impossible. In 1961, Alan B. Shepard became the first American to fly in space. Of course, we remember him because he died just recently. In 1962, John Glenn, who now serves with us in the U.S. Senate, became the first American to orbit the Earth. Project Gemini allowed two astronauts to travel in space. On Gemini IV, Edward White became the first American to conduct a space walk. 
In 1969, just 11 years after the creation of NASA, and less than a decade after President Kennedy committed America to the project, Apollo 11 landed on the Moon and Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made the dramatic `leap' for mankind. NASA completed five more lunar missions and learned much about the origins of the Moon, as well as how to support humans in outer space. Twelve American astronauts walked on the Moon during the six Apollo missions. Nothing symbolizes the uniqueness of this great Nation better than the American flag flying on the lunar surface. 
In 1975, NASA joined hands with its former competitor in the space race and cooperated with the Soviet Union to achieve the first international human space flight. This project successfully tested joint rendezvous and docking procedures for spacecraft from the United States and the Soviet Union. 
In 1981, the advent of the space shuttle ushered in a new era of space travel and exploration. By creating a reusable launch vehicle, NASA was making access to space now more affordable. The disaster of the Challenger brought the shuttle program to a rapid standstill. It was a harsh reminder that the exploration of space is a dangerous and unpredictable undertaking. Seven astronauts gave their lives on that mission in an effort to further our knowledge of the universe. We owe them and their families our eternal gratitude and respect. 
Two years after the Challenger disaster, we returned to space. Through mid-1998, NASA has safely launched 65 shuttle missions. These missions have included a wide variety of scientific and engineering missions. There are currently four shuttles in NASA's fleet and NASA is working with the private sector to reduce the cost of space flight even more. Two experimental vehicles, the X-33 and X-34, are prototypes for cheaper, more efficient reusable launch vehicles that would provide commercial entities with access to space. I commend NASA for continuing to look to the future and the challenges that lie there. 
One of our colleagues, John Glenn, is scheduled to return to space on October 29th. It was in NASA's earliest days that John Glenn made history by bring the first American to orbit the Earth. Now he is making history again by being the oldest person to fly in space. 
Looking forward to the next 40 years, NASA's future is as bright as its past. NASA's core mission of any future space exploration will be man's departure from Earth orbit and journeys to the Moon or Mars. This will require extended, even permanent, stays in space and has led NASA to begin construction of the International Space Station. 
In 1984, Congress authorized NASA to build the space station as a base for further exploration of space. A project of this magnitude was certain to face a multitude of unkonwns--and NASA has confronted many of them. As has always been the case, though, NASA will overcome these obstacles and we will reap the rewards of doing so. 
For example, NASA has developed a unique technology, a bioreactor, that allows medical researchers to produce breakthrough results by creating `artificial' human tissues outside the human body. This bioreactor has provided new knowledge in cell science and tissue engineering that will bring exciting advances in medicine and the treatment of disease. This amazing technology is already being used by scientists who are growing ovarian tumor samples so they can conduct studies outside the body and without harm to the patient. 
The absence of gravity on the space station also will allow new insights into human health and disease prevention and treatment, including heart, lung, and kidney function, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and immune system functions. 
In recent years, NASA has obtained scientific data from space experiments that is five times more accurate than that on Earth. None of these benefits will be available unless we have a space station on which we can perform adequate research. 
The space station is the greatest peaceful scientific international endeavor undertaken. This is our future and space is one of the last unexplored regions of our universe. It holds untold knowledge and could catapult us into even greater understanding of our world and yet undiscovered worlds. Yes, the station will provide us with fantastic science--but that is only one of the known positives of this great endeavor. The unknowns are limitless and could provide us with unimaginable discoveries. We are on the very cusp of launching the first elements in November of this year, with the second element to follow in December. 
Since its inception in 1958, NASA has accomplished many great scientific and technological feats. NASA's technology has been adapted for many nonaerospace uses by the private sector. We can thank NASA for so many things--from car phone technology, satellite imagery, the CAT scan, to Velcro and freeze dried ice cream. At its fortieth anniversary, NASA remains a leading force in scientific research and is one of the best examples of the American spirit and our can-do attitude. 
We are proud of what NASA has achieved, and on this 40th anniversary we do have a number of accomplishments to celebrate. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, S. 414 is my bill that was passed by the Senate. It was passed by the House. It is now back in the conference, and there will be an amendment. 
American ports and carriers are disadvantaged by current laws that require all contracts to be public. To avoid this, shippers who conveniently can, will ship out of foreign ports in nearby Canada and Mexico to avoid this. U.S. ports are bypassed and the U.S. carriers lose business because only U.S. companies have to reveal their ocean transportation costs. This permits their foreign competition to undercut our shippers. 
Recent economic problems in Asia will increase pressure in those countries to increase their exports. Therefore, S. 414 will be even more important as our shippers meet the heightened competitive challenge.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Commerce Committee for raising this issue. The General Counsel of the FMC, in a recent written response to an inquiry on this issue with respect to the Department of Defense, stated: 
I have no doubt that we will be able to develop an intragovernmental system for providing the DOD with the pricing and service information it needs to effectively execute its mission, within the framework of S. 414. If we determine that technical legislative corrections would aid this process, we will no doubt make such recommendations jointly. At this time, however, I do not believe that any additional amendments to the bill are necessary to meet your concerns for the Department. 
Mr. President, I want to make it clear that the FMC is authorized to share with another Federal agency service contract information that parties of the service contract have legally decided to protect from public disclosure in order to enable that Federal agency to ensure the compliance of U.S.-flag ocean common carriers with cargo preference law shipping rate requirements. Of course, that confidential service contract information would remain protected from disclosure to the public consistent with the Shipping Act of 1984, as amended by the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998, and other applicable Federal laws.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I want to speak for a few moments about the action that was taken by the House of Representatives last week in passing a tax cut for the middle-income, hard-working Americans. I commend the House for doing that and hope that the Senate will follow suit. I think it is very important that every year we give the taxpayers back something of what they have worked so hard to earn when we are looking at a surplus. That is, in fact, what we are looking at. 
You know, if I had said to my constituents 5 years ago, `I'm running for the U.S. Senate, and I'm going to balance the Federal budget,' most of them would have probably smiled benignly and thought, `Oh, at least she is naive enough to think that she can make a difference.' 
Well, in fact, that is exactly what has happened. I did run saying that I wanted to work to balance the budget. I did not promise that I would come to Washington and do it alone, but I did say that this is something I thought our Congress should do. In fact, in the Congress that came in in 1994, we did make the promise and keep the promise that we would balance the Federal budget. In fact, this year, we will see that balanced budget. 
So then, of course, the question comes, What are we going to do with the new surplus? Of course, there are lots of ideas. Of what we think is going to be a $1.5 trillion surplus over the next few years, the lion's share should go toward making sure that Social Security is secure--no question about it. But an $80 billion tax cut every year, I think, will stimulate the economy, will do what is right by America, and will correct some inequities that we have found in the Tax Code--the major portion of what the House passed is the bill that I introduced with Senator Faircloth last year and the year before; and that is to reduce the marriage tax penalty. 
In fact, if a policeman who makes about $33,000 a year in Houston, TX, marries a schoolteacher in Pasadena, TX, they have a penalty of $1,000, or a little more; and every person in those income categories in our country has the same. In fact, the average is about $1,400. Now, this is a young couple who gets married that wants to start saving to buy a new house or buy another car, have their nest egg, get started in life. And they get hit with a $1,000 penalty. 
That is not what was ever intended. But the Tax Code, because there are more two-income-earner couples now than when the last revision of the Tax Code was passed, in fact, has penalized those two-income-earning couples, many of whom have two incomes because they are trying to make ends meet. So we are taking away a part of their quality of life. So I commend the House for saying it is time to correct that inequity and it is our highest priority. I am pleased that they passed the bill that Senator Faircloth and I introduced. It is our highest priority. 
It will also help ease the burden for small business owners and farmers and ranchers and others who have been able to accumulate something to realize the American dream; and that is, that they would give their children a better start than they had by increasing the inheritance tax--the death tax--exemption to $1 million starting January 1 of next year. I think that is the right thing to do. It will begin to ease the tax on the elderly. I think we should do that. 
We have already eased the capital gains tax. I hope we can eliminate that. But, Madam President, I think it is important that we, every year, make a little bit more progress in giving the hard-working Americans more of the money they earn back to them so they can decide how to spend the money for their families rather than having Government decide for them. 
I hope the Senate will pass tax cuts. It is a high priority. I think we can have two goals that are very clear: We are going to save Social Security; and we are going to give a little bit of the money people work so hard to earn back to them to get our Government in perspective. 
I think it is time that we lowered the opportunities for spending at the Federal level, let the States and local governments have more leeway, have families have better opportunities to spend the money they earn, and to make sure that Social Security is secure. I think those are the right priorities for spending that surplus. I hope the Senate will follow suit. 
Thank you, Madam President. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I do support the Inhofe amendment. Having served on the National Transportation Safety Board, I can tell you that the NTSB normally does not overturn the FAA revocation of pilots' licenses. But they do, after they go through the process and look at all of the evidence. I think it is quite fair to say if someone is going to be disadvantaged by having a license revoked, that the NTSB could very easily, and quickly, look at the type of evidence that they are going to hear and, without making a final adjudication, determine that this person would or would not be eligible to fly during the pendency of the proceedings. 
I think it would introduce a new level in the process. It would be the emergency level. I think the NTSB can handle this. I think they are competent to do it, and I think their record shows that they have done it in the past. 
I do support the amendment.

 Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join forces with Senators Leahy and Jeffords to introduce legislation which confirms that zoning decisions should be the providence of local governments, not overseen by the Federal Communications Commission through the use of preemption authority. 
It has been my position for some time that the FCC does not have a role to play in local zoning, right of way management and franchising decisions. I fought hard during consideration of the Communications Act of 1996 to ensure that local governments have the right to exercise these fundamental authorities. The issues associated with the use and value of property, public and private, are most appropriately considered at the levels of government closest to the citizenry. Local governments can balance the needs of commerce and the use of property. If their judgment is subject to question, it should be reviewed by the court system. It should not be checked by a federal regulator, who is far less able to calculate the totality of a community's interest. 
This legislation is needed because local governments have contended with a proposed FCC rule to preempt local authority over the placement of broadcast towers. The rule, I understand, has been withdrawn as a result of an agreement between the FCC, local and state government interests and telecommunications industry interests under the auspices of the FCC's `Local and State Government Advisory Committee.' This agreement provides for facilities siting guidelines and informal dispute resolution. I applaud this agreement. I believe it represents the reality that local governments, in the main, do want to work cooperatively with telecommunications providers who want to serve the residents of a community. 
However, I believe that this legislation is still necessary. The FCC simply should not have the authority to preempt local zoning decisions. 
I look forward to working on the progress of this bill with my co-sponsors and appreciate the opportunity to act in support of the exercise of local authority.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to answer some of the arguments that have been made earlier in the debate. First, it keeps being said that the oil companies are not paying their fair share, that they are in lawsuits about it, and that they have been settling the lawsuits and therefore they must be guilty. All of this is totally separate from the amendment before us today. 
There is a disagreement between the oil companies and several States about how the valuations under the present regulation have been made. I want the oil companies to pay their fair share. So does the Senator from California, so does the Senator from New Mexico, so does the Senator from Louisiana. These matters are in court, and they will be settled in court. They have nothing to do with the amendment before us today. In fact, as the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Louisiana have said, the oil royalty valuation process is very complicated. 
The new MMS proposal is very complicated. In fact, I would make the case that we do not change anything in the process as far as making it clear what is owed. It is just a matter of the Mineral Management Service raising the rates on oil companies at a time when oil prices are at an all-time low. That is the issue. 
A second argument has been made that this only affects big oil companies. I would just say that I have received a memo from the Independent Producers Association of America that represents the small independent oil producers. And what they say is: `Percentage of oil producers impacted by proposed oil royalty rule--100 percent.' Because everyone who is in this industry knows that whatever is the standard for royalties on public lands is also the standard throughout the industry. 
So to say that we are only talking about 5 percent of the large oil companies in America is absolutely untrue. We are talking about small producers, independent producers, and we are talking about marginal producers. Those are the ones that are drilling 15 barrels or less a day. 
They are operating at very low margins. With the oil prices at 11- and 12-year lows, they are not even making a profit in many instances. So we are affecting oil jobs in our country. 
Now, it was said by the Senator from Illinois that the amendment delaying the rule was put on an emergency supplemental appropriations bill. That is true. It was put on an emergency supplemental appropriations bill and passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President. The reason it was put on is because the Bureau of Mineral Management Services announced they were going to finalize a rule without going through the congressional process that they had been told they must do. There was no alternative but to immediately stop that. Otherwise, they were going to implement a rule without reporting to the appropriate congressional committees. 
Of course, Congress exercised its prerogative to say no, that is not what we told you to do. After all, we do make the laws and the policies of this country. Raising taxes is the prerogative of Congress for a very good reason--because we are accountable to the people. If we are going to set the policies of this country, we must consider many things. We must consider jobs, we must consider crises, we must consider security, how much of our oil needs to be imported, is there a security issue in our country. The reason that elected representatives make policy is because we are accountable. We look at other factors such as how much of our oil we are importing, how many jobs are going to be affected, and what is the overall situation in the economy of our country. 
I want to talk about the first part of a policy decision that Congress considers, and that is jobs. Oil prices are at a 12-year low in this country. I refer to a chart for the jobs at risk in our country if we now raise the cost of drilling on oil companies. Let's take some examples: In California, 115,000 jobs are at stake; in Missouri, 31,000 jobs are at stake; in Montana, over 9,000; New Hampshire, over 3,000; New Jersey, almost 30,000; Nevada, over 7,000; Ohio, 54,000; Pennsylvania, 48,000; Texas, 253,000; Virginia, almost 30,000. 
Now, those are the jobs at stake. 
Let me just read to Members recent articles that talk about the job layoffs that are occurring right now because, of course, the industry is on its knees. 
August 28, 1998:  
J. Ray McDermott, a builder of offshore petroleum platforms, has laid off 41 employees in Houston [Texas], cutting about 10 percent of that office's staffing. 
[McDermott] left open the possibility that more layoffs could result if the oil market remains in a slump. 
August 29, 1998, Halliburton lays off 100: 
The state of the oil industry is being blamed for the layoffs of about 100 employees at Halliburton Energy Services [in Oklahoma.] 
August 12, 1998: 
Schlumberger laid off several hundred people in the second quarter and plans further cuts, as falling oil prices lower demand for its services and products. 
Schlumberger's news comes as a number of oil-field-service companies have been cutting staff in recent months. The industry is struggling with some of the lowest crude oil prices in 12 years. 
Oil and Gas Journal, August 3, 1998: 
Triton Energy Ltd., Dallas, laid off 65 employees from its Dallas office as a part of a corporate restructuring and cost-reduction plan. The move cuts Triton's Dallas staff by more than one third. 
August 18, 1998: 
Low prices particularly hurt small producers who rely on marginal, or stripper, wells producing less than 10 barrels of oil a day. Some 74 percent of New Mexico's 24,000 wells are considered marginal. 
Some small producers have cut back or eliminated new drilling projects. . . . 
Others have shut-in wells--stopping pumping, a solution intended to be temporary but which often results in permanent loss of production. 
Tom Dugan of Dugan Production Corp. in Farmington [New Mexico], said, `Essentially our income has been cut in half within the last six or seven months.' 
Dick Frank, the state Department of Labor's area director in Lea County [New Mexico], said the unemployment rate in the oil rich county has been climbing, reaching 6.7 percent in June. 
Oil and Gas Journal, July 20, 1998: 
An independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States survey has found that the plunge in oil prices is forcing marginal well shut-ins in the U.S. Rocky mountains. Twenty producers have shut in more than 200 marginal wells. . . . 
Big U.S. Independent Union Pacific Resources said it will slash its rig count from 49 to 18 for the balance of the year, further depressing an already shaking North America land rig market. 
Oryx Energy battened down the hatches, July 28, saying it will cut its 1,000-worker payroll costs 20 percent, or $14 million a year, and sell another 35 million of properties in response to continued weak oil prices. 
I think it is very important that we look at the impact on people, on their families, their lives, on States that are not going to have sales tax revenue if people don't have jobs in States that will have to start paying unemployment compensation because people don't have jobs. 
Yesterday, in the debate on the mining bill, Senator Harry Reid from Nevada said, `These are the best blue-collar workers in America,' and he was talking about gold prices being the lowest in years. I can make the same arguments today. The Senate voted for keeping the mining industry intact yesterday. As Senator Bumpers said, he lost his argument. 
The same arguments apply today. We have oil prices at their lowest in 11 years and we have the best blue-collar jobs in America. In fact, oil and gas jobs are among the highest paid in our economy. In Montana, for example, the average oil and gas jobs pay $32,380 compared to $20,500, which is the average of jobs in Montana. Every oil industry job creates an average of 2.3 service-related jobs. 
This is a very important issue for jobs in our country. As you can see, almost every State is affected. It not only creates jobs in the industry, but over two jobs in the service industry are related to oil production in our country. What could be bad about that? Yet, we are talking about raising fees and taxes on the companies that are on their knees, with low prices, that are laying people off as we speak. It doesn't make sense. 
The other side has said, `We are losing $5.5 million a month.' In fact, I thought Senator Landrieu made a very important point. We are talking about $6 billion in revenue to the Federal and State Governments, and they want to tear it down, saying they are going to add $5 million a month. You would jeopardize a steady stream of revenue from an industry that is on its knees, that is shutting down wells as we speak, to try to gain $5.5 million a month. Even if you thought you were going to get $5.5 million a month, you would have to assure that the companies are going to stay in business. 
If they go under, you are not going to get $5.5 million a month; you could lose $5.5 million a month, and those are jobs that we now have in place. Why would we jeopardize those and risk losing revenue, when you hope they will stay in business and gain revenue? That is not a very good hope when the industry is on its knees. 
Let's talk about the policy of raising taxes. In fact, we have shown, both in Congress and in 13 States, that lowering the taxes on the oil and gas industry have actually increased revenues. In fact, the Congress passed the Offshore Drilling Deep Water Royalty Relief Act in 1995. They gave tax relief, they gave tax breaks, lowered taxes, to companies that would go out and do the expensive drilling in the water, especially the Gulf of Mexico. For doing this, the Government has received $3.1 billion in bids on those leases in the gulf. This has created over 3,500 direct jobs to manage the increased activity. In fact, it has created $3 billion in revenue. So we have shown that when we lower revenue, we increase the amount that comes into the Federal Government. 
When we lower taxes, we increase revenue. This has been duplicated in my State of Texas, where they have given tax relief to drill the marginal wells which are less than 15 barrels a day in Texas. Or if someone goes in and unplugs a plugged well, they will get a tax break. Here is what that has done in Texas: 6,000 wells were returned to production; $1.65 billion came into the Texas economy; 10,000 direct and indirect jobs were created every year; and $22 million more went into the Texas treasury--$22 million by giving a tax break. Thirteen States have inactive well recovery programs that are doing the same thing. 
Yet, the amendment before us today would go in exactly the opposite direction. It would increase the amount that the oil companies would have to pay, putting many of these small producers in jeopardy because that will be the industry standard, creating a loss of jobs and, I submit, a loss in revenue. 
I have a chart that shows the economic effect of the abandonment of marginal wells just in 1997. The lost revenue to California was $45 million; Kansas, $24 million; Louisiana, $8 million; New Mexico, $19 million; Oklahoma, $29 million; Texas, $97 million. These are lost revenues because marginal wells went under. They had to plug the wells. This doesn't even address the lost jobs or the lost sales tax revenue to these States. 
So I think we have the evidence that raising taxes is going to cost revenue to the Federal Government, not raise revenue to the Federal Government, because so many of the wells in this country are marginal; they produce under 15 barrels a day. So if they go under, these States are not going to get more money for their schoolchildren, they are going to get less. That is what the amendment before us would do. 
Let's talk about another policy issue that Congress must address when we increase taxes on an industry. We import over 50 percent of the oil that we need in this country--the oil we need to drive our cars to work, the oil we need to operate our plants, the oil we need to produce fuel for every home in America. Fifty percent is imported. This is a national security issue. It is an economic issue. 
Does anybody remember what it was like when we had the severe oil shortage several years ago and people had lined up for 5 hours to get gas for their cars? They could not fill them up; they were limited. They were limited in the amount or the number of gallons they could put in because we had an oil shortage. 
This country cannot depend on imports if we are going to have control of our own economy. How could we be talking about shutting down wells and causing our dependency to become greater? It does not make sense. It would be highly irresponsible of this Senate to do something that would jeopardize every person driving a car in this country, every plant that operates, and every home that depends on oil or gas for its energy. We should not be even considering something so irresponsible.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. First is Citizens Against Government Waste. In part, they write: 
On behalf of the 600,000 members of the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, we respectfully ask you to oppose any efforts in the Senate to strike the provision in the Interior Appropriations Bill that delays the implementation of a final crude oil valuation rule, unless a resolution between MMS and industry can be reached. The Minerals Management Service proposed new oil valuation rules that would eventually raise taxes on producers. 
They go on to say: 
Passage of this provision in the Interior Appropriations Bill will provide the time necessary for MMS and the industry to reach a fair and workable agreement on the rule, benefiting both sides. 
Here is a letter from the Citizens for a Sound Economy: 
I write on behalf of the 250,000 members of Citizens for a Sound Economy regarding the Boxer amendment to the Interior Appropriations bill. . . . Historically, the cost of this type regulation is passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices for commodities. 
Of course, it makes sense that if we are going to raise the rates that producers have to pay, it is going to raise the price of every gallon of gas that you buy at the pump. 
Specifically, the Boxer amendment circumvents the authority of Congress to ensure that agencies of the Federal Government operate within the bounds of the law, and it will have the ultimate effect of increasing the cost of oil and gas for every American. 
This is in a letter from the National Black Chamber of Commerce: 
The cost of fuel is extremely influential in most levels of our economy and our competitiveness in the global market. Any approach in how we assess royalties is very critical to each and every one of us. Congress should certainly be involved as they truly represent the people, not bureaucrats. 
This is from the People for the USA: 
The new rule proposed by MMS is far too complex and could lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in the energy industry, where so many of our members are employed. . . . 
On behalf of the 25,000 members of our grassroots People for the USA campaign, I am respectfully asking you to resist any such efforts to remove this provision. 
Mr. President, we are talking about tax policy in this country. If you vote for the amendment before us today, we are saying that the Mineral Management Service can walk away from Congress and the congressional intent and congressional mandate that they report to us about any kind of fees or increases. 
If they do this--and if we allow them to do this--we will shut down marginal wells throughout our country, which we have already seen happening because of the low prices. Thousands of people will be out of jobs. We will lose revenue in our States and our Federal Government, hurting the schoolchildren of our States when they are not able to have that income stream that is now steady--$6 billion worth of steady income stream--which will become shaky from marginal producers because they cannot make ends meet. They are laying off people every day because of the low price of oil. 
This is not the time to raise prices. We should not let unelected bureaucrats do it, and we should not jeopardize the energy independence of our country by allowing a bureaucracy to raise taxes when that is the prerogative of Congress. 
Thank you. Mr. President, I thank Senator Domenici for his leadership, along with the bipartisan group that is trying to make sure we keep jobs and energy independence and gasoline pumps filled throughout our country.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his leadership. 
Which of these actions would be the act of a strong and powerful nation led by men and women of vision and foresight: a nation that constantly reassesses its security threats and tailors its defense to meet those threats, or a nation that sits back and says let's see what the threat is, then we will assess it and then we will address it? 
Mr. President, it was the latter thinking that caused us to go to a hollow military after World War II, and we paid the price with thousands of lives in the Korean war--lives of our men and women, because we hadn't planned for the future. 
Mr. President, we have gotten the wake-up call. It is the Rumsfeld report that Congress commissioned, which said that we have failed to estimate how long it would take rogue nations to develop ballistic missiles. That is the wake-up call. Are we going to meet the security threats of this country? The greatest security threat we have is incoming ballistic missiles. If we put our mind to the technology, we can prioritize our defense spending to say to the American people that we will protect you from incoming ballistic missiles to our shores, or to any theater where our Armed Forces are present. We can do no less if we are men and women of vision and foresight for the greatest Nation on Earth. 
I urge your support for the Cochran visionary amendment that would protect our country at the earliest opportunity.

 Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man for whom I have great respect; a man who inspired and taught me while I attended the University of Texas Law School. I am speaking of Law Professor Charles Alan Wright. Today is Charles Alan Wright's birthday. Charles Alan Wright is one of the most distinguished constitutional authorities in the country, a champion for racial justice, and the model of what a great lawyer should be. For more than forty years he has shaped and influenced generations of Texas lawyers while teaching at the UT Law School, including myself. Professor Wright also does not shy from a challenge. He has argued twelve times before the Supreme Court, winning most of his cases, some of them landmark decisions. As an author, Professor Wright has written one of the most definitive texts in the arena of law, Federal Practice and Procedure, cited by many as the bible for federal judges. His pursuit of professional excellence is mirrored by his righteous courage, having fought for desegregation and to put an end to racial intolerance.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will speak briefly about what Senator McCain and I are trying to do. 
My amendment says that no funds will be contributed to North Korea until the President has certified that North Korea is not providing ballistic missiles or ballistic missile technology to a country, the government of which the Secretary of State has determined is a terrorist government. 
This adds to Senator McCain's amendment which has the same prohibition of funding for North Korea if they are continuing to build a nuclear weapon. 
Senator McCain and I are clearly saying that the United States will not continue to fund an agreement with North Korea that we know is being violated. The McCain amendment deals with the nuclear capability North Korea appears to be building. It would restrict the use of funds for the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization pending a Presidential certification that North Korea has stopped its nuclear weapons program as it has promised to do. My amendment adds the requirement that North Korea is not transferring ballistic missile technology to other terrorist countries. 
Mr. President, this week, we saw what trying to coerce and reward a totalitarian dictatorship will achieve. North Korea launched a two-stage ballistic missile toward Japan, a country which has provided emergency food relief to North Korea and wound up having a ballistic missile pass through their air space as thanks. 
North Korea has admitted selling ballistic missiles to raise hard currency. It has made repeated threats to restart its nuclear program, claiming that the United States has not honored its obligations. Recently we learned of evidence that the North Koreans are ignoring their part of the agreement and building a new underground site for nuclear weapons development. 
I raised concerns 4 years ago when the Clinton administration proposed this framework agreement. It seemed to be an all-carrot-no-stick approach to North Korea. The agreement was to help develop a peaceful nuclear program giving them 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil. I was concerned that the nuclear weapons program would continue and that the fuel oil that we promised would be diverted to military use. I am sorry to say both seem to have occurred. The fuel was diverted almost immediately for military use. 
Since signing the agreement, the North Koreans have also continued to conduct military operations against South Korea, sending spy submarines into South Korean waters and discharging commandos on to South Korean territory. This is hardly the behavior of a partner to an agreement, and sending them a no-strings gift of 35 million American taxpayer dollars is hardly a responsible act for the U.S. Congress to make. 
The North Korean launch this week of the ballistic missile over the airspace of Japan was truly a shot across the bow of the civilized world. North Korea was warned beforehand that testing this type of missile would have a direct impact on our negotiations. They ignored the warning. We must make it clear to the North Koreans that we cannot and will not disconnect North Korean conventional military activity from the nuclear issue. Their failure to meet their obligations not to build nuclear weapons, nor to sell the technology to rogue nations, cannot be disassociated from our contribution to their country. We must stop rewarding dangerous North Korean provocations. This amendment will ensure that we do just that. 
Mr. President, I urge adoption of the second-degree amendment to the McCain amendment. 
Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. I want to thank the Senator from Kentucky, who is a cosponsor of this second-degree amendment, for helping us with it because obviously, when the committee was putting together its bill, we did not know of North Korea's provocative actions of last week. 
I think it is imperative that the Senate act very decisively to say that we are not going to continue to appease a country that is clearly selling technology to rogue nations that would harm our own allies and, furthermore, is breaking an agreement they made with us in return for which we would have assisted the people of North Korea in developing peaceful energy sources. 
I hope, with all my heart, that North Korea will back up, that it will keep its commitment to stop building a nuclear weapon. I hope that it will step back and stop selling ballistic missile technology to rogue nations. Then it would be eligible for the money that has been fenced in this bill. 
But until they do, it would be highly irresponsible for the U.S. Senate to go forward with a no-strings-attached gift of 35 million taxpayer dollars that are against the interests of the United States and all of our allies. 
Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his leadership on this issue.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Maine. 
Mr. President, I think it should be noted that all six Senators from three affected States are supportive of this legislation. 
I want to begin my remarks with the most important thing I can possibly say, and that is, I would never support a hazardous waste site in my State that wasn't in full compliance with Federal and Texas environmental laws and regulations. This is the most important of all of the things that I could possibly say. 
This compact came about because of Federal legislation--the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act and its 1985 amendments. They allowed States to come together, and encouraged States to come together, to find waste disposal facilities that would meet the needs of our country. 
In fact, all of us would love not to have any waste that would be put anywhere. But if we didn't have waste, we wouldn't have medical remedies, we wouldn't have the cures for people's diseases. That is what this waste is. It is not nuclear waste. It not high-level hazardous waste. It is low-level medical waste. 
The law has created 41 States that have formed 9 low-level radioactive waste compacts. Minnesota is a member of one such compact ratified by Congress in 1985. Nine compacts have been formed. And the compact that Texas, Maine, and Vermont have created is no different from these, and it seeks to provide the citizens of our three States the same protections enjoyed by the State of Minnesota and the other 40 States that have formed compacts. 
I think it is very important that we address the issue of how this came about. 
A compact agreement was negotiated by former Governor Ann Richards with the Governors of Maine and Vermont. The compact was overwhelmingly approved by the Texas State Legislature and signed by Governor Richards in 1993. That compact now enjoys the support of our current Governor, George Bush, and our Lieutenant Governor, Bob Bullock. 
Maine's compact was passed by their legislature and signed in 1993. It also passed a State-wide referendum. In Vermont, legislation was passed by the legislature and signed by the Governor in 1994. I don't think the Federal Government has a mandate to nullify a contract among three State Governors and ratified by their legislatures. 
I think it is also important that we address the local issue that has been addressed by the Senator from Minnesota. 
We have not yet--the three States together, nor the State of Texas--decided on a place for this radioactive waste. However, there is careful consideration being given to Hudspeth County, which is the focus of where they are looking for the site of this low-level waste compact as a place where they are going to put the waste. 
Hudspeth County is the third largest county in Texas, with 4,566 square miles. It has a population of 3,200 people. 
I want my colleagues to know that the vast majority of the county's leadership support locating this facility in Hudspeth County as long as it is done in an environmentally safe way, which the Governor has promised will happen or it will not be created.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the issue before us today is whether the citizens of Texas, Maine, and Vermont will enjoy the same protections as 41 other States to ensure safe and environmentally sound disposal of dangerous radioactive material. 
The local support is there. The Governor has assured us that there will not be a site selected until all of the scientific data shows that this is where it should go, and we are doing exactly what Congress directed us to do in creating safe places for this low-level radioactive waste. 
I hope my colleagues will support this, as all of the six Senators who have a direct interest in this are doing. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Maine. I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, just before the Senator's modification of my amendment, I want to add that as people in America today are going to the movie theaters and seeing for the first time the horrors of war, if every person who sees `Saving Private Ryan' will think about this great leader, Strom Thurmond, whom we are talking about today, and realize that this was a man who, in his forties, volunteered to go into World War II, and went into Normandy--the sights of which most of us could not have imagined unless we saw this movie--and was there in his forties, volunteered to be there to serve his country--as Senator Coats so well said, they will never make another Strom Thurmond. 
I just want to add my accolades for this great man and what he has given for our country besides voting 15,000 times. He has done so much more. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coats for his addition to my amendment, because I do think it strengthens the base amendment. What Senator McCain has done is assure, in order to get this money, that there would be no nuclear proliferation by North Korea. My amendment then comes in and says we will not allow the ballistic missile technology to be sold by North Korea to terrorist nations. I think the amendment of Senator Coats strengthens both of these by assuring the certification process is real. 
I think it is very clear that the Senate is speaking with a very loud voice that we are not going to continue to sit back and let North Korea break the agreement that they made, sell technology to terrorist nations that would use that technology against the United States or our allies anywhere in the world, and let them do it and reward them for it. We are not going to do it. The signal is clear. The Senate is speaking. 
I thank Senator Coats, I thank Senator McConnell, I thank Senator McCain for working together to send a very clear message that we want North Korea to abide by the agreement they made. If they do, we will reward them. If they do not, they will not get one penny of taxpayers' money from this country. 
Mr. President, I urge my amendment.

 Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to engage my colleague, Senator DeWINE, in a colloquy. 
I thank Senator Jeffords, and the other members of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources for your collective efforts in passing H.R. 1385, the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. This bill promises to improve and revitalize our country's workforce system and will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our federal job training programs. 
As you know, Texas has been in the forefront of the remaking its state and local workforce delivery system. Beginning in 1993, Texas created a system very similar to one embodied in HR 1385. As with this federal legislation, the new Texas system is based on the principles of local control, customer service, and consolidation. 
In this regard, I commend you for recognizing in the bill the uniqueness and foresight of the Texas workforce system by providing flexibility in the bill for our state to fully implement its new laws. 
Specifically, I understand that HR 1385 provides that Texas will be able to maintain use of its Human Resource Investment Council (known as the Texas Council for Workforce and Economic Competitiveness) as defined in Texas statute and regulation to fulfill the State Board requirements under Section 111. In addition, Section 117(I) provides that Texas will be able to maintain the Local Workforce Development Boards as defined in Texas statute and regulation to fulfill the Local Board requirements under Section 117. Section 189(I)(2) provides that Texas may maintain the current local workforce board areas as defined in Texas statute and regulation to fulfill the requirements under section 116, and that no other language in HR 1385 may be construed to force Texas to change the configuration of its 28 local workforce areas. Section 189(I)(3) provides that Texas may maintain its sanctioning process for local boards. Section 194(a)(1)(A) provides that Texas may maintain it current process and formulas for allocating funds under sections 127 and 132 to its local workforce boards and that Texas may maintain it current procedures for disbursing money that is allocated to local workforce boards. Section 194(a)(1)(B) provides that local workforce boards in Texas may maintain their disbursal processes and procedures for monies provided under sections 127 and 132. Section 194(a)(2) provides that Texas may maintain the procedure as defined in Texas statute and regulation through which fiscal agents are designated by local boards for monies provided under sections 127 or 132. Section 194(a)(3) provides that Texas may maintain its process by which local boards designate or select one-stop partners and one-stop operators, notwithstanding any requirements set forth in section 121. Section 194(a)(4) provides that Texas may maintain its requirements that service providers shall not be permitted to perform both intake and training services. Section 194(a)(5) provides that Texas may maintain the roles and functions of its state board (otherwise known as the Texas Council for Workforce and Economic Competitiveness) and that no requirements for elements of state plans shall be construed to force a role or function upon Texas' State Board that is inconsistent with Texas statute or regulation. Section 194(a)(6) provides that Texas may maintain the roles and functions of its Local Boards and that no requirements for elements of state or local plans shall be construed to force a role or function upon Texas' local board that is inconsistent with Texas statute or regulation.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Amendment No. 3413 has to do with Bosnia. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-hutchison-tx-3-19980730</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, amendment No. 3413 is to condition the use of appropriated funds for the purpose of an orderly and honorable reduction of U.S. ground forces in Bosnia. 
It is a fact that the U.S. Armed Forces have accomplished the military mission assigned to them as a component of the implementation and stabilization forces. The continuing and open-ended commitment of U.S. ground forces in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is subject to the oversight authority of Congress. 
Mr. President, this is the first time that Congress will vote on any kind of resolution that would establish some kind of policy on Bosnia since the President decided that it would be an unending mission. 
On November 27, 1995, the President said that America would be part of a multinational military implementation force that would terminate in about a year. The President declared the expiration of the mandate to be December 20, 1996. 
The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time expressed the critical importance of establishing a firm deadline in the absence of which there is a potential for expansion of the mission of U.S. forces. 
That was a forceful statement by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He said it is a recipe for mission creep not to have a termination date. 
On October 3, 1996, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs announced the intention of the United States to delay removal until March 1997. In November of 1996, the President announced that we would delay until June of 1998. The President did not request authorization by the Congress of a policy that would result in the further deployment of U.S. forces in Bosnia until June 1998. 
Notwithstanding the passage of two previously established deadlines, the reaffirmation of those deadlines by senior national security officials, and the endorsement by those same national security officials of the importance of having a deadline, nevertheless, the President announced on December 17, 1997, that establishing a deadline had been a mistake and that U.S. ground combat forces would be committed to the NATO-led mission in Bosnia for an indefinite amount of time. 
What my amendment does is very simple. It says that funds appropriated will not be made available except as conditioned below; that the President will bring the number of troops down to 6,500 by February of next year and 5,000 by October of 1999, so we are staying within this fiscal year. Now, the exceptions are very broad at the discretion of the President and the Secretary of Defense that U.S. forces would have enough forces to protect themselves as the drawdowns proceed. So we are, of course, going to give the protection to the forces as the drawdown goes forward. 
This doesn't take us out of Bosnia, which many in this body feel that we should do, that we should begin this at the base, for an honorable withdrawal. It just says, by the end of the fiscal year of the budget that we are considering, that our troop level would be down from about 8,500 to about 5,000. This should start the process of working with our allies to have a better distribution and sharing of responsibility among our allies and the United States. 
This is a European security issue. The United States has approximately double the number of forces that any of our European allies have. We want to be a good ally. In fact, I don't want to pull up stakes and leave Bosnia without doing it in a responsible way. I think that is our responsibility. But, in fact, many of us have asked the President repeatedly to lay the groundwork with an established and clear mission that has a chance to succeed, a mission that has a finite term so that both our allies and any enemies of our cause would know exactly what to expect from America. That would not be possible at this time. We have said we were going to leave twice, and we have not left. We have not left, and we have not laid a proper base to leave. 
What I am asking the President to consider and what I ask the American people to consider is that we start the process of realigning the forces in Bosnia so that our contribution would be reduced and our allies in NATO would begin to take a greater share of the burden. 
Why is this important? We are looking at a time when our military readiness is being called into question. In fact, if you look at all of the responsibilities that America has in the world, we are spending too much on Bosnia and putting the future security of the United States and our ability to respond in the future in other places where America may have to respond, even unilaterally, in jeopardy. That is not the course we should be taking. 
It is most important that America start with the issue of Bosnia and address it in a way that we should by putting it in context with our overall responsibilities in the world. The Bosnia operation has already diverted nearly $10 billion from our national defense. A growing lament at the Pentagon among senior officers is that we are in danger of returning to the hollow forces of the militaries of the late 1970s. 
Let me mention some of the indicators that demonstrate our military is once again at risk. Last year, the military had its worst recruiting year since 1979. The Army failed to meet its objective to recruit infantry soldiers, the single most important specialty in the Army. A Senate Budget Committee investigator recently reported finding serious Army-wide personnel and readiness problems. At the National Training Center, where our troops go for advanced training, units rotating in typically come with a 60 percent shortage in mechanics and often a 50 percent shortage in infantry. These shortages were blamed on the fact that these personnel, especially the mechanics, are deployed abroad for missions such as Bosnia. 
More than 350 Air Force pilots turned down the $60,000 bonuses they would have received to remain in the cockpit another 5 years--a 29 percent acceptance rate. That is compared with 59 percent last year and 81 percent in 1995. That is a stark trend. The Air Force is finding that whatever the perks, it can't hold its best pilots. Last year, about 500 pilots resigned. Most of them were lured by the airlines. This year the number will be 700, and the Air Force says it is not able to train enough new pilots to replace them. 
When I have gone and visited our bases overseas and at home and I ask our enlisted military men and women why we are losing our experienced people, almost every time the answer is: Too much time away from our families on operations that don't seem that necessary. A Senate Budget Committee investigator also found that some small units are now being led by junior people because sergeants are off on peacekeeping duty. As a result, subunits from basic squads on up do not train with the leaders they would go to war with--breaking the rule of training just as you would go to war. 
Since 1991, the United States has cut its Armed Forces by about a third. It may be more difficult, more risky, and possibly more costly to invade Iraq right now. We are going to debate and vote on a resolution today, hopefully, expressing our support for the President's strong actions toward Iraq. But the fact is, if anything went wrong, we would have to divert troops from every theater in the world to prevail. Defense cuts of almost 50 percent over the last decade have put our security at risk. But this has been made worse by the diversion of U.S. resources and readiness to places where there is no security threat to the United States, such as Bosnia, Haiti, and elsewhere. 
We have spent more time discussing Bosnia than missile defense, which is a security risk to our country. We are not developing a policy that is going to put our country in the best position to deal with the myriad of issues that will face this country and our security in the next century. 
President Clinton and his administration are missing a big-picture view of the world and the proper role for the United States. Our growing involvement in Bosnia is a good example of that. Just last week, U.S. forces were directly involved in tracking down and capturing a war criminal. 
The Dayton accords have made it clear that apprehension of war criminals would be the responsibility of the parties to Dayton--civilian police and government officials. In fact, a little more than 1 year ago now, the former NATO commander, George Joulwan, told the Congress this:  
The military are not policemen. And I think the proper responsibility rests on the parties. That is what Dayton says. . .[I]f we are not careful, we will go down this slippery slope where the military will be put in the position of hunting down war criminals. That is not within the mandate. 
That is Gen. George Joulwan. 
I joined with many of my colleagues in the Senate to oppose the decision to send troops to Bosnia. One of our principal concerns was that, once there, our mission would be indefinite, and that it might lead to mission creep. We were bolstered in our concerns by former Secretary of Defense William Perry and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Shalikashvili. They both warned that without a specific deadline for withdrawal there would be the potential for expanding the mission. 
I am concerned that Secretary Perry's warnings are coming true. While we were on a recent recess, the President announced that thousands of U.S. troops would remain in Bosnia after the June 30 deadline, remembering that the Senate had unanimously endorsed that deadline of June 30, 1998, which his administration had established. 
After 240 U.S. Marines were killed in Lebanon in 1984, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger established six principles upon which the decision to send U.S. ground troops should be based. Here is what he said:

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma, the Senator from Alabama, the Senator from West Virginia, who have all made very strong statements about their commitment and the commitment of Congress to support our troops. It is our responsibility to do this. 
I want to answer a couple of points that were made. Somalia--the argument was made that troops were not provided equipment and we lost 18 rangers. That is exactly correct. I would hold up Somalia as the very reason that we should be doing something today to protect our troops in the field--because, in fact, in Somalia Congress was never consulted. The decision not to send the equipment was made by the Pentagon. It is precisely because Congress was not consulted and was not committed to this that it failed so miserably. The mission creep in Somalia is exactly what we are trying to avoid in Bosnia today. And that is why I have this amendment on the floor. 
Let us talk about precedent. On July 31, 1989, there was a resolution requiring the President to reduce the number of U.S. forces in Korea. That is exactly what I would hope that we would do today. Nine years ago, almost to the day, Congress met its responsibility. This was an amendment that specifically asked the President to come forward with a plan to have gradual reductions in the number of U.S. military personnel stationed in the Republic of Korea. 
This is exactly what we are doing today. We are saying, in this appropriations bill for this fiscal year, that we should reduce the number of forces so that the President can go to our allies and start negotiating for a more equitable spread. That is exactly what we did in Korea. 
With Korea we said, `The Republic of Korea should assume increased responsibilities for its own security.' This was an amendment that was sponsored by Senator McCain, Senator Nunn, Senator Warner, Senator Exxon, Senator Dixon, Senator Wirth, Senator Shelby, Senator Thurmond, Senator Cohen, Senator Wallop, Senator Gorton, Senator Lott, and Senator Coats. 
This is exactly what I hope we will do today. It is the responsibility of Congress to provide support for our troops. We cannot stand by and watch our military disintegrate, lose our most experienced warriors, put them in harm's way, and do nothing. 
Have we lost our backbone in 9 years? Or have we lost our compass? Have we lost the will to do what is right for this country? 
Congress is responsible for providing the support for our troops. And I hope that we will meet our responsibility today. 
Thank you, Mr. President. And I yield the floor.

So many people are now talking about the hollow military that we seem to be going into, and I think it is time that Congress address the concern that all of us have that we may be driving our military down to the point that we will not be able to respond if something happens where we are needed anywhere in the world. 
So, I make the following findings: 
That since 1989: 
The national defense budget has been cut in half as a percentage of the gross domestic product; 
The national defense budget has been cut by over $120 billion in real terms;

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Delaware, because I wanted to be able to speak on this matter. I have just come from a committee markup. But the bill that is on the floor as an amendment is actually a bill that Senator Faircloth and I introduced. 
I am very pleased that Senator Brownback and Senator Ashcroft and others have pursued this, because I think it is at the core of what we should be doing in this Congress; that is, to try to give people back the money they worked so hard to earn. 
It is so important that we address the issue of the couple from Houston whom I met recently. He is a police officer. He makes $33,500 a year. She is a teacher in the Pasadena Independent School District. She earns $28,200 per year. They were married and immediately had to pay an increased tax of over $1,000. 
Mr. President, this is a young couple who just got married who want to begin to save to purchase a new home, and they are hit with a $1,000 penalty because they got married. 
This is of the utmost importance. It is an issue that we must address this year. 
I appreciate that the Senator from Delaware, who is the chairman of the Finance Committee, has said if we have tax cuts, this will be the first priority. I know he agrees with us on the merits. He may disagree on process or on whether we use this bill as a vehicle. That is understandable. But in the end, Mr. President, it is very important that we speak for the working young people of our country to make sure they get a fair shake when it comes to taxes. 
Twenty-one million couples are paying a penalty because they are in that middle-income level, and when they get married, they get assessed an average of $1,400 a year more. Simply because they wanted to get married and raise a family, they are penalized by the U.S. Government. 
We must correct this inequity. That is what our bill, the Faircloth-Hutchison bill does. That is what Senator Brownback and Senator Ashcroft are trying to do with this amendment. We are together on this. 
If this isn't the right process, if this isn't the right time, let's find the right time. Let's commit to the right time, because we must correct this inequity. I hope the Senate will speak very firmly that this is our priority. 
I want to address one last issue, and that is Social Security. 
Do we have to compete between tax cuts and Social Security? Absolutely not. In fact, I think many of us are going to support all of the surplus of the Social Security system going into saving Social Security. That is our first priority. We are going to have a budget surplus that is separate and apart from the surplus in Social Security. We are saying that the surplus should go to tax cuts, because those of us who have been around here for a few years have begun to see that if there is any excess revenue in this budget, all of a sudden we get very creative about how to spend taxpayer dollars. We must remember, the money does not belong to us, it belongs to the people who work so hard to earn it. And it must be returned to them before somebody gets very creative with some new program that would take the money from the families who earn it. That is the issue. 
Let's set aside the surplus from Social Security. And let's start the process of saving Social Security and making it even better, which I think we are going to be able to do in a bipartisan way in this Senate. But let's also take the surplus from the revenue that is coming in and give it back to the people who earn it--the people to whom it makes a big difference. If they have that $1,400, that is six or seven car payments, several payments on a student loan or maybe the couple is saving for their first home. We can help them with those expenses, and we should. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished Senator from Delaware for allowing me to make those points. 
I hope we will do the right thing. I hope we will make this our highest priority in this Congress, along with saving Social Security. We can do both. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I join my colleagues and our fellow citizens all across this country in honoring the memories of Detective John Gibson and Private First Class Jacob Chestnut. These two fine law enforcement officers gave their lives in the line of duty during a tragedy on Friday, July 24, 1998, while guarding the United States Capitol. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of these two fine gentlemen. 
The United States Capitol is recognized the world over as the symbol of American freedom and of the still revolutionary idea that citizens confer power upon those who serve us in government. That it could become the scene of so heinous an act as this cannot but shake us from the complacency by which we sometimes take this all for granted. 
But on a beautiful summer day and with thousands of ordinary people in sight, Officers Chestnut and Gibson gave their lives as proof that everyday, in places as near as our Capitol and as far away as seven seas, men and women serve selflessly to protect the freedom that is the American birthright and the dream of millions around the globe. 
I commend the United States Capitol Police, the D.C. Metropolitan Police, and the other law enforcement agencies that have performed so professionally throughout this difficult period. They are a continuing tribute to their fallen comrades, and I trust that they will be inspired to serve on in their memory.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I just want to say that all of us in the Capitol have one overriding thought in our minds right now, and that is that our hearts go out to the families of the two officers who were slain in the line of duty last Friday. 
All of us were in a different place. But I will never forget where I was when learning this tragic news. I had left the Capitol that morning and had returned home to Texas. I was just stunned. And when I learned that these officers had passed away after their injuries, I was heartsick, as all of us were. 
There is no question that the Capitol Police are friends to all of us. When I came into the Capitol this morning and saw the black tape across their badges, it all hit. And I want to say there is not anyone here who has worked with these fine men and women who doesn't appreciate every day the job they do protecting all of us and every visitor to the Capitol.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to speak on behalf of the Hagel amendment, because I, too, am very concerned about the safety and soundness of our nation s credit unions. 
Mr. President, I was State treasurer of Texas and dealt with banks and certainly credit unions, as well as other kinds of financial institutions. 
I think the banking system that we have, while it could use some improvement--and perhaps there is going to be legislation in the future that is going to have a few more areas of deregulation--nevertheless, I think the banking system that has niches for the different banking institutions and the balancing of those niches has served us well. 
I think the credit unions have particularly been a breath of fresh air in our banking system, because they have been able to offer something that banks and savings and loan associations and other finance institutions have not been able to offer. They have had unique characteristics in that they have been member-owned and member-operated institutions. 
Credit unions do not operate for profit and, therefore, do not pay taxes. Credit unions have limitations on their membership, generally based on affinity among the members. They rely on volunteer boards of directors that come from their membership. They have been able, because of the lack of taxes and because of this affinity, to give great services to their members. They have been able to offer mortgages, automobile loans, and personal loans that have been very favorable to their members. And they have served a terrific purpose. 
I want credit unions to stay strong in order to continue giving these kinds of services to their members. We are expanding the types of membership they can have. It is certainly going to be a bigger arena. But, nevertheless, I don't think we should take that next step into allowing a risky commercial loan portfolio without the requisite reserves that are required by banks and which I think are important for safety and soundness. 
The Hagel amendment limits commercial loan activity to 7 percent of assets. That is what the bill requires for the reserves for a well financed and strong credit union. We want to make sure that the deposits of credit union members are not put more at risk than the reserves that are required to be kept, particularly when you get into commercial lending, which is much more risky than the home mortgages and automobile loans and the personal loans that credit unions have made. 
I remember what happened when Congress started trying to eliminate the differences among the financial institutions. And that is what caused the S&L crisis. We had S&Ls going into real estate lending without the requisite reserves. All of us paid a heavy price for that. I do not want to jeopardize the strength of our credit union. 
I hope that when we pass this amendment, if we pass this amendment, it will provide for the strengthening of the credit union. I will support this bill. I think it is a wonderful bill in many respects, because it is going to give more people more access to credit unions. But I think we have to make sure, as we do it, that we protect the safety and soundness of the deposit of credit union members, as well as the credit union industry itself. 
The last thing I want is to come back here at the end of my next term and have to look at a credit union crisis because we didn't take the very cautious step of requiring this same reserve requirement as the limit on commercial loans. 
That is it in a nutshell. 
I think the fact that Senator Hagel's amendment matches the reserves with the amount of commercial loans that will be available is a very correct decision. It is the right thing to do. It will keep the safety and soundness of credit unions, and it will allow more people to have access to those commercial loans, as well as access to the credit unions in general. But mainly we want to make sure that everyone is protected and that we don't run into any trouble in the future. 
I hope very much that we will pass this bill. I hope we will pass the Hagel amendment so that we have a win all the way around--giving more access to more people to join the credit union; giving more people access to the lower interest home mortgages, car loans, personal loans, but making sure that we protect those deposits so that the credit unions will be able to continue to give a little bit higher rate of interest to those that it is paying; and so that the deposits will be safe; so that the credit union itself will be safe; so that we will not have to face a financial crisis in the future that Congress would have to address with taxpayer dollars as we have seen with the S&L crisis. 
I thank Senator Hagel and the others for their leadership. I think this is a good, sound move. I hope we can pass this amendment and then pass the bill that will create bigger and better credit unions in our country. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to explain a provision included in the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill manager's amendment and to convey my thanks to Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings for including it. This provision directs funding for the Student Incentive Payment (SIP) program for FY99. 
I am very concerned about language in the Administration's budget calling for a four-year phase-out of SIP, beginning in FY99. These payments are used to help students at state maritime schools defray the cost of their education. In exchange for an annual stipend while they are in school, these students incur a 6 year obligation in the Navy and Merchant Marine Reserve. They represent an important element of the Navy's professional mariners and a cadre of trained professionals available in the event of a national emergency when activation of the Ready Reserve Fleet is required. 
I commend the subcommittee for sharing my concern. The subcommittee report reflects this concern by calling upon MARAD to report on the willingness of the Navy to pay for the program. However, I understand that discussions between the Navy and MARAD are still on-going which, while encouraging, may mean that the incoming class at state maritime academies may not be able to take advantage of SIP as their classmates ahead of them have, and those behind them hopefully will. If we are going to ensure continuity, we have to fund SIP for another year in this bill. 
This provision restores SIP funding in the FY99 budget, preserving the program in order to allow the Navy to assume the funding responsibility beginning in FY2000. I am pleased that we have bought more time for MARAD and the Navy to negotiate the transfer of financial responsibility for this program. I am very hopeful that we will have a negotiated continuation of SIP under the Navy in FY2000 and beyond. I thank the Chairman for working with me to ensure this result.

 Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to recognize and remember the importance of the previous two days in American history. July nineteenth and twentieth, 1998, mark the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention in Seneca Falls, New York. This gathering of American women and men began a movement in our nation that changed the role of women in this country and, ultimately, around the world. Because of the convention's tremendous impact on the American way of life, I joined Senator Torricelli and several other Senate colleagues in recently introducing a Senate resolution honoring the women's rights movement and saluting those who made it all happen. Today I speak in honor of this occasion. 
Women's struggle for equality had very humble beginnings. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a housewife and mother of three sons, and Lucretia Mott, a Quaker teacher and staunch abolitionist, were ejected from the 1840 World Anti-Slavery Convention in London simply because they were women. Outraged at such an injustice, they were compelled to call attention to the many freedoms denied to women, including the right to vote or hold elective office, the right to own property if married, the right to obtain a professional education and the basic right to protect oneself from an abusive spouse. 
Mrs. Stanton and Miss Mott, along with Jane Hunt, Martha Coffin Wright and Mary Ann McClintock, called for a public convention to discuss the social, civil and religious rights of women. The first meeting of the women's rights movement convened at the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel in Seneca Falls, New York. Over 300 men and women attended the two day conference, including Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass. 
The highlight of the convention was the reading of the Declaration of Sentiments, a document composed on Mrs. McClintock's kitchen table. The statement was based on the words of our Declaration of Independence, applying its self-evident truths to both males and females and declaring all men and women equal. The document even called for a woman's right to vote, a revolutionary idea at the time. In fact, while 68 women and 32 men signed the Declaration of Sentiments, more than 200 attendees refused to endorse such an outrageous notion. Today, it is difficult to imagine a democratic society that would not permit women to hold elective office, sign legal documents or attend the church of their choice, much less exercise the basic right to vote. 
Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and the other founders of the women's rights movement epitomized the strength of the American woman and exhibited the courage necessary to put an end to a great injustice. They understood the road before them would be long and hard. Little did they know, however, that it would be more than 70 years before women would be granted suffrage in the United States. Today the movement is symbolized by the unfinished marble carving of the Suffrage advocates now displayed in the Capitol Rotunda. 
The calling of the Seneca Falls Convention and the passion of those involved forever changed the course of American history. All Americans should honor the efforts of these intrepid women and learn from their commitment to a cause in which they so deeply believed. Without the fortitude shown throughout this arduous struggle for equality, I could not be standing before you on the Senate floor today.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Cochran and Senator Bumpers for helping pass a sense-of-the-Senate resolution about an hour ago that addresses the devastating drought that we have been experiencing in Texas. They did it on behalf of Senator Gramm and myself. This is a very important sense of the Senate, because it direct the Secretary of Agriculture to do everything possible to relieve the drought conditions--not to provide rain, obviously, but to do everything we can to prepare for the relief that is going to be necessary due to the economic losses that Texas farmers and ranchers are facing because of the worst drought that we have seen in my memory in the State of Texas. 
In fact, it is now estimated that more than $4.6 billion in losses will result to the agriculture community according to the Texas Agricultural Extension Service. Direct losses of income to agricultural producers is $517 million, which will lead to another $1.2 billion in economic activity for the State. 
What we are asking the Secretary to do is to streamline the drought declaration process to provide necessary relief as quickly as possible. The Secretary has released CRP acres in 53 counties for haying and grazing. 
It will help to have these acres available for grazing because there is so little grass and few crops able to grow right now. Not only will haying the land provide food for the livestock, but it will take up dry grass so that it will not be a fire hazard. 
In addition, we have asked and the President has given us an emergency declaration so that we can start positioning equipment in places where there is imminent danger of wildfires. We are very concerned about this potential because we have had so little rain for such a long period of time. 
We have also ensured that the local farm agencies are equipped with full-time and emergency personnel in these drought-stricken areas to assist the producers with the disaster loan application pages. We are doing everything we can to prepare for the disaster that we are seeing unfold before our very eyes in our State right now. In fact, we have had more days of back-to-back temperatures over 100 than at any time in our State's history. 
As you know, when you have, day after day after day, of no rain, and over 100-degree temperatures, it does start baking our land pretty quickly. I hope the Secretary of Agriculture will continue to respond to the requests that Senator Gramm and I are making. As I will continue to do everything to prepare for the farmers who are losing their crops--as we speak right now--to give them the insurance that they need to get through this year economically. 
I want to thank both Senator Cochran and Senator Bumpers for working with us to expedite this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I just hope that, in lieu of rain, we will do everything else we can to prepare and give a cushion to the farmers and ranchers of my State that are suffering greatly right now.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank the Senator from Washington for allowing me to use some time because I think there are a couple of other Senators who will be speaking on her side very shortly. 
Mr. President, I commend Senator Hatch for his commitment to ensuring protection of private property rights as required by our Constitution and for trying to do everything we can to assure the private property provision of our Constitution is adhered to. People seem to overlook the fifth amendment sometimes, which says that: 
No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation. 
In spite of this unequivocal protection of private property in the Bill of Rights, the Federal Government has often adopted laws that violate these important rights. One law, for example, which has been implemented to the detriment of private property rights in Texas is the Endangered Species Act. In the Texas Panhandle, the Endangered Species Act has been used to protect a bait fish called the Arkansas River shiner. To protect the fish in Texas, even though it thrives in New Mexico, the water supply for cities such as Amarillo and agriculture in the area are put in jeopardy. In Travis County, families who purchased residentially zoned lots in good faith to build their homes are being penalized. In addition to the cost of their lots, they are forced to pay $1,500 as an added fee to protect habitat for the golden-cheeked warbler, in an area where 20,000 acres already are set aside for that purpose. 
There are many other examples like this that demonstrate how laws can be used to actually violate constitutional rights. For this reason, I support property rights protections. We tried in the 103d Congress and in the 104th Congress, to guarantee compensation to landowners whose private property was devalued due to government regulations. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in adopting these reforms. Today, we are trying a new approach. Senator Hatch has put forward a new approach that adjusts our legal process to assure that constitutional rights are secured for the private property owners of our country. 
Now, what Senator Hatch is doing is really mostly technical in nature. It is giving people the right to have their cases heard. I don't think Americans should have to spend all of their money just seeking to challenge the violation of rights that are guaranteed to them under the Constitution. I don't think that is due process. So I commend this bill because I do think it will take one step in the right direction toward protecting private property rights and helping private property owners at least have their cases adjudicated in court. 
The bill does not speak to the real issue which is how we can accommodate environmental laws in a way that also protects the rights of private property owners. I hope this Congress will address the basic issue soon. 
In the meantime, this bill at least will take us a step toward allowing people due process to protect their private property rights. I think it is time that the American people who own property have the ability to fully protect their rights guaranteed by the Constitution. I hope that we will all support this bill. 
I thank the Senator from Washington. I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to commend an extraordinarily successful collaboration between NASA and the JASON Project, a private foundation which is working to engage middle school students in grades 5-8 in science and technology. Each year, JASON electronically takes hundreds of thousands of our students on real scientific expeditions with world class scientists, researchers and explorers to work together with them on projects of discovery. NASA participates through three of its research centers and the expertise of many of its scientists. This collaboration is bringing real science to many students and teachers in the US and abroad, and I wanted to commend NASA's work with JASON as a model for public/private partnerships and educational leadership.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. I want to thank Senator Bond very much for allowing me to be in the summation. Because of a family emergency I just arrived. 
Mr. President, I do admire the tenacity of the Senator from Arkansas, for he has tried 15 straight times to submarine the space station, in a mixed metaphor. But I do think the Senator is wrong. 
I think the Senate will rise above his arguments, which would have the world's greatest superpower saying to all of the other nations that have put their money into this project, we are going to walk away from an experimental project, 90 percent complete. This project is succeeding. What we are going to be able to do has already begun to be tested in the early stages, and that is use microgravity conditions to grow tissue, which you can't do on Earth. You can't simulate this procedure on Earth. It means we will be able to take defective tissues, without harming the patient, and experimenting without harming the patient. It is biomedical research. We have partners--the United States, Canada, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Spain, France, Germany, the UK, Japan, and Russia--in this project. Yes, the Russians are having trouble. We know that. Does that mean we will walk away from all of our other international partners? The United States has been the leader in technical advances. It is why we have been able to get all of the benefits that we have seen from space research, because we have been willing to take the risk. Experiments are not precise. You make mistakes when you are the first one out there. 
You can't draw the budget for the first time and say you have to stay within this budget. Yes, it may take a couple more years. But if we can find a cure for ovarian cancer, for breast cancer, for osteoporosis, then I think a couple of years or 3 years working this out together, perhaps getting new partners, which is what we ought to be doing, instead of saying let's walk away, 90 percent into a project, with all of the other countries that have depended on us. 
We are the world's greatest superpower. We are not going to walk away from our partnership. We are not going to walk away from the leadership, at least that is not the country I represent. Most certainly, I don't think the Senate would do something so narrow.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, reading from the report that the distinguished Senator from West Virginia refers to, in the report the President says: 
The exit strategy for U.S. troops engaged in such deployment-- 
And then he notes: 
The goal of the military presence is to establish the conditions under which Dayton implementation can continue without the support of a major NATO-led military force. 
And begins to list the concrete benchmarks that the Senator from Michigan has just read. I don't exactly know how you can refer to them as concrete, because I think that they are not concrete. I think the police re-integration, the effective judicial reform, and media regulation is a giant leap, and I think the Senator from Michigan probably has already said that he also sees that these could be limitless. But, in fact, that is the exit strategy that has been put forward by the President, and that is exactly why I think the Senator from West Virginia is on point to question what is the exit strategy. 
If these are clear benchmarks--the State of Texas doesn't have effective judicial reform yet--there are countries in the European Union that can't meet the economic test that is set out in this exit strategy for Bosnia. 
I think the Senator from Indiana and the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Michigan are all beginning to agree that we are looking at an exit strategy from which there is not an exit in the foreseeable future, and I hope that we will be able to clarify this as we go down the road. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Well, I would like to ask the question, if the Senator will yield, and that is, I appreciate your interpretation of this because I certainly agree with you that these benchmarks are not achievable in a reasonable length of time. But I would just like to ask you the question, What is the next step? The President has said this is an exit strategy, that these 10 benchmarks could be--would be reached without the necessity of major support from the United States. That is what is on this page. 
The Senator from Michigan has asked General Clark, What would be the timetable to achieve these 10 benchmarks, which I think we all now have a consensus are going to be very difficult to quantify? What is the next step? If General Clark comes back and says, well, effective judicial reform would be maybe 50 years, or 30 years, the civil Dayton goals, the reestablishment of minority homeowners in each area of Bosnia, the media regulation, these will take 60 years or 40 years or 25 years, what then is the next step? 
If we have the benchmarks in a report from the President, which we are now asking, `OK, you, Mr. President, have said the exit strategy is that these will be achieved without the requirement of a major U.S. presence,' we get the timetable back, we think it is unrealistic to have a major U.S. presence for 50 years, and do all of the other responsibilities of the U.S. military, what is the next step?

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you. 
Mr. President, first, let me say I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, because he and I have worked together. We have introduced a bill--the Byrd-Hutchison bill--which would produce a downsizing of our commitment in Bosnia in, I think, a reasonable timeframe, taking into account the safety of our troops. I will talk about that in a few minutes. He has been a leader in this effort, and he is a member of the Armed Services Committee. He has provided a lot of input into this debate and certainly a background that none of us can match because of his years in the Senate and his scholarly pursuits in Senate history. 
I also want to thank Senator Thurmond, Senator Levin, and Senator Coats for putting forward this amendment. I think this sense of the Senate is a good start. It certainly sends the signal to the President and the administration from Congress that Congress is very concerned about the policy. I think it is very clear from the recent debate that many of us do not consider that the exit strategy put forward, in response to our question, from the President is a serious exit strategy. It cannot be considered a serious exit strategy, because I think when General Clark comes back with a timetable, it is going to be totally unacceptable, and I think everybody on this floor agrees that it is too nebulous to be in any way dubbed a concrete and clear benchmark. 
I want to respond because Senator Byrd and I have spoken on this subject and we feel, I think, very strongly about the role of Congress and the importance that Congress exercise its responsibility under the Constitution. That is why we have been active in this area and why I think it is important that we take this first step with the Thurmond-Levin-Coats amendment, and that we eventually go further in making sure that Congress is a part of any effort by the President to have a long-term commitment of our troops in a foreign land. 
In fact, that is what the Constitution envisioned. It is very clear if you read the Federalist Papers, if you study the Constitution, if you read the debate, that our founders had an example. The example was a king, a monarchy--a monarchy in which the king not only declared war for his country, Great Britain, but the king also paid for it, implemented it, did the strategy. It was all a power of the monarch. As the founders of our country were debating what they wanted, they said they wanted it to be hard to declare war. In fact, in the debate, I will quote from James Wilson, the delegate from Pennsylvania, who said: 
We must have a system of checks and balances in this area that will not hurry us into war. It is calculated to guard against it. It will not be in the power of a single man or a single body of men to involve us in such distress, for the important power of declaring war is vested in the legislature at large. 
Mr. President, we have a situation here in which there is no declaration of war. So we have a shift of power toward the President, putting our troops into combat positions, or into peacekeeping positions, certainly into harm's way--however you would like to describe it--unilaterally. 
Congress has since World War II, I think it can be fairly said, continued to allow the President to encroach more and more on the responsibility that was clearly given in the Constitution to Congress, because, in fact, it should be hard to declare war. It should be hard to put our troops into harm's way except in an emergency, which I think all of us would agree is within the power of the President to address. 
So now we have a situation where more and more the President is going forward on his own and Congress is stepping back and allowing the President to take the power without our input, and even when we disagree with the President, unfortunately, I think we have been timid about standing up. 
I believe it was this timidity that caused the extended Vietnam war. I think we extended it by not exercising the responsibility of Congress, which clearly knew that this was not a war in which we should be, and most certainly not one in which so much American blood should have been shed. 
Mr. President, here we are now with an exit strategy given to Congress by the President that is not realizable--an exit strategy that many States of the United States couldn't meet as benchmarks. 
On the effect of the judicial reform program, police in both entities are restructured, retrained, and equipped in accordance with democratic standards; media-regulated in accordance with democratic standards; independent alternative media available; free market reforms; functioning privatization; banking laws; an IMF program in place. 
Mr. President, these are worthy goals. They are worthy benchmarks, and I hope we work toward them. But this is not an exit strategy for U.S. forces. 
I am pleased that so many Members of Congress agree with that, and are beginning to take first steps that would say to the President you don't have carte blanche to watch our military move into a dangerously hollow force while you are spending $10 billion of taxpayer money on this kind of effort with no exit strategy. That is what is happening. 
I am pleased that we are going to begin to take the first steps to say to the President we want an exit strategy; we want an exit strategy that is reasonable, and we want an exit strategy that is responsible as an ally. 
Everything that Senator Byrd and I have done has been to try to work with our allies as a responsible ally, not to exit totally from Bosnia as a requirement, but to say we want to do our fair share, and we want our allies to work with us to allow us to continue to have a military that is capable of responding in the only way that America can respond, and that is with our unique capabilities, our unique technology, our unique modernized equipment, and our uniquely trained forces, which are the best in the world. We don't need our best fighting forces to do the police-keeping mission that we are doing in Bosnia, which can ably be done by many other of our allies. 
So my goal is going to be to support this very good beginning, but to say that we must be willing to stand up and force this issue because we are going in the wrong direction. We are allowing our military to become hollow because we are in unending missions. Our troop morale is suffering. We are losing experienced people, because they are gone from home so much on missions that they do not see as essential. If you talk to military people, as I have, that is what you will hear. They will be there when they see that it is a U.S. security interest. 
They have always been. But they do not understand continuous deployments when there is no emergency, as they see it, and when they see no exit strategy. 
I am very pleased that the Senator from West Virginia made the specific point of trying to determine what the mission is. Is it a clear mission? He asked what the benchmarks for the exit strategy were. I think it became very clear to anyone who listened that the benchmarks are no exit strategy at all. They are worthy goals. But they will not be met in our lifetime. And, indeed, many countries of Europe do not meet them today. 
I hope the Senate will take the first step. But I hope the Senate will not be timid about its responsibility under the Constitution, and take further steps along the way. 
We are going to continue to have other amendments to other bills that will provide the United States an opportunity to speak to our allies to determine how we can work together to downsize the U.S. commitment, to help our allies in every possible way within the bounds of reason, because we do have other commitments. We must respond, if there is a real security threat to our country, or to any of our forces in the field, and we are losing our edge. 
Mr. President, I hope that this is a first step, not a last step. I hope the President will hear what the Senate is saying with this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It is a good resolution. The President should work with NATO allies to withdraw U.S. ground combat forces from Bosnia within a reasonable period of time. 
That is the resolution. I agree with that--that a NATO-led force without the participation of the U.S. ground combat forces in Bosnia might be suitable for a follow-on; that we, the taxpayers of the United States, have spent $9.5 billion over the last 6 years at a time when our military is telling us that we are dropping in modernization; that we are dropping in our recruitment. We are losing experienced people. We must as responsible Members of the Senate question the priorities in spending for an operation that has no exit strategy. 
We want to take this first step. I certainly do. But I want the U.S. Senate to remember our part of the Constitution. If we fail to keep our part of the Constitution working, we are failing in our duty and our responsibility to the people of our country, and most certainly to those combat forces who are putting their lives on the line every day. 
We would never jeopardize troop safety in anything we do. 
I want to say that Senator Byrd's and my two bills that have been put forward both exempt totally the troops that are necessary for the safety of the troops that are on the ground. 
We want a responsible exit. We want to be responsible allies. We are not walking away from our responsibility to our allies. But we do not think it is fair for the United States to continue to bear the lion's share of the burden in Bosnia. We are now twice as many troops as our nearest ally, and I do not think that is a fair allocation. 
So, Mr. President, I think this is a good first step. I think the United States is taking a necessary first step. I hope the President will listen to the concerns that have been raised in this very good resolution, and I hope the Senate will be willing to continue to work on legitimate, responsible parameters around this Bosnia mission. 
And just one more response to the Senator from Virginia. I think that this must be separated from Kosovo for many reasons. One is Kosovo is an independent country and requires a different set of references. We have been in Bosnia for 6 years, really more. We have been working on the Bosnia issue. Kosovo, we have yet to take the definitive action, and I do support the President for getting his emissaries in and trying to bring these people to the peace table. I want to be shown to support that effort, and I hope that it works. 
I think the Bosnia issue is much different, and I think we have worked toward coming to some sort of clear mission and clear exit strategy in Bosnia for many years, since I have been in Congress, and I think now is the time for us to exercise our responsibility under the Constitution and become more firm in how long we will be in a mission in which our troops will be engaged, will be in harm's way, and for which there is no congressional approval as I think is required by the Constitution in spirit if not in actual terms. 
I thank the Chair.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator. 
I would just say to the distinguished Senator from Virginia that we have had benchmarks that are clearly not achievable in any lifetime that we are going to have. We have had deadlines that have failed to be met. I think it is time that Congress stand up and say we are looking at the facts. The facts are we are having a harder time recruiting for the military. We are having a harder time funding the modernization and the technology. We haven't even addressed missile defense systems. And yet we know now that two more countries have joined the nuclear club; that we are talking to troops--at least I am--who are very low in morale, and people who not only are not coming into the service, but our experienced people are leaving, and I think it is time that Congress take the responsibility to address these concerns. One of them is a mission with no exit strategy, which is, I think, an ill-defined mission, and no clear policy that shows our enemies or our allies where we would go in the future. 
Kosovo is another issue. There are problems erupting in India and Pakistan. Certainly, Iraq is still on the horizon, not to mention Korea. The United States has the unique responsibility in the world to provide a security umbrella in a lot of places, and I want to make sure that we are going to be strong enough to respond when there is a threat to U.S. security. And if we continue to sit back and let deadline after deadline and benchmarks that do not hold water go forward, I think we are abdicating our responsibility.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Virginia. I think when you look at these other potential necessary points of U.S. defense callings, we have to look at our budget, our defense dollars, our modernization, our technology and our will along with the morale of our troops, and we have got to say that there is a red flag out there, and if we do not do something about the priorities, we are going to have a hollow force at a time when we really need it. And I think that is the responsibility of this Senate to address and to make sure that it does not happen on our watch. I appreciate what the Senator from Virginia has said. I appreciate the leadership he has shown, along with Senator Thurmond and all of those. I think we all have the same goal. I just hope that we can all as a group of 100 independent operators come together and realize that because we are so diverse, we cannot allow ourselves to be inept in action, in doing the right thing that all of us, I think, are seeking to do. 
That is what happens in a legislative body. It is not an easy, clear direction that you can point a legislative body to. But nevertheless, I hope we can overcome the inherent problems in dealing in a legislative body and do something strong and courageous and decisive and fulfill our responsibility under the Constitution for our country, for those who are serving our country in the military, and for our future generations. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I thank Senator Coverdell for bringing some creativity into our public education system. 
If you talk to parents and teachers in America, it is clear that many of them are frustrated, because they are not satisfied with the education children are getting in our public schools. So we can take one of two approaches to address this problem. 
We can take the approach that we will continue to just go along as we have been year after year after year while the money spent on education goes up and up at the same time that test scores go down and our nation's children are increasingly unable to compete. We can do that. But we don't have to. 
We have today an opportunity to bring some innovation into our public school system. We can give parents and their children more options and more opportunity at success. That is what the Coverdell bill does, and I thank the senator for his leadership in shepherding this bill through Congress. 
This bill adds options--options for parents to give their kids a better chance at success. Under the Coverdell A+ bill, parents will be able to save after-tax dollars and use those funds on a tax-free basis for a whole variety of K-through-college education expenses. Even grandparents can contribute to these education savings accounts. As the cost of college in particular continues to climb, this added savings tool for parents will become essential for more and more American families. But in addition to enhancing the ability of families to save for college, the bill also addresses the need all parents have of supporting their children's elementary and high school education. 
I heard Senator Bingaman talk about the dropout rate among Hispanics. I am alarmed at that statistic. But I don't understand, knowing that we have this problem, why we can't go forward and say what will take innovative steps to help make our kids more motivated and more able to succeed in school. What can we do? 
The Coverdell bill gives families options they do not presently have. It allows parents to set aside an extra amount of money, up to $2,000 each year, to enhance their elementary and secondary education opportunities for their children. One option they will have is to then use that money, tax-free, for private or parochial school, if they feel that is the atmosphere that will be best for their children. 
Parents would also have the option of adding tools to enhance their child's education in public school, like buying the child a computer. That would be allowed in the Coverdell bill, and buying a child extra books so that the child can go beyond just what is in the classroom and enhance his or her knowledge; even buying band uniforms, because we know that children who participate in extracurricular activities are the ones most likely to stay in school, to be interested and to do better in school. In fact, we have seen that children who have arts classes do better in the other classes as well. So buying school-related art supplies would be another option that is conceivably allowed under the Coverdell bill. 
So as we witness the continued underperformance of our public school system, we are offering through this bill originality and creativity that will save children who might otherwise be lost in the present system. 
I am particularly pleased that the conference committee kept my amendment that passed on the Senate floor by a 69 to 29 vote to allow the option of public, single-sex schools and classrooms. 
This is not a mandate, of course. But many parents try to send their children to single-sex private schools because they think they will have a better chance in that environment. In fact, many studies show that for some children, single-sex education is their best chance at academic and life-long success. In a single-sex environment, hundreds of thousands of America's children have reported that they are allowed to excel, flourish, and grow, because they are not hampered by the distractions and disruptions that are found in many coed environments. 
I am pleased that we have in our education budget an innovative education reform program. It is called title VI. Title VI funds a wide variety of education reform projects, almost anything a school, community, or state feels will be in the best interests of their children and will help improve students' academic performance. And the Department of Education can give grants for these innovative programs. 
What my amendment and this bill will do is specifically include single-sex schools and classrooms as one of the innovative education approaches that can be funded under Title VI. 
We have an example that has gotten wide notoriety of late. It is the Young Women's Leadership School in East Harlem, in the New York City public schools. This is an elementary school. This school has a 90-percent attendance rate, one of the highest in the New York City public schools. They are well above the average in test scores in both math and English. When interviewed, the girls who go to this school say they love going to school; they feel safe there. And they are excelling. This is a success story. 
However, the bad news is the ACLU and the National Organization of Women are suing to close this school, and have filed a complaint with the U.S. Education Department to cut off all the school's federal funding. They say the school violates the constitutional equal protection clause and Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments Act. In addition to the obvious question of why in the world anyone would want to close this school down when it does so much good for the young girls who attend it, these groups' legal arguments are absolutely wrong. Title IX and the equal protection clause were intended to be protection against discrimination, not against educational enhancements for students who choose to learn in an environment where they can excel. In fact, in the amendment that is in the bill before us, it specifically states that one can offer options of single-sex classes or schools only if comparable opportunities are given for the other sex. That standard is fair, and that standard will protect against any possible discrimination against one sex or the other. In fact, that is why the state of Virginia lost in its defense of the previously all-male Virginia Military Institute, because the state did not offer a comparable educational opportunity for women. Time after time we have seen the courts uphold single-sex schools. 
What we want is for every parent in our country to have the same option that a parent who can afford a private school has. The parent who can afford a private school can choose among all the options--single-sex private schools, single-sex parochial schools, coeducation at parochial schools or private schools. They have these options. Parents of public school students do not. This bill and my amendment will allow every family to make these choices and do what is best for their children. 
Mr. President, I am very proud that I am a product of public education. I think free, public education is what makes this country different from every other country in the world, because we open our educational system to every child. Why not offer even more opportunity to every child and thereby improve every child's chance to achieve the American dream? 
That is what the bill before us does, and that is why I strongly support this bill. I hope it will pass by an overwhelming margin, and I hope the President will see that the bill's benefits to America's families are so great that he could not possibly veto this legislation and halt this historic opportunity to give parents and their children more and better education options. 
I thank the Chair. I thank Senator Coverdell.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I believe the Senate should act on legislation to address the problem of teen tobacco addiction, but am troubled by the tax and spend aspects of the legislation as it now stands. I support an approach that is closer to the agreement reached by the states attorneys-general a year ago this week. That agreement combined tough restrictions on advertising and a commitment by the states to address teen tobacco use. 
I have worked with Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah and other Senators to co-sponsor legislation codifying the attorneys-general agreement. Our legislation is a responsible and credible effort to achieve the goal we all share: ending smoking by underage youth. If we cut off debate on the McCain tobacco legislation, the rules of the Senate would prevent debate on the Hatch bill or any other responsible alternative. I cannot support that. Therefore, I will vote against cloture. 
We will have other opportunities during the 105th Congress to consider alternatives to the McCain bill. I intend to work hard to pass legislation that includes voluntary restrictions on industry advertising to young people and a substantial commitment to smoking cessation programs for minors.

 Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Surface Transportation Board Amendments of 1998. This legislation proposes to expand the Surface Transportation Board's existing authority to address circumstances affecting rail service transportation in today's environment. 
First, I think most colleagues would agree that the STB has performed well since its inception in 1996. The industries it regulates have experienced a number of significant changes in the past few years. The STB has acted consistently with the authority Congress gave it, and clearly within the deregulatory intent with which it was created. 
This year's reauthorization gives us the first chance since we created the Board to review its practices and performance. My bill is based upon the principle that Congress sets government policy and the Executive Branch, through regulators such as the STB, executes that policy. During hearings in my Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee, I have consistently sought to identify the limits of STB authority to act in certain circumstances, and to identify those areas beyond which STB action would require a policy decision by Congress. 
It is very important that we pass a re-authorization bill this year. Doing that will require that we establish the middle ground between those who want to roll back the clock and begin to re-regulate the industry and those who think the board needs no additional authority to adequately address the many issues before it. 
I believe my bill does just that. However, I stand ready to work with my colleagues to further refine my proposals to move this bill through the legislative process. I welcome input from any interested members. 
My own personal view is that re-regulation is not called for. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 has had very positive results for both industry and shippers. But we must ensure the board has sufficient tools to ensure that deregulation has its intended effect of greater competition and better value to the consumer. The experiences of the past few years, and this year in particular, give us much to consider. 
Mr. President, our country has endured a critical rail service crisis for many, many months. My home State of Texas has felt this crisis as much as any other State, and more than most. Texas has sustained billions of dollars of economic losses as the goods bound to and from the State's ports, factories and refineries sit gridlocked on the rails. These service problems primarily have occurred in the West, but there has been a ripple 
effect throughout the entire rail system. Service problems continue today, and I know the railroads have been working night and day to alleviate service troubles. 
Mr. President, I will explain my bill at greater length in a moment, but I want to stress that I have worked to craft a bill that maintains the basic de-regulatory rules that the rail industry and shippers have played by since the 1980s. However, it is the shippers today who face a most challenging rail shipping environment. 
Therefore, I am proposing we take action to ensure that the Board's procedures are more readily accessible to small shippers. I also am proposing to expand the Board's authority with regard to maintaining and promoting rail competition in appropriate circumstances. And, I believe strongly that we can do this without jeopardizing the integrity of deregulation. 
The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation has been working for many months on issues surrounding the rail service transportation. In that effort, the reauthorization of the Surface Transportation Board is a priority of our Committee. 
To date we have held four rail service hearings during this Congress--three field hearings along with a Subcommittee hearing on the Board's reauthorization. In addition, at Senator McCain's and my request, the STB held 2 days of hearings in April to address rail access and competition issues at which more than 60 witnesses testified. 
In response to the information gathered during these many hearings both by our Committee and the Board, today I am proposing legislation to address a number of areas which I believe warrant serious attention and in some cases, reform. I expect some will have a strong reaction to my proposals, as some in the rail industry have tended to tar any legislative proposals affecting their industry as `re-regulation.' At the same time, I suspect some shipper groups will report that these proposals do not go nearly as far as they believe we should go. If so, that sounds like we're at least within striking distance of the middle ground. 
I want to briefly explain the major provisions of this legislation: 
First, the bill establishes that promoting competition within the rail industry is one of the criteria the STB should use in performing its responsibilities. 
Second, the bill would extend the time period covering the Board's emergency service orders. The current 270-day emergency order authority would be extended to cover a total period of 18 months. In the event an emergency remains in effect beyond this time frame, the Board would be permitted to request and receive 
two 6-month extensions of an emergency service order. The Congress could disapprove the Board's requests and also take affirmative action to grant any further extensions as may be necessary. 
Third, the bill includes several features to simplify the regulatory process involving small rate cases. During every hearing before our Committee, shippers stressed their frustrations that for a small shipper, it is simply too time consuming and costly to ever bring a case to the Board. This bill seeks to acknowledge those concerns and proposes to foreclose discovery in small rate cases, absent a demonstration of compelling need. Further, it would direct the Board to establish an arbitration mechanism for small shipper cases. It would not require mandatory arbitration, but would allow for arbitration at one party's request. 
Fourth, my bill seeks to address concerns raised about the Board's market dominance standard. Some have advocated Congress statutorily eliminate product and geographic competition from the Board's market dominance analysis as it is a very time consuming process. Yet others contend these considerations remain necessary. My bill recognizes the Board's April 17th decision announcing it would initiate a proceeding to consider whether to maintain, change, or eliminate product and geographic competition from consideration in rate cases. I believe the Board's action is the proper route to follow. 
Fifth, my bill seeks to address another area of concern raised by shippers: revenue adequacy. At the Board's April hearings, rail and shipper representatives suggested referring this matter of considerable debate to one or more disinterested economists, which the Board initiated April 17th. My bill directs the Board to carry out its proposal in this area and direct rail and shipper representatives to select a panel of 3 disinterested economists to examine the Board's current standards for measuring revenue adequacy and to consider whether alternative measurements of a railroad's financial health are warranted. 
Sixth, my bill seeks to address the issue of bottleneck rates. There is considerable debate as to the correct approach in this area, with some strongly opposed to any change and others equally adamant about total reform. My proposal seeks to take a balanced approach, ensuring some needed boundaries remain. It would require a carrier to provide a shipper with a rate for a `bottleneck' line segment when requested to accommodate a transportation contract. The railroad would be required to provide the shipper with a rate over the `bottleneck' line segment as long as the interchange would be operationally feasible and the through route would not significantly impair the railroad's ability to serve its other shippers. 
Finally, my bill would remove the 3-year renewal requirement regarding antitrust immunity applicable to household goods carriers. While the continued propriety of collective actions by other types of motor carriers has been the subject of debate, no similar concerns have been voiced about the collective activities of household goods carriers. The repeal of the mandatory review requirement would relieve the carriers of an unnecessary regulatory burden, although it would have no effect on the STB's existing authority to modify or revoke collective actions when the STB determines such action is necessary to protect the public interest.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, thank you. I want to talk about the tobacco bill in the context of where we started and where we are now. 
I was on the Commerce Committee, and although I thought the bill had flaws in the Commerce Committee, nevertheless there was a balance to the bill. Our purpose in the tobacco bill is to try to keep teenagers from experimenting and getting hooked on cigarettes before they have the full judgment to understand that nicotine is addictive. 
That has been everyone's stated purpose. The President said that. Every Member who makes a speech on the floor says that. Everyone agrees. What we came out of the Commerce Committee with was a bill that I felt had a good chance of reaching the goal of severely limiting the amount of teen smoking in this country. 
Here is what the bill did, in a broad generalization. It had an agreement from the tobacco companies that they would not advertise. That is a key component to curbing youth smoking, not making it seem attractive to smoke. If you are not advertising with the Marlboro Man, it may not be nearly as appealing to smoke. So the tobacco companies voluntarily agree that they are not going to advertise provided a huge part of the balance of this bill. 
The second part, and what the tobacco companies needed, I suppose, or asked for in order to give up a major right that we could not take away from them--their constitutional right under the first amendment to advertise. Congress could not pass a law saying they could not advertise. We had to have something to which they would agree. What they wanted was some limitation on the liability in any 1 year. 
So in the bill that came out of committee, there was a limitation of about $8 billion. And if someone sued, and it was above that limit, their claim would not be thrown out but it would roll over until next year. I thought that was a fair balance because it would allow us to go for the target of stopping teenagers from starting to smoke because of advertising, which we now know has been targeted toward them, in return for having what I think is a huge liability limit. Nobody at this point has even come close in this country to $3 or $5 billion in any year from a lawsuit on liability. So I thought we had a balance. 
What has happened on the floor is, I think--a combination of people who had different purposes in addition to stopping teen smoking, removed all the liability limits, therefore, you lose the tobacco companies agreeing to give up their constitutional right to advertise. I think we lost track of the major target. 
In the meantime it was also decided that we would tax the people who legally smoke, at least $1.10 a pack, so that the price of a pack of cigarettes would go toward $5 a pack. So now you have what I think is a terrible principle; and that is, that you are taxing one sector of the population to have new programs that may or may not be effective in curbing teen smoking. 
So now we have an amendment that is going to be offered in the next hour that would say, `Well, we've got this huge tax increase and I don't like where the spending is going, so let us give it back in tax cuts to somebody else.' I do not like that principle. I do not want to tax a working person who is making $20,000 a year in order to give money back to a working family making under $50,000. I do want to give money back to the working family that is making under $50,000, but I want to do it in the context of our budget, like we do every other tax cut or every other tax increase, for that matter. 
This bill violates both principles that we would tax or give tax cuts within a budget and that we would tax one person to give it to someone else. 
I am the sponsor of the bill that would eliminate the marriage tax penalty. It is my bill. Senator Faircloth and I are cosponsoring this bill together because we believe the highest priority for tax cuts in this country should be eliminating the marriage tax penalty. 
So given the choice that I am going to have before me of not wanting to tax one person in order to give it to someone else, but my choice being we are going to have the tax increase, what do we do with it? Go spend money on new Government programs or give it back to people who make under $50,000, I am going to choose the latter. I am going to choose to try to start eliminating the marriage tax penalty by giving a higher level of exemption before you have to start paying taxes. 
So I am going to make the tough choice in favor of giving money back to the people who work for it. But I do not like this 
bill. And I hope and I urge my colleagues not to continue to try to put this bill in shape but instead to go back and start all over. I think we can pass a responsible bill in this Congress that would severely limit the number of teenagers who start smoking. That is a worthy goal. 
I also think in this Congress that we should pass the elimination of the marriage tax penalty because it hits people who make $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, couples who get married, who want to make that downpayment on their first home; and when they do, they are hit with a $1,000 or $2,000 tax increase just because they got married. 
So I want to do both of these things. I do not like the choices that we are looking at in the bill before us. And I do not like the choices being given to us by the amendment. But as the lesser of two evils, I am certainly going to support a tax cut when we already have a tax increase on the floor. But what I would suggest is that we scrap the whole thing and try to do this right. 
Doing it right means two things: It means, first of all, eliminating the marriage tax penalty in the budget; and, secondly, coming back with a balanced bill that will have the purpose of stopping or severely curtailing teen smoking, but not on the back of a person who is working for a living, not making much money, and is smoking, unfortunately, but nevertheless by his or her own choice. That is a choice that a person makes. I do not think that we should be taxing someone at this level--it is a regressive tax--when we are not sure that the purpose is going to be achieved. 
So I hope my colleagues will look at this issue, step back--first of all, pass Senator Gramm's amendment because at least we can take the first step towards eliminating the marriage tax penalty--then I hope we will bring this bill down and start from scratch and try to put forward a bill that will stop teen smoking or at least put a big dent in it. I think we can do that with the balance that we had in the original bill before it got worked over by the U.S. Senate. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, on May 29th, I will be in Port Arthur, Texas, helping to celebrate the City of Port Arthur's Centennial Day Celebration as well as the tenth anniversary of the Golden Triangle Veterans' Memorial Park. Port Arthur, a city born at the dawn of the 20th century, enters the 21st century confident in its stride as a growing and vibrant community on the Texas' Gulf Coast, not far from my home town of La Marque. Port Arthur, a corner of what some call Texas' Golden Triangle, plays a key role in our national security by contributing to our energy independence through its oil exploration and petroleum refining activities. Nearly every American has benefited from the products that enter the world market from Port Arthur--petrochemicals and oil in particular. 
The City of Port Arthur is named for Arthur E. Stillwell, originally of Rochester, New York. In 1895, Mr. Stillwell was searching for a site for the southern terminal of his proposed railroad from Kansas City to the Gulf of Mexico. He chose a site on the north shore of Lake Sabine, where Port Arthur stands today. The railroad to Port Arthur, which eventually became known as the Kansas City Southern Railroad, was completed in 1897. The city of Port Arthur was incorporated on May 30, 1898, one hundred years ago this month. 
The next year, the original ship canal to the Gulf was opened. Today, cargo tonnage out of the Port of Port Arthur averages about 23,000,000 tons per year. But it was on January 10, 1901, that the destiny of Port Arthur changed forever when a well dug by Anthony Lucas at Spindletop, only ten miles away from Port Arthur, struck black gold. Nearly a million barrels of crude oil are refined in the area daily, justifying Port Arthur's claim--`We Oil the World.' 
Today, Port Arthur is the home of three major refineries and the still important terminus of the Kansas City Southern railroad. The town of one thousand people a hundred years ago has grown to almost 60,000, and a diverse economy guarantees Port Arthur's growth into its second century. In addition to its energy industries, Port Arthur has become a year-round fisherman's paradise where thousands of anglers catch more than twenty-five varieties of freshwater and saltwater fish. Other popular local attractions include the Museum of the Gulf Coast, the McFaddin and Texas Point National Wildlife Refuges, the Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Park, and Sea Rim State Park. 
I'd like to talk for a moment about the tenth anniversary of the Golden Triangle Veterans' Memorial Park, which we will also be celebrating next week. This is the only park in the United States that recognizes all veterans, including those that served during times of peace. It was built by members of the community, financed and constructed through donations and over 55,000 volunteer man-hours. The park contains walls of honor for all our nation's past wars. The park's ten-year anniversary celebration is part of a week's worth of activities recognizing the Port Arthur Centennial. 
I want to congratulate Jefferson County Judge Carl Griffith, Port Arthur Mayor Robert Morgan, Jr., and the people of Port Arthur on this historic occasion. Together, we look forward to what their community will accomplish in the next 100 years.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. If the Senator will yield, the marriage bonus was put in place for single-income-earning families years ago. At that time, under 50 percent of the families in this country had two incomes. But today, 69 percent of the families in this country have two incomes. So the bonus became a penalty, because people were not able to get married remain in the same tax bracket as two singles earning the same combined amount. My colleague from Texas and the Senator from New Mexico are doing here what I have done in another bill, which I introduced with Senator Faircloth of North Carolina. Our bill allows married persons to choose to file as they do now or to file as single persons. That way, marriage versus single status will not have any tax consequences whatsoever. What we want in this country is fairness and equity in our Tax Code.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Where we differ is, how do we achieve this result? Forty States have now filed lawsuits to engage the tobacco industry in accepting the responsibility for its actions. Recent evidence demonstrates tobacco companies targeted children in their advertising, and the industry may have manipulated scientific research in its favor. This, obviously, is outrageous. 
We have a historic opportunity to limit youth smoking and to disclose all the information concerning the health risks of adult tobacco use. 
Four States have moved forward and reached settlements. My State is one of those. As a member of the Commerce Committee, which drafted the first version of the legislation before us, my principal concern was to ensure that nothing we did at the Federal level would undermine the agreements that have been reached by the individual States. 
I appreciate Senator McCain for his support of my amendments in the committee, most of which are in the bill before us, that would hold those States harmless. 
In my view, the most critical aspect of the Texas settlement and of the State attorneys general agreement that was reached with the industry was the restrictions on advertising and marketing that the industry accepted. These restrictions were tacit admission by the industry that its practice of marketing to teens was unacceptable. 
These restrictions are critical to our cause of reducing teen smoking. According to the Congressional Budget Office, if the tobacco industry did reduce its advertising, the greatest effect would probably be among teens. 
This report notes that studies show that teens are more sensitive than adults to brand-specific advertising. 
I voted for the original version of this bill in the Commerce Committee in large part because of the testimony of the attorneys general. They said the industry acquiescence in a ban on advertising, combined with a limit on industry liability, was the critical policy mix needed to attack the problem of teen smoking. That is why I voted against the Gregg amendment that was just before the Senate. That amendment will remove the liability limits. 
The reason a limit on liability was deemed important by the attorneys general was that the tobacco companies are the source of funds for the smoking cessation programs in this bill. If tobacco companies are sued out of business, new ones that aren t held to the standards of this bill will replace them and we will have the worst of all worlds. We will have new tobacco companies that do not have liabilities because they haven't advertised to teens and committed the other misdeeds of the present ones. They will not be bound by the restrictions on advertising. I am afraid we will do more damage if we pass a bill that has no limitations on liability and no restrictions on advertising. This balance between advertising restrictions and liability limitations is what the attorneys general put forward, and I think we must recapture it. 
In the Texas agreement and in the State attorneys general agreement, the tobacco companies are partners in the effort to stop teen smoking. Largely through the voluntary advertising and marketing restrictions in the legislation that was before the Commerce Committee, we would be able to achieve our result to stop teen smoking. The tobacco companies have now walked, and I am afraid this is not a good development. I hope we can restore the balance and, in our zeal to punish the tobacco companies, that we do not destroy the very companies we expect to pay for the programs in our bill that can end teen smoking. 
Without the advertising restrictions, I believe what we have before the Senate is a tax bill. We have to decide if raising the price of cigarettes would have the effect of stopping teens from buying them. 
Now, most parents would be experts in answering the question: Will the demand for cigarettes by teenagers go down if we raise the price? They know, for example, that a $200 pair of tennis shoes or a $75 pair of sunglasses sound perfectly reasonable to a teenager. To those teens, there probably isn't much difference between a pack of cigarettes that costs $2.25 or $3.75. Unfortunately, the Congressional Budget Office study tends to support this common sense observation. According to the CBO study that said teens are sensitive to advertising, teens are not very responsive to tobacco price changes. In fact, studies show that, under some circumstances, there is no impact on teen demand when cigarette prices rise. 
I have spoken to teens about this. I have asked them, Will raising the price from $2.25 to $3.75 make a difference? What I have found is that teens do think this is a pocketbook issue. But it is not the one you think. It is not the money in their pocketbooks that will make the difference to teens; it is their driver's license. Teens say that what will really deter them from smoking is the threat of losing their driving privileges. In fact, a study by the Texas Department of Health found that 64 percent of teenagers said they would not smoke if they thought they would lose their driver's licenses. This was compared to 48 percent who said a $250 fine would deter them. My State legislature passed legislation that imposed tough penalties on tobacco use for underage Texans, including suspension of their driver's licenses. 
I am very concerned about what I consider to be essentially a tax bill, because we have lost the balance that we had in the attorneys general agreement. If it is going to be a tax bill, let's be honest; it is a tax bill on lower- and middle-income people. It may also lead to a black market problem. 
Before I came to the U.S. Senate, I was the treasurer of the 
State of Texas. In Texas, the treasurer was the tobacco tax collector. I have dealt with the black market. I have seen how differences in tobacco taxes between states affect the black market. My agency did raids on flea markets and roadside sales of illegal cigarettes that didn't have stamps on them, and I can tell you something: We stopped truckloads coming from Louisiana into Texas and into the flea markets because there was a significant difference in taxes between Louisiana and Texas--it s a 21 cent a pack difference today. In fact, the estimates of the nonpartisan Tax Foundation show that my State of Texas loses $172 million in revenue annually due to the black market in tobacco. That is because we live next to a State that has a 21-cent lower tax and next to a country, Mexico, where cheaper cigarettes are available. 
In Canada, they had the exact same experience when they increased the cigarette tax in 1991. Smuggling became such a problem that many provinces cut their own taxes to make it less lucrative. What did that lead to? Instead of smuggling, there was a black market between the Provinces. The government of British Columbia estimates losses of as much as $100 million a year. 
This is the reason that the National Association of Police Organizations has asked us to be very cautious with the legislation before the Senate. According to the executive director, Mr. Robert Scully, this bill could lead to an increase in cigarette smuggling beyond the control of organized law enforcement. 
All of us are struggling to try to do the right thing. I believe that I can truthfully say every Member of the U.S. Senate has the same goal: To stop teen smoking. However, how we get there is the question, and I don't think we are close to agreement on what is the right path to that goal. 
I am not going to vote for taxes that will run out of business the tobacco companies that can pay for the health and smoking cessation programs. This would result in the emergence into the market of new companies not bound by our restrictions because they would have no history of wrong-doing. Then we would have no funding for the health programs, no voluntary restriction on the advertising, and we will never reach the goal of stopping teen smoking. 
I am not going to vote for a tax increase that is so high that it causes a black market in my State of Texas as well as Arizona, New Mexico, and California, that borders Mexico, or where the price of cigarettes is very cheap. I am not going to vote for a bill that does not have a reasonable chance of a balance that will achieve the goal of stopping teen smoking. 
We are going to have a lot of votes. I hope we can come up with a bill that I believe will reach that reasonable balance. I have not seen it yet. I hope that in the end we will not pass a bill that will create a black market, that will create more crime, that will take away the source of revenue that could help us pay for ads to stop teen smoking. And I hope we will not, in our zeal to punish the tobacco companies, have them walk away from the restrictions on advertising which they can only do voluntarily because it is their first amendment right to do so. 
I hope I can vote for a responsible bill, Mr. President. I hope everyone in the Senate will come together to try to achieve an agreement that will produce the result of stopping teen smoking.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Mississippi. He has shown such leadership in bringing to our attention the importance of a missile defense system for this country. We have all been shocked this week to hear what is happening across the globe with India actually testing a nuclear weapon and starting an arms race, tension that we haven't seen in a long time. 
I can't think of another country in the world that would be testing its own missile defense system out in the open as we are, the THAAD missile that my colleague just talked about, but we did. Yes, it didn't work. And, yes, we are all disappointed and we are hoping that we can learn from what didn't work on that test and perfect it. But that is why we have tests of defensive systems. 
But I think what Senator Cochran has done is, he is putting in context how important it is that we put our full force behind the priority of defending our shores and our troops, wherever they may be, anywhere in the world, against any incoming ballistic missile, a Scud missile or an intercontinental missile. Senator Cochran is right. The Senate had a very important vote yesterday, and by only one vote--by only one vote in the Senate, we were not able to move and clearly say that this country's first priority is going to be a defensive system for the ballistic missiles that we know 30 countries are now in the process of perfecting. 
So I commend him for the statement he just made, for the efforts he has been making over the last year, and for the future efforts that we are all going to make to continue to press this very important issue. As we are debating the defense authorization bill for our country, I can think of no higher priority than to make sure that the shores of our country are protected against an incoming ballistic missile, whether it be from a rogue nation or terrorist act. That our people would know that we would be protected is the very highest priority. We are debating right now how to fund and make sure that our troops have everything they need to do the job to protect us. They should have that same protection anywhere that they would be representing the United States of America. In any theater anywhere in the world, we should be able to have a defense against an incoming ballistic missile. 
So I commend the Senator from Mississippi, and I want to say we will not rest until we have won this issue, that we would be able to deploy right now our first priority, a defensive system for incoming ballistic missiles.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Mississippi, who has provided great leadership in this area. In fact, I said to the Senator from Mississippi yesterday, if I am ever going to need a consultant on the timing of introducing bills, I am going to call him immediately, because, of course, what has happened just in the last 5 days, proves how absolutely correct the Senator from Mississippi has been in pursuing this very important legislation. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his leadership. 
It is clear that the greatest security threat the United States faces today is that we do not have a defense for incoming ballistic missiles. In fact, if you look back at the latest war that we have had, the gulf war, the largest number of casualties in that war was from a single ballistic missile attack. 
We had the Patriot, and the Patriot was actually a missile that was supposed to hit airplanes. We quickly tried to make the Patriot into something that would hit missiles, and, phenomenally, it actually had a 30-percent success rate. But when we have our troops in the field and we have the capability to do better than 30 percent, how could we even think of not going full force to protect our troops in any theater where they might be, anywhere in the world, and to protect the citizens of the United States within the sovereign territory of our country? How could we be sitting on technology without saying this is our highest defense priority? 
Today, we have a chance to say this is our highest defense priority. Because if we cannot protect our citizens in our country and our troops in the field, we are leaving ourselves open. And we don't have to do that. Today, we know that over 30 countries in the world have ballistic missile technology. The Senator from Mississippi has gone through what some of these countries now have. Just in the last 5 days, we have seen North Korea threaten to go back on the agreement they made and refuel their nuclear reactors. We have seen, in the last few weeks, that China has been buying our technology without our permission--except for the President letting people do it, presumably because they contributed to his campaign. Pakistan is now deploying a missile with a 1,500 kilometer range. India, as we know, in the last 2 days has actually--has actually--tested nuclear weapons. So, of course, the arms race between Pakistan and India has been rekindled. 
Iraq--we fought the Desert Storm war because Iraq was getting ballistic missile technology, and we know they have chemical and biological weapons. Iran--they are receiving assistance from the Russians to develop missile systems. Russia is willing to export a good part of their scientific basis for nuclear weapons, and we don't know how secure is what is left in Russia. 
So, how can we look at the facts and not address them vigorously, if we are doing what is right for the American people? We have the capability to do this if we make it a priority. The Senator from Mississippi is introducing a bill that basically says this is a priority, that we will go forward full bore with the capabilities that we have, doing the technological research, doing the testing. All of us are very disappointed that the recent THAAD test was not successful. But we should not back away from it. We should be going forward full bore to try to make sure that we have a national missile defense system, an intercontinental missile system, and a theater missile ballistic system that would defend against any incoming missiles. 
Let me make another argument, and that is, as we are going through all of the countries that we know are now building ballistic missile capability with chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, what would be the very best deterrence from them making that investment? What would be the best deterrence, so India would not feel that it is necessary for their security to test ballistic missiles? The best deterrence would be the capability to deter a launched missile in its boost phase. Simply put, if we can take a missile as it is just being launched and turn it back on the country that is trying to send that missile, isn't that the best deterrence for that country not to send the missile in the first place? Because, obviously, no country is going to launch a ballistic missile if it is going to come back on its own people. 
So, if we can get that defense technology, perhaps that is the best way to stop this arms race. Most certainly, the joint threat to us, and to our allies, should be our highest priority. This bill establishes missile defense as a top priority because it says we are going to fund ballistic missile defenses and we are going to deploy them as soon as the technology is there. 
The argument against it is incomprehensible to me, although I do not in any way suggest that those making the argument aren't doing it with good faith. I am positive that they believe they are doing the right thing. But to say that the world's greatest superpower is going to wait and see what other countries might get, what ballistic missile technology, and then set on a program full bore that would defend against that--they could not be talking as representatives of the only superpower left in the world. They cannot be thinking what a superpower must do, which is to do what no one else in this world has the capability to do. We are the only country that has the capability to put the resources behind a ballistic missile defense capability. We are the only country that can do that. Why would we hesitate for one moment? Why would we leave one of our troops in the field unprotected for one more moment than is absolutely necessary? There is no excuse. Why would we leave the people of our country unprotected for one more moment than is necessary, when we have the resources to go full force? 
It is not an argument from the superpower to say when we know that someone has perfected a technology that could reach the United States then we will deploy our full forces. How many people will die or be maimed because we are not going full force right now? What better quality-of-life issue is there for our military than to give them every safety precaution, protecting them in the field that we have the capability to do? 
We are the leadership of the greatest superpower in the world. We must say we cannot wait for one more moment for the full priority to be given to missile defense technology and capability for our country, for the people who live here, from potential terrorist attacks, and for anyone representing the United States of America in the field. 
When our young men and women pledge their lives for our freedom, how can we not give them every protection they deserve to have when they are, in fact, defending our ability to speak on this floor today? 
Mr. President, I hope our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will in a very bipartisan vote say, `We will not walk away from our responsibility to provide the protection to our people that they expect and the protection of our troops in the field, wherever they might be, fighting for our freedom or for the freedom of oppressed people in other places.' We must give them the protection that we have the capability to do. It is a very clear-cut issue. Thank you, Mr. President.

 Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to my colleagues' attention the dedication of the Gilbert M. Grosvenor Center of Geographic Education at Southwest Texas State University. 
Located near the Texas Hill Country in San Marcos, Texas, Southwest Texas opened its doors 95 years ago to 330 students. Today, Southwest Texas is a major, innovative university with a growing student population of over 21,000. During its history, Southwest Texas graduates have distinguished themselves in numerous career fields, including research and teaching. Today, Southwest Texas builds upon this legacy of success and commitment to higher education by dedicating the new Grosvenor Center. 
The university has distinguished itself nationally in the area of geographic research and education. In fact, Southwest Texas's Department of Geography and Planning has been recognized as the best undergraduate geography program in the nation by the Journal of Geography, the Association of American Geographers, and a national Program Effectiveness survey. Southwest Texas has the largest geography department in the country with 590 undergraduate and 165 graduate students. 
Southwest Texas is the home of the Texas Alliance for Geographic Education, which is one of the premier geography alliances in the nation, according to the National Geographic Society. The Alliance has more than 5,000 teachers as members. It has sponsored numerous geography institutes and workshops for educators and has led efforts to generate participation in Geography Awareness Week. The Alliance is a strong supporter of the Texas Geography Bee, which is a statewide competition for young people to test their geographic knowledge before advancing on to the national contest. 
Not surprisingly, Southwest Texas has chosen to name its new Center for Geographic Education after Gil Grosvenor, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the National Geographic Society. With this decision, Southwest Texas salutes Mr. Grosvenor's outstanding leadership in the drive to improve education in the field of geography. His pioneering work to advance Geography Awareness Week, the Geography Bee, and state geography alliances, has dramatized the need for quality geography education in America's classrooms. 
I want to commend Mr. Grosvenor for his lifetime commitment to the advancement and dissemination of geographic knowledge and understanding. Under the leadership of Gil Grosvenor, National Geographic has done more to make geography alive and interesting than any other organization. We all owe Mr. Grosvenor and the National Geographic Society a huge debt of gratitude for their tremendous contributions over the years. 
Mr. President, hundreds of geographers from across the country will converge on the Southwest Texas campus today to inaugurate the new Center. Lady Bird Johnson is also an expected guest, along with elected officials and many alumni from the Department of Geography and Planning. In the evening, Mr. Grosvenor will serve as a special guest at a dinner in the ballroom of the LBJ Student Center. On Friday, Mr. Grosvenor will have the honor and distinction of delivering the 1st Annual Grosvenor Lecture at the Alkek Library Teaching Theater on campus. Mr. Grosvenor is expected to focus his address on the critical importance of providing quality geography education in America's schools. 
It is with great pleasure that I join in the celebration of the dedication of Southwest Texas's new Grosvenor Center. I congratulate all those involved in making this effort a reality and ensuring that geography education plays an important and integral role in the classrooms of today, as well as tomorrow.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I want to say how pleased I am to be working with my colleague, the senior Senator from West Virginia, who was honored last night on the Senate floor for having cast the most number of votes of any Senator in the history of our country--15,000. It was quite awesome. I am pleased to have someone of his stature and experience to take the lead on this very important act that we hope the Senate will pass in the form of an amendment to the defense authorization bill, or failing that, the appropriations bill, because it is time that Congress step up to the line and fulfill its constitutional responsibility for allocating the military dollars. 
Mr. President, as the senior Senator from West Virginia has stated, our bill will begin the orderly and honorable withdrawal of U.S. ground forces from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
U.S. forces in Bosnia have accomplished the military mission assigned to them. They were sent to enforce the Dayton peace accords by keeping the warring factions separated. We all owe our troops a debt of gratitude for having done this with no combat loss of life to any American. 
I have just returned this weekend from my seventh trip to the Balkans. I saw a well-trained professional force capable of performing any mission that we would give them as long as we give them the support they need. But I also saw a force on a mission with no clear direction and certainly no exit strategy. It has no end date. These troops have been spending more and more time away from home than at any other point in their careers. 
The continuing and open-ended commitment of U.S. ground forces in Bosnia is subject to the oversight authority of Congress. When we narrowly voted to support this mission in 1995, I voted against it because I was afraid what would happen is exactly what is happening. We are now in an open-ended mission. This was not supposed to be an open-ended mission. It was supposed to be a 1-year commitment. That deadline was missed and the next deadline was missed. 
It is very important that we have an exit strategy. The Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, have said an exit strategy and an exit date is most important if we are not going to have mission creep. But, in fact, what I fear is that we do have mission creep in Bosnia, and as a matter of fact, we also have deadline creep. 
NATO forces have increased their participation in police activities, something for which they are not trained. General Joulwan has said our military forces are not trained for police missions, and yet that is what they are doing more and more. 
U.S. commanders in NATO have stated on several occasions that, in accordance with the Dayton peace accords, the principal responsibility for law enforcement rests with the parties to the Dayton agreement--the Serbs, the Croats, and the Muslims. 
In a recent letter to Congress, President Clinton identified a host of additional missions that seem to go well beyond the peacekeeping scope of the U.S. forces in Bosnia and are aimed really at nation-building. These include--and I quote from his letter-- `supporting * * * the conduct of elections and the installation of elected officials,' and `supporting * * * media reform efforts.' 
During our recent trip we were briefed that establishing a rule of law and a judiciary were also among the criteria that must be established prior to our troops' withdrawal. 
Mr. President, these are goals that could take 50 years to achieve, and they define a mission without an exit strategy. I would just say that the distinguished Senator who is presiding at this moment was also in the meetings we had in Bosnia this weekend. I think I speak for all of us who were there in saying that what we 
were told about an end date is a recipe for a mission with no exit strategy. Congress has had little to say, as the President has authorized an ever-longer commitment of troops for an ever-growing number of missions. 
I believe that exceeds the war power authority of the President, although this is debatable and I cannot say that it is totally clear. But while the Constitution leaves some issues unsettled regarding war powers, there is no such conflict over the power of the purse. The Congress alone has the power. We have the responsibility to provide the money for our military and to look at the big picture. 
The big picture, Mr. President, is that our troops are being flung around the world in police missions and peacekeeping missions, and we are losing the edge that a superpower must have to be able to act when no one else can or no one else will. 
Senator Byrd and I do not want Congress to ever shrink from its constitutional responsibility. And it is Senator Byrd who understands the Constitution better than anyone on this floor. But I, as a new Member, am trying to see things in a way that our Founding Fathers intended and to remain true to the balance of power that they attempted to create. 
Our bill is aimed at getting our European allies to start taking a greater share of the responsibility for their own regional security matters. This will free the United States to respond where our allies cannot or will not and where the United States is the only power that is capable of doing so. 
It is in the interest of our allies that we maintain the capability to keep the world safe from threats that would endanger our mutual security. The United States has nearly twice the number of troops on the ground as our next closest ally, Great Britain. We have three times more than the French and German allies. 
Our bill provides for a gradual-phased timetable of reduction of the level of U.S. troops so that by February in the year 2000 the American ground combat level would not exceed 2,500. This timetable is consistent with the stated objectives of the Clinton administration. 
In a recent letter to several Senators, President Clinton said, `The deployment will not be open-ended. . .SFOR will be progressively reduced. 
Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia and I hope to aid the administration by offering a credible and orderly timetable for such reductions so that we can provide the ability to finance the mission with some sense that we will know what to expect. 
Our bill provides 6,900 troops by June 30, 1998; 5,000 by February 2, 1999; 3,500 by June 30, 1999; and 2,500 by February 2, 2000. 
Our bill exempts from these totals those forces that are needed to protect the U.S. troops as the drawdowns proceed. We also exempt those forces necessary to protect U.S. diplomatic facilities. Most important, we exempt any U.S. ground forces which may be deployed as part of NATO containment operations in regions surrounding the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
It is my belief that one of our principal objectives in the Balkans should be to prevent the conflict in Bosnia from spilling over into neighboring European countries. Should the President propose to establish a NATO containment perimeter around Bosnia, our bill would permit that. 
Why is our legislation needed? What does it have to do with military readiness? Just last week this Congress approved adding a half a billion dollars to the Bosnia operation. This brings our total to $8 billion. The President has asked for another $2 billion for the next year. That makes a $10 billion operation, five times the original estimate this administration gave Congress. 
Where is this money coming from? It is coming from future readiness. We are borrowing from the future to pay for a mission that is clearly capable of being performed by countries other than the world's only superpower. If they can do this, the United States can be ready to respond in other areas where we have mutual security threats with our allies, such as the Middle East and Asia. 
There are ample indications that our readiness has begun to suffer as we have drawn forces and resources off to support regional conflicts. In the U.S. Pacific Command, the commander in chief testified before Congress that some forces required for long-term commitments in the Asia-Pacific area of responsibility are now positioned in the Persian Gulf. He further reports that the Pacific fleet is short over 1,900 sailors in key technical ratings. 
In the Pacific Air Forces, the F-16 cannibalization rate is 12.8 percent--a more than 100 percent increase since 1995 due to lack of spare parts. 
The Army faces similar shortfalls. A recent Army Times report revealed that while the 1st Armored Division was staffed at 94 percent, its combat support and service support specialties were filled at below 85 percent, and captains and majors were filled at 73 percent. Noncommissioned officers are also in short supply in the divisions, particularly sergeants. In the 10th Division, 24 of 162 infantry squads were not fully or only minimally filled. 
According to Major General Carl Ernst, commanding general of the Army's premier infantry training post at Fort Monroe, VA, this is having a serious negative impact on the Army. General Ernst recently told a congressional panel at Fort Monroe, `We are now dangerously close to the breaking point.' 
What about the Air Force? In the Air Force, only 29 percent of the pilots eligible for a $60,000 bonus to sign up for 5 more years signed up. That is half the number that took that bonus last year. 
Our military is stretched to the breaking point. Our military cannot continue to provide peacekeeping operations all over the world. This causes them to lose the skills for which they have been trained and dulls their fighting edge. We are letting it happen because the operations tempo is too high and the amount of money we have is finite. 
What is suffering is the quality of life of our military. We are losing our most experienced people. Also our modernization suffers as we try to keep our best planes in the air, with the parts that they need to function, and, perhaps most important, the systems that we will need to meet the future security risks of our country and those of all of our allies. This includes the threat of an incoming ballistic missile with a nuclear, chemical, or biological weapon. We know that 30 countries in the world have ballistic missile capabilities, yet we are not deploying as quickly as possible any defenses. 
What the Senator from West Virginia and I are asking is that our allies, who are perfectly capable of performing these peacekeeping missions as well as anyone can, take that responsibility. Let the United States build our forces through modernization and technology and develop missile defense systems so that we can be there if there is a real threat to our mutual security. We cannot have a military that is unable to respond. We must not have a military that is not respected by our allies, nor our adversaries. 
The Senator from West Virginia has stood for the constitutional responsibility of Congress. I hope to follow in his footsteps in always reminding our Senate of the importance that we uphold our one-third of the balance of power in our Government. Our one-third is that we must be the stewards of the funds. Only Congress was empowered to declare war. I do not believe that our Founding Fathers intended for us to be sending troops abroad in operations other than war. They intended it to be a tough decision, to put our troops in harm's way. 
Mr. President, I am going to stand for the U.S. Senate's 
responsibility to assure that we do not fling our troops around the world in operations other than war and dissipate our resources and our readiness. I am proud to cosponsor with the Senator from West Virginia the bill that will begin the orderly and responsible exit from Bosnia, with our allies, as a team, coming together and sharing this burden in a way that meets the regional test and meets our responsibility in the world to do that which no one else can. 
I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his leadership in this area. I hope we will have the strongest bipartisan support for our bill so that we can make this law, so that our allies will know that when we say we are going to do something--whether it is something they like or don't like--that we will keep our word. That is in their best interests as well as ours. 
I yield the floor.

 Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to recognize and remember the importance of this day, known as `Cinco de Mayo' to the Republic of Mexico and to millions of Mexican-Americans. Many in this country may not realize it, but after 40 years after achieving independence from Spain, in 1862 Mexico was again subjugated to European colonial domination, this time by the French. In that year, Napoleon sent a massive military force to Mexico to unseat President Benito Juarez to install a Hapsburg, Maximilian, as monarch of Mexico. 
After capturing the port city of Veracruz, the French continued their march toward Mexico City. But the proud Mexicans did not give in without a fight. On this day in 1862, on a small battlefield near Puebla, a hastily assembled, ill-equipped Mexican force of predominantly Mestizo and Zapotec Indians bravely battled against a force of Napoleon's renowned professional French Army. Against all odds, the Mexicans actually routed the French, and the `Batalla de Puebla' became a rallying cry and watershed event for eventual Mexican independence. 
The Mexicans who fought on that fateful day embodied the spirit of freedom and patriotism that eventually drove Mexico to victory and paved the way for the economic and political advances that continue in that nation to this day. It is in that same spirit that we in the United States, who have our own proud history of achieving independence, celebrate and recognize the Batalla de Puebla and the significance of this day. 
In addition to signifying a military victory, the Cinco de Mayo holiday, particularly as recognized in the United States, is also a celebration of Mexican and Mexican-American culture and history. In many cities throughout the U.S., this celebration centers around grand cultural fiestas that include traditional Mexican song, dance, and cuisine. Much as we recognize the Fourth of July not only as an act of independence from Britain, but also as a cornerstone of our cultural identity as Americans, many Mexican-Americans view Cinco de Mayo as a common cultural thread and history that they share. 
Mr. President, I would like to join all Americans and all Mexicans in this recognition of a very proud and colorful Mexican history. The Mexicans who fought and died on that battlefield near Puebla in 1862 embodied the ideal to which all human beings, regardless background or status, aspire--the inalienable right of self-determination. Cinco de Mayo is therefore a chance for communities on both sides of the border to remember how important a gift freedom is, how difficult it is to achieve, and how vigilant we must all be to preserve it.

 Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the amendment I added to the conference version of the 1998 Supplemental Spending Bill deals with how oil is valued for the purpose of collecting royalties. This is not about royalty rates, but rather how that value is established. 
Under the Outer Continental Shelf Leasing Act and the Minerals Leasing Act, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) is required to value the oil where it is removed from the ground. The MMS wants, instead, to value the oil after the industry has added significantly to its value (through marketing and transportation costs). Such a change would have the effect of increasing the tax collected on any set amount of oil at a time when the oil prices are at an all time low. The economy and jobs will be affected by such an arbitrary increase in costs. And finally, the MMS wants to make this change in the law through regulation. Mr. President, changing the law is the job of Congress, not the MMS. 
My amendment prohibits the MMS from implementing this proposed change next month and prohibits the agency from acting before the end of the current fiscal year. This will give Congress time to weigh in on this matter, instead of letting the MMS arbitrarily change the law through the exercise of its rule-making authority. 
Last year, this Congress, in the FY 1998 Interior Appropriations Bill specifically directed MMS to report back to the committees prior to finalizing the new regulations after numerous members expressed concern. MMS has ignored this direction, and neither the Energy and Natural Resources Committee nor the Appropriations Committee was notified that MMS proposed to finalize the new rule this June. 
I support a valuation program that ensures the state and national governments receive all royalties due to them while maintaining fundamental principles of equity. I support the MMS in its efforts to simplify the valuation system and collect the government's fair share. However, it cannot be done at in a manner that changes federal law.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I believe I share with a substantial number of my colleagues a real sense of unease about the process that we are about to finish. When I made my opening comments about the resolution before us, I noticed that a legislative body is ill-suited to the task of establishing order, coherence, and discipline to a foreign policy initiative. The last few days have proven me right, as we have missed the opportunity to greatly improve the resolution before us. 
The decision to expand NATO and extend invitations was made in the heat of a political campaign, with little attention given to the truly important questions that should have been addressed. 
There has been no assessment of the threat against which the military alliance was supposed to defend. There were no clear criteria established for membership in NATO. We did not use this opportunity to debate what the mission of NATO should be in the post-cold-war era. We have not used this opportunity to lay out clear expectations for the next group of would-be members of NATO. We have left no roadmap for the future. 
Unfortunately, the administration did little to address these issues when it proposed to expand the alliance in the first place. The Senate was placed in the position of having to do so because of a failure of executive leadership. And I do not think the Senate has done very well, either. 
Why was it left to us to wonder about the possibility for border and ethnic disputes to impact the expanded alliance in a way that might hurt U.S. interests? 
While my amendment on that matter was defeated, 37 Members, more than one-third needed to stop future expansions, believe that a process to address such disputes is important and should be discussed. Other Members raised equally valid concerns, and they were nearly all defeated. 
The Senator from Virginia had a prudent proposal to step back after the first round of expansion to let the experience be fully absorbed by the United States and her allies. Defeated. 
Our colleague from Idaho wondered if we should not at least vote to authorize the ongoing and possibly open-ended NATO mission in Bosnia before we think about expanding the alliance to new members. Defeated. 
The Senator from New Mexico said strategy should be adopted before we take in new members. Defeated. 
Because the concerns of so many Members were so summarily dispensed with, many will find it difficult to support this resolution. How much stronger a signal might this body have sent on this important matter if there had been more willingness to find an acceptable compromise with concerned Members, many of whom are not on the relevant committees and had no opportunity to really fashion the underlying resolution. 
Instead, we have a resolution that has very little to say about the future beyond the fact that we will likely add three new members to the alliance. But that has never really been the debate here as far as I am concerned. 
Most of us have not opposed the three countries being considered for immediate membership. We were concerned about the process by which we got to this point. In many ways, after more than a week of debate, we are still not much further than when we started. 
For example, there is no strategic rationale for the new NATO alliance. It is not due from the President until 180 days after this resolution is passed. There is still no credible estimate about the cost. We have seen estimates miraculously shrink from $125 billion to a couple of million as we have gotten closer to this vote. Obviously, no one knows what the real cost will be. At least we have the protections available because of the cost caps imposed by the amendment of the Senator from Alaska. 
In the meantime, this body over the last couple of days has voted for a provision that allows NATO possibly to engage in military efforts on border and ethnic disputes but, rather strangely, voted against letting NATO attempt to resolve such disputes peaceably at the lower levels through dispute resolution. 
In short, I think, Mr. President, that both the administration and the Senate have approached the issue of NATO enlargement in a rather haphazard and disjointed manner. Because this Senate defeated the pause proposed by the Senator from Virginia, we will probably be debating the admission of yet another tranche of countries before we have any idea about cost, border disputes, or strategic rationale. 
So where are we now? Instead of debating the more challenging issues involving the future of the alliance, we are left with a narrow question: Should Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary be admitted to NATO? 
These countries have made a sustained commitment to democratic capitalism since the end of the cold war. In numerous discussions with the Ambassadors and Foreign Ministers from each of these three countries as a member of the U.S. Senate's NATO Observer Group, I am convinced that they intend to aggressively shoulder the burdens of membership in NATO. They seek no special treatment, and they wish only to be treated as full members of the alliance with the rights and the responsibilities entailed. 
Further, these countries have demonstrated a commitment to the goals of the alliance. They have contributed, in some cases heavily, to the ongoing NATO mission in Bosnia. In the case of Hungary, the United States has staged its Bosnia operations there for some years. The U.S. presence there has approached that of our closest NATO allies and our non-NATO allies. And the Hungarians have been excellent hosts to U.S. forces. 
While I remain steadfast in my belief that NATO needs and should at least discuss the adoption of a formal dispute resolution process, the fact is that these countries have worked hard to resolve disputes with neighbors. The Czech Republic peaceably separated itself from Slovakia. Hungary and Romania have signed a treaty to resolve issues surrounding the treatment of ethnic Hungarians in Romania. 
Despite these strong indications that these countries are ready for the burdens and benefits of alliance membership, I would nevertheless have retained additional reservations had the managers not accepted the U.S. cost limitations proposed by the Senator from Alaska. 
A major issue that must be addressed is how much should the United States continue to shoulder for peace in Europe? We pay 25 percent of the cost of NATO. The Stevens amendment will keep U.S. costs at no greater than what we now spend for NATO. Additional costs incidental to the adoption of three new members will have to be specifically authorized by Congress. 
With great reservations about this process, I will not vote against three countries that I believe will strengthen the alliance. I do hope this administration will not come to us again with new countries invited before the strategic rationale, cost limitations, border dispute processes and other conditions many of us tried and failed to impose. I hope we will not put the cart before the horse. 
To that end, I take some comfort in the vote totals for at least two of the amendments that failed. My amendment on conflict resolution received 37 votes. Senator Warner's amendment, requiring a pause of 3 years, received 41 votes. It takes 34 votes to stop a future treaty. 
I hope the administration and its successors would see these votes as cautionary should they consider going forward and raising expectations of good people in other countries before looking at the long-term security interests of America and considering what our responsibility is throughout the world. America has never walked away from its responsibilities. We want to pay our fair share. But we would not represent the taxpayers of this country if we allowed our country to take more than its fair share and thereby debilitate the strength of our own security. 
I hope that we can move forward now and continue to have the Senate maintain its constitutional responsibility in treaties of advise and consent, not just consent. What we have done instead of truly rewriting the course of our future and creating an alliance for the next century is to add three new members to an alliance whose purpose and therefore whose future is no more certain than when we began this process. 
While I cast a vote in favor, I take no great comfort in doing so and I hope the next debate is on the role of NATO in the post-cold-war era. Only then will we assure that the greatest defense alliance in the history of the world will remain exactly that. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I share the Majority Leader's concerns about Amtrak. As the primary author of the Amtrak reform law, I am very concerned that Amtrak has yet to have the opportunity to avail itself of the statutory reforms we all worked so hard to provide. The Amtrak Reform Council positions are an essential element in the overall reform scheme. 
Amtrak needs to make long-term plans and commitments. That action has not yet begun. I hope the Administration will take prompt action to fulfill its responsibilities and give Amtrak the opportunity to achieve what we all hope is possible--a fiscally sound and efficient national rail passenger system.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I know we have a pending amendment. I would like to speak on the whole issue of NATO enlargement at this time because I was not able to make my opening statement yesterday at the appointed time because we had the other amendment of which I was cosponsor with Senator Smith. 
I believe this Senate will not vote on a more important matter than the one before the Senate this week. The advocates of unfettered enlargement of NATO argue that we are expanding the frontiers of freedom in Europe. It is true that freedom won the cold war. But the spirit of that freedom was the American commitment to defend Europe against the Soviet Union. 
Therefore, at the heart of this debate is a simple question: Is the United States prepared to add countries to the list of those that we pledge to defend as we would our own shores? In answering that question, the Senate should look to the future. Instead, many supporters of the resolution have been talking about the past. 
They have argued, not without merit, that expanding NATO is necessary to correct the map of Europe that was drawn incorrectly at the end of World War II. And many argue that it is right and just that these three countries before us today become part of the West, since the West turned its back on them at Yalta more than half a century ago. 
I think the Senate should be looking to the future to decide if this idea is the right one at this time. What are the future threats to Transatlantic security? Is expanding the alliance the best means of addressing those threats? Must the United States continue to be the glue that holds Europe together, as was necessary during the cold war? 
This is an interesting time to consider expanding our military obligations. Today, the President has said the United States will have an open-ended commitment of thousands of U.S. troops in Bosnia. This mission has already cost the United States $8 billion. That is in addition to our NATO requirement, our commitment, our allotment. It appears likely that a major conflict will break out in the Serb province of Kosovo, raising the question whether U.S. troops will be drawn deeper into the morass. 
We have also learned just this week that the chief U.N. weapons inspector has declared that Iraq's Saddam Hussein has not complied with U.N. resolutions to destroy his biological and chemical weapons, so the allies may have to take military action to force him to comply. Again, that will mean a disproportionate burden for the United States. 
While we are adding new commitments, our military readiness is in decline. Last year, the military had its worst recruiting year since 1979. The Army failed to meet its objective to recruit infantry soldiers, the single most important specialty of the Army. At the National Training Center, where our troops go for advanced training, units rotating in typically come with a 60-percent shortage in mechanics and a 50-percent shortage in infantry. These are often due to the fact that these personnel are deployed abroad for missions such as Bosnia, so advance training is suffering. 
This year, more than 350 Air Force pilots have turned down the $60,000 bonuses they would have received to remain in the cockpit another 5 years. A 29-percent acceptance rate for the bonus compares with 59 percent last year and 81 percent in 1995. 
Recently, a lack of critical parts for F-16 aircraft forced two fighter squadrons in Italy to cannibalize grounded aircraft to ensure they can continue to conduct the NATO peace enforcement mission over Bosnia. 
Mr. President, these are just some of the indicators that show our military is being stretched too thin. The fact is, these defense cuts that we have made over the last few years of almost 50 
percent have put our security at risk. This has been made worse by the diversion of U.S. resources and readiness in Bosnia and elsewhere. 
In the midst of all this, the President presents the Senate with a proposal to expand NATO to include three new countries without first answering such questions as what is the mission of a post-cold war NATO? The Senate has been put in a dilemma. On one side, we have colleagues who strongly support the resolution of ratification and oppose conditions and reservations that any of us may wish to add. 
Throughout this debate, I have heard supporters say that the proposal to add these new members is moral and just and needs no further thought. We have been told that the United States owes these countries membership in NATO, and it has been implied that to question this assumption is to question the very merits of the cold war and NATO's role in winning that role. 
Many of us who have reservations about this proposal are the strongest supporters of NATO--I certainly am--and our American leadership in the alliance is also very important. I think NATO is the best defense alliance that has ever been put together in the history of the world. I want to make sure we preserve it, which is why I am questioning some of the assumptions about enlargement that are not based on any facts that we have seen and which have been brought up at the North Atlantic Council or in the U.S. Senate. 
There are many other places in the world where only the United States can and will lead. I cherish the role that NATO played in winning the cold war, and it is because of that commitment to support NATO that I take the ramifications of enlargement so seriously. 
Many of us with reservations want to see the United States take its fair place in the world and assume its fair share of the responsibility. But we do not think we should be involved in every regional conflict, dissipating our strength and endangering our role as a superpower, a superpower capable of responding where no one else can or will. This doctrine was set in this country as far back as John Quincy Adams, who said to the American people that we will be tempted to go out and right every wrong, but if we do, we will dissipate our strength and we will no longer be effective. 
On the other side of the dilemma is the failure of the President to negotiate conditions that address U.S. costs and the heavy burden for European security that we already bear. He promised the three countries under consideration--all of whom are worthy countries--that their admission into the alliance was a fait accompli. 
But too many issues remain open, and it has been left to the full Senate the responsibility, a responsibility unsuited to a legislative body, I might add, to address the mission of NATO and what the criteria for new membership should be. I, for one, believe it may even be premature for the Senate to be considering the question. While the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has held a number of hearings on NATO enlargement during this Congress, several matters have not been yet thoroughly aired. For example, we still await a strategic rationale for an expanded NATO from the President. What will NATO's future mission be? What will be the role in executing that mission? 
The resolution before the Senate requires the President to report on these matters within 6 months of our approval of NATO enlargement. I can think of no better example of putting the cart before the horse. If we approve that sequence, the Senate is, in effect, saying it agrees with the President that we need to expand NATO, but we haven't decided why. 
It seems to me the Foreign Relations Committee, the Armed Services Committee, and even the Intelligence Committee, should have the rationale from the administration now, not in 6 months. 
There are other issues that need further discussion. On January 16 of this year, the Clinton administration signed a security charter with Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia that raises important questions: What are we committed to do in this charter? Have we given these countries a security guarantee? Why have no other NATO members signed the Baltic charter? I just think we need to discuss this in the context of where we are going with NATO over the long-term. 
The Senator from Virginia has introduced an amendment to take a 3-year time-out after this first phase of enlargement so that we can begin to consider these important issues without the pressure of additional countries that would be waiting on the doorstep with admission promised to them. This would permit us to discuss additional membership on the merits, rather than because of personalities. 
A new development since the last Foreign Relations Committee on NATO enlargement is the violence in the southern province of Kosovo. It is very important that we consider the impact this could have on the U.S. and her allies. I think these issues need to be addressed if we are going to look at what NATO is and what everyone in NATO will agree it should be. 
There are other issues. How much will it cost? I will speak in greater detail later, because there will be an amendment on cost. But no one knows how much it is going to cost. Estimates that vary from a few million to $125 billion are not credible. It is impossible to say that we know what the cost to the United States will be. A range of a few million to $125 billion cannot be taken seriously. 
I am also concerned about the chances we have of importing into the alliance ethnic, border, and religious disputes that have riven Europe for centuries. I will have an amendment in that regard. 
After looking at the underlying resolution and the Kyl amendment that was passed yesterday, which could be interpreted--I hope it isn't--as drawing us into one of those ethnic conflicts, my amendment will say that we want NATO to determine a border and ethnic dispute resolution process before we have to make a decision on what our role will be, so that there will be no question of what process will be followed to make peace, and so that it will not rise to the level of common defense necessities for the United States. 
The American people cannot believe that this U.S. Senate would act on a resolution that would draw U.S. troops into harm's way for an ethnic conflict that has been boiling in Europe for a hundred years if there is not a U.S. security interest involved. 
Opponents of my proposal will say that that will weaken U.S. influence in NATO, but I don't understand that concern. We should certainly be confident enough in our leadership that we would be able to discuss candidly with our allies the limits of our involvement in a parochial dispute. 
Mr. President, the resolution before us is far from a finished project. Many of us who do not serve on the Foreign Relations Committee, and would like to support the resolution, particularly as it applies to the three countries, good countries, that are doing the right thing toward democracy and a free market. But we do believe too much has been left out. It is not right to say that this resolution cannot be improved. There are several good proposals that will be introduced in the Senate, which we will have a chance to debate and vote on, which would make this resolution one that all of us can support in good conscience. 
I urge my colleagues to consider each amendment on its merits and not based on a preconceived notion that this resolution needs no refinement and that any change would somehow be a bad change. The Senate has a constitutional responsibility to express its will on international treaties. That is a double responsibility when we 
are talking about the potential of U.S. troops going into a conflict in which they could lose their lives. 
The Senate's responsibility in the Constitution is to advise and consent, not just consent. Mr. President, our responsibility in the Constitution is every bit as important and clear as is the President's responsibility. The signers of our Declaration of Independence and the writers of our Constitution came from a historical point in which they had a king who declared war and also executed that war. They specifically rejected the idea of one person having all the power. They dispersed the power because they wanted it to be a well-debated and difficult decision to send U.S. troops into harm's way. 
Mr. President, our founders were right. It is the Senate's responsibility to meet their test of advice and consent when our troops and our American security is at stake. I hope we can make this resolution one that all of us can proudly support, one that has conditions that are responsible in the stewardship of the security of the United States. That is our responsibility under the Constitution, and that is what we must do. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, my amendment is very simple. It requires the U.S. Representative to NATO to make a proposal to our allies regarding the resolution of disputes that fall short of article V conflicts. 
Before discussing what my amendment does, I would like to say what it does not do. It does not require that NATO adopt a dispute resolution process, although I think it should. It does not tell the President what his ambassador to NATO should propose, although I hope the administration will take the opportunity to provide meaningful leadership in this area. It does not treat new members of NATO any differently from current members. In fact, that is the premise of the amendment, that there be a dispute resolution process that applies to all members, current and prospective, so there are no surprises should a dispute arise. 
I think it would show strong leadership to anticipate that there might be disputes in Europe where we have seen disputes of varying kinds over the course of history. But to have a dispute resolution process that is not looking at two particular countries and individual personalities, but rather to have a dispute resolution process so everyone knows what the ground rules are and everyone would comply with those, having had a say in the way they are drawn up. 
Why is this needed? Simply put, because the history of the 20th century demonstrates clearly that great conflicts can arise from small disputes. If we are going to expand NATO to include an ever-growing number of new countries, it is simply folly to pretend that no such disputes will ever occur within the alliance, or that they would not affect the alliance in its ability to stay together. 
According to the Congressional Research Service assessment of a number of sources, there are at least 11 ongoing disputes in Europe that have a moderate or high potential for violence or escalation. Some of those are listed behind me. 
For example, three involve Albania. While Albania is not being considered for membership in NATO today, many have said that it should be considered in the next wave of new members. So I think if we set something in place now, we are not saying that it would apply just to Albania; we are not making it personal. But what we are saying is `let's recognize the obvious. NATO currently has no process to peacefully resolve disputes, which will only grow in number as the alliance enlarges.' We have had a conflict involving Greece and Turkey for most of the history of the alliance. 
Opponents to my amendment would say that this proves that we don't need a dispute resolution process, because we can handle future conflicts the way we have handled the Greece-Turkey conflict. Mr. President, we have not handled the Greece-Turkey conflict. We have avoided handling it. In 1974, these two supposed NATO allies almost went to war over the island of Cyprus. That conflict continues today. Each country regularly threatens the other with war over sea and airspace violations, weapons proliferation, and the treatment of each other's compatriots in Cyprus. 
If the best that my opponents can say of my amendment is to point to Greece and Turkey as proof that we don't need it, then there really can be no opposition to it at all. The fact is, the cold war imposed a discipline on the alliance that probably did keep such conflicts in check. That discipline is no longer in place. If we do not at least discuss a process by which NATO can peaceably resolve disputes, then the alliance will lose credibility as we turn a blind eye to a growing number of disputes similar to that of Greece and Turkey. Such a process might even have ended that conflict, permitting both of those countries to move on and focus on their own strengths and their own economies. 
In a letter to the President last summer, I joined with nearly two dozen Senate colleagues to raise this and a number of other questions regarding NATO enlargement. We asked the President about the importance of border-dispute resolutions and should we not be anticipating this so we could resolve them, not in the heat of a dispute, but in a vacuum of such disputes so we would be able to go forward in an objective way. 
In his response to us, the President said, in effect, that NATO doesn't need a dispute resolution process because the European countries have themselves established a number of bilateral treaties regarding their borders. But we are changing the makeup of NATO. We can certainly anticipate what more members--many with long-standing disputes, ethnic disputes, border disputes--will do to the alliance. We must go in with our eyes wide open and prepare for some potential escalation of conflicts or new conflicts to arise as we add new and diverse members. 
My amendment simply requires that before NATO expansion goes into effect, the U.S. Representative at NATO should open discussion about dispute resolution. My amendment restricts the issues that should be considered in such a proposal, and it certainly restricts it to territorial and security matters so as not to permit an agricultural crisis, for example, to trigger a NATO process. 
My amendment further requires that any U.S. proposal be aimed at disputes in which at least one of the parties has threatened the use of military force. That is it. There is no reason to be concerned that this proposal is going to do something drastic. It is not directing any outcome, but it is saying we must raise this question. Let's talk about it when there is not the heat of a crisis. 
Opponents to it, though, say that it will dilute U.S. influence in NATO. 
 How could U.S. leadership be weakened by our representative in NATO raising a topic that the European countries themselves believe is so important that they have signed 12 treaties on the matter already? It is because of our leadership in NATO that this could happen in a way that I think would provide stability in the alliance, and I don't know why it would even be resisted. 
Why would we be thinking of adding new members to this alliance if we didn't have enough confidence in our leadership to know that we could open for discussion such an issue and that it would be good for everyone to address? It seems to me that the argument about U.S. leadership being diluted is much more relevant to the question of whether there should be new members, rather than whether all members should acknowledge their potential border problems. 
I have had conversations with foreign ministers and ambassadors from each of the three prospective NATO members. They have told me that as long as any dispute resolution process applies to all members evenly, then they support the idea. 
I also spoke with former U.S. representatives to NATO and to other European capitals. They, too, have told me that NATO should discuss this matter. Former NATO Ambassador Bob Hunter has said that he thought this was a positive approach. President Reagan's Ambassador to the U.S.S.R., Jack Matlock, said--and he is, I would say, a leading authority on European security--that, `NATO has no policy on how to deal with ethnic unrest, and they need it badly.' This is a quote directly from Ambassador Matlock, who is a seasoned and career diplomat.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yesterday, we adopted an amendment that could be interpreted to endorse NATO's role in responding to ethnic or religious disputes. If it is legitimate that NATO be involved in ethnic or religious disputes, why would it not be equally legitimate that NATO discuss a process to avoid or resolve such disputes? 
My amendment would initiate that discussion. I had much stronger language in an earlier amendment that I was considering, but I have talked to many Members of the other side, I have talked to many Ambassadors and people who have dealt with the security of Europe for a longer time than I have, and they felt that it was too strong to give directions. So I have pulled back that language. But I think to open the discussion, to open our eyes to the fact that any time we add members to an alliance, we should certainly expect that there would then be more potential for disagreements, I think that will be a responsible approach to our responsibility in the Senate. 
I hope my colleagues will accept this amendment. It is one of the amendments that I think would strengthen the responsible role we play, it would strengthen U.S. leadership, and, most of all, Madam President, it would strengthen the NATO alliance to anticipate problems and have a process by which we could address them. What could be more responsible and more reasonable than that? 
I do hope we can adopt this amendment. It will be one of the amendments that I think would help me be able to vote in good conscience for this resolution that is before us today. 
Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.

Isn't it a responsible thing to at least bring it up, start talking about what would be in a border dispute resolution? And then if there was not a consensus, of course, it could be rejected. What could be wrong with just asking that it be brought up for discussion among our allies?

If we had the ability to have something in place by which we could have had a process long before Dayton to discuss these issues and perhaps bring them to the table together for a resolution, I do not think we would be in a potentially unending commitment in Bosnia. 
I just ask if a border dispute resolution process would not be part of collective security, if it would not help us prevent conflict rather than always reacting when things are already exploding before our eyes?

Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would like to try to answer that because what we are trying to do is not have it come up to NAC but to have border disputes and a process that everyone has agreed to, and if anyone doesn't agree, including us, it wouldn't go into effect. 
The Senator from Delaware quoted from my statement, but he forgot to say that I laid out the labor arbitration as just an example of what it could look like. I was only trying to provide one option, one thought. The purpose is not to have border dispute resolutions come to NAC. It is to have an agreed-upon procedure at the lowest level so that every country would know what the ground rules are so that they could handle it at the lowest level and there wouldn't be an eruption at the highest level. 
I say to the Senator from Delaware, who I admire very much, that all the United States Ambassador has to do is say, `I don't think this is a good idea,' when he does start talking to the allies. It will go nowhere. Why would anyone be afraid to talk about this in anticipation of problems that could occur? There are 11 potential border disputes that have been identified by the Congressional Research Office as having a medium to high probability of escalation. It is, I think, an opportunity to keep a Bosnia from rising to the level it has. If we had a mechanism in place with the Croats, the Serbs and the Moslems could have gone to an arbitration process, or could have agreed on a process early on 
how they would like to settle the dispute in the former Yugoslavia. 
All we are talking about is putting the idea on the table. We are not talking about a result. I don't know why we should fear a discussion. Why should we fear bringing this up just to see what our allies would like to do about potential border conflicts? NATO is not going to be the same. When you add new members, regardless of who they are, you have to anticipate that there may be a change in the alliance. When West Germany became a member it changed the alliance. When Spain became a member it changed the alliance. When France decided not to be a part of the military operation, it changed the alliance. 
What I am trying to do with this amendment is provide leadership. If we have the veto, as the Senator from Delaware has said, we can veto. But why not bring it to the table for discussion?

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, let me just say that I agree with my friend, the Senator from Virginia, that why wouldn't we put out every possible effort with every potential idea that could keep us from having an escalation that would require arms conflict, or would allow for armed conflict? Precisely for the reason that the Senator from Delaware has stated: Perhaps we do need another step in the process. 
What if the two generals in the back room can't agree? Why not have a safety valve that would give another option when all else has failed? Why not go the extra mile? We are not trying to guarantee the result with my amendment; we are only trying to guarantee that there will be an effort, that we will try to come forward with a process that everyone would agree is a good process. If the United States thinks the end result is not a good one, it has the final ability to veto, as the Senator from Delaware has pointed out. 
Why not try? What are we afraid of? That we would not be able to put this on the table for discussion, to see if a process can be agreed upon by all of our allies in a consensus, and, if so, have the opportunity for another layer at the very lowest levels before it escalates into a situation as we see in Bosnia today?

Mr. President, I have now heard from the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from California that the 11 disputes which have been put together by the Congressional Research Service have no relation to what we are doing today. And yet the countries mentioned for inclusion in the next wave of NATO expansion are Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Romania. And Albania has also been mentioned. 
It is relevant that we have ongoing disputes within the area that we will be considering for inclusion in NATO. Mr. President, it is a matter of preparing for the future. We are changing NATO. Every time a new member is included, it changes the alliance. We hope it will strengthen the alliance. We must look to what the future potential conflicts in the alliance would be. And the more you expand it, the more potentials for conflict there are. 
Let me read to you the amendment that we passed yesterday. It defines `common threats' in NATO to include `conflict in the North Atlantic area stemming from ethnic and religious enmity, the revival of historic disputes or the actions of undemocratic leaders.' That is the definition of `common threats.' 
In the paragraph following the next paragraph, the capacity to respond to common threats is addressed. `NATO's continued success requires a credible military capability to deter and respond to common threats.' 
So, Mr. President, it could be that we are opening NATO and 
changing its very nature by the amendment that was passed yesterday. It could be that we are looking at involvement in ethnic and religious enmity and revival of historic disputes or the actions of undemocratic leaders in a future mission for NATO. 
If we are going to change the nature of NATO in this way, my amendment is even more important. Why are we afraid to lead? Why are we afraid to put on the table a border dispute resolution process which everyone would have to agree to so that we will know what the process is before there is an eruption that goes beyond our ability to contain it without military force?

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, it was said by the distinguished Senator from Oregon, for whom I also have great respect and I think he is doing a fine job in the Senate, but he said that we have other mechanisms for dispute resolutions. My problem with that is that the OSCE not only is a very different kind of organization in which we are 1 vote out of 50, but if a dispute resolution is not passed in the OSCE, we aren't pledging military involvement by the United States. The OSCE is a good organization, and I hope we can use it. What I am trying to do is to recognize that we are changing NATO as we add new members. When we added West Germany, it changed. We want NATO to be strengthened by the new members, and we know that new members are coming down the pike. In fact, members that are in dispute right now have been mentioned as potential new members of NATO. Why would we be afraid? 
As my amendment says, to introduce to the North Atlantic Council a proposal for consideration by all allies aimed at establishing a process for dispute resolution--to keep our alliance strong, we must have a mechanism where disputes that we know are pending today by potential future members, or things we have not even thought might occur, if they do, why not have a process that everyone has agreed is the way to hold this to a low level rather than raising to the high level of the North Atlantic Council? 
Mr. President, we have seen border disputes in Europe erupt. We want to do everything. We want to go the extra mile to make sure we can resolve small things at a low level because small things can become big things. Then we would have troops at stake. Our security could be at stake. We want to lower the rhetoric. 
That is what this amendment does. It does not guarantee the outcome of our proposal. 
It says we will lead. The United States will lead to try to make sure that we have a process before we need it, before personalities are involved where we can solve problems. 
I hold up the New York Times of today: `Greek Cypriots To Get Missiles from Russians.' `Turkey has warned that it may take military action to block the sale of S-300 missiles' going into that part of the world. 
If we had talked about a process where we could be helpful in resolving disputes like this, wouldn't we be better off? Why would we fear talking and having a forum that would allow us to solve these problems before they escalate and our troops could be called in to military action? It is our responsibility to lead, and I am asking my colleagues to make sure we do. 
I yield the floor.

This amendment says to them we will never forget and if there is ever a shred of hope that we could learn more about how even one service man or woman died or became missing, it is worth every effort that we would make. That is what this amendment does.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Smith for leading the effort on this amendment. 
I want to tell you a story about how this came to be an amendment to this bill. 
Pat Dunton is my constituent. She is the president of the Korean-Cold War Family Association of the Missing. Pat Dunton's father served in the Korean conflict. She has been trying to get information about her father for all of these years since the Korean war. She still gets choked up talking about not knowing where he is or what happened to him. She came to my office one day and we started talking about how hard it is not to know. We started thinking. Well, you know, maybe we could do something with the new members who have been invited into NATO because during the cold war, which is when some of the MIA incidents took place, maybe the governments of these countries who were allies with the Soviet Union, some of whom were in Korea, might be helpful in going to these families and providing the information that they might have knowledge of. I just believe that this is something that should be done. I also believe that all three of the countries being considered for NATO membership would like to help in this effort. 
I went to Senator Smith, who has been the leading advocate in the Senate for not forgetting our POWs and MIAs. I said, Let's do something in the NATO agreement that would require any information to be opened to the families of POWs from any conflict. But most especially, of course, Korea is where we think these countries really might have some information that could be relevant. 
I am pleased that Senator Smith decided to take the lead and work with me on this because I think it can make a difference. It calls for the full cooperation of the Governments of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in obtaining that accounting, and specifically calls for facilitating access to relevant archival material and for these Governments to identify any individuals that may possess knowledge relative to captured and missing U.S. personnel. 
Mr. President, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have all thrown off the chains of Communist domination. But not so long ago and throughout the cold war their military forces and their intelligence services were closely aligned with the very governments who hold the keys to a great deal of information which may help achieve the full accounting we seek. For example, from the end of the Korean war in 1953, representatives of the Czech and Polish military were stationed inside North Korea as part of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission at Panmunjom. Their military personnel had direct contact with the North Korean military and had at times a great deal of high-level access throughout North Korea. They met with their North Korean counterparts and may well have highly relevant information on the fate of Americans who were missing during the Korean war. 
We also know that their intelligence services and their military often shared information with the intelligence services and military forces of the Soviet Union and that there are those who may have direct knowledge of events involving Americans who were missing during the Vietnam war as well as the numerous Americans who disappeared during military operations in other areas during the cold war. 
As new NATO allies, it is certainly reasonable to expect that they would open their archives and provide access to our officials. I have already received assurances from representatives of the Polish Government that this access would be readily granted, and I am certain that the Czechs and the Hungarians would also be eager to work with us. 
I have also been contacted by family members of the missing as well as by military personnel working in the area of POW-MIA recovery, and both groups have insisted that it would be helpful to make an official statement on behalf of Congress in the form of this amendment that this is an issue of national importance. 
I think the amendment is necessary and important. It sends a message to the long-suffering families often forgotten that are still seeking information about the fate of their loved ones. We must take every opportunity to demonstrate that we understand their grief and their desire to find answers and that it is reasonable to expect any new allies to also respect our legitimate desire to learn all we can about those who are missing in the service of our country. The armed forces and the intelligence services of these same countries that seek to join NATO today were once on the other side of the bitter struggle of the cold war. So they would have information, and we hope that they would agree readily to help us in giving some comfort and perhaps providing answers, that final answer, to some member of a family who has been waiting maybe not patiently but certainly with hope in their hearts that someday they would know what happened to their father or their son who has served in our military and perhaps gave his or her life in service to our country. 
I think we owe them this amount of caring, this amount of assurance that we will go the extra mile to make sure they have that closure if it can possibly be given to them. 
So I thank Senator Smith. I hope the Senate will adopt this amendment when we have the vote. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have just been looking at the amendment with the Senator from Virginia. I like every other part of the amendment. 
I like every other part of the amendment. But it seems that the words define what a common threat is, and included in the common threat are ethnic divisions or uprising, and then it says that one of the missions of NATO is to respond to common threats. I just wondered if there could be a clarification, or perhaps a clarifying amendment that would assure that is not going to be a responsibility of NATO to come into a situation in which there is a border dispute or an ethnic dispute. In fact, that is one of the amendments I would offer later, which is to avoid having the United States get into an ethnic dispute. 
If the Senator from Arizona can clarify it, I think the Senator from Virginia and I would like to support the amendment. But if it needs some work to assure its intent, then perhaps we could work on that as well.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, technology has opened many doors for communications and information sharing. Unfortunately, criminals have found new ways to use the innovations to hurt children. 
Today I am introducing with Senator DeWine the Child Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act of 1998. Our bill will give law enforcement the necessary tools to stop crimes against children, especially those initiated through the Internet and commercial on-line services. 
Along with the proliferation of users of on-line services, our nation has seen a rise in crimes committed against children by sexual predators on-line. Every day, pedophiles stalk children through the computer, transmitting pornography to them and enticing them to participate in illegal activity. In some of the most tragic instances, these criminals have convinced children to travel long distances to meet them, only to face horrendous abuse by their `hosts.' 
In response to the growing number of these crimes. Congress has and will surely continue to appropriate funds to allow collaboration among FBI and state and local law enforcement to develop effective means to prevent innocent children from being exploited. In the past, funds have been used to train officers to detect cybercrime, pursue sexual predators and establish child sexual exploitation cyber-squads of state and local officers. 
But the responsibility of Congress is not only to provide necessary resources. We have an unfinished responsibility to give officers the legal tools they need to stop these crimes before they happen. In addition, Congress must send the unequivocal message to criminals who dare to prey on children that such crimes will not be tolerated. 
As children and adults increase their use of computers and online services, this problem will only get worse. Only through aggressive enforcement will we be able to combat this rise in tragic crimes against our most vulnerable citizens--children.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank Senator Torricelli and my other colleagues who voted in favor of this important amendment yesterday. I think the Senate's strong 69 to 29 vote in favor of this amendment sent a strong signal that same-gender education should be made available as an option to parents and their children enrolled in public schools. I understand, however, that you have additional questions about the amendment and the issue of same-gender education.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank Senator Torricelli very much for his statement and for his very important question. States, school districts, and individual public schools all over the country have either tried to implement same-gender programs and have been forced to end them, or have been dissuaded from even trying by the threat of lawsuit or termination of federal funds by the Department of Education. 
The fundamental purpose and intent of my amendment, then, is to make it clear to these schools that it is the will of Congress that they be allowed to institute voluntary same-gender programs if they believe it will help further their important mission of educating students of both sexes. In no way, however, could this amendment possibly allow discrimination against either girls or boys. 
As you know, the text of my amendment is straight forward. It simply adds same-gender schools and classrooms as one of the allowable uses for federal funds under Title VI of the 
Elementary and Secondary Education Act. As you also know, Title VI is a very flexible block-grant program that can be used for virtually any education reform effort a school district wishes to try, arguably including same-gender programs. But in order to receive Title VI funds for a same-gender school or classroom, the amendment requires that school district offer, quote `comparable educational opportunities for students of both sexes.' This requirement is completely consistent with the requirements of both Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. As you know, in that case the Supreme Court struck down the state-supported VMI because the state of Virginia failed to, quote `provide any comparable single-gender women's instituion.' My amendment follows the Supreme Court's own language and requires that programs offer `comparable' opportunities for both sexes. 
I should also highlight that while the VMI case is certainly in keeping with my amendment, it was a case about higher education, which clearly involves different considerations with regard to the different needs of male and female students than elementary and secondary education. The only major case in which the Supreme Court directly dealt with the Equal Protection Clause as applied to K-12 education was in Vorchiemer, which involved a challenge to an all-girls academy in Philadelphia. In that case, the Supreme Court upheld a Third Circuit ruling that this single-gender public school did not violate Title IX or the 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause. The court in that case explicitly held that there are legitimate differences between boys and girls that can justify separate educational programs in order to provide the best education possible. 
I appreciated the questions that were raised about this amendment, and I sincerely wish to engage them to see how we might best address their concerns. I hope our discussion here today has been helpful in clarifying some of these questions, and I would certainly be happy to answer any additional questions you or other individuals may have. 
The one point I do not wish to get lost in this discussion, however, is that you and I and the other supporters of this amendment simply wish to protect single-gender education as an option. If someone is opposed on principle to single-gender education, that's fine. They can keep their children in a co-ed environment and even oppose single-gender education when their local school board brings it up. But the decision will be made at the local and individual level. Parents and their children and administers serving the community will choose, and that is what this effort is all about.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am going to take the 2 or 3 minutes we have before we begin the debate on the Gorton amendment just to familiarize my colleagues with the bill that is before us, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998, and give an overview of the bill. 
This is something that I think has been a long time coming. What we are trying to do is open our ports and give our carriers and our shippers more of an opportunity to compete with foreign competitors where they have been at a disadvantage in the past because our markets were so open that they were transparent in their contracts to the extent that many shippers would go to foreign carriers in order to escape the requirement to have so much openness and on the other hand carriers would be able to compete at a disadvantage to our shippers because they knew everything about a contract and they could undercut that contract. 
So it has not been a good situation. Particularly our ports that are near Canada or are near Mexico have felt a loss of business because of the competition from the foreign carriers. What we are trying to do is level the playing field for American shippers, American carriers, and try to help American ports get more of the business, which we think, of course, would create more jobs for our port cities. 
So what we tried to do was balance the interests. We want transparency. We want openness. But we also want to allow the privacy of contracting to the extent that shippers and carriers can make contracts which they ought to be able to do privately, and as long as everything is open in competition it should be an open marketplace. 
I would not say this is a perfect bill. Certainly nothing we ever pass is just the way we would pass it if we alone wrote it. But we are not alone. We have 100 Members. We have a Commerce Committee that debated this bill, that worked on it for a long time. In fact, we have been working on it for 2 years, and it has been a compromise bill. But I think everyone will be better off as a result of this effort. 
I appreciate the support of the Commerce Committee. It has been a major achievement for the Commerce Committee. I appreciate the work of Senator Lott, our majority leader, who is very interested in this matter. I appreciate the work of Senator Gorton and Senator Breaux, both of whom have worked very diligently to try to hone the balance in this bill. 
Senator Gorton has an amendment. There was one part of the bill that he felt needed changing. So he is going to debate that amendment. I think the bill should pass as it is because I think the balancing has been done. 
So with that, I will yield the floor. I know we have a unanimous consent agreement that at 9:40 we will begin the debate on the Gorton amendment. And Senator Breaux will be arguing on the other side for the committee. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Senate on its adoption of S. 414, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998. We have worked long and hard to achieve the consensus necessary to move this bill forward. The revisions that S. 414 would make to the Shipping Act of 1984 will help U.S. shippers, ports, and containership operators succeed in an increasingly competitive world of international trade. 
I want to thank all Senators who worked on this bill for their key contributions, especially Senator Lott, our distinguished Majority Leader; Senator McCain, Chairman of the Commerce Committee; and Senators Gorton and Breaux who ensured that all affected groups' concerns were thoroughly considered and addressed. I ask the leadership of the House to quickly adopt S. 414 without amendment so that the participants in the ocean liner shipping industry can turn their efforts toward reaping the benefits of these changes. 
Mr. President, for the record, I now want to explain some of the key provisions of S. 414. 
The most significant benefit of S. 414 is that it will provide shippers and common carriers with greater choice and flexibility in entering into contractual relationships for ocean transportation and intermodal services. It accomplishes this through seven specific changes to the Shipping Act of 1984. It allows multiple shippers to be parties to the same service contract. It allows service contracts to specify either a percentage or quantity of the shipper's cargo subject to the service contract. It prohibits multiple-ocean common carrier cartels from restricting cartel members from contracting with shippers of their choice independent of the cartel. It allows service contract origin and destination geographic areas, rates, service commitments, and liquidated damages to remain confidential. It eliminates the requirement that similarly situated shippers be given the same service contract rates and service conditions. It eliminates the current restrictions on individual common carriers engaging in discriminatory, preferential, or advantageous treatment of shippers and ocean transportation intermediaries in service contracts (while retaining those restrictions for groups of common carriers and strengthening prohibitions against refusals to deal or negotiate by individual common carriers). It allows groups of ocean common carriers to jointly negotiate inland transportation rates, subject to the antitrust laws and consistent with the purposes of the 1984 Act. 
The Commerce Committee report on S. 414 dated July 31, 1997, includes in pages 12 through 17 a new legislative history for section 6(g) of the 1984 Act. Although a substitute amendment to the Commerce Committee reported version of S. 414 has been adopted by the Senate, the legislative history for section 6(g) and other sections of the 1984 Act affected by S. 414 contained in the Committee report remains intact, to the extent that the Committee reported provisions of S. 414 are not substantively amended by the substitute amendment, or the Committee report legislative history is not superseded by the below comments. 
It is anticipated that members of ocean common carrier agreements will enter into individual service contracts with shippers and that, consistent with section 8(c) of the 1984 Act, as amended by S. 414, some of the terms and conditions of those service contracts will not, by agreement of the contracting parties, be publicly available. 
Section 5(c) of the 1984 Act, as amended by S. 414, states that an agreement of ocean common carriers may not require its members to disclose any service contract negotiations they may have with shippers or the terms and conditions of any service contracts which they may enter into for the transportation of cargo. It is important to note that, while section 5(b) of the 1984 Act applies only to conference agreements, new section 5(c) would apply to all agreements among ocean common carriers, including conference agreements. 
Any agreement requirement that members disclose confidential contract information would violate section 5(c) and subject agreement members to penalties under the 1984 Act, as amended by S. 414. In the event a member divulged confidential contract information, that member would likely be in breach of its contract with the shipper and could be held liable by the shipper under the contract. However, in the absence of any agreement requirement that disclosure be made, neither that carrier nor any other agreement member would be subject to penalties under the 1984 Act, as amended by S. 414. Section 8(c)(1) of the 1984 Act, as amended by S. 414, provides that the exclusive remedy for a breach of a service contract shall be an action in an appropriate court, unless the parties otherwise agree. 
Section 8(c)(2) of the 1984 Act, as amended by S. 414, would continue to require that all service contracts be filed with the Federal Maritime Commission. The purpose of this requirement is to assist the FMC in the enforcement of applicable provisions of United States shipping laws. However, other Federal agencies have expressed concerns over how they are to ensure ocean carrier compliance with United States cargo preference law requirements concerning shipping rates in an era of service contract rate confidentiality. The FMC is encouraged to work with affected Federal agencies to address this concern.

Mr. President, my amendment offers the opportunity, the option to local school districts and parents to choose single-sex classrooms or schools if there are comparable opportunities for both sexes. `Comparable' is the word used by the Department of Education and the Supreme Court in the VMI case to determine if there is equal protection under the law. 
I hope we will allow all of the parents of our country to have this as an option. We have to break out of the box in public education to give options to our parents for what is best for their child.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am so pleased to have the question asked because, of course, this is to allow local school districts to have the option. We are not forcing this on anyone. But where an individual child can best perform in a single-sex classroom, why not let them try it? Are we not going to open our minds and be creative with our public education system? If it is good enough for private education, it should be good enough for public education, and everyone should have the opportunity to do the best in the circumstances that fit them best. I thank the Senator for the question.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to thank John Danforth, the former Senator from Missouri, for initiating the ultimately successful effort to create greater opportunity in public schools to have same-gender classes schools. 
I was a freshman in 1994. I remember the compelling argument made by Senator Danforth about what an opportunity this would be for a girl like Cyndee Couch, the seventh grader at the Young Women's Leadership school in East Harlem, NY, to have a safe haven where she could learn without worrying about her safety, or her ability to speak out without being made fun of, or in any way not able to be secure in feeling that she could ask questions and participate in the classroom. 
He also thought about the young girls in the classroom in Maine that were spoken about by Senator Collins today where the school had to go through hoop after hoop after hoop to be able to have an all-girl math class. When they were able to finally do it and break down all the bureaucratic barriers, the test scores have shown that this has been an outstanding success for the girls in that class, without any detriment whatsoever to the other students in that school. 
What we want and what the Senate has done today is to help pave the way to ensure that every child in America to has this same option. This amendment is not a mandate. We are not saying that same-gender classes are best for everyone. But it has been proven that they are good for some, especially for girls and minority boys, who have demonstrated higher test scores and higher grades when they are allowed to concentrate on their studies, free from the distractions of a coed environment. 
I am very proud that the Senate has spoken so clearly today in favor of this option for our public school students, an option that I might say is available at private schools, for parents who can afford it. Should this amendment ultimately become law, this same option will become available for many thousands of parents and their children who may not be able to afford private school tuition. In short, the amendment expands the proven benefits of private, same-gender education to the public school system. 
I am very pleased the Senate has spoken so decisively today on this issue, and I am confident Congress will include it in the final version of this important bill. And this success would not have been possible but for the hard work, vision, and leadership of Jack Danforth, who took-up this cause and in whose footsteps I proudly follow. When he left the Senate and said he would not seek reelection, I told him I would take up the mantle on this issue, and that I would continue his fight to ensure that our nation's schools pursue excellence wherever they may find it. The parents and students of this nation now await the completion of this job, and I urge my colleagues to continue to work for expanded educational opportunities and choices for all Americans. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to be notified at least 4 minutes before the end of my 15-minute allocation, with the intention of giving 2 minutes to the Senator from Georgia to argue in favor, and then I want to reserve the remainder of my time for the end of the debate following any debate opposing my amendment. 
My amendment simply seeks to give the opportunity to public schools what private schools can now do, and that is offer an option of same-gender classes or schools. I seek to amend the allowable uses of title VI funds for education reform projects that provide same-gender schools and classrooms as long as comparable educational opportunities are offered for students of both sexes. 
Mr. President, title VI is the place in our education code providing for reform of education to create new and innovative programs to try to improve our public education opportunities in this country. 
I am offering this amendment to remove a cloud of doubt hanging over the education community about the Federal policy on whether we allow a local decision by a local public school district to operate same-gender schools and classrooms. 
The amendment is very simple. It adds the establishment and operation of same-gender schools and classes to the allowable uses for funds under title VI. It is not a mandate; it is an option. The title VI program is so broad and flexible that I believe it already allows same-gender education programs. But due largely to the fear that many schools throughout our country have, believing that the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights would not allow same-gender education efforts, most States and school districts are reluctant to use their own money, much less Federal money, for these purposes. This is unfortunate. 
Ask almost any student or graduate of a same-gender school, most of whom are from private and parochial schools, and they will almost always tell you that they were enriched and strengthened by the experience. Surveys and studies of students show that both boys and girls enrolled in same-gender programs tend to be more competent, more focused on their studies, and ultimately more successful in school as well as later in their careers. We are talking here about K through 12. Specifically, girls report being more willing to participate in class and to take difficult math and science classes that they otherwise would not have attempted. Boys also report less pressure of being put down by their classmates for wanting to participate in class and excel at their studies. Both sexes report feeling more of a camaraderie and sense of peer and teacher support than they do when they are in a coed environment. Teachers, too, report fewer control and discipline problems, something almost any teacher will tell you can consume a good part of class time. 
Inevitably, these positive student attitudes translate into academic results. Study after study shows that girls and boys in same-gender classes, on average, are academically more successful and ambitious than their coed counterparts. 
I also note that a recent well-publicized report by the American Association of University Women did not so much challenge the demonstrated benefits of same-gender schools as it called to implement these benefits into coed classrooms. That is exactly the point. For many students, the same-gender schools and classrooms is the most conducive environment for success, precisely because they are same gender. No one would dispute that schools and teachers should strive to maintain order, academic rigor, and treat boys and girls equally. The fact is that in some cases this tends to be easier in a same-gender environment. 
Same-gender education has benefited students like Cyndee Couch, a seventh grader at Young Women's Leadership school in East 
Harlem. Cyndee and the other students at this all-girls school, located in a low-income, predominantly African American and Hispanic section of New York City, have an attendance rate of 91.8 percent--significantly above the New York City average. They also score higher on math and science exams than the city average. In fact, 90 percent of the school's students recently scored at or above the grade level on the standardized public school math problem solving test. The citywide average was only 50 percent. 
Last year, Cyndee bravely appeared on the television show `60 Minutes' to talk about why she likes the all-girl public school. She told host Morley Safer, `As long as I'm in this school and I'm learning and no boys are allowed in the school, I think everything is going to be OK.' 
Unfortunately for Cyndee and for other students in fledgling same-gender public school programs around the country, everything is not OK. Opponents of same-gender education have sued to shut down the Young Women's Leadership school and other schools like it around the country. Mr. President, I can't imagine why they would do this. Why would they take away this option for parents in East Harlem of New York City? When they can't choose the environment that they find is more supportive and conducive to learning for their children, what are their options? Whose civil rights are being violated when parents and their children voluntarily enroll in same-gender programs in the hope that they will be able to get a better education and have a better chance at success in life? Who is harmed by that? 
Mr. President, many of our Nation's public schools are failing in their jobs to adequately prepare our young people for the challenges that face them. After decades of rhetoric about who is to blame for this failure, it is time to stop talking and give more options. We need to find out what works and use it. For many students, same-gender education works. It is certainly not the only answer to our public school woes, but it is one solution that should not be left out of the equation. 
We are adding to the list of choices. We are not mandating anything. In education, one-size-fits-all is simply not going to work. We have to allow our local schools to have all the choices that can best fit the individual students in their school districts. 
Some opponents of same gender education may also try to claim that it violates title IX of the Civil Rights Act or the equal protection clause of the Constitution. Both of those arguments are erroneous. Title IX was passed as part of the Education Amendment of 1972. It prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex at any school receiving Federal financial assistance. Title IX was never intended to prohibit same-gender K-12 education. In fact, with regard to admissions, the language of title IX applies only to higher education institutions that were not same-gender at the time of passage of the provision and to vocational and professional institutions. An earlier version of title IX that would have prohibited same-gender admissions policies, K-12, was specifically defeated in Congress. 
The language of title IX as well as subsequent judicial interpretations of title IX make it clear that the law does not prohibit same-gender schools. What, then, about same-gender classrooms located at coed schools? Are they prohibited by title IX? The answer again is no. The overriding purpose and intent of title IX is to prohibit discrimination against individuals because of their sex, not to erase any consideration of the different educational needs of boys and girls. There simply is no discrimination if comparable educational opportunities are afforded to each sex, as my amendment requires. 
Indeed, title IX itself recognizes a number of gender differences in allowing separate programs for physical education, organized sports, and sex education. Even the Department of Education sees same-gender classrooms as acceptable if the school is able to come up with a sufficiently convincing argument that it is doing so to overcome some past discrimination against one sex or the other with regard to that course offering, even though no such proof of past discrimination is required by the language of title IX. 
I believe the only justification that schools should need to have to institute a single-sex classroom or school is that the school and the parents believe it will provide a better educational opportunity for the parents and children who choose the option. This reflects both the language and the intent of title IX, and what we would do today with this amendment is clarify that that is the will of Congress. 
Mr. President, I will yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Georgia, after which I will reserve my final 2 minutes.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it is my intention to finish the use of my time. I understand there will be no one speaking against it at this time. So we will close out this debate and go to the next amendment. 
Mr. President, I just want to speak to the last point, which is the concern about the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the Constitution. The Supreme Court recently struck down the all-male admission policy of Virginia Military Academy on the grounds that it violated equal protection for female applicants because Virginia did not meet the constitutional requirement that there be a comparable facility for women. 
My amendment clearly requires that there be comparable opportunities for both sexes. Mr. President, we are meeting the constitutional test of the 14th amendment. We are meeting the constitutional test of equal protection, and we are meeting the definition of title IX, and we are adding an option to title VI. 
In short, what we are trying to do is say that the parents of children who go to public schools should have the option--not any kind of mandate, but the option--in grades K through 12 to allow same-gender classes or same-gender schools to be offered in their school districts. 
We believe that for some children it is proven that they can excel academically in the lower grades when they are in a same-gender environment. This has been proven with both boys and girls. Why not allow our public schoolchildren to have the same opportunities that parents could choose if they could afford to send their children to private schools? Why not say our education system is failing and the way we are going to improve it and tailor it to individual boys and girls in this country so that they can meet their full potential with the best education that they can receive is to allow more options for our public schools? 
I believe these options are available now. But because it is not absolutely clear, many public schools are afraid to go forward for fear they might be sued to shut down, which is exactly what is happening to the Young Women's Leadership School in East Harlem that is showing nothing but success. Someone has come in to sue and to say that this violates the Constitution. I argue that it doesn't violate the Constitution; it is required by our Constitution to give our children in our public schools the same opportunities that a child going to private school would have. Let's improve the education system and vote for this amendment. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, American ports and carriers and shippers are disadvantaged by current laws that require all contracts to be public. To avoid publication, U.S. ports are bypassed when possible and the U.S. carriers lose business. U.S. exporters, unlike their foreign competitors, must reveal their ocean transportation costs, permitting the foreign competition to undercut them. Recent economic problems in Asia will increase pressure in those countries to increase their exports. S. 414 will be even more important if our shippers meet the heightened competitive challenge. S. 414 attempts to level the playing field between U.S. companies which export and their foreign competitors. 
This bill will encourage greater competition among carriers. It will provide American exporters and importers with greater choice in obtaining ocean transportation services and promote more ocean shipping activity for our carriers and our ports. 
In providing our shippers with this important reform, we have still attempted to preserve antidiscrimination provisions in current law and the elements of our current `transparent' system that protect our ports, smaller shippers, and U.S. workers. This bill balances the need to have enough transparency to assure fair pricing with contract privacy. 
Ninety-five percent of U.S. foreign commerce is transported via ocean shipping. Half of this trade which is carried by container liner vessels with scheduled service is regulated under the Shipping Act of 1984 and would be affected by these reforms. This legislation represents an important opportunity to ease the hand of regulation on a significant sector of commerce. 
This bill represents the first major reform of this critical 
industry in a decade and the most significant change to the underlying statute since 1984. Its completion complements the free trade revolution that has occurred during this same period and will allow American businesses and consumers to take advantage of the global increase in trade, both imports and exports. 
Mr. President, I am proud to have worked on this bill with the distinguished Majority Leader Lott and colleagues from both sides of the aisle to advance this important legislation. I really appreciate the leadership of the ranking member of the full Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings, as well as certainly the ranking member of the Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee, Senator Inouye, and my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, and the chairman of the committee, Senator McCain. 
I would also like to acknowledge the concerns of my colleague from Washington, Senator Gorton. I am aware of the outstanding issue that he will soon address with his amendment. I understand the merits of his amendment. I have sympathy for it. However, I will have to vote against it and urge my colleagues to do likewise because its adoption at this time will jeopardize the progress of this bill. 
I would like to outline the key points of the legislation. Here are the highlights of the floor amendment that I have introduced. 
We provide shippers and common carriers greater choice and flexibility in entering into contractual relationships for ocean transportation and intermodal services. To this end, the most significant improvements are: 
No. 1, that we strengthen the right of individual members of ocean carrier groups to negotiate and enter into service contracts with one or more shippers, independent of the carrier group. This means that individual carriers will be better able to customize their services without the interference of the carrier conferences. 
No. 2, we clarify the rights of groups of ocean common carriers to jointly negotiate inland transportation rates and services consistent with antitrust statutes and FMC approval. This means that carriers will be able to incorporate electronic commerce, logistics and other services that add value to the customer's contract. 
No. 3, we continue to require a form of tariff publication. However, it is much more flexible than the current tariff filings. Tariffs become effective upon publication through a private system, such as on the carriers' World Wide Web pages, not a governmental publication. Also tariff changes do not require Government approval. This puts the maritime industry on a similar footing as other transportation industries which we have deregulated in recent years, providing carriers with greater flexibility. 
The measure protects U.S. exporters from disclosure to their foreign competitors of certain proprietary business information through their contractual relationships with common carriers by allowing confidentiality of certain service contract terms. As I have mentioned earlier, our competitors can and do contract ocean shipping transportation confidentially, and our shippers never know what their competitors are paying for transportation. However, U.S. shippers' ocean transportation costs are an open book, and foreign competitors use the information to undercut our exporters whenever possible. Our ports suffer, too. Shippers who conveniently can, will ship out of foreign ports in nearby Canada or Mexico to avoid this penalty. 
Our shippers say they want more flexibility in dealing with their ocean carriers and the ability to go outside the traditional tariff system and conference structure. We have provided this needed confidentiality, but balanced it with protections for ports and U.S. dockworkers who seek information on the movement of commodities to protect their competitive position. 
Additionally, this measure relaxes some of the restrictions on individual carriers relating to practices or preferences in dealing with exporters, but maintains them with regard to the concerted activity of two or more carriers. 
Finally, the reported bill would have combined the functions of the Federal Maritime Commission and the Service Transportation Board into a single agency. This floor amendment retains these separate agencies and functions in their current form. 
Thus, the overall thrust of this entire bill--with the amendment that I am offering--is to generate more competition for shippers of all sizes in the ocean transportation sector and to make this important transportation link to their overseas markets more affordable and sensitive to their individual needs. 
This is a bill that should help our ports get more business, which means more jobs in America. It should level the playing field for our U.S. carriers while protecting the rights of shippers and dock workers and other union personnel. It is very important that we have tried to balance this. 
Is the bill perfect? No. There are things I would like to have seen different. We have had to compromise to a degree. But I do think we have done a good job of working with all the interests here and allowing our carriers, shippers and ports to compete, which means jobs for Americans. 
That is the purpose of this bill. I believe we have done it in the best way we could, balancing all of the competing interests. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Washington has made a very eloquent statement, and I am very glad that we agree on 99 percent of this bill and that we agree that this is a very important improvement for the whole shipping and carrier industry which will promote more business for U.S. ports. 
I do not take issue with anything Senator Gorton has said, except to say that in the balancing of competing interests, it is very difficult to have acceptance by all. And I can truthfully say that no one who is affected in this shipping industry is completely happy with this bill--no one--not the unions, not the shippers, not the carriers, and not the non-vessel-operating common carriers of which Senator Gorton spoke. But in the main, the balance is better for all of these than in the present law. 
This bill has some advantages above current law for these non-vessel-operating common carriers. They can take advantage of the tariff reforms. They will be able to privately publish tariffs, and they don't need to file them with the Federal Maritime Commission. These NVOs, as shippers, can have confidential contracts with carriers, helping them compete against each other. They will be able to benefit, of course, from the more competitive atmosphere among carriers when purchasing space, and they have the current protections against discrimination against them by cartels maintained in this bill. 
So while they are not completely happy with this bill--and I certainly understand their concerns--there are important pro-competitive reforms they will benefit from. 
I would point out that the other entities affected by this bill are also not completely happy with it. But they too, recognize it as a compromise that contains positive reforms. I think all would say that having this legislation does open competition, it does bring business to U.S. carriers, the competition will bring lower prices to shippers, and our ports will get the business. 
That is good for everyone above and beyond the law as it stands today. 
I hope, when we vote on Senator Gorton's amendment, people will understand this balancing, that they will opt in favor of the Hutchison amendment to S. 414 unamended by the Gorton amendment and then let us keep working on this issue, which I think certainly the non-vessel-operating common carriers are entitled to and which I pledge I will do and try to get a bill that is a balance, that creates more jobs and more business for America. That should be our goal, and I believe it is. Let us just get there. 
I thank the Chair. 
Now, according to the unanimous consent agreement, I will yield back the time from the majority side. The minority side has agreed to also yield back time. If Senator Gorton does not wish to have further debate, then I will yield the floor and the unanimous consent agreement is in effect. 
Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, a healthy domestic energy industry is critical to our nation's security and our economic well-being. That is why I am pleased today to introduce the U.S. Energy Economic Growth Act. My legislation provides much needed tax relief for the domestic oil and gas industry. It is a part of the omnibus Domestic Oil and Gas Security Enhancement Plan that I've developed with Senator Murkowski and Senator Nickles. Together, our comprehensive legislation represents the most sweeping tax and regulatory relief since before the Gulf War. 
Our package could not come at a more critical time. The price of crude oil recently dipped to its lowest level since April 1994. This downturn in world oil prices has exposed America's independent producers to great risk. If current market conditions persist, as is expected, thousands of wells could become uneconomic and be shut-in or plugged. It is time we acted to ensure this does not happen, and my bill is the first step in that direction.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is what my amendment does. It is a sense of the Senate that this resolution assumes that any budget surplus should be dedicated to debt reduction or direct tax relief for hard-working American families. 
It is really quite simple. This Congress has labored mightily for the last 2 years to come up with a balanced budget. This budget resolution, which has been so ably led by the Senator from New Mexico, and helped by the Senator from New Jersey, is an example of how difficult it has been to actually balance our budget. It has not been easy. It has been tough to make these hard choices, but Congress has done it. 
We are talking about a balanced budget and, in fact, surpluses. I am saying, do not fritter away the victory. We have done the tough things. Now is not the time to get wimpy. Now is the time to remain tough, so that we will be able to assure our children and grandchildren that they will not inherit the $5 trillion of debt that has been built up in this country for the last 40 years. It is a time to say we are going to be responsible stewards of this country while we are on the watch deck. 
It is time for us to say, it is the sense of the Senate that there are only two responsible choices for spending any budget surplus: either tax cuts for the hard-working American family that is today paying over 38 percent of its income in Federal, State and local taxes--and if you add the regulatory burden on top of that, government is costing the average American family, at the $50,000 level, 50 percent of its income. If we say we are going to give tax cuts to those hard-working Americans or we are going to start paying down the debt for our children and grandchildren, and to keep interest rates low, that would be the sense of this Senate for the responsible stewardship of our 
economy. 
We have the highest debt burden today of any peacetime in American history. Economic research shows that tax cuts actually add to the economy. They generate work; they generate jobs; they generate buying power. So it would have a huge impact in a positive way. Debt reduction also has positive returns because certainly it will keep interest rates low and we can continue to invest in our savings. 
Not only are taxes at record highs today, but the trend is in the wrong direction. Since President Clinton came into office in 1993, the tax burden as a percent of gross domestic product has climbed 2.1 percentage points. Just reducing taxes to the 1993 levels means the average family would have a tax windfall of $2,500. This is their money. This money is money they earn, and we believe it belongs to them. That is what this sense of the Senate would say to the American people--you earned this money, and it belongs to you, and if we are not going to give you direct tax relief, the surplus is going to pay down the debt so that you will be able to continue to enjoy the great economy we have and we will also give to our children the same stability in a great economy. 
The amendment is very simple. I ask my colleagues to vote that we will not undo the hard choices and the hard work that we have done in this Congress over the last 3 years, but in fact we will do the right thing, and that is, give the money back to the people who earned it or pay down that debt so that our interest rates can stay low and so that we can stop paying so much interest. 
Mr. President, I now yield the rest of our time--up to 5 minutes--to Senator Grams, the cosponsor of this resolution.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from New Jersey that he can very well vote for my amendment and still do what he says he wants to do, and that is, save Social Security first, because my amendment just lays out the framework for what our priorities would be. 
What it says is that there are only two reasons we should spend the surplus: For tax cuts for the hard-working American family, or for debt reduction, which would save Social Security. 
I support saving Social Security first with all of the surplus, and that would be possible under my amendment. But what we are saying is, we are not going to do anything else with 
the surplus. We are not going to go on new spending binges. We are going to live within our income. We are going to prioritize our budget, just like every family in America does. We are going to live within that budget. And every penny of surplus can only go to one of two purposes: One is tax reductions on the hard-working American family, and the second is to pay down debt. If we continue to pay all the debt, to save Social Security, you can vote for my amendment and be very happy that all of the Congress will support debt reduction as one of our two priorities. 
I hope everyone will support this sense of the Senate, because I think it does set our priorities, just as this budget resolution does. That is what a budget does; it sets the priorities. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. This is a budget that will set our spending priorities. What my amendment says is there are only two responsible ways to spend any future surpluses: to pay down the debt, to save Social Security; or to give tax relief to the hard-working American family. If Congress decides to put all the money into debt relief and Social Security, that is consistent with this amendment. 
The only reason you would vote against this amendment is if you want Congress in the future to be able to go on spending binges and give the bill to our children. This allows us to put all the money on pay-down debt or to give tax relief. 
It is important that we recognize that we have labored mightily. We should not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory on the balanced budget. This is our chance to take a stand. We are going to spend any future surpluses in only two ways--to pay down debt or to give tax relief to the hard-working American family. 
I urge Members to support this.

 Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight to the Senate and to the American people the importance of this day--National Breast Cancer Survivors' Day--a day commemorating breast cancer awareness and the celebration of life. 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women of all ages. There is scarcely an American family that in some way has not been touched by this disease. In fact, it is estimated that over 180,000 women and men are diagnosed with breast cancer and over 43,000 die from the disease each year. Women have a 12 percent lifetime risk for developing breast cancer, and one in 25 women will develop the disease by age 60. While these statistics are grim, today we pause to focus our attention on the hundreds of thousands of success stories--individuals who have survived and even prospered despite breast cancer. 
I salute every brave woman and man who has battled and beaten this disease. Only someone who has had cancer can really know what it is like--the fear, the doubt, and the often painful and debilitating treatments and medical procedures. But beat it they have. And to those who are still in the fight, I say: `Hang in there. You can do it, and the chances are ever greater that you will do it.' 
When detected early and when confined to the breast, the five-year survival rate for this disease is over 95 percent. Mr. President, this is a remarkable statistic, and represents a dramatically improved picture than that of even a few years ago. It is also important to note that, for the first time in years, the mortality rate for both Caucasian and African-American women is also declining. With continued advancements in early detection and treatment procedures, and with the growing hope that a cure might be found in a matter of years, not decades, women today certainly do have cause to celebrate. 
But our work is far from done. I and many of my Senate and House colleagues are doing all we can to ensure that adequate federal resources are being allocated to research, education, and treatment of breast cancer. Through research grants and direct research conducted at the National Institutes of Health, promising leads and even occasional breakthroughs are being pursued with vigor by the best and brightest of the medical and scientific worlds. We can of course do more, and I am joining many of my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee in supporting a significant increase in the fiscal year 1999 budget for the NIH so that this important work can move forward. Put simply, we will not rest until a cure is found. 
But until a cure is found, let me say to every woman in America that you are your own best ally in the fight against breast cancer. Self-exams and regular breast cancer screenings for high risk women and women over 40 is absolutely crucial. I was pleased that last year the National Institutes of Health joined me and others in recognizing the importance of annual screening of women over 40, and the availability and affordability of mammography and other promising detection techniques continues to increase. 
So today, I join my colleagues and all Americans in celebrating those who have won the battle against breast cancer. We salute and celebrate their courage, optimism, and often selfless commitment to help those newly diagnosed to overcome the challenges that lay ahead. Mr. President, these individuals are not just survivors, they are beacons of inspiration and hope for all of us. With the heart and spirit of these survivors leading our way, I know that we will eventually win and conquer this disease. That will be the best Survivors' Day of all08

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Four minutes. I thank the Senator. I appreciate that. 
This is the Faircloth-Hutchison amendment 
and it is also the Faircloth-Hutchison bill that would eliminate the marriage penalty tax. 
All this amendment says is, it is a priority of Congress to eliminate the marriage penalty tax. We don't think Americans should have to choose between love and money. Yet 21 million American couples today have to make that exact choice, because they go into a higher tax bracket when they get married. 
Let me give an example. A rookie policemen in Houston, TX, makes $33,500. His wife is a schoolteacher in the Pasadena independent school district making $28,200 a year. When this young couple got married, they owed Uncle Sam $1,000 more a year. This is at a time when they would like to buy their first home, when they have to buy a second car. They are having to pay Uncle Sam $1,000 because they got married. That could be two house payments, three or four car payments, and we are taking it away from them by an unfair Tax Code. 
Our Tax Code does not meet the fairness test. I think this sense of the Senate says it best--that it will be the highest priority of Congress to correct this inequity in the law. I don't think Congress intended it, but that is the way it happened, and Congress does have the power to correct it. 
I hope we will take this opportunity to speak with a loud, firm, clear voice, that Americans should not have to pay more money because they get married than they would have to pay if they stay single. That is the issue, a very simple amendment. I hope we will have a unanimous vote when this amendment comes forward to show that we intend to do something about this if we possibly can within the constraints of the surplus, and that if we are not able to do something, it will be the highest priority when we do have that budget surplus that I have seen spent in so many ways already in the last year. We haven't seen that budget surplus, so I think spending it is a little premature. 
I do appreciate the fact that this committee set aside $10 billion for the first year for tax cuts, and I think if we can build on that, we can do some good for the hard-working American. We should continue to give money back to the people who earned it. You can always tell who cares about the people who earn the money, and that is by how they refer to tax dollars. We refer to tax dollars as belonging to the people who worked for them, and we are going to try to let people keep more of the money they earned. They deserve it. That is what setting this priority will do for 21 million American couples. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would love to address that issue. It is a valid point. 
We will not take away the break that a couple has in the one-income-earner family; that is, where people are ahead if they have one income in the family, they get a break on taxes. The people who get hit are the low-income people with two wage-earners in the family. They are the ones that often have to work to make ends meet, and yet they are penalized because they get married. It is a couple that makes $28,000 a year and $33,000 a year, and together they move into the higher bracket, but separately they would not be in the higher bracket, they would stay at the 15 percent bracket. 
What we are trying to do is create an equity for those lower- and middle-income two-earner couples that right now are paying a hefty penalty.

I urge all my colleagues to vote for the sense of the Senate, which basically says it will be a priority of Congress to eliminate the marriage penalty tax. People should not have to choose between love and money in this country, but 21 million couples are doing it. And they are the police and schoolteachers, people making $28,000 and $32,000 that are getting hit the worst with taxes up to $1,400 just because they got married. That is not right. It is a priority of Congress to change that. And I urge my colleagues to say that the U.S. Senate is going to fix this problem very soon. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

 Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, Medical schools and teaching hospitals, the training ground for our nations' healthcare personnel and the centers for world class cutting-edge medical innovation, are facing significant challenges as new efforts of cost containment force radical transformation in the healthcare market. There has been a steady decrease in the pharmaceutical R&D performed at medical schools and teaching hospitals. A study by three pharmaceuticals companies revealed that while pharmaceutical R&D is larger dollarwise than NIH, the university-based portion of clinical trials fell from 82% in 1989 to 68% in 1993. 
Given this fact, I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of The Medical Innovation Tax Credit introduced by Senator D'Amato. This bill would give a tax credit of up to 20% on qualified research expenses to firms that conduct and expand their biopharmaceutical research activities at medical schools and teaching hospitals. 
In my home state of Texas, medical technology is poised to become a high-tech boom industry. Texas is currently home to more than 500 medical technology companies with $5 billion in annual sales, according to a new report released by the Austin-based Texas Healthcare and Bioscience Institute. Medical technology companies currently employ about 38,000 people, making it a medium-sized manufacturing industry comparable to the state's paper, lumber and aircraft industries. 
Texas' growing presence in medical technology is firmly rooted in the state's universities and health-related research institutes. Academic health centers such as The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Baylor College of Medicine and MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, and the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth position Texas as a world leader in biomedical research. 
By stimulating more private-sector research at these institutions, the Medical Innovation tax Credit will help ensure America's continued preeminence in bio pharmaceutical research; provide needed resources for medical schools and teaching hospitals; and encourage more clinical trials to be conducted in the United States. 
Mr. President, I look forward to working with Senator D'Amato and members of the Finance Committee to create an environment that will enable medical technology to grow and create jobs.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, the question is not whether we are winning the war on drugs. If that were the question, the answer would be no, and everybody who has spoken would be in agreement. The question is, What is our best strategy to win the war against drugs? I just submit to you that the answer is not making an enemy of Mexico. Mexico is not 2,000 miles from our border. Mexico is our border. Mexico is our second largest trading partner. 
We are not dealing with an easy issue. The sophistication of the drug dealers who are coming in from South America through Mexico into our country is phenomenal. We have found tunnels as deep as 60 feet below ground through solid rock across our border. We have found stashes of illegal drugs buried on the beaches. We have found high-performance boats and satellite communication. 
It is not like someone isn't trying. It is a very difficult problem. If we are going to win the war on drugs, or have any chance, the only way we can do it is through cooperation. And I don't think harsh rhetoric against our neighbor is the best way to do it. 
Do I think we are successful? No; we are not successful. We are not successful in controlling demand. And certainly Mexico has not been successful in controlling supply. 
Mr. President, it isn't the time to start hurling charges back and forth across the Senate Chamber to solve this problem. 
What we must do is try to sit down in cooperation. 
If President Zedillo was saying, `Go fly a kite, we are not going to work with you,' that would be one thing. He isn't. He is trying desperately. He doesn't want a criminal element in Mexico any more than we want a criminal element on the schoolgrounds of America. 
So I hope we will not do something intemperate, which is not what the U.S. Senate normally does. I hope we will not act in haste and do something that would hurt our cause more than it would help. 
Mr. President, I am urging my colleagues to vote against the Coverdell-Feinstein resolution because I think the better way is cooperation. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I anticipate for those who are trying to set a time that we will be ready at about maybe 10:30. I would say this will take 30 to 40 minutes. 
Let me just briefly state what the amendment does, and then I am going to yield to Senator Inhofe and then Senator Roberts and then Senator Craig for their remarks. 
Mr. President, this is an amendment that would express the sense of the Senate and the Congress to the President that we should create the conditions for withdrawal of U.S. ground troops from the NATO-led stabilization force in Bosnia. That is what the amendment does. 
We all know that the President on December 19 of last year declared that Bosnia would be an open-ended commitment for the United States. Congress was not in session. Congress was not consulted. There was no authorization, and the President has made this an open-ended mission. I am very concerned about the mission creep, and I am very concerned that the President has bypassed the Congress, and the Congress has constitutional responsibilities that cannot be bypassed by the President. That is why I am calling up this amendment today. 
I very much appreciate the remarks of the majority leader, Senator Lott, and the chairman, Senator Stevens, saying that this is going to be brought up, we are going to discuss it, we are going to tell the President that the Congress of the United States is not asleep, that we know our constitutional responsibilities and that we now have a commitment that this is going to be discussed and a policy will be set, and we will have an up-or-down vote in the defense appropriations bill later this year before the June 30 deadline that we now face and that we have now seen the President walk away from. 
So, Mr. President, we are going to exercise our responsibilities. We can do no less, and that is why we are discussing this today. 
I am very pleased to now ask Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma to take up to 5 minutes for his views on this issue. I intend to talk about what the amendment does as soon as those who have time commitments have been able to speak. I yield to Senator Inhofe.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of a member of our leadership team on our side, the Senator from Idaho. I think he is right on. I think the Senator from Kansas was right on. The Senator from Oklahoma was right on. I want to talk about what my amendment does. It expresses the sense of Congress that the President and Congress should create the conditions for withdrawal of U.S. ground combat forces from the NATO-led stabilization force in Bosnia. What we are trying to do is lay the groundwork for an honorable exit. 
You know, every time we come up to a deadline that the President himself has set, he says we cannot just leave, it would be irresponsible to leave, it would throw everything into chaos. That is absolutely true. It would be irresponsible to leave right now. But why is that? Why would it be irresponsible to leave right now? It would be irresponsible to leave right now because we have not laid the groundwork for an honorable exit and the President has gone on without the authorization of Congress to say this is going to be an unending mission. 
On November 27, 1995, the President said, `First, the mission will be precisely defined with clear, realistic goals that can be achieved in a definite period of time. Our Joint Chiefs of Staff have concluded that the mission should and will take about a year.' 
The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs strongly concurred with the President's assessment in their testimony before Congress that it would not get involved in such tasks as forcing the resettling of refugees or capturing war criminals and that we should have an end date. 
The Vice President of the United States also provided additional assurances, arguing that the deployment would not lead to mission creep and that within a year hostile forces would be separated, the borders would be marked, elections would be organized and held, and police forces would be established. 
As that deadline approached, the President extended the mission further by announcing a new deadline of June 1998, once again assuring the American people and Congress that the mission would be achievable. 
The mission creep, which concerned General Shalikashvili when he said that, without a fixed end date, mission creep would occur, has come to pass with our military now adding missions such as capturing indicted war criminals, seizing and controlling broadcast facilities. 
U.S. commanders of NATO have stated on several occasions, in accordance with the Dayton peace accords, the principal responsibility for apprehending war criminals would be the parties themselves. 
Mr. President, Secretaries of Defense and Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs have said throughout this 3-year period that setting a deadline is a good thing. But on December 19, 1997, President Clinton finally said he had misjudged the mission and he was committing the U.S. military to an open-ended mission which would only end when certain unnamed, concrete benchmarks had been accomplished. 
Since then, we have seen the benchmarks, but they are not very concrete. I introduced a resolution of disapproval for this mission to Bosnia in November 1995. It was narrowly defeated, by three votes. Many of my colleagues specifically said they voted against that resolution only after receiving solid assurances from the administration regarding the length and cost of the deployment. 
The mission is now in its third year, and the President is saying there is no end in sight. 
Mr. President, unless Congress exercises our constitutional responsibility, we are going to see an unending mission where there are no clear goals and there is no exit strategy. 
I am second to none in appreciating the great work that our military has done in Bosnia. I have been there five times. I have met with the troops. Their courage, their dedication, their professionalism have permitted a separation of the belligerent parties. 
There has been a significant reduction in the violence and suffering in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. They have accomplished every mission they have been given, and they have done it in exemplary fashion. But, Mr. President, the administration keeps moving the goalposts. Now we have had forces in Bosnia for 3 years, we have spent $8 billion of our taxpayers' money, and now we see the President expanding the mission without coming to Congress first. 
My resolution today says that Congress is expressing its concern and opposition to the policy of the President that has resulted in this open-ended deployment without the prior authorization of Congress and urges the President to work with our European allies to set an orderly transition so that American troops can leave by January 1, 1999. 
Mr. President, I think my 5 minutes are up. I want to ask that others be allowed to speak. I hope Senator Byrd is going to be able to speak, and certainly Senator Feingold. I do have some closing remarks, but I would like to yield at this time.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I so appreciate the great leadership of the Senator from West Virginia. He understands better than any Member of this body the role of Congress in sending our troops into foreign conflicts or into harm's way anywhere overseas. He understands and he has spoken eloquently about not only our role but our responsibility. 
He well knows that the Founders who wrote the Constitution of the United States had a model. They had a model of a king. The king was able to declare war and implement it. The king held the purse strings and the power. Our Founders very clearly said, `We are not going to do that.' And in the Constitution they provided that there would be a dual power. The President can commit troops; only Congress can declare war. 
That is what our Constitution says, and if one side falls down on their responsibility, then we have an unlimited power in the President. That is not the American way; furthermore, it is a dangerous precedent. Congress must stand for its responsibility to make sure that if our troops are going into harm's way, if our taxpayers are going to spend $3 billion a year on a mission overseas, Congress must authorize it, and we do it with the power of the purse, which is the appropriations process. That is why we are standing here today, to serve notice to the President that we are not going to stand here for an unlimited commitment in Bosnia until we have a rationale for it, until the President comes to Congress and says, `Here is why we are doing this, here is the United States security interest, here is our responsibility as a superpower to our allies in NATO, and here is our exit strategy.' That is what the President must come to Congress to give--a responsible exit strategy. I think we could ask the President for that. We could ask the President to look again at the Dayton accord. Let's see how it goes and what can we do to have a better prospect for lasting peace, have a combined joint task force that would be led by Americans, but in which we would transition out at a specified time. Let's have an orderly transition and let our allies know up front what they can expect from us, so that we don't come on to a deadline and then have the President say to us, `Oh, but it would be irresponsible to leave right now.' It is irresponsible to leave right now because we haven't laid the groundwork for an honorable exit, and now is the time to do that. That is why we are talking about it today and why we will have, as part of our defense appropriations bill this year, a statement of purpose, which we hope the President will give us, that will include an honorable exit strategy. We can do it if we start now. We can work with the President toward this honorable exit, and we can go back to our constitutional responsibility to make sure that the President presents a mission before he sends our troops into harm's way, and that the President makes sure that he provides for the funding when it doesn't take from our readiness and the quality of life of the troops that we have all over the world for missions that only the United States can fulfill and for which we must remain ready. 
Mr. President, that is the responsibility of Congress. That is what my amendment would do today. Mr. President, I am going to withdraw this amendment because the chairman of the committee and the majority leader have given us a time certain when we can vote on a policy statement by this Congress which will have the force of law, and I hope the President will work with us so that we can agree on an honorable strategy that fulfills our commitment to our allies, that fulfills our responsibility to the world, that makes sure we have a United States security interest and provides for the payment for it, and last but certainly not least, an exit strategy that is honorable in line with the United States of America. 
Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am going to speak today on the very important responsibility that the U.S. Senate has in ratifying the addition to the NATO treaty. 
I am a strong believer in the Senate's constitutional obligation and responsibility to advise and consent on treaties. Generally speaking, I also believe we have an equally strong obligation and responsibility to oversee American foreign policy. In fact, I think too often in this body we simply acquiesce to the President--regardless of party--when it comes to these responsibilities. Members on both sides of the aisle too often interpret the authority the Constitution gives to the President to conduct foreign policy as somehow superior to the authority the same document gives to us to oversee, advise, and consent. 
Because the Framers of our Constitution were concerned about the unchecked power of the executive branch, they placed the responsibility to advise and consent on all treaties in the U.S. Senate. I have read the Federalist Papers. I have studied the Constitution and what went into making the Constitution of the United States. It was clear that the Framers of the Constitution were very concerned about the king they had just left. And they put power in the legislative branch of Government to make sure that a treaty that would obligate the United States would be well thought out and not something that would be easily given by our Chief Executive. Because of that responsibility, I find myself--and the Senate in general--facing a dilemma when it comes to the 
question of whether or not to expand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
On one side we have colleagues who strongly support the resolution of ratification. I respect their views, and I believe they are in the majority in this body. But throughout the course of the past few days of debate, I have heard some of those supporters speak out in an intemperate manner about the reservations other Members have raised. I have heard supporters say, in effect, that any reservation is a bad reservation, that the proposal to add these new members is moral and just and needs no further thought. We have been told that the United States owes these countries membership in NATO, and it has been implied that to question this assumption is to question the very merits of the cold war and NATO's role in winning that war. 
I was just a citizen during Desert Storm, and I watched intently the debate in the U.S. Senate on the resolution to approve sending our soldiers to Desert Storm. What struck me about that debate was that it was a wonderful debate, and it was what I thought the Senate would be and should be. It was Members speaking from the heart about what they believed their responsibilities were and how they would exercise those responsibilities in relation to what the President was asking them to do. I never heard one Member in that debate criticize another Member for having a different view. And I think that is what the Senate should be today as we debate NATO expansion. 
Many of us who have reservations about this proposal are strong supporters of NATO--I certainly am--and of American leadership within the alliance, because I think NATO is the best defense alliance that has ever been in the history of the world. I want to make sure that we preserve it. We understand, however, that there are many other places in the world where only the United States can and will lead. We cherish the role that NATO played in winning the cold war, and it is because of that commitment to support NATO that we take this responsibility to consider the ramifications of enlargement so seriously. 
Mr. President, many of us with reservations are not isolationists. Neither are we interventionists. We want to see the United States take its fair place in the world and its fair share of the responsibility, but we do not think it should be involved in every regional conflict, dissipating our strengths and endangering our role as a superpower capable of responding where no one else will. 
On the other side of the dilemma--in which many of us find ourselves, frankly--is the failure of the President of the United States to lead. While our colleagues who support NATO and support the enlargement vigorously oppose any reservations and conditions we may wish to debate, the fact is it was the President's responsibility as the executor of American foreign policy to negotiate these reservations and conditions. 
Instead, he all but promised the three countries under consideration--worthy countries--that their admission into the alliance was assured. He presented this to the Senate as a fait accompli, and now it is being suggested that any opposition or even reservation must be seen as isolationist or, as some colleagues in this body have suggested, as appeasement of the antidemocratic forces of the cold war. 
Mr. President, we have seen this approach to difficult foreign policy issues by the President before. In Bosnia, the President negotiated peace accords that required the involvement of tens of thousand of U.S. troops and then dared the Congress to oppose his decision to send those troops. More recently, in Iraq he sent tens of thousands of U.S. forces without having laid out any coherent mission. 
So what should the President have done? I think the responsibility of the President of the United States was to sit down with our NATO allies at the end of the cold war and say, `We won the cold war. Now let's talk about what is the biggest threat to our collective body, and let's address that threat.' 
What is the purpose of NATO? That should have been the first question. Given our victory in the cold war and the consolidation of freedom and democracy in the former Soviet bloc, what should we do that would enhance the security of Europe and look to the security threats to all of us in the future? What is the role of the United States in a revised strategic alliance? Does the United States need to be the glue that holds Europe together? Or is this the time to start encouraging our European allies to take more responsibility for their own continental security? I am not saying there is the answer before us, but I say this should be the question. 
The second thing the President should have done before we started talking about specific countries is establish the criteria for membership, having negotiated a new post-world-war strategic rationale, as he should have done. Then the President should have organized the allies to start thinking about the criteria for new members. It would have been better to set these qualifications before personalities were involved. 
No. 3, having adopted a new strategy on admission and identifying the country that could help NATO execute that strategy, the next step for the President would have been to establish the fair share of the United States of America. He would have made it clear to the allies exactly what it is the United States would bear, mindful ever of the reality that we already pay for 25 percent of NATO's common costs. He would have discussed with the allies the amounts the United States already spends disproportionately to maintain the remainder of power in Asia and in the Middle East. He would have recounted those early debates in the United States about NATO membership 50 years ago when the Senate and President Truman agreed that the United States commitment could not continue at such levels forever if we were to maintain the capability of responding elsewhere in the world. 
It was President Truman who was thinking ahead at the time with the Congress of the United States and realized that there were limitations which must be addressed for the long term. 
Fourth. With a new strategic rationale, a new mission, new members identified and reasonable cost sharing, the President should then have established some mechanism to ensure that NATO was not importing into the alliance the border, ethnic or religious disputes that have riven Europe for centuries. He would have pointed to the ongoing conflict in the Balkans, the longstanding conflict between Greece and Turkey and seen the opportunity to leverage our allies' desire for NATO enlargement into a formal process of dispute resolution that would be well understood and accepted by all members present and future. Such a process would prevent the United States and other NATO allies from having to honor mutual defense commitments required by the alliance in the event of border or other conflicts that are not worthy of the alliance's involvement. 
We all know that this has not happened. Instead, the President has presented to us a proposal to add new members to the alliance--nothing more, nothing less. We know nothing about what it will cost the United States. The administration's own estimates have varied wildly. They are somewhere between $400 million and $125 billion. We are not considering an updated, new strategic rationale for the NATO alliance. We are not considering standard criteria for membership for other countries to have a precedent. We are not considering how the expanded alliance will handle future conflicts among members or between members and nonmembers. 
To put it simply, we are today debating who and when, and we should be debating how and why. 
That is the crux of my problem with this process. So it is left to the Senate to answer these questions and provide this definition. I commend the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, my friend, the senior Senator from North Carolina. He tried to do this work in his committee. He has established some good conditions and reporting requirements that are in the proposal before the Senate today. But because the President put the cart before the horse, we are facing a terrible dilemma. We are trying to put the criteria in place on the Senate floor that should have been negotiated before invitations were issued. 
So where are we now? We are considering three wonderful countries, and we are talking about the criteria and the cost and the new mission in the context of whether we would take these wonderful countries into NATO. I do not like to be faced with a dilemma of voting against these countries, the hopes of which have been raised to such high expectations. I am affected by that dilemma because every one of these countries has wonderful people who are trying very hard for democracy and a free economic system. I want to support these countries. I want to support NATO enlargement. The key for me is whether we can set responsible conditions that should have been set before we ever got into invitations for membership. 
I hope I will be able to do it because I hope the Senate will act in a responsible manner and do what the President should have done, and that is provide for the mission of a post-cold-war NATO, look at the fair share that America should put into European security, establish a border resolution process for disputes, and make sure that the criteria are set so that we will not raise false hopes or no hopes from other countries that will be seeking membership. 
Let us talk about where we are now for our own security interests. Our defense resources are being stretched to the limit. We are leading all over the globe. We have tens of thousands of U.S. forces in Asia. We have thousands in Korea. We have thousands in Bosnia, with thousands more backing them up. I have already mentioned the Middle East where it seems only the United States is able to lead in that vital area. 
While these obligations have grown since the cold war, the forces we have to meet them have decreased. In fact, defense 
spending has declined by 40 percent in real terms since the peak in 1985. Our ability to modernize and prepare those forces for the 21st century threat has been mortgaged against today's more urgent, though ultimately less important, priorities. 
Regardless of the cost, our intention to add security obligations seems to contradict the reality of declining defense budgets and the general post-cold-war retrenchment that is taking place in all of the Western democracies. French President Jacques Chirac has already flatly declared that France does not intend to raise its contribution to NATO because of the cost of enlargement. 
It seems fitting that we are discussing these issues even as we are preparing to approve an additional $1/2 billion to the ongoing U.S. mission in Bosnia. It is a warning about cost estimates and reality. This administration estimated the cost of the operation in Bosnia at less than $2 billion. Recently, Secretary of Defense Cohen acknowledged that we are approaching $8 billion, and now our mission has no withdrawal date so there is no limit. 
Mr. President, we are drawing $8 billion out of a shrinking defense budget, and we are having trouble recruiting in the Army, and we are having trouble keeping our F-16's in parts. What are we thinking? Have we looked at the big picture here? So this is why I and other Members are going to try to impose cost containment on the expansion of NATO. It is long past time that we tried to establish somewhat more equity between the amount we spend and the amount our allies spend to defend their countries. Right now, the United States spends nearly 4 percent of our gross national product on defense. Our allies spend an average of 2.5 percent. In NATO, we bear about 25 percent of the common costs. Our next closest ally spends 18 percent. So we will be introducing several amendments to establish equity for our fair share of NATO. We want to pay our fair share, but I am not sure we are there yet. 
I am also concerned about the question of collective security. In an era when border and ethnic disputes may be on the rise, we obviously need to look at the example of the Balkans to see what could happen with the United States pledging, as we have in NATO, to consider an attack on an ally as an attack on the United States of America. 
I am aware that the President and the Secretary of State have assured us that the very promise of NATO enlargement has served to hasten resolution of many longstanding disputes. Certainly, it seems that Hungary has worked quite hard to reach an agreement with Romania regarding the ethnic minorities and borders, and there are other good examples. 
However, NATO is not a stakeholder in that resolution. Should the alliance expand to include Hungary as a member and should Hungary's agreement with Romania break down, for whatever reason, we would face a significant problem of alliance management as we work to resolve the dispute. Frankly, we have seen the burden imposed on the alliance by the ongoing dispute of Greece and Turkey. It makes little sense to pass up this opportunity to fix this problem. 
So I have an amendment that will require the U.S. representative at NATO to enter into discussions with our allies on establishing such a process. My proposal for doing so would be for the North Atlantic Council to establish a formal mechanism for resolving disputes. There are a variety of approaches to do this. I am just going to suggest one to be like that used in American labor disputes. If such a process were adopted by the North Atlantic Council, countries would have the opportunity to resolve the dispute among themselves in this way. If by a certain date the parties cannot resolve the dispute, the North Atlantic Council could implement the dispute resolution mechanism. Each disputant would select a NATO country to represent it. The two representative members would together select a third member. These three NATO members could then form a dispute resolution council to consider the matter and help negotiate a settlement. Once a settlement is established, the disputants would have a specific 
period to accept or reject it and conduct the bilateral diplomacy needed to ratify it according to each country's laws. If the dispute resolution council's negotiated settlement is rejected, the rejecting disputant would forfeit their article 5 collective security protection. 
I have discussed this process, or something similar to it, with the Foreign Ministers of the three prospective allies. Their responses were positive. Their only question was that they wanted to ensure they would not be treated differently from present members of the alliance. That is a fair statement, and I agree with them. It should apply to present and future members. This is an opportunity to help the situation we face now and for any future developments we may not see on the horizon. 
There are other ways that we can improve the resolution before us. NATO needs a new strategic rationale. We must ask the question, Why do we have this great alliance in the post-cold-war era? What should be the goal for future alliance in Europe? What is our collective strategic need? And what is our threat? How does expanding the alliance help us with other priorities such as deterring the spread and use of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction? We are putting the cart before the horse by adding new members to the alliance without first answering the question as to what those members will be asked to do and what purpose the alliance serves for the future. 
We have a golden opportunity to recreate this remarkable alliance in ways that were not possible when it was forged in the crucible of the cold war. If we miss this opportunity, we could sow seeds for the eventual demise of the alliance if it loses its focus and becomes mired in all manner of regional disputes. We should not be debating who and when. We should be debating how and why. 
Mr. President, I take very seriously my responsibilities as a Member of the Senate to do what is best for America, what is best for our present troops that are protecting our security and the security of generations to come. How we approach our obligation to European security is a key part of the future security of the United States. We must establish our place in the world, our responsibilities in the world and make sure that we can cover those responsibilities with the strength and integrity that our word as the greatest superpower in the world should have. If we do this on a piecemeal basis, without laying the groundwork for the strength of this alliance, we could risk losing the alliance in the long term and we could risk losing the strength of America. I will not allow that to happen without at least speaking for what I think would maintain the place for America in the world, the strength of our country, and making sure that we have the ability to be the beacon for what is the best of people and that we have the strength to back it up. Our decision on the way we approach this alliance, this treaty, and the future of this alliance is key to the future of America. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume consideration of NATO expansion and its treaty, with amendments to the resolution of ratification being offered throughout the day. 
As previously stated, any Senators with amendments are encouraged to contact the managers of the treaty with their amendments. As earlier stated, it is hoped that the Senate will be able to make considerable progress on the treaty today. 
In addition, the Senate may consider any other legislative or executive business cleared for Senate action. 
As previously announced, no rollcall votes will occur during today's session. The next vote will occur at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, hopefully in relation to an amendment to the NATO treaty. Also, the second cloture vote in connection with the Coverdell A+ bill has been postponed, to occur on Tuesday, March 24, in an effort to work on an agreement towards orderly handling of that bill. Therefore, a second cloture vote will occur on the Coverdell A+ bill on Tuesday, if an agreement cannot be reached in the meantime.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to say that we have taken, or are in the process of taking, one major step toward more tax relief for the hard-working American family. The budget resolution, which is being marked up as we speak right now, will allow for $30 billion in tax relief for the hard-working Americans. 
This $30 billion is not nearly enough. I hope that we will be able to expand the $30 billion. But, at least it recognizes that we need to keep on the same course that we started last year, and that is giving back to the American people more of the money they earn so they can decide how they want to spend it, rather than sending it to Washington and letting somebody here decide what is best for their families. That is what we are trying to do in this Congress. We are trying to give more of the money that people earn back to them. And $30 billion will not do it, but at least that is a beginning. It is a beginning for new tax cuts that we would propose over the next 5 years. 
I am very pleased to say that both Congressman Archer, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Senator Roth, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, both of whom will be responsible for setting the priorities in tax cuts, have said their first priority is the marriage penalty tax. I am very pleased that Senator Faircloth and I are working on a bill that will provide that relief. There is a Faircloth-Hutchison bill that allows people to put their money together and split it in half. There is a Hutchison-Faircloth bill that will allow people to file as single or married, whichever is best for them. We want the hard-working young couple that gets married not to have to pay a penalty. 
Let me just give you an example that is a true one. A rookie policeman in the city of Houston, TX, makes around $30,000 a year. He marries a Pasadena School District schoolteacher who makes about $28,000 a year. When they get married, they will owe almost $1,000 in additional taxes. Mr. President, we think that is wrong. We do not think that Americans should have to choose between love and money. We do not think that young couples who are getting married, who want to have their first home, who want to buy that new car, should have to give more money to Uncle Sam because they decided to get married and start their family. That is not the American dream. So we are going to try to do something about it. 
I want to commend Senator Faircloth from North Carolina, because he took the early lead on this. He and I have been working together to eliminate the marriage penalty tax once and for all. I am very pleased that Senator Roth and Bill Archer, from Texas, who understands this issue--have said this is a first priority. If we can give this relief to that young couple that gets married, they will be able to perhaps put that money aside for a downpayment on their first home, or perhaps a downpayment on a new car. Rather than sending that money to Washington for the government to decide how they should spend it, we need to let couples keep that money they earn, which in many cases could equal a couple of car payments. 
So, $30 billion is not quite enough. The Joint Tax Committee says that it would be roughly $110 billion over 5 years that would be taken out of the Government coffers to repeal the marriage penalty. We are going to have to keep working to look for either a budget surplus or more money that could be set aside, or we may have to phase that in. But the bottom line is this is one step toward the right thing to do. It is one step more in the direction of giving more tax relief to that young couple that decides to get married, who are in entry-level positions, just starting their lives together, and we are going to make that happen. If we have to do it by phasing it in, we will do it; if we have to do it by finding more money, we will do it, because we believe it is the right thing to do. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor to the Senator from North Carolina, who is a cosponsor with me of both of the bills that would give tax relief to that young couple who should not have to choose between love and money.

 Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, yesterday, I introduced, on behalf of our Nation's charitable organizations, the IRA Rollover to Charity Act. It will allow donors to roll assets in an IRA to a charity or a deferred charitable gift plan. The effect would be to unlock certain taxable income and allow individuals to choose to direct personal resources to charitable causes penalty-free. 
Under my proposal, a person who has reached age 59 1/2 will be allowed to move assets penalty-free from an IRA directly to charity or into a qualifying deferred charitable gift plan--e.g. charitable remainder trust, pooled income funds and gift annuities. In the latter case the donor would be able to receive an income stream from the retirement plan assets that would be taxed according to normal rules for those giving methods. Upon the death of the individual or the individual's spouse, the remainder would be transferred to charity. 
Recent studies show that assets of qualified retirement plans comprise a substantial part of the net worth of many professionals. The IRA Rollover to Charity Act lifts current law disincentives to this important source of charitable giving. IRA assets represent untaxed income and cannot be withdrawn without being subject to taxation in full at the time of withdrawal. As a result, if an IRA is transferred into a charitable remainder trust, donors are required to recognize all such income. Therefore, absent the changes called for in the legislation, the donor will have taxable income in the year the gift is funded. 
Mr. President, this bill will unleash an enormous resource for charities servicing cultural, educational, environmental, health-related, religious and humanitarian purposes. If passed, the bill could be a huge asset for charitable organizations and I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment. I think Senator D'Amato, Senator Sarbanes, and all of those who worked so hard, including especially Senator Domenici, for helping us find this money in the budget, should be commended, because there is no question that highways are the lifeline of our country. But there is a point at which in you cannot build enough freeways in our biggest cities to get rid of the congestion. This is especially happening in some of the States that have new emerging big cities that have not kept up with their infrastructure demands. 
Some of those cities are in my State of Texas. We now have some of our biggest cities starting to try rail. And some are being successful. For instance, in Dallas, when people said, no one could get Dallasites out of their cars, nevertheless, people are leaving their cars to ride the new DART trains. It has been so successful--over an extended period of time--that they are going to try to get the extended DART lines out in a quicker timetable. 
So it is very important that we look at cities, not only like Dallas, but San Antonio, El Paso, Austin, and Fort Worth in my State. There are other States now that are looking at new transit systems--Colorado, Utah--Western States that have not had traffic problems before. 
The issue really is that in order to have a good infrastructure in our country, we must have more than one mode of transportation. Highways are the lifeline. But we also have airports and airplanes. We have buses. We have trains. Particularly in our urban areas, this is the only way we can address congestion. We cannot have a clean environment in a major city if we have cars stuck on freeways for hours at a time. We cannot have environmental purity throughout our States if we do not have some way to stop this congestion. 
The aesthetics. You cannot continue to build big spaghetti-bowl freeways and have any kind of aesthetics if you cannot get away from that. 
So I do think highways are our first line. And that is why the lion's share of the money is going to highways. But I think this amendment, that allows $5 billion additional for transit, half of which is earmarked for our new starts, recognizes that there are new emerging cities that are behind in their infrastructure improvements. This will give them the capability to do new starts in things like rail systems that will have, hopefully, the success of the Dallas DART train. Even Houston is beginning to look at this kind of rail system in a line from Katy to downtown where the freeway congestion is like a parking lot most of the day. 
These are things that I hope we can help to start. I hope that we can give incentives to some of our major big cities that have not had years and years and years of mass transit funding to be able to start thinking of new and innovative ways to have a cleaner environment, to stop the waste of money and time of congested traffic, and to have aesthetics that are also pleasing in a city. 
So these are the reasons that I am supporting this amendment. I think it is quite a good compromise. I think Senator D'Amato and Senator Domenici, along with Senator Sarbanes, and all of those who had the foresight to provide this extra money, are to be commended. And I do commend them. I hope my colleagues will recognize that this is an environmental vote, it is an anesthetic vote, it is a time-conserving vote, and it is a money-conserving vote. 
I hope that we will pass this and give our cities the chance. The locals match this Federal funding. It is not like it is all Federal funding. The local people should match. That is the right thing to do. But this does give them a very important start. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today Senator Rod Grams and I are introducing the half-and-half bill. We like to say half-and-half is more than just rich milk. We want to have the plan in place so if we, in fact, have a surplus, we will start doing the responsible thing for the people of our country. We believe half should go to debt reduction, to start paying down the $5 trillion debt, and half should go to tax relief for the hard-working American family. 
The Federal tax burden today is the greatest that it has been in the history of our country. In fact, 38.3 percent of the average family income is spent on taxes. That is a whale of a burden on people who are trying to raise children, trying to put them through college, and we are very pleased to try to bring down that tax burden with the half-and-half Tax Relief and Debt Reduction Act of 1998. 
This is what our bill does. First, it eliminates the marriage tax penalty by allowing couples to file as singles. Mr. President, 21 million American couples today pay an average of $1,400 more because they got married. You see behind me an example, and this is a real example. A first-year schoolteacher in Houston is paid $27,000. A rookie police officer in Houston, TX starts out at $29,698. After they get married, their tax burden will be $638.44 more, just because they got married. We do not think that is right. We do not believe that Americans should have to choose between love and money. We want an equitable and fair burden on the taxpayers of this country, and we do not think that people who get married, who are both working, should have to pay more taxes. 
The second thing our bill does is raise the income levels for the 15 and 28 percent tax brackets. For a single person, before he or she would move into the 28 percent bracket, it would go up to $35,000; a married couple, $50,000, and for a head of household it would be $40,000. The 28 percent bracket would be expanded for a single person to $71,050; a married couple at $109,950, and head of household $93,750 
It is very important that we start giving that relief at these lower income and middle income levels, and that is what this bill will do. 
The bill also repeals the 18-month capital gains holding period and makes it 12 months instead. It is a fact that our elderly people pay the most in capital gains taxes, and we think that is wrong. So we are going to try to reduce the holding period so our elderly people who may have to sell assets to live on will not be burdened any more than is absolutely necessary. 
We index capital gains taxes for inflation in our bill. Taxpayers should not have to pay a capital gains tax in assets that have increased in value simply due to inflation. Last year we started this process of by allowing an exemption of $500,000 in capital gains for the sale of a home. That's a big help to an elderly person. We want to make it even easier for them. 
We would cut the top estate tax rate from 55 percent to 28 percent. We believe estate taxes take away from the ability of Americans to realize the American dream of giving their children a better start. 
So we are trying to bring down the tax burden on the hard-working American family. We believe it is important that people be able to keep more of the money they earn, and 38 percent of the average American's pay, salary, going to taxes, is too much of a burden. So I am very pleased Senator Grams has come on as the major cosponsor of this bill. 
Mr. GRAMS: Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Hutchison in introducing legislation to lockbox any budget surplus for tax relief and national debt reduction. Given this week's budget surplus projections, the `Tax Relief and Debt Reduction Act of 1998' is the right legislation at the right time. 
Eighty-five years ago this week, the Internal Revenue Service began collecting the individual income tax, initiating 85 years of ever-increasing hardship for America's taxpaying families. Now, with a budget surplus closer and taxes at an all-time high, it is time that Washington let the taxpayers keep more of their own money, so that families can spend it meeting their own needs--whether that is child care, health insurance, clothing, or groceries. By dedicating half of any budget surplus to reducing the debt and the other half to family tax relief, Senator Hutchison's legislation protects the taxpayers of today while reducing the burden on the taxpayers of tomorrow. I commend her for her leadership on this timely issue. 
Mr. President, I would like to offer some perspective into why we are introducing the `Tax Relief and Debt Reduction Act" today. 
If it seems as though the media has a label for everyone these days, blame it on the era of the 15-second sound bite. At a point in history when many in the media consider brevity the most virtuous of virtues, journalists compete for our attention by whittling down their words into a kind of reporter's shorthand that, over time, becomes meaningless to news consumers. 
The shorthand gets especially muddied when it is applied to politics. Once a person enters public office, the media is quick to toss them a label--conservative or liberal, left wing or right wing. As political realities evolve, though, the labels have less and less relevance as time goes on. They become a cliche, no longer very useful in describing a political philosophy. 
I believe the American public has already moved beyond the media in breaking from the label mentality, and whether they consider it consciously, they have shifted their thinking from the old concept of liberal versus conservative to that of taxpayers versus big Government. Today, every action of the government is being evaluated by a standard that strikes home for the folks who work for a living, raise a family, and pay their taxes: does it benefit the taxpayers or does it benefit the Government? 
What we have discovered through this new way of thinking is that far too often, the Government is prospering at the expense of the taxpayers. Too much faith in Government equals less freedom for families and individuals. Dependency on Government equals less independence for the governed. And as the Government prospers, we have learned that big Government does not necessarily translate into better Government--it is just bigger Government, with more bureaucracy, paid for by higher taxes. 
Families today are taxed at the highest levels since World War II, with 38 percent of a typical family's budget going to pay taxes on the Federal, State, and local level. In nominal dollars, a two-income family is paying more just in taxes today than their paychecks totaled in 1977. That is nearly 50% more than they are spending for food, shelter, and clothing combined. 
Taxpayers do not mind paying taxes when they can see results. In local government, the results are obvious: clean streets, police cars on patrol, regular garbage pickup. On the Federal level, the results are much less evident. Families want to believe Washington is spending their tax dollars prudently, but when the evening newscasts focus repeatedly on the `fleecing of America,' they wonder: is the Government serving the taxpayers, or just serving itself? 
There is no question the Federal Government is growing bigger. Contrary to the claim of President Clinton in his State of the Union address that `we have the smallest Government in 35 years,' the Federal Government will spend more tax dollars in 1998 than it has in the history of this nation--$1.7 trillion. That is a 19 percent increase since the President took office in 1993, although inflation during that same period has risen less than 14 percent. 
The President would add thousands of new civilian federal employees and, according to an analysis of his budget by the Senate Budget Committee, $123 billion in new federal programs that would touch nearly every aspect of daily life, from our classrooms to our boardrooms to our bedrooms. 
To pay for all that new government, the President calls for boosting taxes by $115 billion over the next five years. That is a massive hike that would effectively wipe out the hard-fought $85 billion tax cut Americans won under last year's Taxpayer Relief Act. 
A big, expensive federal government is a bad deal for the taxpayers. It is an even worse deal for my fellow Minnesotans. A recent study conducted by the Northeast-Midwest Institute shows that Minnesota ranks 49th of 50 states in Federal dollars returned to the State. The people of Minnesota pay one of highest tax rates in the Nation, but only one other state receives less service in return from the Federal Government. 
According to the National Taxpayers Union, if Congress could roll federal domestic spending back to 1969 levels, a family of four would keep $9,000 a year more of its own money than it does today. Millions of families would pay no income tax at all. Unfortunately, tax-and-spend, not tax relief and streamlining, is the policy Washington now pursues. 
The most disturbing sign that the taxpayers are losing the `taxpayers versus big government' debate is the rush in Washington to spend a budget surplus that does not yet exist. If a surplus does develop, the Government has no claim on it because the Government did not generate it. A surplus will be borne of the sweat and hard work of the American people, and it therefore should be returned to the people as called for under the `Tax Relief and Debt Reduction Act of 1998.' 
When Washington serves itself instead of meeting the needs of its owners, the taxpayers, spending rises, taxes increase, responsibilities are neglected, and people begin to feel constricted by a Government they sense is deeply out of touch. At their urging, we have begun to turn the focus away from the smothering squeeze of big government toward families and new partnerships that move Washington from the center of the circle to another spoke along its hub. Where the Federal Government once held all the power, communities--local churches, nonprofit organizations, job providers, individual volunteers, and charities of all types--have stepped forward to work with neighbors to attack problems on the local level. 
Freedom for families also means giving families the freedom to spend more of their own dollars as they choose. We have taken steps in Washington to return more of that control to working Minnesotans and all working Americans, through tax relief, beginning with passage last year of the $500 per-child tax credit. 
Mr. President, the states offer us an excellent model of how we should use a future budget surplus. In recent years, many Republican governors cut taxes and shrank the size of their governments, and in the process turned budget deficits into surpluses. They are now using those surpluses to provide further tax relief. Take my own State of Minnesota, for example. When Governor Arne Carlson was elected to office in 1990, he inherited a deficit greater than $1.8 billion and a government that was spending 15 percent faster than the rate of inflation. Today, the State government has a $1.3 billion budget surplus. Now the Governor is using the surplus to give Minnesotans a property tax cut and an increase in the education homestead credit. Returning a future surplus to those who created it, the Nation's hardworking taxpayers, is the right way to use that surplus. 
I agree with President Clinton that saving Social Security is vitally important. But I believe we can save Social Security and provide tax relief simultaneously, if we have the political will to enact sound fiscal policies. The best way to save Social Security is to stop looting the Social Security surplus to fund general Government programs, return the borrowed surplus to the trust funds, and begin real reform to change the system from `paygo' to one that is prefunded. 
As the Federal Government has grown, it is ironic that it has grown further away from the one thing from which it derives its strength. And that is the people. In 1998, Congress and the President have the power to bring government closer to the people, to refocus its attention on serving the taxpayers, not fortifying itself. Yet, while Washington may have the power to change, does it have the resolve to change? I believe it does, because if we intend to reduce the growing burden awaiting the next generation of taxpayers, `Failure is not an option.' 
In closing, the Hutchison legislation would help move government toward the taxpayers and toward greater accountability, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  
Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Grams for taking a leadership role in this. He has been dedicated, since he was elected to the U.S. Senate, to sound fiscal policies. I think this bill is a sound approach to any surplus that we might have. I appreciate his cosponsorship. 
I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Ashcroft as a third original cosponsor of the bill.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, just to sum up. I think the Hutchison-Grams-Ashcroft half and half bill is sound policy. It is a responsible approach. If we, indeed, have worked hard and cut the deficits and will go toward a balanced budget even sooner than we thought, I think we create a great dilemma of what to do with the surplus. Because we have worked so hard and become more efficient, I hope we will take this opportunity not to backslide, not to go into more spending programs that will put us in the same situation we were before, but instead take the opportunity to start paying down the $5 trillion debt. 
So this would be an opportunity to start paying down the debt and put in the pockets of hard-working Americans more of the money they earn. Thirty-eight percent of a person's income is too much to be doling out to Government programs that you may or may not think are a good priority. 
So we are going to try to lessen that at the same time that we begin to pay down the debt so our children and grandchildren will not have to take from us that kind of burden. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the managers of the bill for allowing us to take this time to introduce the bill.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today to talk about a point of history as well. That is to commemorate, today, from 162 years ago, Texas Independence Day. 
Each year I look forward to March 2. This is a special day for Texans, a day that fills our hearts with pride. On this day, 162 years ago, a solemn convention of 54 men, including my great great grandfather Charles S. Taylor, met in the small settlement of Washington-on-the-Brazos. There they signed the Texas Declaration of Independence. The declaration stated: 
We, therefore . . . do hereby resolve and declare . . . that the people of Texas do now constitute a free, sovereign and independent republic . . . 
At the time, Texas was a remote territory of Mexico. It was hospitable only to the bravest and most determined of settlers. After declaring our independence, the founding delegates quickly wrote a constitution for the new born republic. Then they organized an interim government. 
As was the case when the American Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776, our declaration only pointed the way toward a goal. It would extract a price of enormous effort and great sacrifice. 
While the convention sat in Washington-on-the-Brazos, 6,000 Mexican troops were marching on the Alamo to challenge the newly created republic. Several days earlier, from the Alamo, Col. William Barrett Travis sent his immortal letter to the people of Texas--and to all Americans. He knew the Mexican Army was approaching. And he knew that he had only a very few men to help defend the San Antonio fortress. Colonel Travis wrote: 
Fellow citizens and compatriots: I am besieged by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna--I have sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours and have not lost a man--the enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword if the fort is taken--I have answered the demands with a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly from the wall--I shall never surrender or retreat. 
Then, I call on you in the name of liberty, of patriotism and of everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid, with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. 
If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible and die like a solder who never forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his country--Victory or Death. William Barret Travis, Lt. Col. Commander. 
What American, Texan or otherwise, can fail to be stirred by Col. Travis' resolve? In fact, Col. Travis' dire prediction came true--4-5,000 Mexican troops laid seize to the Alamo. In the battle that followed, 184 brave men died in a heroic but vain attempt to fend off Santa Anna's overwhelming army. but the Alamo was crucial in Tax independence. Because those heroes at the Alamo held out for so long, Santa Anna's forces were battered and diminished. 
Gen. Sam Houston gained the time he needed to devise a strategy to defeat Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto, just a month or so later, April 21, 1836. The Lone Star was visible on the horizon at last. 
We Texans continue to commemorate the heroic times during which we won our independence, when we existed as a republic and finally joined the Union. 
Each year, on March 2, there is a ceremony at Washington-on-the-Brazos State Park where there is a replica of the modest cabin where the 54 patriots laid down their lives and treasure for freedom. 
Each year, as close as possible to March 2, I read Colonel Travis' letter to my colleagues in the Senate, a tradition started by Senator John Tower. This is a reminder to them and to all of us of the pride Texans share in our history and in being the only State that came into the Union as a republic. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to continue the tradition that was started by Senator Tower because we do have a unique heritage in Texas where we did fight for our freedom. Having grown up in the family and hearing the stories of my great-great-grandfather, it was something that was ingrained in us--fighting for your freedom was something that you did. We did it for Texas and we have done it for America. 
I think it is very important that we remember the people who sacrificed, the 184 men who died at the Alamo, the men who died at Gilliard, who made it possible for us to win the battle of San Jacinto and become a nation which we were for 10 years before we entered the Union as a republic. 
Now we fly both flags proudly--the American flag and the Texas flag--over our capital. I am very pleased to once again commemorate our great heritage and history.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I also want to say I was here on the floor during the recent agreement that was made on the highway bill. I commend my fellow Senator, my colleague from Texas, Senator Gramm, for working with Senator Byrd in what I think is a very important accomplishment not just for my State but for all Americans. 
Many of us feel that our transportation infrastructure is the key to our continued economic viability in this country. Many of us have been very concerned that we have shortchanged that infrastructure by putting money in other areas. 
What Senator Gramm and what Senator Byrd did today was to assure that we are going to have the money that people pay in their gasoline taxes each day when they go to work, assure that it comes back in the form of a user fee to help ease the transportation congestion in our urban areas and to make it easier to access our rural areas in this country. 
I commend Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus for working with Senator Gramm and Senator Byrd to come out with a very fair agreement that will benefit everyone. I especially thank also Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee, for helping to make sure that would happen without busting the budget caps because that is also our responsibility as stewards of our Nation. 
I think we had a very important agreement, and I look forward to voting for this agreement tomorrow on the floor. I think everyone will be pleased that we are going to have the money that is paid every day by Americans, that 4.3-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax, go right where it should go, and that is to ease our transportation byways and highways and the transit systems that keep us from having congestion and environmental pollution in our cities.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. If the Senator from Rhode Island would yield, I am happy he mentioned the corridors, the trade corridors, that were also included in the recent agreement. 
As we have opened our trade with Mexico, it has caused a huge congestion on the NAFTA corridors that come through my State but also through other States that are on the border and also up into the rest of our country. 
I am very pleased you have allocated an extra amount for wear and tear because it will ease the congestion and stop some of the long delays that we are seeing at the border because we don't have enough bridges and gateways. This will help alleviate that and make it even easier to trade with our neighbor to the south.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the leadership that Senator Lott has provided in the ongoing discussions that we have had in Congress on the situation with Iraq. 
I was very pleased that in the 2 weeks previous to this, when the President came to consult with Congress, that Senator Lott stated that we needed a plan, that it was important that the President have, indeed, in an aftermath certainly the acknowledgment that there might be a retaliation, and asking the President to tell us what the response would be. I think this set in motion, on the part of the President and the President's advisers really the awareness and the reality of the situation--that it is not an immediate situation that is going to be set aside and not visited again. In fact, I think all the indicators point to the fact that we are going to revisit this again--that perhaps we have a reprieve, that we have a window of opportunity. And this window of opportunity should be taken to lay out a long-term strategy--a long-term strategy that would, once and for all, make clear what our policy is in dealing with Saddam Hussein. 
For whatever else you say about Saddam Hussein, his objectives are clear. He has been very clear in his actions and in his words that he intends to make weapons of mass destruction, that he intends to abuse his people to be able to keep them, that he does not intend to be part of the community of nations. And I think it is time that America be just as clear with Saddam Hussein as he has been with us and with the world. 
It crystallized I think for the American people a higher-stake universe--not the rabble rousing by the people who were protesting the war. They would protest the war, no matter what. The people who would protest the war for the integrity and the security of the United States are not the mainstream of America. But who was the mainstream of America? It is that veteran, who spoke with a cracked voice, who said, `I fought in a war. My son fought in a war.' And he asked the question that the American people and the Congress ask. And that is: What are you going to do? What is the plan? If you are going to put our troops in harm's way, are we going to have the guts to stick with it when the going gets tough? That was his question. He was so sincere. He captured the heart of America in that moment. And he captured the essence of what Congress has asked the President to do; that is, to submit a plan. If our troops are going into harm's way, if we are going to have an altercation with another country, let's be specific about what the mission is. 
The time has come to stop status quo with Saddam Hussein. The majority leader just mentioned that Saddam Hussein has quite a record. He plotted the assassination of our former President Bush. He used chemical weapons on his own people. He used chemical weapons on the Iranian people. He went into Kuwait, and tried to take over another country. This is not a man that we can deal with very easily. And business as usual has not worked for the last decade with Saddam Hussein. 
So I believe that the time has come for Congress and the President to work together to address this issue of Saddam Hussein. I hope the President will continue to consult with Congress, 
because I think in the last 2 weeks there has been a good understanding of where Congress is and where the American people are. Now is the time to put forth a plan. A group of our former Secretaries of State and Secretaries of Defense have made some suggestions. This is not to say that this is the only thing we could do. But certainly having a strategy is something that America has been able to do in the past, and should be able to do today. 
I think it is important that we look for another Iraqi Government that we could support--one that wants to be part of the community of nations. We could look at lifting sanctions in liberated areas of Iraq and communicate directly with the Iraqi people. Let them know the dangers of the chemical weapons that are being housed in their country and tell them there is another way. We want to help the Iraqi people. We want to give them the food and medicine for their children that we would like for them to have that every parent in the world wants for his or her children. 
We should target relief supplies to those Iraqi people who are in need. We need to delegitimize Saddam Hussein. And we need to be ready with enough troop force to make the threat and live up to it. That, if Saddam Hussein does not live up to this potential agreement that is laid before the Security Council today, we will be ready to act with force swiftly and go for what will be a destabilization of Saddam Hussein; that is, the military regime. 
That brings up another question. Are we ready to lead the forces we need for that kind of strength in the area of the Persian Gulf? Are we ready? That brings up the issue of what we are doing in other parts of the world. Is that bringing our forces down to the extent that we are not going to be able to do what we need in the Persian Gulf where everyone I think would agree we have a security interest? Right now we have some pretty alarming statistics. Last year the military had its worst recruiting year since 1979. The Army failed to meet its objectives to recruit infantry soldiers--the single most important specialty in the Army. More than 350 Air Force pilots turned down the $60,000 bonuses they would have received to reapply for the Air Force for 5 more years. 
That was a 29 percent acceptance rate. Mr. President, 59 percent of the pilots offered that bonus accepted last year and 81 percent in 1995. This is an alarming trend. This is something that we must address as we look at the issues of the use of our force and where they are. 
I come back to the need for a policy of when we are going to send American troops into harm's way. I think we must be very careful, because they are stretched so thin, that they are not going to be able to establish in the Persian Gulf a major presence in addition to our responsibilities in Korea and in Europe, and then with responsibilities that we have taken on for the United Nations in places like Haiti and Somalia. We have to have a policy. I would ask this administration to look very clearly at drawing down our readiness at the same time we are asking our troops to do more. 
So, these issues are before us. I think the administration should step back and use the window of opportunity to have a clear policy in Iraq. As we go into the discussion of Bosnia, I hope the President will also look at the fact that we have 500,000 fewer soldiers today than we did in Desert Storm, and that we are having a tough time keeping our good people in the military. Let's have a policy that will use our military when there is a U.S. security interest, but be very careful about dissipating our resources in places where we do not. That is causing us to lose many of our best people in the military. 
The young men and women who sign up to protect our freedom deserve the support of the U.S. Congress and the President--the support, the training, the quality of life, the equipment to do their job--because their job is protecting our freedom, and there can be nothing as important. 
I ask the administration to address these issues as we are looking at Iraq, as we are looking at Bosnia, as we are looking at our responsibilities in a global sense. Let's start acting like the superpower that we are and target our defense dollars for our readiness and our national security. Let's have policies where, when the United States speaks, everyone knows that we will be a reliable ally and a formidable enemy.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the resolution to override this line-item veto. I have heard the argument both philosophically about not overriding the President and on the specifics, and I am not persuaded in either case because I supported the line-item veto. I see absolutely no inconsistency in supporting the line-item veto and supporting this override because that is exactly what was intended by the line-item 
veto in the first place. It was to let the President have a chance to cut projects that he considered inconsequential or not necessary, and Congress reserved the right, as it always does, to override a President's veto by two-thirds vote. It is a higher standard. I think this meets the test of the higher standard, because the President went back and looked at the line-item vetoes he had made and admitted he had made mistakes in his calculations. 
The Department of Defense also said that some of the information was erroneous. For instance, these projects are in the military 5-year plan. Many of these projects are very important for our military readiness. In fact, one of the specifics that was mentioned by the Senator from Arizona, the Fort Bliss ammunition storage facility, is necessary and will actually pay for itself because you won't have to pay for the transportation of ammunition 20 miles from a firing range into Fort Bliss. So you are going to save transportation costs and, most of all, you are going to have a safety factor that will be better because you are able to have the ammunition stored in and next to the firing range where it will be used. 
This is the end of a project that has already been started. So this is just one instance. I don't disagree with, perhaps, the other suggestions of the Senator from Arizona. I don't know much about that. I know that at Fort Bliss the ammunition storage facility is essential. In fact, I thought it was interesting that the President signed the bill for ammunition storage facilities in Europe. He signed the bill for facilities such as operations headquarters in Europe, and yet he vetoed those that were in the budget in the United States. So I think he has shown that he sees the importance of operational headquarters and the importance of ammunition storage facilities. I just think we need to have those at our bases where they are necessary and where they are in the 5-year plan in our military here. 
I think it is important, as we are testing the line-item veto in Congress--and it is already being tested in court--the test should be exactly what we are looking at today. It should be the importance of these projects where Congress has said in its budget submission to the President that they are a high priority. The military has given them a high priority, and I think Congress certainly should have the ability to add to the priorities. In fact, Congress has added to the military budget every year that I have been in Congress and that President has been in office. President Clinton cuts the military budget and Congress puts it back in because Congress values military spending. 
Congress believes that the readiness of our forces depends on many things, such as quality of life, pay raises, our military construction, our equipment being maintained. All of this is an issue between Congress and the President, and it is a legitimate issue. Congress has spoken. The President has spoken. Congress has the right under the line-item veto, with a two-thirds margin, to override the President and say these are in fact priorities. 
So I hope the President will understand that we have our set of priorities. We are going to fund the military. We are going to make the military a priority. This is our national security at stake, and we believe these projects meet the test. The Senate has a rigorous test. We don't even add in the Senate military budget a military construction project that isn't already in the Defense Department 5-year plan. We never do that. That is our standard. So it is not like we picked something out of the air that the military didn't think was important. It is in the military 5-year plan, and we believe that spending this money for military construction is part of readiness. As we have added equipment, training, salary increases, we are also adding military construction for the overall readiness of our troops. 
We cannot continue to add to the responsibility of our military and cut the spending for the military budget. We cannot do it. We are facing a crisis in Iraq, which we must meet, and I support the President sending troops to make sure that we shore up our situation in the Persian Gulf. I hope the President will give 
us a plan of action for the future there. We support that. But we can't take from military readiness accounts all over the world when we have a situation like we do in Iraq where we need to respond. That is why we are trying to plan for the future, and that is why it is important to override this line-item veto of the President, so that we can maintain that readiness. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I, too, want to commend our two leaders for working together on this very important issue. I think all of us believe that it is our responsibility, as the U.S. Senate, to work in a bipartisan way with the President of the United States on an issue as grave as attacking another country and sending our troops into harm's way. I believe the administration will work with this Congress and I believe we will have a comfort level that there is a plan and that our troops will be sent on a mission that is very clear. That is what this is all about. 
The message we are sending to Saddam Hussein today is clear: You may either join the community of nations, abide by the resolutions of the United Nations, or there will be serious consequences. I don't know anyone who disagrees with that proposition. 
We have often debated the importance of international arms control agreements, such as the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty among others. What is clear is that without the resolve of the international community to enforce these standards, they are meaningless. Saddam Hussein has threatened the peace in the Middle East before. His people have suffered mightily for it. But even at that time he did not deploy weapons of mass destruction. We cannot provide him a second chance. 
International inspectors have concluded that he is continuing to develop an arsenal of these horrible weapons. He has used them in the past, so why wouldn't we believe that he would use them again, unless he is stopped? Just to put this in perspective, when you talk about chemical weapons or biological weapons, someone may say, `So, what is that? Does that make that much difference? Is that really something that could harm the neighbors of Iraq, or harm the people of any other country?' 
Anthrax is one of these weapons. A few pounds--think of what that is. It's something that is about this big. A few pounds of anthrax could wipe out a city the size of Washington, DC. We know that Saddam Hussein has the capability to produce this type of weapon. We know he has Scud missiles, we have seen them. Put that on top of a Scud missile and what does that do to the security of the neighbors of Iraq? 
Chemical or biological agents could be introduced into the water supply of any city and kill thousands of people. That is the kind of weapon we are talking about. So, if you are talking about, is this really an issue? Is this something that we need to stop? I just ask you, if a few pounds of this kind of agent can kill the inhabitants of a city the size of Washington, DC, who in the world is safe, if someone is manufacturing these and has used them on innocent people before? 
The United States led in the gulf war. We will lead again. And we will do so with the support of the American people. We are going to stand against nuclear, chemical or biological weapons in the hands of someone so irresponsible as Saddam Hussein, who has a record that is known of killing innocent people. We look for support from the international community as we had it in Desert Storm, and as I hope we can count on for the future. 
We must not let there be a doubt of the resolve of the American people. Saddam Hussein must know that we speak with one voice. We need the resumption of inspections, for Saddam Hussein to show that he wants to be a part of the international community. Military force is justified as part of an overall strategy. Our leader has said that. What Congress will be looking for, what the American people will be looking for from the President and his advisers, is an overall strategy so we know what we are looking at, what our troops are going to be asked to do; so that we can provide our troops with all the means they need to do the job and the protection they need when they are in the field. 
I hope that part of an overall strategy will be the beginning of the communication directly with the people of Iraq, with the good and decent people who have fled the country, to say we want to support you and we want you to know that the weapons that are being held could be totally deadly to you, to your children, and to the people that live throughout the country of Iraq. What we want to do is make that a safe area so the people will be free and so they can join the community of nations for a lasting peace in the Middle East. Our forces are prepared. They will be capable of dealing a harsh lesson once again. I hope it will not be necessary. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my Congressman. The House of Representatives is paying tribute today to our Vietnam prisoners of war. It was 25 years ago this month that those brave men began returning home to America. 
Among those heroes was Sam Johnson. Sam was a prisoner 6 years 10 months 18 days and 23 hours, which he can tell you to this day. 
All of us who know Sam know he is a fighter. He was called `diehard' by his North Vietnamese captors. 
Sam was one of 11 prisoners whose total defiance to prison authority resulted in banishment to a high security prison that was dubbed `Alcatraz.' The prisoners were placed in tiny cubicles in an earthen-walled facility that was dug out of the center courtyard of the North Vietnam Ministry of Defense in downtown Hanoi. Sam and the other 10 wore leg irons and suffered from severe malnutrition. 
Sam's defiance continued to the end, until February 13, 1973, when Sam boarded a plane at Gia Lam Airport to return home. 
Our Nation recognized Sam Johnson's contributions by making him one of the most highly decorated aviators of his era. During Sam's military career, he was awarded two Silver Stars, two Legions of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, one Bronze Star with Valor, two Purple Hearts, four Air Medals, and three Outstanding Unit awards. 
Mr. President, I would like to note also that here in the Senate there are many heroes from among us from World War II, the Korean war and the war in Vietnam. 
Today, 25 years after the POWs in Vietnam began to come home, it is also appropriate to recall the sacrifice made by our own colleague, my good friend, John McCain. John returned from Vietnam after his own capture and imprisonment 25 years ago next month. 
Patriots like Senator John McCain and Congressman Sam Johnson remind us of what makes America great--honor, courage, and duty. They enrich the Congress and remind us every day of the important responsibility we have as stewards of the young men and women in our armed forces. As we prepare for a possible conflict in Iraq, I have no higher priority than that those troops will get everything they need to do the job if they are sent. 
As Americans we have many things for which to be thankful. But perhaps we should be most thankful for the brave Americans throughout our history who have fought the wars to keep America free. It is their sacrifice that has preserved democracy. It is their sense of patriotism and duty that Americans must always embrace if we are to remain free. Commemorating this 25th anniversary is one way that we will make sure that Americans do not forget the sacrifices that have been made for us to be able to stand here in this Senate Chamber and speak on an unfettered basis and openly and freely. 
I want to say that I am proud that Sam Johnson is my Congressman. I also want to pay tribute to his wife, Shirley. Shirley and Sam are friends of Ray's and mine, and have been for years. 
But Shirley is a hero, too. Sometimes we do not talk about those who were left home for 6 years to raise the children, to give them the hope and strength and love that both parents would normally give. It is to the Shirley Johnsons, also, that we owe a great debt of gratitude, because she was there never giving up, making sure that America never forgot that some were missing and some were imprisoned. She, too, should be commended today on this 25th anniversary. 
I am honored to serve with Sam Johnson and Senator John McCain. As we honor them, we make sure that those who came home know how much we appreciate them. And, most of all, we remember those who did not come home. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Ms. HUTCHISON. I agree with what the Senator from Connecticut is doing in laying this aside. I do think we need a process and procedure. I am on the Rules Committee. I will work with the Senator from Georgia and our leadership as well as the Democratic leadership. I would like to see us have a process in which all the views are represented and then we can go forward. And I pledge to the Senator from Connecticut my support.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair. 
I, too, thank the Senator from Georgia for getting the time in the Chamber to talk about the President's budget submission and some of the things that we hope Congress is willing to do in working with the budget that we have. I concur with my friend from Arizona who just spoke and, before that, my senior colleague from Texas who talked about the very clear choice we have in dealing with the budget issues. 
The clear choice is, do you believe that we should increase Government spending by $123 billion this year or do you think the hard-working American family should get back more of the money it has earned and worked for. And do you think we have a responsibility to our future generations to pay down the $5 trillion debt that has accumulated over the last 40 years in our Congress. 
That is the clear choice. I come down very strongly on the second choice. The choice should be that we would do what is responsible for ourselves and for future generations, and that is to pay one-half of any surplus we might have on the debt so that we start whittling it down to a reasonable, manageable size. We cannot turn over to our children and grandchildren a bill of $5 trillion, that if we are in a recession, will skyrocket their taxes in order to pay. The other half should go back to the people who earned it. I never cease to be amazed at the way people who want to have more Government spending talk about tax cuts. 
They talk about tax cuts in terms of what is it going to cost the Federal Government. I talk about tax cuts in terms of what is it going to cost the American family if we don't give back to them the money they worked so hard to earn, for them to decide what they would like to spend it for in their own families. That is the difference in framing the question. And I am for the hard-working American family. 
Most families in this country--in fact, the average family in this country pays 38 percent of what it earns in taxes. That is wrong. We do not need to have that much Federal Government encroachment into the pocketbooks of the American people. We do have responsibilities in Government, but we do not have to take such a chunk out of the hard-working American's pocketbook if we manage our taxes and our spending responsibly and if we are efficient in spending the taxpayer dollars. 
So I would just say that I think the President has gone on the wrong track when he says we are going to have a surplus and therefore I want to increase spending by $123 billion. He is mortgaging the future of our children and he is saying I want to spend today and let's not think about tomorrow. That is not what our responsibility is, as the stewards of our country and our Government. 
So I am hoping we will do the right thing. I am hoping that as we are looking at a level budget that we will also prioritize within that budget and I hope we will remember, on the eve of potential problems and conflicts in the Middle East--that we will remember one of the main roles of the Federal Government is to provide for the national defense. In fact, this budget does begin to stop the decline in spending for procurement in our national defense. It does provide for a 3.1 percent increase for our military personnel--well deserved. But it continues to decrease the personnel strength. In fact, in this year's budget it decreases another 43,000 in our troop strength from 1997 levels. We are already at the lowest levels this country has been since the Korean war. 
There was the assumption after the cold war that somehow the world was safer. But now, because we see escalating tensions in the Middle East, because we know the North Koreans continue to train and build up their military, we see the conflicts around the world and the potential conflicts--and it is clear the world is not a safe place from which we can retreat. 
So I hope we will look at this drawing down of our strength. From Desert Storm levels, we will be down half a million in troop strength, from roughly 2 million, drawing down under this budget request of the President to 1.4 million. I do not think that is responsible. In fact, at a time when the Army had its worst recruiting year since 1979, I do not think it would be prudent to put more responsibility on the thinning ranks of our troops who are leaving our armed services because of the overseas deployments. So, I am going to stand for the strength of our national defense, for that priority in our spending. I want to keep the other side, the increase in bureaucracy down, so our national defense stays up and so we can return to the taxpayers the hard-earned tax dollars that they deserve; and that we start paying down the debt. That would be my approach and I hope that is what Congress will do in the budget deliberations. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I asked for 30 minutes today because I think it is very important that we address an issue that will be coming before the Senate in the very near future. It is an issue that has been brought about by the President's pronouncement that he wants to keep our troops in Bosnia in an undefined mission for an undefined time. 
Mr. President, I think that would be a mistake for our 
country. I hope the Senate will focus on this issue. Indeed, I hope the American people will focus on this issue, because it is going to set a precedent that I think is very bad. 
I do not want to pull up stakes and leave Bosnia without doing it in a responsible way. I think America has that responsibility. But in fact many of us have asked the President to lay the groundwork with an established and clear mission that has a chance to succeed and a mission that has a finite term so that both our allies and any enemies of our cause would know exactly what to expect from America. But in fact both our allies and our adversaries could not possibly know what to expect from America because in fact America has said it is going to leave twice and we have not left. In fairness, we have not left because we have not laid a proper base to leave. 
What I am asking the President to consider and what I would ask the American people to consider is starting the process of an honorable and responsible approach to Bosnia which includes an honorable exit. 
Mr. President, we are looking at a time when our readiness is being called into question. In fact, if you look at all of the responsibilities that America has in the world, I think we are spending too much on Bosnia and therefore putting in jeopardy the security of the United States in the future and the future of our ability to respond to other places where America may have to respond even unilaterally. And, Mr. President, that is not what we should be doing. 
I think it is most important that America start with the issue of Bosnia, address it in the way that America should, and we must look at our overall responsibilities in the world. 
The Bosnia operation has already diverted nearly $8 billion from our national defense. A growing lament at the Pentagon among senior officers is that we are in danger of returning to the hollow military of the late 1970s. Let me list some of the indicators that demonstrate that our military is once again at risk. 
Last year, the military had its worst recruiting year since 1979. The Army failed to meet its objective to recruit infantry soldiers, the single most important specialty in the Army.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I thank the Senator from Georgia for letting us talk about this important issue, because I think we are getting to the crux of what Congress wants to do. I am glad to be able to address this issue today after the President's State of the Union Message because I was somewhat concerned that in his State of the Union message. The President seemed to throw aside any hope for tax cuts. That is a very important agenda that I have, and I think most Members of Congress have because we believe that hard-working American families should be able to keep more of the money they earn, not less. 
I want to outline what I think is the right approach, if we do in fact start seeing budget surpluses. I want to put forward the proposition that `half and half' is more than just a high-quality milk product. In fact, half and half is the right formula for the responsible spending of the surplus that we hope to see in our budget over the next 10 years. Half should go for paying down the debt. If we are going to be the responsible stewards of this country for our future generation, we must start whittling away the $5 trillion debt. We have worked hard in a bipartisan way in Congress and with the President to come to a balanced budget. We have done the hard work. To now fritter it away with new ideas for spending our hard-earned taxpayer dollars is the wrong thing to do at this time. 
So I think one-half should go towards paying down debt, so that we can say to our children we are going to give you at least as good a solid base as we had when we were growing up in this great country. The other half should go for direct tax cuts for the people who have earned this money. 
When I hear people on this floor talking about tax cuts, you can really tell the difference in the way they frame the question. The question asked by people who do not want tax cuts is `Well, now if we give these tax cuts, what is it going to cost the federal government?' That is the wrong question. It is not the government's money, it is the money of hard-working taxpayers. A tax cut lets them keep more of the money they earn. It is not robbing it from the Federal Government. It is letting the people who earn it keep it. 
So half and half I think is the right formula. 
I will be introducing legislation very quickly that would provide tax cuts, and it would do it in a descending order of priority so that we would never go over one-half of the budget surplus of that year. 
Here is what my tax bill would do. It would first eliminate the marriage tax penalty. People in our country should not have to choose between love and money. We value marriage. And the people who get hurt the most are the middle-income. The policeman who marries the school teacher will pay over $1,000 in taxes in a marriage tax penalty just because they got married. That is wrong, and I want to eliminate it. 
No. 2, I want to raise the level of income that people would start paying taxes at 15 percent and 28 percent. This helps the people who are paying the most. I want to raise that 15-percent tax on a single person which, in 1998 will kick in at $25,350. I want to raise that to $35,000 so that you would not go into that 15-percent bracket until you are single and earning $35,000. If 
you are married, it would be $50,000, up from $42,350. If you are the head of a household, it would be $40,000, up from $33,950. The 28-percent bracket, the next bracket, would start at $71,000 for a single person, up from $61,109, $109,950, for a couple, up from $102,000, and for a head of household, $93,000, up from $87,000. 
This just raises the point at which people would have to pay higher rates. It gives a break to those who are paying the biggest share, and that is the lower- and middle-income people of our country. 
No. 3, the bill will repeal the 18-month capital gains holding period and make it 12 months. I think 12 months is ample time for a capital gains tax to set in. And keep in mind that capital gains are more disproportionately paid by our elderly citizens. 
No. 4, in my proposal, I will index capital gains for inflation. This will be a tremendous help to elderly people because most of their income is investment income rather than earned income. We are indexing the personal exemption on earned income. Why not do it for those who are earning it through investment, as elderly people are? 
Finally, my bill will cut the top estate tax rate from 55 percent, to 28 percent. I don't like the estate tax at all because I think the American dream for over 200 years has been that you could come to this country, you could work harder, and you could give your children a better chance than you had. So I do not want the estate tax at all. But if we are going to have one, I think it should be lower so that people will be able to give their children a little bit better start than they had. 
This is a balanced tax-cut plan. It is not the only one that is good. I have heard many versions of tax-cut plans being put forward by my colleagues that I could easily support. But, I think the important point here is that most Americans, the average American family, pay 38.2 percent of their income in taxes. Mr. President, that is too much. And we want to change it, and it is a priority for this Congress. 
I thank the Senator from Georgia for letting us focus on this very important issue for strengthening the American family by letting them keep more of the money they work hard to earn. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleagues for passing the Mammography Quality Standards Act, assuring that national, uniform quality standards will be in place for this lifesaving, preventive procedure. 
Experts universally agree that mammography is one of the best ways to detect breast cancer early. Yet, statistics show that the majority of women who need mammograms are not getting them. Nearly 40 percent of women ages 40 to 49, 35 percent of women ages 50 to 64, and 46 percent of women 65 years of age and over have not received a mammogram in the past 2 years. With 44,000 women dying annually from breast cancer, one in three of these might be saved if her breast cancer is detected early. 
Since almost 10 percent of breast cancers are not detected by mammography, it's essential to remember breast self-examination and clinical screening as the other important early detection tools we have at our disposal. 
This was the first year that the National Cancer Institute joined the American Cancer Society and other breast cancer organizations in support of screening mammograms on a regular basis. Dr. Richard Klausner, NCI Director, announced in March that the mammography recommendations of the National Cancer Screening Board would be adopted by NCI. 
Dr. Klausner spoke movingly about NCI-conducted focus groups that found that many women are not aware that breast cancer risks increase with age and that most women who develop breast cancer have no family history of the disease. He is to be commended for launching a new education campaign featuring new breast health and mammogram fact booklets, and breast health information hotline and Internet website. 
The passage of the reauthorization of the Mammography Quality Standards Act dovetails nicely with these efforts. The original legislation passed in 1992 has been successful in bringing mammography screening facilities into compliance with a tough Federal standard. Patients can be assured that their mammography procedures and results are provided by qualified technical professionals and with annually inspected radiographic equipment and facilities. 
This reauthorization makes some needed improvements to existing law. Facilities are now required to inform the patient as well as the physician about the screening results, and patients may now obtain their original mammogram films and report. Consumers and physicians must now be advised of any mammography facility deficiencies, and both State and local government agencies are granted inspection authority. These improvements were recommended in a GAO report as ways to assure that this vital prevention program continues to protect the public health and address women's health needs. 
Last, I want to thank all the countless radiologists, radiologic technicians, and support workers who provide this very worthwhile service and make the time spent undertaking this procedure as pleasant as possible. These are the soldiers in our war against cancer, and their contributions are invaluable. I thank you all for your support.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to support, along with my distinguished colleagues, Senators Murray, Snowe, Landrieu, Feinstein, Boxer, Mikulski, Moseley-Braun, and Collins this concurrent resolution to grant recognition to the effort now underway to establish The Women's Museum: An Institute for the Future. 
This important museum, being sponsored by the Foundation for Women's Resources in Texas and to be completed in 2000 in Dallas, will appropriately be designated by this resolution as a national millennium project for the United States. While the resolution will not preclude other official events and activities commemorating the turn of the millennium, it will serve to highlight the contributions of women in our Nation and world and how those contributions promise to continue to expand and evolve into the next century and millennium. The Women's Museum: An Institute for the Future will become a focal point for this recognition and appreciation of the role of women in our lives and culture and in commerce, politics, art, music, the sciences, and virtually every other field of endeavor. 
Mr. President, I am especially excited about the tremendous potential of this museum to educate all people, particularly young women and girls, about the growing opportunities women have today--opportunities that were only dreams a few decades ago. These visitors to the museum will have the opportunity to learn about the past, present, and potential future lives and accomplishments of women, using a variety of traditional and innovative exhibits and interactive experiences. Moreover, the museum will serve as a center where people may gather to discuss and research the history and trends of issues affecting women. 
The museum will be housed in the historic Texas State Fair Coliseum, located on the grounds of Fair Park in Dallas, which receives over six million visitors a year and is already home to a host of cultural and artistic attractions. The Women's Museum: An Institute for the Future will be an exciting addition to this state and national asset, and I am confident will continue to attract the enthusiastic support of governments, individuals, and corporations across the nation and across the world. It is my hope that this concurrent resolution will help focus even more attention on this effort to acknowledge and understand the virtually limitless potential of women in our society.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to say that what Senator McCain said is absolutely true. I think it is fairly clear from his comments that he is not a fan of Amtrak. But as the chairman of the committee, he worked with all of us who do care about Amtrak, who do want passenger rail for our country, to try to give Amtrak a chance to succeed. I think all of us have come together on a bill that will give Amtrak a chance to succeed and will also make Amtrak accountable. That is what Senator McCain is looking for and that is what all of us hope will happen. 
In fact, Senator Lott, the majority leader, who has worked on this for, as he said, 3 years--he was the Surface Transportation Subcommittee chairman before I took that position, before he became majority leader--Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, Senator Breaux, Senator Kerry, all contributed greatly to a very hard-fought compromise. Because, of course, we are making huge changes in the law as it affects Amtrak and passenger rail in our country. Anything that makes this many changes, of course, could not be done easily. It took the labor groups, it took the trial lawyer groups to come together and work with us, along with Senators such as Senator McCain who want accountability. So I think we have come together in a bill that will give Amtrak a chance. It is not a slam dunk. It is not an assured success. This is the first step in many steps that must be made for Amtrak to be able to operate without subsidies in the future. 
What this bill has done is authorize the subsidies over the next 5 years that eventually will phase out. At the end of 5 years there will not be operational subsidies by the taxpayers of Amtrak. We have all agreed to that. That is why it was essential that we have reforms, so that Amtrak could be more efficient, so it could compete in the marketplace, so that it could have a passenger operation that would be much improved and, hopefully, bring more people into the system so it could operate without the subsidies. In addition, the $2.3 billion in infrastructure improvements, which are necessary both for the efficient operations and for the higher technology trains that we hope they will be able to operate, is contingent on these reforms. I think it was very wise, in the budget reconciliation bill, that the $2.3 billion that would be put into investment in capital improvements would be tied to these very important reforms. Because without the reforms, Amtrak has no chance to succeed--none. With the reforms, it has a chance. That is what our bill today will give it. I would like to go through a few of the most important points of what we did today. 
First, some of the labor protections that were mandated by the Federal Government are now taken out of the law. The 6-year statutory severance benefits will now be in place for 180 days as they are negotiated at the bargaining table, after which they will be totally lifted from all negotiation and there will be no Federal mandates. In other words, today if a line goes out of business or Amtrak takes it off, those employees today would be entitled by Federal law to 6 years of severance pay. Most Americans do not have jobs that have 6-year termination agreements. In fact, when Amtrak first came into place, it was a different time. Today, these severance packages are about to break the system, and I think the unions realize that and they are willing to say we will put it on the negotiating table and we will let the free market reign. So that is the first thing we are doing. 
The second thing we are doing is taking the prohibition against any contracting out out of the law once again. It will be part of the contracts for the next 2 years, but it is on the negotiating table now so that Amtrak, if it sees that it can make efficiencies by contracting out certain services, will be able to do that in a negotiated framework. So that will be on the table as well. 
It is very important that Amtrak bring its labor costs into line because, in fact, if you look at other forms of transportation, the labor costs in passenger rail transportation are lopsided. For instance, no airline has more than 37 percent total labor expense, yet Amtrak is at 54 percent of its total expenses in labor. No competing passenger industry has similar protection rules that are mandated by the Federal Government. In fact, Greyhound drivers and mechanics, who might be laid off because of service discontinuances, are guaranteed 7 days' notice under union contracts; no statutory guarantee against contracting out. So I think if you are looking at transportation in its totality in our country, you have to have the ability to compete. So we have to have the ability at the bargaining table to bring these costs in line, if Amtrak is going to be a viable alternative form of transportation. 
Another major area that needed some limitations was liability. Our substitute bill provides for a global passenger liability cap of $200 million. I think this is very important. For any one accident there will be a cap, so Amtrak will be able to buy insurance. That is what we are trying to do, is have some sort of quantifiable limit so we will know what the costs would be in the most extreme circumstances. And Amtrak could buy insurance to cover that, hopefully at a reasonable cost. 
As Senator McCain mentioned, there is a trigger on this. There will be an Amtrak Reform Council appointed to monitor Amtrak's progress with these new reforms, to look at the 5-year glidepath that Amtrak is on, to try to get to the point that there will be no more taxpayer subsidies of Amtrak. This Amtrak Reform Council is going to look at the Amtrak operation and the reforms and see how Amtrak is doing. After 2 years they will submit a strategic plan for Amtrak, and they will also report to Congress if they just don't think Amtrak has a chance to make it, after which Congress will be able, then, to either implement the plan, the strategic plan that would be put forward, or pull the plug on Amtrak. 
These are accountability standards that I think are reasonable. Certainly we want to put good money into helping Amtrak succeed, but if it is going to be hopeless, we don't want to throw good money after bad. So I think the accountability is a very important part of this compromise. 
We also provide in this bill for interstate rail compacts, so that two States that have traffic that would warrant, perhaps, a joint effort toward rail transportation could come together, could pool their resources and provide for rail transportation in their States. I think that is a very important step, for our States to be able to form compacts, because that will add to the options of rail transportation. 
It also provides that Amtrak will have to give 180 days' notice if they are going to discontinue a route. The previous law required 90 days' notice. That is not enough time for a State to be able to step in and help Amtrak, especially if it's a State that has a legislature that only meets every other year and would have to make some emergency arrangements. 
So I think we have several new parts of the law that will help very much in giving Amtrak the ability to succeed and also in giving more options to our States to add to the rail passenger capabilities in our country. Because, you see, I think one of the reasons that Amtrak is not only viable but a very important part of an intermodal mobility system for our country is because cities are now going more and more into intracity rail systems. Even in southern States, in my State of Texas, now, in Dallas, Dallas has a rail train system that goes out of the Amtrak station. So I am very happy that the Texas Eagle Amtrak train will be able to start in Chicago, IL, come down through Missouri, through Arkansas, over through east Texas into Dallas and Fort Worth. People can get off the train in Dallas or Fort Worth and they can get on an intracity train and go all over the city of Dallas. They can go to the zoo, they can go to the museums, they can go out north where the commuting traffic is. They will be able eventually to go to the airport. 
So, as more cities are beginning to have rail transportation options, then the feeding in of Amtrak also provides more passengers for Amtrak and more mobility for the citizens of our country. I love the fact that you can go from Chicago all the way down through Texas to San Antonio and then get on another Amtrak train, the Sunset Limited, and go to Los Angeles or all the way over to Florida. 
These systems will provide vacation capabilities for people in our country to see the sights of America on a train. I think it is something that has been so successful in Europe through the years that it will also have a resurrection in America that will provide more opportunities for families to see this great country from a train and have that experience that we really almost lost in the last 25 or 30 years. 
So I think what we are doing today is not propping up a historic, old, antiquated type of transportation that we have known in the past in this country. That is not what we are doing today. What we are doing today is providing a new, vibrant option for rail transportation to be added to the air transportation that is so terrific in our country and the bus transportation and the automobiles and highways that provide mobility options for all kinds of people--people who can't drive and people who don't want to drive. People who don't live near airports would be able to go to a train station that is fed from buses from small communities all over our States, going into an Amtrak train station where someone can get off a bus in a very small town and get onto an Amtrak train and go into cities from Florida to California, from Illinois to Massachusetts, and all the way down to Texas. 
So I think it is a very exciting thing we are doing. That is why I have worked so hard with my colleagues, Senator Kerry, Senator Breaux, Senator Hollings and Senator McCain, to make this a reality, to give Amtrak a chance. Because if Amtrak can compete with the other kinds of transportation, I think it will not be a relic of the past but a very important part of an overall transportation system for the future for our country, for our children to have this experience, for our elderly people to have the mobility that train passenger systems can give. 
I am very excited that we have come to this agreement. I appreciate the bipartisan spirit in which this agreement has been made. 
I thank the Senators who are waiting to speak and I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts who was so helpful in working out this compromise. I think, as he said, a lot of people had to give something that they didn't want to give, which probably means that we did a fair compromise. Senator Breaux, who is also on the floor, was very much a part of this. Senator Hollings, who was here, I also thank. 
If there is no one else wishing to speak, then I would like to have third reading and then go to a vote, if that is possible.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader I announce this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10:30 a.m; following morning business, the leader hopes the Senate will be able to consider Amtrak reform under a short time agreement. In addition, the Senate is close to an agreement on the D.C. appropriations bill. Therefore, Members should be prepared to consider that legislation today. 
Also, the leader hopes that the Senate will be able to consider the FDA reform conference report during today's session. Unfortunately, it is looking like the Senate will need to be in session this weekend to complete work on the pending appropriations bills. Members will be notified as to the possible weekend schedule and necessary votes. 
Also, the Senate may consider any additional legislative or executive items that can be cleared for action. Therefore, Members can anticipate rollcall votes throughout today's session of the Senate and possibly into the evening. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to add my remarks to those of my senior colleague. 
We are so proud in Texas that President Bush is opening his library today. We are proud that he chose to do it in Texas because he had other home States that he could have chosen, but that he came to Texas where he had his roots, his business, and raised his family. It means a lot to us. 
Also, I think what it is going to add to the intellectual commitment to Texas A&M, the foreign policy commitment to Texas A&M, and to all Americans is going to be great. It is going to be a great contribution for foreign policy debates; for leaders to come together. I think it is going to provide a diversity of views and opinions that will certainly enlighten all of us. 
So, we are proud that the opening of the library is today. I know that through the years we will all be very thankful that President Bush has chosen to have a school and a place for people to discuss very important domestic and foreign policy issues. I know that he will provide a fine quality of opportunity for all of us to learn from. 
So I appreciate it. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask I be notified after 22 minutes because that is the time I will control. My senior colleague, Senator Gramm, will have the other 23 minutes. 
Mr. President, I want to say that I am one of the most prodefense people in this body and I think most of this bill is very good and very important. I am going to speak on the part of the bill that I think is very shortsighted and will, in fact, hurt our readiness in the future if it is not fixed. I will continue to urge the committee to work to fix it because I do believe that all of us want a stronger national defense and we want the taxpayer dollars to be spent wisely. In fact, passing this bill will waste billions of taxpayer dollars, and those aren't my figures. Those are the figures of the experts. 
So why would we do that? Let me first say that the points that were made by Senator Kempthorne and Senator Cleland can be met. I agree with them. It is most important that the pay and compensation issues, the health care issues, the military construction issues be addressed. In fact, a clean bill has been introduced that would cover those items, that if this bill is vetoed by the President--which I hope it will be, so it can be corrected--we can take care of those very important compensation, health and military construction issues, and that bill has been introduced. 
This can be worked out. It can be worked out for the good of everyone, for the good of the Department of Defense, for our men and women in the military and for the taxpayers of our country. 
I want to read from the Base Closing Commission recommendation. The Base Closing Commission recommended the closing of both Kelly Air Force Base and McClellan Air Force Base, but it did reserve the right of the Department of Defense to make the decision about where the work would be done and how it would be done. It says that `the workload would be moved to other depots, or to private sector commercial activities, as determined by the Department of Defense.' 
Now, what we are doing in the bill, if it is passed today, is taking that flexibility away from the Department of Defense. What we are saying is, you cannot have a level playing field, you cannot have real competition for the most cost savings and for the readiness issues in the maintenance of our equipment. This is a crucial issue, and it is not an issue that is just for McClellan Air Force Base or Kelly Air Force Base or California or Texas. This is an issue about how we are going to conserve the dollars that we spend on defense so that they can be spent for our troops, for the quality of life, and for the readiness that we must have to face the security threats to this country. 
The savings are absolutely--it has been proven--achievable, and it has been shown already by the most recent competition, the one that took place on the C-5, which saved $190 million on the cost of doing the maintenance of the C-5. This was won by a public depot against the private sector bidders that I had hoped would win. Nevertheless, I didn't win, but the taxpayers did, and the Department of Defense will save $190 million because we had the competition. 
In fact, private-sector companies that outsource frequently achieve cost savings of 20 to 30 percent. That is proven. If the Department of Defense could achieve similar savings by outsourcing $15 billion in annual depot maintenance, that would free up $2 billion a year for other purposes--$2 billion a year. Just think of it. Our operations in Bosnia cost us $3 billion a year. Most of that could be achieved with savings from efficiencies gotten with competition in the depots. That was proven within the last 2 months in the C-5 competition that was won by Warner-Robins. It was only because there was competition that these efficiencies were made. Otherwise, it would have been business as usual. Everything would have been done the same way. In fact, we would have paid $190 million more to do this work. 
One corporation, with much experience in commercial aircraft maintenance, has already looked at the engine maintenance work at Kelly. They have concluded that, by employing commercial-sector business practices, they can reduce the cost by over $1 billion over the life of the contract. They can reduce the amount of time necessary to repair engines by as much as 40 percent. So that is a readiness issue. And they can improve safety of flights through their process modifications. We all know that safety is of paramount importance when we are talking about our young men and women flying in the aircraft provided to them by the Department of Defense. So why wouldn't we bring this kind of expertise and savings into our military maintenance? I don't understand it. 
Look at the people who have spoken on this issue. Adm. William Owens, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, when he was going out of office, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee said: 
The world's largest business is 65 to 70 percent fixed cost, 35 percent variable cost. The variable cost translates to the war-fighting capability. The money is in the fixed costs, and that is what we've got to work on. We must work on the fixed costs, like maintenance. 
Dr. John White, Deputy Secretary of Defense, March 1996: 
Privatization provides substantial savings. Now as we go forward, we have a situation where we have to emphasize modernization. 
General Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, 1996: 
I believe we must go on with privatization, with outsourcing. We need your support to make the hard choices and to change it to make these initiatives work. I particularly ask for your support where changes in law are required. 
I don't think the general would want to have constraints on competition and privatization as we are seeing in the bill before us today. 
William Cohen, the present Secretary of Defense, June 18, 1997: 
The San Antonio and Sacramento workload involve thousands of highly trained workers and large, expensive equipment and facilities. This work is critical to the continued operation of national assets. To transfer all of these workloads without a competitive evaluation and risk assessment would be unwise, from a business perspective, and would involve a significant risk of disruption in mission performance and degradation in military readiness. 
Now, these are the people in charge of our military. They are talking about the importance of privatization, the option of privatization. They are saying, look, we are willing to live with fewer dollars and provide the security that we are supposed to provide to the people of America. But don't tie our hands. 
Let us have the option, let us have the ability to do this job with the options and flexibility we must have to put the dollars where we need them. And we are seeing the capability of saving $2 billion a year if we will allow full competition. 
What is Congress doing in the bill that is before us today? It is tying the hands of the people who are asking for our help in order to do the job we are asking them to do in the most efficient way. 
Mr. President, why would we do this? I can't understand it. We have heard quotes from the people on the military side. Now let me quote from a letter received today from the Industry Depot Coalition. These are the people who do the work. These are the people who have been in this business, who know what the cost savings can be, who provide the 20 to 30 percent cost savings when they do the work. They have written a letter to Senator Thurmond and Senator Levin. It says:  
The Industry Depot Coalition, comprised of eight national associations representing the breadth of the defense industry and thousands of American businesses, large and small, wishes to register, for the record, our concerns relative to the depot maintenance provisions that are contained in the FY98 national defense authorization bill. In so doing, we wish to raise with you a number of impacts we foresee resulting from the provisions, as well as our sincere hope that you will give serious consideration to making modifications in that language. 
They state as a primary concern: 
The legislation requires that the Secretary of Defense assign sufficient workload to public depots to ensure cost efficiency. However, the arbitrary assignment of workloads will not ensure efficiency. Efficiency can only be ensured through competition, innovative management initiatives, and the adaptation of commercial practices, none of which is adequately addressed in this legislation. 
In addition, we are concerned that the legislation's requirement that DOD have in-house capability to repair all new systems within four years of initial operating capability could result in DOD having to create and maintain redundant facilities and capabilities, even when doing so is neither cost-effective nor, in the judgment of the Department, necessary for the national defense. 
A second area of primary concern: 
The legislation places in statute competitive requirements that are at this time only to be applied to the proposed competition for the workloads at the Kelly and McClellan Air Logistic Centers. As believers in fair competition and equal treatment in all areas of competition, we simply cannot support a statutory requirement such as this one that places unique requirements on one category of bidders. 
Mr. President, we have heard from the industry, we have heard from the Department, we have heard from the military chiefs--they need the flexibility. They need the ability to be able to do the work in the most efficient way, and that is what we are trying to provide them. 
The bill before us today does not allow that competition. It does not allow a free and fair competition; it weights toward the public depots to such a great extent that even one of the greatest proponents of this language admits exactly what they want to do, and that is keep private bidders from bidding. 
I will just quote from the Daily Oklahoman, where the junior Senator from Oklahoma says: 
With the language in the bill before us, I think it is highly unlikely any contractor would want to bid on it. 
So they are trying to stifle competition, and I don't understand why the committee is letting them do this. I do not, in any way, challenge the motives of the committee. I know they want to do what is right. But I think they have not looked at the quote of the Senator from Oklahoma, who admits he is trying to put language in so that no one will bid. They are overlooking the Defense Industry Depot Coalition, who have done the work and know that they can do it more efficiently. They are overlooking the fact that, where private industry is doing maintenance, it has worked very well for the Department of Defense. One of the best examples of this was in Desert Storm, where we had much private maintenance that kept right up to the readiness requirements of the Department of Defense. 
Mr. President, all the evidence is against what is in this bill today; yet, everyone who is arguing for this bill seems to say that this is just one little issue; it is just one little issue that can save $2 billion a year--$2 billion a year. We could start deploying theater missile defense. We could pay for most of our operation in Bosnia with these savings. Why won't the committee work with us to make sure that it is not just the one narrow interest of people who do not want competition who are winning? That is why the President has said he is going to veto this bill. He has told the Members of Congress he is going to veto this bill, and he is right because he knows that, as he himself is trying to lower the defense costs to our country, he has to have the flexibility to do his job. He can't afford to let $2 billion lay on the table in inefficient operations because a few people don't want competition. The President has said he is going to veto the bill because he knows that it is wrong to stifle competition and waste taxpayer dollars when we need to provide for the readiness of our country. 
We are not talking about one State or one depot. We are talking about the readiness of our troops, and the quality of life for our troops. We are talking about doing a job with fewer dollars from our taxpayers but fulfilling our responsibility for the security of our country. 
How could we pass a bill that we know is going to waste $2 billion a year, according to the Department of Defense statistics? How could we do it? 
I urge the committee to work on this language and make it fair. I urge my colleagues to listen to the debate because, if you vote on the merits, we can fix this bill, and we can provide for competition. We are not asking for favors. We are not asking for anything more than a fair and level playing field. In fact, in my conversations with the Secretary of Defense and the Deputy Secretary of Defense, I said, `If you can answer one question for me, I will be for this bill because I like most of what is in it.' Answer one question. `Can you have a fair and open competition with the bill language as it is before the Senate today?' And the answer was `no.' The answer was no from the Deputy Secretary of Defense. That is the only question that matters. 
So when you hear people glossing over this issue as if it is some small thing, as if it is some parochial, minor issue, $2 billion of taxpayer money, $2 billion of readiness, $2 billion of quality of life for our troops, and $2 billion toward systems that will protect the security of our country, it is not parochial. 
I urge my colleagues to get engaged on this issue and do what is right. We still have time to pass a good armed services authorization bill that provides for health care, quality of life, pay raises, military construction, and free and fair competition for savings, for good jobs, for people who win on the merits--not through a fix. And the fix is in the bill. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I would like to ask that any balance of my time be given to Senator Gramm.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to speak in morning business about a bill that I believe we have an agreement to bring up at a later time, hopefully in the next few hours. It is a bill that we worked on for quite a long time. We will be talking about it again if we are able to bring it up tonight. But I wanted to get a head start, because I am such a believer in passenger rail transportation for our country. I think we are going to come to closure on an Amtrak reform bill that will allow Amtrak at least to have a chance to succeed. 
It is not a slam dunk and there is no question that a lot of work is yet to be done, but I think passenger rail in America will add mobility for people in this country who don't have other choices. We have a terrific aviation system and, in fact, there are Federal subsidies of our aviation system. There are Federal subsidies of our highway system. Highways, of course, provide the most flexible mobility for people. But trains can also add something for people who don't live near airports. 
I think we have a chance to do something that will allow for an intermodal system that will serve the best needs of our country, will be the best for our economy and also will have, I hope, an impact on tourism and transportation in this country. I think it opens up a whole new world if we can have a good, solid transportation system with passenger rail as part of it. 
We have worked in this bill to try to bring the labor protections into line so that, basically, we won't have protections that are above and beyond protections that most people have in this country. But we would leave it to the collective bargaining system that exists between Amtrak and its unions. I hope, when we have the agreement, to announce that the protections will be gone, and that collective bargaining will be a viable way to determine exactly what the people who work for our passenger railroad will have in the way of protections and also allow the railroad to be competitive, because, of course, if we are going to have a system that will survive. I think Congress has sent the very clear signal that the subsidies are going to be phased out. 
But in order for the subsidies to be phased out, we are going to try to give Amtrak a chance to succeed. 
So I am hopeful that in the next few hours or perhaps tomorrow, we will, in fact, have an agreement that we can announce and we will be able to pass this bill, send it to the House and send it to the President in very short order. 
Of course, everyone knows that there is money from the budget reconciliation agreement that would help on the infrastructure costs that we think will provide efficiencies for Amtrak and make it even more profitable and make it more attractive for people to be able to take high-speed trains, especially in the corridors where there is more density. But the $2.3 billion that has been set aside for the infrastructure depends on the reform bill going through. 
The reform bill includes taking away some of the protections that are required in law that should be instead agreed to at the bargaining table, having some liability limits that will allow Amtrak and the railroads to buy an insurance policy so that they will know what their liability potentials will be. 
We also have some protections for lines that are going to go out of existence. Right now there is a 90-day notice for a continuance of a line. I ran into a problem in my State of Texas in which they didn't have the ability to make decisions quickly. Many State legislatures only meet every other year. So if they have a notice of discontinuance of a line, they don't even have a chance to stand up and say, `Look, we will step in and try to help with some funding.' 
We need to give the States more time. We give them, in fact, 180 days notice, up from the 90 days notice, to give them a chance to address any kind of disruption in service that would affect their States. 
Second, we allow States to create interstate rail compacts. I think this is a very important possibility. It is not a mandate, of course, but it allows the States to come together. States that have commuters that go between two States can come together and form a compact and make a high-speed rail line that both States can contribute to. I think that should add to the ability to have more entrepreneurial spirit in our rail systems and perhaps allow States to work together for their mutual best interests. 
Third, we provide for accountability. In fact, we want an independent audit of Amtrak. We are going to have, thanks to Senator John McCain, an Amtrak reform council that is going to look at everything Amtrak is doing and determine if there are things they could do better, if there are ways they can give better and more efficient service. In fact, they will report to Congress on their independent recommendations and if they think Amtrak will be able to succeed if these recommendations, along with the reforms in this bill, are put into place. If not, Congress will face that prospect with informed choices and must act on them. 
I think we have a good opportunity here. I believe very much that Amtrak can contribute to the mobility of our country. 
It will give more citizens more access to be able to get on a train and, for example, go see a grandchild that they would not have an opportunity to do because they did not live in a city that has an airport. Or take Amtrak to connect to a city with a major airport, making Amtrak part of a connected intermodal system. These are just a few examples of how important it is and can be to our transportation system. 
So I am looking forward to discussing this bill further when the agreement is made and when we are able to actually act on the bill. But I wanted to give an outline of what we are looking at and what we are trying to do. I am hopeful that we will be able to do it in the very near future. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would enable the Canadian River Municipal Water Authority in Texas to use the Canadian River Project's water distribution system to transport water from sources other than those envisioned when the project was conceived nearly 50 years ago. 
The Canadian River Municipal Water Authority is a State agency which supplies water to over 500,000 citizens in 11 cities on the Texas high plains, including Lubbock and Amarillo. The water authority was created by the Texas Legislature which authorized it to contract with the Federal Government under Federal reclamation laws to build and develop the Canadian River Project, also known as Lake Meredith. While the operation and maintenance responsibilities of the project were transferred to the water authority, the Bureau of Reclamation retained the title and ownership of the project. 
The quality and supply of water from the Canadian River Project has not met the expectations of either the Bureau of Reclamation or the residents of the Texas high plains. Not only is their insufficient water to provide adequately for the needs of the communities Lake Meredith serves, but the water has high levels of salt. 
The Canadian River Municipal Water Authority has proposed to supplement the water in Lake Meredith with better quality groundwater from nearby aquifers. While this will not require any Federal funding, the Bureau of Reclamation has ill-conceived guidelines precluding nonproject water from flowing through their reservoirs or distribution systems. 
The legislation I am introducing today would allow the use of the Canadian River Project water distribution system to transport better quality water from the nearby aquifers which are outside the originally defined project scope. An environmental review, as required by law, would be conducted and completed within 90 days of enactment of this legislation. Congressman Mac Thornberry has introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives. 
The citizens of the Texas Panhandle have long suffered from insufficient water and poor water quality. The Bureau of Reclamation has worked with the water authority to develop a solution to the high salt content in the water. Local officials believe that one solution is to simply dilute the poor quality water with better quality water from the nearby aquifers. 
I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation quickly to meet the long-term water needs of many Texas Panhandle residents.

 Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize an outstanding American and Texan and to take note of his recent reappointment by President Clinton as a member of the Board of Directors of the Inter-American Foundation. 
Many in South Texas know Frank Yturria, and is wife, Mary, for the many years they have devoted to public service in Brownsville, TX, and throughout the Rio Grande Valley. As a leading voice for community improvement, Frank Yturria has served as an example of devotion to community. He and his wife have been involved in, and often led, numerous community projects in the south Rio Grande Valley. They are also pioneers in the effort to forge meaningful and productive relationships with private and public sector community leaders on the Mexican side of the border. 
Frank Yturria was first appointed in 1990 by President Bush to serve as chairman of the Board of Directors of the Inter-American Foundation, a development agency which promotes self-help community efforts in Latin America and the Caribbean. During his tenure, Frank Yturria instituted necessary reforms at the agency and insisted on program accountability. Because of his efforts and hard work, Frank Yturria is the first member of the Inter-American Foundation's Board of Directors to be reappointed by any President, Democrat or Republican. This reappointment by President Clinton clearly speaks volumes about Frank Yturria's contributions to his community, Texas, and to our Nation. I support his reappointment and wish him well as be continues to work for mutual friendship and prosperity of the United States and Latin America.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask that I be notified if I go over 5 minutes, which I don't expect to do. 
Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Stevens' putting this bill forward, along with Senator Burns, because I think this is exactly the way the process should work. I am, frankly, puzzled by some of my colleagues who are arguing that they aren't going to vote for this bill because they voted for the line-item veto. I voted for the line-item veto. This is exactly the way the process should work. The President vetoes, and the Congress does not take away its right to disagree with the President. The Congress has not taken away its right to override. In fact, that is part of the process. That is the way it is supposed to work. 
I don't accuse the President of partisanship. I think he has vetoed projects that he probably considers were not worthy in States and districts represented by Republicans and Democrats. But I do think the President is wrong. I think the President did not have the facts straight, and I think he has vetoed essential projects that the military has asked for, and I think we need to override this veto. In fact, the President vetoed these measures that are operational. Let me just read you a couple of examples: A repair of the launch facilities for missile systems in White Sands, NM; to expand ammunition supply facilities at Fort Bliss; consolidation of B-1B squadron operations facilities. 
These are projects the military has said are essential. They are in the military 5-year plan. The reason they weren't in the President's budget is because the President always comes in below Congress in the military budget. Congress believes the military has certain needs for our readiness, and Congress has increased the President's budget every year since I have been here. So it is not unusual that the President would not have in his budget some of the needs that Congress believes are essential. In fact, the President left in many military construction projects at NATO facilities that are exactly the same type of facilities that he vetoed on American bases. 
So I think this is exactly the kind of override that the process calls for. The President did not have his facts. The Department of Defense admits that their data was not up to date. The military asked for these projects. They are very important for readiness. And I think it is time for us to exercise our rights as Congress to override the President's veto, not because we think he was sinister in what he was trying to do but because we think he was wrong. 
It is Congress' prerogative to do this. I think it is important that we stand by the needs for the military that we have studied and that we believe are necessary, and that we stand by what we did and override the President's veto. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Madam President. I thank all of the Senators who are trying to do what is right in this bill. I hope very much that we will be able to come to an agreement that will allow free and fair competition. 
We are not asking for something special. We are not asking for an advantage. In fact, we have gone so far beyond where BRAC, the Base Closing Commission, was that I think we have gone overboard to allow the public depots to even compete, because the Base Closing Commission report in 1995 states specifically, and I am reading from the report: 
Therefore, the Commission recommends the following: Realign Kelly Air Force Base, including the Air Logistics Center, consolidate the workloads to other Department of Defense depots or to private sector commercial activities as is determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council. 
`As determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council.' By the law that this Congress passed in adopting the Base Closing Commission report in full, the Department of Defense has total discretion about whether to move the depot maintenance from Kelly and McClellan or whether to privatize it in place. The concept of competition came forward in the intervening years, and we all believe that is fair. Why shouldn't the public depots be able to compete? We think that is best for the taxpayers. 
So, of course, there we were trying to get a fair and level playing field so that the public depots could compete, so that there could be private competition in the depots that were closed, and that is what is right for this country. It is what is right for the Department of Defense, and it is what the Department of Defense wants. So we have added a huge measure of support for the public depots to be able to compete. 
In the last 2 years, I have heard Member after Member who represents a depot State saying, `There can't be fair competition between the public sector and the private sector.' In fact, the first competition that was held for part of the work that is now being done at Kelly went out for competition and, in fact, the bid was awarded to a public depot in Georgia. In fact, the Department of Defense personnel say that they don't think there was a level playing field in that bid. But nevertheless, the bid was won. 
Did the people of San Antonio stand up and whine about not getting the bid? No, they didn't. Even though they were told it wasn't fair, even though they were told that their bid was better, they did not whine about it because they believe that if they have a fair chance, they will be able to compete the next time. 
Now we have a bill before us that does not allow them to compete on a level playing field once again. At some point, there has to be integrity in the process. At some point, the people of San Antonio or the people of Sacramento must know that there is a fairness because the Base Closing Commission recommended that the Department of Defense be given the option of privatizing in place or going to a public depot. They have competed fair and square, and they have been beaten. They have been beaten. So you can have a fair competition. It has been shown. 
Who was the winner in the C-5 competition? It was the taxpayers of America, because there was competition. The taxpayers of America and the men and women in our military gained $190 million because that is the efficiency that would be gained because there was competition. 
If you take the other competitions that are left to go during the years, think of the hundreds of millions of dollars that will be available for a better quality of life for our men and women in the services, for the equipment and the technology that would protect them when they are in the field, and that would make our security of our shores intact. Those hundreds of millions will go for our national security rather than on wasted depot space.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Just to end my remarks, if you want to have the argument on fairness, I will just quote from the junior Senator from Oklahoma who says in the newspaper that the requirements that are in this bill put on contractors new language which would likely keep them from wanting to bid for the work. He says contractors will have to include in their bids millions of dollars in costs that weren't previously required. `I think it's highly unlikely any contractor would want to bid on it,' he said. 
Madam President, that is prima facie evidence that they are not looking for a level playing field. If they will sit down and work with us, we will provide the level playing field, the winners will be the taxpayers of America, the winners will be the Department of Defense, the winners will be our men and women in the 
military, and the winners will be the secure Americans who will have the hundreds of millions of dollars that competition will give us in national security rather than in Government waste. Thank you, Madam President.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. For many years, the United States has attempted to negotiate commonsense changes to this system with Japan. Japan also faced criticism from the European Union. However, no progress was made until earlier this year when the FMC voted to assess $100,000 fines against Japanese ocean carriers for each United States port call. It is reasonable for the United States to collect fines from the Japanese shipping lines. Before these fines were to be imposed, the Government of Japan agreed to make the necessary changes. The FMC judiciously gave Japan until August 1997 to work out these changes. When Japan failed to meet this generous deadline, the fines automatically went into effect. By last week, the Japanese ocean carriers had missed the FMC's deadline to pay the first $5 million in fines. Realizing that Japan would not follow through on its promise to fix its port system unless stronger measures were imposed, the FMC voted last week to deny the same Japanese ocean carriers entry to and exit from United States ports.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, Amtrak is at a crisis point. Actually, it faces two crises: a strike and the financial crisis brought about by failure to reform the railroad. Reform is a prerequisite to accessing the much-needed capital Congress provided for the railroad in the Balanced Budget bill. Congress decided when that bill was passed that it did not make sense to provide that money unless the railroad was able to act more like a business. I strongly support intercity passenger rail but believe that reform is essential before putting this major financial commitment in place. 
First, and most immediately, Amtrak is facing a possible national shut down because of an impasse between the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees (BMWE) and Amtrak over wages and work rules. At question is Amtrak's ability to pay for any increase in wages during the difficult financial times the railroad is currently going through. 
Using the Railway Labor Act, the President has named a Presidential Emergency Board to recommend a solution to the dispute. It concluded its investigation and made its recommendations. The parties are now in a 30 day `cooling off' period to consider the recommendations. If no agreement is reached by the end of this period, which falls on October 22nd, we could have a strike or a management `lockout of employees'. Either action would have the effect of shutting down all commuter operations, as well as other services, across the country. A strike would not be confined to the Northeast Corridor, but would affect all of the passengers in the entire Amtrak system. 
Amtrak's largest operations are in the Northeast Corridor, where a large number of commuter authorities between Washington, New York and Boston depend on that infrastructure to operate their railroads. 
They include: the MBTA or Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, CONNDOT, Long Island Railroad, NJ Transit, the SEPTA or Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, and the two local services, the MARC or Maryland Commuter service and the VRE or Virginia Railway Express. Each one of these commuter authorities use the Northeast Corridor. If Amtrak cannot operate the Corridor, these services come to a halt. In addition, freight carriers such as Conrail who use the Corridor would be seriously affected, because Amtrak operates much of the track on the Northeast corridor. 
Mr. President, let me put this in perspective. When a 60-day cooling off period recently expired in California, the San Francisco Bay Area's commuter railroad was shut down by a strike which stranded 270,000 commuters. 
Dispatchers at Norfolk Southern, which carries commuters between Manassas, Virginia, and Washington, DC recently called a `wildcat' strike for three hours and the VRE had to cancel one-half of its afternoon trains. 
But if Amtrak is shut down, it won't be one commuter authority paralyzed as we saw in San Francisco or Virginia, it will be many. It won't be thousands of commuters, it will be millions. 
If this happens, the strike in San Francisco will pale by comparison. 
Mr. President, my colleagues need to be aware of this situation, because the Senate needs to address it head-on before we leave in November. 
Congress has to act because the future of America's railroad depends on it. Amtrak is simply in a no-win situation. Amtrak cannot afford the terms of the PEB and it cannot afford a strike. 
The PEB recommended a package of wage increases recently implemented by the profitable freight railroads. The freight deal for the BMWE would cost Amtrak $25 million in FY98. If it were extended to all of Amtrak's employees, it would cost Amtrak $250 million. I seriously doubt that Congress would appropriate funds for these wages. As it is, the railroad is currently borrowing just to meet existing daily expenses. 
Mr. President, my colleagues have to be realistic. I look forward to working 
with both the Majority Leader and Senate Labor Committee Chairman to find the right solution to this dilemma. 
Mr. President, in that spirit, I plan to move forward on Amtrak's reform legislation. I have had extensive discussions with the Majority Leader on this matter and he feels the same way.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. The Majority Leader has summed up this situation exactly. If we really care about our national rail passenger system, the communities that it serves, the employees that work there and the role it plays in our transportation infrastructure, then we need to take up and pass the Amtrak authorization bill that has been reported from the Commerce Committee. If the Senate wants to give Amtrak the tools it needs to run a national system and collectively bargain with the employees, the Senate needs to act now. 
The clock is ticking and time is running out. Congress needs to act or there most likely will be a national rail strike, crippling transportation of people and goods across the country. Congress also needs to act on the Amtrak reforms to ensure it receives adequate capital funding and becomes solvent. If Congress doesn't act, there will be no national rail passenger system.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, Americans should not have to choose between love and money. In a country that values families, the Federal Tax Code shouldn't punish people for being married. The number of unmarried-couple households increased 80 percent from 1980 to 1990, according to census figures. The percentage of people who never marry has doubled, from 5 percent in the 1950's to 10 percent today. 
Today, I am pleased to introduce legislation with Senators Faircloth and Mack that will abolish the Federal income tax marriage penalty. Under this legislation, families will have the choice of filing as single or married, depending on which method works best for them. 
There is something wrong with a law that imposes higher taxes on married people with two incomes than on single people. The hallmark of a fair tax system is even-handedness, and the current law flunks this test. From 1913 through 1969, the Federal income tax treated married couples either better or as well as if single. Since then, progressive tax rates have meant that married couples with two incomes have to pay more in Federal taxes than they would as individuals. The Congressional Budget Office reports that in 1996, more than 21 million married couples paid the marriage penalty. The average couple now pays $1,400 in additional income tax simply because they're married. One thousand four hundred dollars could mean six or seven car payments, a family vacation, or a computer for the family. 
For example, a single person earning $24,000 a year is taxed at the rate of 15 percent. But, by taxing them on their combined income, the IRS collects 28 percent in tax from a working couple in which each spouse earns $24,000. It is wrong for two people living together to pay less taxes than if they were married. 
Because American families increasingly have had two breadwinners, instead of one, more Americans are impacted by the marriage penalty. In 1969, 52 percent of American families had only one bread winner. Today that figure is 28 percent. 
Mr. President, under current law, the only way to avoid the marriage penalty is not to marry or to leave your spouse if already married. This is wrong. We need a Tax Code to encourage marriage, not penalize it. This legislation is supported by Americans for Tax Reform and the National Taxpayers Union. We are introducing this bill with 34 co-sponsors, including every Member of the Republican leadership. I am very pleased to be working with Senators Faircloth and Mack and I hope Members from both sides of the aisle will join us in rectifying this unfair tax treatment of married couples.

Before the distinguished Senator from Kansas leaves the floor, I do appreciate so much this Senator's leadership on the issue of Bosnia and the issue of NATO expansion because he is one of the Senators who has taken the time to go to Bosnia, to look firsthand at the conditions there to determine what is in the United States security interests and certainly the best interests of the people of Bosnia. 
I would just like to ask the Senator from Kansas before he yields the floor to tell me and the American people about the experience that he had in the resettlement-of-refugees issue. 
What did the Senator see with his own eyes that brought him to the same conclusion that I have come to, that we are barking up the wrong tree in putting U.S. troops in harm's way before the people of this country have come to a settlement themselves?

Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Kansas. I thank him for taking the time to go over there, to look firsthand, because I think you get a very different perspective when you are able to do that. I appreciate the leadership position the Senator from Kansas is taking. I will just say that I had a different experience walking on the streets of Brcko in August. But I came to the same conclusion, after going into the home of a Serb, going into the street and talking to a Muslim who was just resettling into the neighborhood where that person had lived before. I asked each individually, `Are you working with your neighbor to help them resettle into their homes?' 
I asked the Serb about the Muslim. `Oh, no, no. We are not doing that because we know that they are occupied and they have their own problems. We wouldn't want to disturb them.' 
So then you ask the Muslim, `Have you met your Serb neighbor? Have you had a chance to visit or have coffee with your Serb neighbor?' And the answer was, `Oh, no, no, we actually haven't. We have not been able to do that.' 
These are people who are living in homes that are 5 feet from each other, 10 feet. The streets are very narrow. Yet, they are not mixing. 
I think we have to look at the big picture here. American people are very generous. We want to help the people of Bosnia. But I think what we are trying to do is help them in a way that will provide a long-term peace, an economic stability. And doing things that are inherently unpeaceful, putting our U.S. troops in harm's way, I don't think is the right answer. That is why I am saying let's go back to the table at Dayton. Let's determine where we are. 
I will give this administration a lot of credit for keeping the parties apart, for trying to forge a peace. Now I ask this administration to say we have had 2 years of Dayton, let's assess it. Let's see if this is the right direction. Because I don't think it is. 
We have witnessed elections in which the people who come in to vote come in under armed guard, they vote, they leave under armed guard. We have elected Muslims who cannot even enter the city to take control of the government to which they are elected to serve. We have elected Serbs, where they are not able to reenter. We are declaring victory. I am missing something. We have elected governments that cannot serve, that cannot even enter the cities in which they were elected. And we are declaring this to be a victory? I think we need to have a reality check. 
That brings me to the bigger context of NATO expansion and cost, and just how much should the United States absorb when we are talking about issues where we want to be helpful but we want to make sure that our money is going toward a successful endeavor. That is where, I think, this administration is not being realistic. 
Take the idea of NATO expansion. I think all of us in this country believe that NATO is the best alliance that has ever been put forward on the face of the Earth. Because of its strength, it never had to fire a shot and the cold war was ended. Now we are looking at expanding NATO and the hearings are starting this week to do that very thing. I think the questions that Senator Helms is asking are the very important questions that must be answered if we are going to expand NATO in a responsible way and in a way that sets a base for a long-term stability in Europe. 
Senator Helms is not saying I am for a NATO expansion period. He is saying I am for NATO expansion if it is done right. The `if it is done right' seems to be lopped off and not given very much 
attention. I think it is time the administration gave the `if it is done right' portion of Senator Helms' statement its due. Because if it is done right, it will continue to be the greatest alliance that was ever formed on the face of this Earth. And if it is done wrong, it will be the unraveling of the greatest alliance that was ever put on the face of the Earth. 
So we have the choice, of whether to keep NATO strong and stable by expanding responsibly or whether we just expand willy-nilly. America will absorb all the costs, and then the American people will say, wait a minute, I don't intend to completely prop up Europe without a fair share taken by our allies in Europe. 
That question becomes very important because just this last week in the Washington Post there was a report on the meeting of NATO defense ministers at which our own Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, participated. The reporter for the Washington Post says that this was, in fact, a startling meeting because the NATO defense ministers voiced serious misgivings about the United States insistence that they, along with the new members to be brought into NATO, would carry the bulk of the expenses related to NATO enlargement. 
You see, President Clinton has told the American Congress that the American share would be $2 billion over 10 years--$200 million. That is something I think American taxpayers would willingly absorb. But there is a lot of disagreement about those numbers because, in fact, we do not know what is in the requirements for NATO expansion. So, to have numbers before you have requirements is the cart before the horse in most people's books. 
The European allies said that they did not think it was right for America to take $2 billion of the $35 billion which the Clinton administration estimates NATO expansion will cost, and they are objecting to paying $16 billion from the present membership. In fact, the ministers from Germany, France, Great Britain, and the Netherlands expressed dismay and insisted that the burdensharing debate must be viewed in a wider context. 
You see, Secretary Cohen was right. He said the right things. He said that any shortchanging on defense investments by existing members or new partners would lead to a hollow alliance and ultimately erode confidence in future rounds of enlargement. Secretary Cohen is sending up the red flag of warning because he, too, is saying, do it right. 
Let's look at the amount of gross domestic product that is spent by NATO members. The United States spends 3.8 percent of gross domestic product on defense. This is 3.8 percent of the domestic product of our country, the whole domestic product. The United Kingdom spends 3.1 percent, Germany spends 1.5 percent, France spends 2.5 percent. And they are saying they are not going to spend any more than that. 
So I think we need to be forewarned that our European allies are not committing to the same numbers that the United States is. I think we have to put that in perspective. Because General Shalikashvili, who just left the chairmanship of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was lamenting the fact that we don't have enough money in our defense budget to properly train our troops for peak readiness. He says we don't have enough money to buy parts or equipment. Yet, we are spending $3 billion a year, on average, in Bosnia, pursuing a policy that has yet to be defined, with no exit strategy and with the administration now saying it is probable that we are going to extend the troops with no defined end when he has already extended the mission nearly 2 years beyond the first limit that he set. 
Let's take another example. Just yesterday the President vetoed almost $300 million of military construction in the United States. He vetoed such operational projects as a corrosion control facility, headquarters facilities that would enhance command, control and communications, ammunition storage facilities--$300 million in America. At the same time, he approved the expenditure of military construction in Europe for NATO enhancement of over 
$150 million. What kinds of projects did he approve for NATO? Ammunition storage facilities, administrative buildings--the exact same things he vetoed for military construction in the United States, for our bases, for our readiness. 
So I do have a problem when the outgoing chairman of the Joint Chiefs says we are not spending enough for our own readiness, for our own military personnel, when the President vetoes military construction which was in the Defense Department's 5-year plan, saying these were not priorities, while at the same time signing military construction of $150 million in Europe for NATO enhancement. 
So, I have to say the issue of our own readiness is a key issue here. If we are going to spend $3 billion in Bosnia for a policy that has, I think, minimal chance to succeed and the outgoing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is saying we don't have enough money for our own readiness, what are we doing as the stewards of this country, as the ones responsible for our own national defense, our readiness, our troop morale, our quality of life for our troops, our taxpayers, and, most of all, for our own security threats, when we would veto our own military construction and put half that same amount into European construction? And when we know that we are not spending enough to keep our troops ready for the eventual real threat to the United States that could come from an incoming ballistic missile, for which we do not have the defense; from a terrorist nation that would do any kind of bombing of our own people, either on our shores or off? Are we building up for the potential threat in Korea, in the Middle East? 
I just have to ask the administration to think about these issues as we look at our own situation and our readiness and our strength. Are we doing everything we should for our own troops, for our own military construction, for our own quality of life for our men and women who are serving in the military? Or are we dissipating our resources in operations that are not defined, that have no exit strategy, in places like Bosnia and Somalia and Haiti? 
I would just ask the question, Do we have our priorities straight? When we look at the issue of NATO expansion, we must look at the cost. It must be nailed down. It must not be a moving target. It must be clear. And we must tell our European allies exactly what we will do, and not be badgered into taking more than our fair share of the cost of European security. We do want to step up to the line. We do want to be the major superpower in the world, and fulfill our responsibilities. But we are already spending more of our gross domestic product on national defense than our European allies spend. I think the American taxpayer has the right to ask the question: Are we spending the dollars for our own security? Are we doing our fair share for the humanitarian needs of this country, and for the countries that we are trying to help? 
Are we spending the dollars wisely? That is the question. 
I think as we move toward NATO expansion, we must be good and responsible stewards for the American taxpayer, and, more important, we must be good and responsible stewards of the national defense of our country. We must meet the test, for our young men and women in the military who have pledged their lives to preserve our freedom, that our commitment to them is commensurate with their commitment to the United States; that we will guard them with respect, with a quality of life that allows them and their families to live with a high standard of living, and that we will make sure that wherever they are, in the field or on our shores, that they have everything they need to do their job. 
I think if we are going to keep that commitment to them and to the American people, we must ask the questions about NATO expansion, about our mission in Bosnia: Are we spending the dollars wisely and are we assured that when we put our United States troops on the ground that there is a United States security threat and risk that requires that action? 
Mr. President, those are the questions that I hope Senator Helms, in his hearings this week on NATO expansion, will focus on and not allow fuzzy, vague, moving-target answers from the administration. The American people and our young men and women in the service deserve no less than total responsibility and total answers to those questions. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back the remainder of my time. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am proud to be able to speak today, as many of my colleagues have done recently, on the significance of Hispanic Heritage Month, being commemorated from September 15 through October 15. For almost 30 years, we as a nation have, in this way, formally acknowledged and celebrated the contributions Hispanic Americans have made and are making to our country. 
Mr. President, in my home State of Texas, Hispanics are an intrinsic and dynamic part of our history, culture, economy, and civic life. From El Paso to Texarkana, and from Amarillo to Brownsville, over 6 million Latinos in Texas contribute immeasurably to making the Lone Star State the unique and wonderful place it is. Whether they trace their ancestry to the earliest Spanish settlers in Texas or have recently immigrated to this country, individually and collectively Hispanics have made our State and our Nation a richer place in which to live. 
For at least 250 of the last 400 years, Hispanic heritage was synonymous with Texas heritage. Since the first Spanish landing at the mouth of the Rio Grande by Alonso Alvarez de Pineda in 1519, the Spanish, and later the Mexicans bravely began to colonize the vast and rugged land known as Tejas. To this day, Hispanics continue to contribute their boundless determination and unique perspective to every facet of life in Texas and the Nation. Hispanic Americans enrich our lives in virtually every field of endeavor: politics, business, science, education, art, music, film, cuisine, and countless other fields. 
In my home State, we recently lost two of our greatest native Texas Hispanics, Congressman Frank Tejeda and musical artist Selena Perez. In their own way, both of these individuals demonstrated astonishing determination, which in turn reflected the vibrancy and strength of the Hispanic community: Frank Tejeda, who dropped out of high school from the south side of San Antonio and went on to distinguish himself in military service in Vietnam, in higher education, in the business world, and as a dedicated public servant; and Selena who, at the young age of 23 became a pop icon, entertaining audiences in her hometown of Corpus Christi and throughout the world with her unique brand of `Tejano' music. Although the lives of these two great Texans ended far too soon, they will forever inspire the tens of thousands of young Hispanics who will look to them and to the many other Hispanic leaders in our country as symbols of what can be achieved through hard work, ambition, and the support of the community. 
As a Texas and as a member of the Senate Republican Conference Task Force on Hispanic Affairs, I remain committed to ensuring that the American dream continues to exist and to come true for all Americans. Through my activities on this task force and in the Senate, as well as through daily contact with my constituents, I have worked hard to ensure that the needs and concerns of the Hispanic community are heard and responded to. While we all share the goal of improving our country and the opportunities for our children, there are economic and other concerns that disproportionately impact the Hispanic community. I believe we in Congress must continue to address those concerns by pursuing policies that promote education, health care, urban renewal, and a business environment that encourages entrepreneurial activity and risk taking. 
There are certainly challenges ahead. With so many Hispanic-owned businesses starting up around the country, access to capital is a critical need. I have supported and continue to support lending and contracting programs that offer fledgling businesses the opportunity to launch themselves--and to continue to soar. I am also working to give small business people and other Americans relief from excessive levels of taxation and Federal regulation. 
On the eve of a new millennium, it is vital that we remain a people united, respectful of the individual, the family, and our country as a whole. In this same spirit, it is also important to inform ourselves and our children of the sacrifices and contributions that have been made by our ancestors on our behalf. Hispanics have extremely good reason to be proud of that heritage and to rejoice in it. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to highlight today the contribution of Hispanics to the exquisite mosaic that is America the Beautiful, America la linda.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, Senator Stevens, and Senator Inouye, for producing a defense appropriations bill that will fund the defense needs of our country. It will create a quality of life improvement for those who are serving in our military, and it will give us, to the extent that we can, the equipment that we need for our young men and women to do this job. 
I want to point out particularly one part of this bill that I think is a major step for this Senate and for our country. That is the part that provides for a cutoff of funds for the Bosnia deployment after June 30, 1998, unless the President comes to Congress 45 days before that time and shows us exactly why he would want to extend the forces, how much it would cost, what it is going to do--what the mission is, and what the exit strategy is. This is what we have been asking the President for, for 2 years. 
When we started this deployment over the objections of many of us in this Congress, it was for 1 year, from November 1995 to November 1996. Then the continuation came with very little consultation from Congress, certainly no previous consultation, and we started in January 1997 until now; it was set for June 1998. But even today the New York Times editorialized, `Still No Exit Strategy on Bosnia.' 
Congress is saying to the President, we want to see an exit strategy. Many of us are concerned that we are drifting into a potential commitment that we do not understand, that the American people do not understand. They do not see a need for it because they don't see the strategy. It seems, if you are looking at Bosnia, that the military mission is to keep the parties apart. But the political mission is to bring them together, perhaps bring them together prematurely. 
I have been to the Balkans six times. I was there in August. I walked on the streets of Brcko. I talked to the Serbs. I talked to the Muslim residents. I asked them if they were helping each other move into the neighborhoods to bring the refugees back. They acted like the others weren't there. They are not helping each other. They are not ready for this move. If we are going to try to continue to force this resettlement, is it an inherently peaceful move? Or are we disrupting the peace that we would like to put into Bosnia today? 
Mr. President, I think what this bill does is say, once and for all, we are going to have consultation. We are not going to allow a mission creep, such as we have seen in Somalia. We are not going to allow a mission creep, such as we have seen in Vietnam. We are not going to allow our young men and women, who are serving in Bosnia, to give their lives before we have a policy in this country about what our mission is there. We are going to do it, I hope, in the light of day, taking into consideration what the U.S. security interest is, what it is going to cost us, what our relationship is to our allies. 
These are the questions we must address before we put our young men and women into a mission that has no end. 
So, Mr. President, I commend the leaders of the armed services and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. I am on that subcommittee. Under the leadership of Chairman Stevens and cochairman, Senator Inouye, with Senator Pat Roberts, with Senator Russ Feingold, we are trying to fashion a policy that the American people will agree is the right policy for our country.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words. I will be brief because I know a number of people have opinions on this subject. But, Mr. President, I think we are talking about the future of public education. I have heard people say, why not just improve public education? That is what we are trying to do. That is the bottom line of what this amendment is trying to do--introduce some new idea, introduce a new way of trying to improve public education by having competition in our system. 
Mr. President, what makes America America, what makes America different from other countries in the world has always been our commitment to quality public education so that every child in our country would have the opportunity, with a full range of public education, to fulfill his or her potential. 
I am a product of public education. I think it is important that we have the quality so that a person like me can stand on the floor with a person like Senator Kennedy who has had quality private education. In order to do that, I think it is important that we have new ideas because, as they say in my home State, `If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' 
This is broken. The District of Columbia schools spend more money per student than any school in America, and yet steadily we have seen the decline of the quality of education as judged by the scores on tests. 
So more money is clearly not the answer. Maybe some competition, maybe letting the mother of a 10-year-old boy who is going to a school that may or may not be open because of fire codes, that may not be able to educate this child because he is being offered drugs on the school grounds, give that mother a chance to do something different for her child, and that is to give her child a chance with a voucher to go somewhere else for competition. And then perhaps, if this works as a test, it might be something that we can do in low- and moderate-income areas all over our country. 
Maybe that is a new idea that might work. 
Mr. President, this is an amendment that is a field test for another way to try to improve our public education system, which I think everyone in the U.S. Senate wants to do. But why are we not open to a new idea? Why wouldn't we say if any place deserves a try, it is this community, the District of Columbia, where we see the test scores go down in relation to the Federal money that has gone in. Let's try something new. This is the perfect place to do it. 
I commend the Senator from Indiana, the Senator from Connecticut, and all those who are cosponsoring this innovative idea so we can have a test market to give every child a chance to have a great public education by introducing a choice. With that competition, encouraging every public school to come up in standards to attract those vouchers that would provide that quality public education that we have guaranteed to our people for the last 221 years in this country, and which if we are going to remain the greatest country on Earth, must be the hallmark of our freedom--a quality public education.

<TEXT>
Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if these concerns are not addressed, one of our country's most successful programs, the Outer Continental Shelf Leasing Program, may be jeopardized. Under that program, the Federal Government has raised hundreds of millions of dollars in rents and royalties over the last 25 years, while at the same time developing safe and secure sources of energy for our country. Crucial to the success of that program is the ability of the private sector to conduct exploration of the Gulf of Mexico before submitting bids on the tracts offered for oil and gas leases. 
I recently learned that the Minerals Management Service [MMS] has proposed changes to the rules under which that exploration is conducted. These changes would potentially jeopardize the continuity and success of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act [OCSLA] program. 
Currently, geological and geophysical companies [G&G companies] conduct seismic surveys under MMS permits which require the permittees to provide the data they collect to the MMS under strict guarantees of confidentiality. 
The G&G companies then provide the oil companies access to the data through nonexclusive licenses. The licenses allow the oil companies to use the data for any purpose including re-processing the data using their own technology and data. These licenses are given on the condition that the licensee will not show or share the data with anyone else. In this way, the G&G companies are able to offer data to the largest number of possible users at the lowest cost. 
Under the proposed regulations, MMS intends to extend its ability to obtain data from just the G&G companies to all of the companies who have licensed and reprocessed that data using their own technology. By requiring all industry to share reprocessed data with the MMS, the threat of disclosure of extremely sensitive business data exists. Under any number of situations, including appeal of fair market values, it is unclear if the proposed changes would protect the confidentiality of that data. This threat to sensitive business data could ultimately threaten the success of the OCS leasing program. 
I understand and appreciate the need for MMS to have accurate data. However, I question the need of the Government to obtain reprocessed data that belongs to the business community especially if it could potentially be released to competitor companies. 
It is my understanding that my colleague, Senator Breaux was an author of the original OCSLA. Do you believe the MMS' proposed regulations accurately reflect the purpose of that legislation?

Mrs. HUTCHISON. I share your concerns regarding the intent of the original OCSLA and the effect of the MMS' actions. 
MMS is threatening to implement regulations without adequate discussions between the agency, industry, and the original authors of the OCSLA. By utilizing a negotiated rulemaking, we have a unique opportunity to avoid the problems that MMS' current course of action will create. There are many stakeholders in this debate that have valid concerns which deserve to be addressed. The exploration contractors, the oil and gas companies and the MMS all have a lot to lose by pushing through regulations that will cause more problems than they will fix. 
Each of the stakeholders can make significant contributions to a set of regulations that will accomplish the goals of the OCSLA, the MMS and the industry. I am frankly at a loss to understand why MMS has refused to engage in substantive negotiations on these issues when it is clear that substantive concerns remain unaddressed. 
The notice and comment rulemaking that surrounded this proposed rule was insufficient. Significant disagreements continue to exist where solutions seem eminently reachable. It makes sense to get the interested parties together to see if they can find a mutually agreeable solution. I strongly urge MMS to abandon the current rulemaking proceeding and to negotiate immediately with the affected parties to avoid placing the OCS lease program in jeopardy.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, this morning the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2107, the Interior appropriations bill, with me being recognized regarding my amendment on the NEA. Following 20 minutes of debate on that amendment, the Senate will vote on or in relation to that NEA amendment. Therefore, Senators can anticipate the first rollcall at approximately 9:30 this morning. It will be probably around 9:40. 
Following that vote, it is hoped that Members will cooperate with the managers of the Interior appropriations bill in offering their amendments and working on short time agreements. The majority leader has stated that we will complete action on this bill today. 
With that in mind, Senators can anticipate additional rollcall votes throughout today's session of the Senate. 
I thank the Members.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to just briefly describe my amendment, and then it is my intention to yield 2 minutes to Senator DeWine. And then of course I know Senator Harkin is here to speak on the other side. 
My amendment leaves the amount for the commitment to the arts at the same level as the committee bill does. It does, however, make some reforms that I think will improve the NEA and most certainly will improve the commitment to the arts and reconfirm the commitment to arts that we have. It cuts the administrative costs of the NEA to 5 percent. I think, since the large part of the bill will require block granting to the States, that the administration does not need to be $17 million. I think $5 million then would be quite adequate to administer the national part of the bill. 
The Federal grants to national groups would be 20 percent of the total grant. In the Federal grants, we have a requirement for State matching funds, which I think is a healthy thing for us to require, so that any project that is funded with national dollars will also have a State commitment. Grants may not be used for obscene works, and they will go for groups and institutions. 
The rest of the money, the 75 percent, would be grants to the States so that the each State or territory is guaranteed at least what they had in 1997. And, in fact, every State, except California and New York, would get more funding for their arts commissions than they had last year. Each State except California and New York will get more money than they got in 1997, and they will be able to spend it according to the wishes of their own arts commissions. I think it is very important that this happen. 
With the 20 percent Federal grants to the national groups, I think California and New York will be able to make up some of the loss that they will receive because they have had the highest number of dollars that have gone to the national arts. 
In this, I think we have a good way to keep our commitment to the arts to increase the access to the arts by children and people in all the States of our great country. And I think it also will give the leeway for the national groups that deserve the support of the National Government, because we do want to keep the very top, top quality in our arts so we can be proud, as a Nation, that we do have the world class opera, the world class ballet, the world class art museums that would actually be worthy of the civilization that our country has formed in its 221 years of democracy. 
Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.

Mr. President, I would like to respond to the remarks of the Senator from Iowa and say that it is most certainly not my intention to do away with our national commitment to the arts. In fact, the opposite is true. That is why I keep the funding level because I do believe that all of our children will gain from having more access to and appreciation of the arts in our country. I want the budding artists of Iowa to have equal access to the education that budding artists in New York have.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, America's strength comes from its grassroots. It isn't Government that provides the spirit of America; it is the grassroots. Government policy should strengthen the people to establish their priorities, and that's what my amendment does. It strengthens the States to create more access and more appreciation and more education in the arts for all the children of America. I believe that our local control of education allows reading through phonics. I believe in old math so that we learn our multiplication tables in addition to how to work a computer and a calculator. I also think as basic to that is to let our children have access to the arts so that they can produce world-class art and arts appreciation. It shows that it is part of our basic education that we would have a national priority. 
Mr. President, my amendment keeps the national commitment to the arts, and it keeps the control in the grassroots and the heartland of America. I think it is the best balance.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will leave it to the discretion of the manager what is the right order because of course there will be a number of amendments dealing with the NEA. 
My particular amendment takes the dollar amount that is in the bill and reallocates it and established a way to spend it. There will be amendments offered that will do other things. And I think it is really a healthy thing that we are going to be debating the NEA and what kind of funding the NEA has and how it is allocated, because I think a number of people in our country have concerns about some of the types of grants that the NEA has approved. 
There have been inappropriate uses of NEA funding. The National Endowment for the Arts I think is a program that everyone hoped would establish as a priority a commitment to the arts in this country. I believe that is a proper commitment for our country to encourage arts in our country, to make arts accessible to all the people of our country, to educate our children in the importance of the arts. 
All of these things are worthy goals. But because we have seen the funding of obscenity, of pornography, of things that you could not even in your most modest attempts to describe as art, many people have opposed the NEA. And many people have said, `We don't need it. Why would we want the Government involved in this?' I certainly have great respect for that view. 
I do believe that there should be a commitment in this country to the arts. I speak as a person who grew up in a town of 15,000. My parents were very careful to try to make sure that I had access to the arts. They gave me ballet lessons for 13 years. You would have thought it would have taken. But after 13 years, I decided that maybe there was something else in my life that would be more successful than ballet. 
They also made sure that I went to the nearest big city, when possible, to go to the symphony. They drove me to Houston, sometimes to Galveston, to see plays or to go to an art museum. 
But, you know, many children in America are not as fortunate as I was because perhaps they do not have parents who thought this was important or that this would make their education more complete. Some children do not have that opportunity. 
I want all children in America to have this opportunity, whether they come from families that do not have time to appreciate the arts because they are working so hard to make ends meet; or whether they come from a rural community that does not have easy access to a major city or regional arts center. I want to try to give that same opportunity that I think was important in my life to every child in America. 
I would like to see school districts adopt arts appreciation programs because it is proven in the testing of our children in 
school that where children do have access to the arts, where they have arts appreciation or arts classes in their school curricula, they also do better in math and science and reading. That is a proven fact. 
So we are not talking about something that is just extra that would be nice if we could afford it. We are talking about giving children a more well-rounded education and giving children the chance, by having the full range of education, to do better in the basic subjects. 
So that is why I believe it is important for our country to have a commitment to arts education and to provide access to the arts for all the children so that some of them can grow up to be artists or to appreciate the arts and pass that involvement or appreciation on to future generations. I cannot imagine a country that is as developed, as technologically advanced as ours, that does not also have an appreciation for and a commitment to the arts. 
That is why I am putting forward an amendment to this bill that would keep the allocation for 1998 exactly where the committee has it, $100,060,000 to be exact. But under my amendment, I would rearrange the priorities. 
Instead of having the NEA make all of the grants with this money, I think it is time that we allocate to the States, in block grants, the bulk of the money. I think it is time that we have a more just and equitable distribution of arts funding. 
For one thing, I think giving the money in block grants to the States--and I will talk about the very few restrictions we would put on this--gives the States the ability to fashion programs that will best meet the needs and priorities of their States. They can divide this money among, for example, arts access or education in the schools, transportation from rural areas to regional arts centers, or insurance programs for art museums to be able to sponsor national exhibitions that would otherwise not be seen by the citizens of that region outside of New York or Washington, DC, or California or Texas. I think it is important that states have that flexibility. 
Also, under my amendment States would have the flexibility to invest up to 25 percent of their Federal funding in an endowment. I think that is important because I would like to see more States have permanent endowments for funding of arts and access to the arts within the State. 
So here is what my amendment does. 
First, it limits the administrative costs of the NEA. Instead of allowing the 17 percent of the funding that the NEA now uses for administrative costs, my amendment would set a cap of 5 percent, reducing the money spent on administration to $5 million down from approximately $17 million. I think 5 percent should be enough for the allocation that the NEA would be able to grant to national art works. 
The NEA grants to national groups or institutions would be 20 percent. The NEA would be allowed 5 percent for administrative costs to administer 20 percent of the total for grants to national groups or institutions. 
My amendment would not allow grants to individuals, but only to institutions or groups. NEA would absolutely be prohibited from granting any obscene works. NEA could also not grant seasonal grants such as, for example, giving the Metropolitan Opera $1 million for its season, whatever works might be performed during that season. Grants would be for a specific project that the Metropolitan Opera would have to specify, so that the NEA would be able to know exactly what it was funding. 
My amendment would also prohibit grantees from giving subgrants to other groups. 
In other words, 20 percent, or $20 million, would be available for national grants to groups or institutions. Such groups would be opera companies, symphonies, art museums, ballets, or other groups or institutions that clearly serve a national purpose or exhibit a national stature. 
These national grants would require matching grants. If the grantee--an art museum, for example--had a total budget of $3 million or less, it could cover up to one-third of the art project with Federal grant money. 
This way, two-thirds of the cost of the project would have to come from the local community or State. 
If the grantee--for example, an art museum--has an annual budget of over $3 million, the maximum Federal funds the grantee could use for the project would be one-fifth of the total cost of the project. So for large institutions, the maximum contribution of Federal dollars would be 20 percent and the other 80 percent would have to come from local or State matching funds. These matching requirements would apply to the $20 million allocated national grants. 
However, under my amendment the bulk of the Federal funds would go to the States in block grants, namely 75 percent or $75 million. That will guarantee level funding from fiscal year 1997 for every State and territory of the United States, up to 6.6 percent of the total funds available to the States for fiscal year 1998. The only two states that would not be guaranteed level funding from fiscal year 1997 would be New York and California. However, those States would be expected to seek a large portion of the $20 million in national grants. So under my proposal 75 percent of the Federal funds would go to the States in block grants, and almost every State in this country will get more of the arts funding under this allocation. 
Behind me on the charts you will see the differences in the funding for each State. Most States will have a significant amount of funding beyond fiscal year 1997. I think it is time that States have more opportunity to support their school systems or their regional arts centers and provide more access to the arts by more people in this country. 
States may use up to 25 percent of their funds to establish or enhance a permanent arts endowment. I think it is a worthy goal to give States this incentive. Under my amendment, States may contribute any amount of money in addition to the 25 percent, but they must match whatever portion they use for an endowment by at least 1 to 1. In other words, if the State of Oklahoma decides to have an endowment for the arts, it can take up to 25 percent of its Federal allocation but it must match that amount, dollar for dollar, with funds from other State, local, or private funds. 
Of course, my hope is that eventually every State will have a permanent arts endowment so that they will be able always to ensure access to art that is available within their own communities and within their own States. But permanent endowments will also in the long run assure the States will be able to attract from the outside some of the national touring art shows, such as the wonderful Monet exhibition that traveled to the Fort Worth Kimball Art Museum. Many people in my part of the country would not have been able to see that exhibition had it not traveled to Fort Worth, TX. This is the case all over the country. 
Right now the NEA serves a valuable role in supporting an insurance indemnity program that has allowed international blockbuster shows, such as the Jewels of the Romanovs, to travel around the country. People all over America, because of this insurance program, will have access to see the jewels from the Romanov dynasty in Russia that I hear are really incredible. Thanks to NEA funds, Americans have also had the opportunity to see the presentation of Tennessee Williams' `The Glass Menagerie.' Shakespeare's `As You Like It' went to 45 communities in 26 States because the NEA helped them with the cost of touring. Those productions traveled to Cincinnati, OH; Keene, NH; and Orange, TX. 
I think Senator Baucus earlier today talked about the Shakespeare plays viewed in Montana would not have traveled to Montana but for the help from the NEA. I think it is exciting when Senator Baucus says that someone in Montana said he had never even thought of reading Shakespeare until he was able to attend his first Shakespeare outdoor play and began to love Shakespeare and studying Shakespeare seriously. These are the kind of things that I think having a small national funding priority will continue to do for this country. 
In Abilene, TX, the NEA has been helpful in starting the Abilene opera. There are so many people in west Texas who had 
never seen the opera and, in fact, thought the opera was a stuffy event that nobody would really enjoy but would just attend for social purposes. When they went to their first opera, the first opera they have ever had in Abilene, they came back just thinking, `what a joy, what a treasure.' These people are now going to encourage people to contribute locally so that they can enjoy more opera productions. NEA funds were the seed corn that gave access to people who had never even seen an opera who now not only have seen one, but loved it and are contributing to bringing that experience to other people, especially children, in the west Texas area. 
Regional touring by the best American dance companies to rural towns and small cities has been helped by the NEA. The production of performance specials and art documentaries by the Education Broadcasting Corp., WNET, in New York are now viewed by millions of Americans because that seed corn was planted by the NEA. 
So that is why I am not among those who want to just do away with the NEA, because I believe that Americans overall will be more culturally aware and enjoy culture more, if they have the opportunity and exposure to the arts, which is ensured by our having a national commitment to the arts. I don't want to do away with that. Do we need to change the NEA? Yes. Do we need to impose strict prohibitions against obscenity and pornography? Absolutely, because it has been shown that because there have not been enough limits on the NEA, truly inappropriate use of our tax dollars has occurred. But I don't think that means we walk away from this commitment. I think it means that we change NEA, that we get control of it, that we make sure that the money is being used for what we intended it to be used for. But we don't walk away from it. 
Let me give another example: Del Rio, TX, is on the border of Mexico. The average per capita income of Del Rio is about one-half of the national per-capita income. The population of Del Rio is 80 percent Hispanic. Yet, despite the economic difficulties that Del Rio faces, the people have a long history of commitment to the arts. In 1992, they converted their old firehouse into an arts center. The new arts center now holds free exhibitions of work of national, regional, and local artists. It conducts art instruction classes. It offers free children's classes in the summer and supports a children's dance troupe that performs at civic and cultural events. All of this is helped by seed money from the NEA. 
Mr. President, I think we have an opportunity here to get control of a funding program that has been abused in the past. But it has not been abused 100 percent. It has been abused but it has also done so much good for places like Del Rio, TX, like Beaumont, TX, like Cincinnati, OH, like Keene, NH. There are so many wonderful stories of young people getting their first access to the arts and their first appreciation for the arts because the NEA gave some grant money, some seed corn, to a local community, which was matched by that local community. Something was made possible because of the national commitment to the arts that has spurred many young people to go into arts as a profession. Artists or dancers or musicians who now belong to a symphony--all of these contributors to the arts in America began their careers from seed corn that came from a national commitment to the arts. 
Now, I do understand how people have become very frustrated. But let's do something positive and productive with this frustration. Let's make something very good out of a modest commitment to national arts. Let's give our young children a chance either to excel in the arts or by an appreciation of the arts to make them more well rounded, to allow them to be literate in whatever circles they may walk. Let's allow them to have the same access that their European counterparts have. Many times I have been told that our young people do not have the cultural awareness that many of their age group in European countries have. I think they should. I think they should also appreciate the contribution of Americans to the great art of the world. The more 
young people to whom we can offer arts access and appreciation, the more of a contribution America will make to the world art community. 
I think we have something that is worth keeping, and I think it is our responsibility to support it in a responsible way. That is why under my amendment I preserve the allocation of dollars but redistribute those dollars to allow the States to use arts funds in the way that will best give access to all people in their State. I oppose throwing out the national commitment to the arts, because we have proof that it helps our young people in all of their educational endeavors to have an appreciation and an awareness of the arts. We also know that art adds to the quality of life in our country. 
If we are the greatest, freest, fairest nation on the Earth, which I believe we are, I think a commitment to the arts is part of keeping the well-rounded, cultural, thorough education of our young people at the premier level that we also value for the preservation of our freedom and democracy that are beacons to the world. 
Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor an amendment. I will look forward to working with the manager of this bill to introduce it at the most appropriate time. I think this is an important debate that we should be having. I hope in the end when all is said and done that the bill we send to the President will say we have a national commitment to the arts in this country. We want to make sure it is done in the way that will give the most access to the arts to the most people of our country and that will give Americans an appreciation for what America contributes to the world art community. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator for those remarks. I think that he, too, is approaching this in a positive way. Like the Senator from Washington, who is chairing this very important subcommittee, I don't have ideas that I consider to be in concrete and I am not unwilling to change allocations or hear other views. But I think if you are going to make constructive change, you have to start with an outline. I think that is what the Senator from Washington has done. While he has brought the bill to the floor, essentially not changing the status quo, he has always been open to suggestions on ways to make it better. I think, in the end, in conference, if the Senate will speak in what I hope is a decisive way on the approach that it wants to take, then I would like to see us work with the House to do something that will be constructive that will preserve our national commitment to the arts. But I would hope that whatever we do, we make the American people feel comfortable and give them something they think is worth their hard earned tax dollars, something that will give their children better access to the arts and enhance their education, if you will, something that the American people would write if they were standing here on the floor. 
I am speaking from my roots. I am speaking as a person who has benefited greatly from growing up in a town of 15,000, with the strong values that this small town gave me, but with wonderful parents for whom I can never fully express my appreciation. They knew that while I learned the values represented in that small town, there were other important things for my education, such as appreciation for the arts, for which they would have to make an extra effort to give me. They did make that extra effort. But, Mr. President, not everyone has parents like I had. 
What I want when we finish this bill is for us to have made up for the fact that every parent is not as responsible as mine were and does not give every child the same access that I had, the same opportunities that I had. I want to see that we in the Congress kept our commitment to funding of the arts for our children all over America, from whatever part of the country. If we can take that responsible action, then every girl who grows up in a town of 15,000 with no arts of its own will have the same access that I was fortunate enough to have, and I think we will be a better country 
and make a stronger contribution to the arts of the world if we keep this commitment. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of the Senator the Community Employment Alliance [CEA], which is sponsored by the Enterprise Foundation. It is my hope that the Department of Labor may identify the CEA as a project for full consideration under research, demonstration, and pilot program funds being made available to the Department in the 1998 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act. 
CEA is working in eight cities nationwide, including San Antonio and Dallas in my home State, to develop an effective job opportunity system for low-income individuals, particularly those on public assistance. CEA offers a new, comprehensive model for developing job opportunities for low-income citizens based on the utilization of community-based organizations, in conjunction with private sector and Government resources. 
CEA's approach envisions the development of compacts involving city and State governments, local and regional business leaders, and community-based organizations. Each local alliance will formulate strategies and implement programs for creating an effective job opportunity system for welfare recipients. The ultimate goal of the CEA, therefore, is to improve job prospects for unemployed and underemployed residents of distressed inner-city neighborhoods through well-coordinated, high performance economic and work force development activities. I believe that it is this type of integrated approach that will help move more Americans from welfare to work.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will just inform the Senator from Arizona that I will be happy to yield back a minute of my time since he so generously has given me the last time. 
Mr. President, let me just say that I am a supporter of medical education. I have supported every amendment that has 
come through here, and I have sponsored amendments that add to the medical schools' part of Medicare funding. I want medical schools to be funded. But, Mr. President, this is not the way to do it. In fact, the University of Texas, which is a school that has one of the best medical schools in the whole United States, has said this is bogus, and they have refused to take the extra funds in this way not to train medical doctors. They are not in the business of not training medical doctors, and they have refused this money because this is the wrong way to go. 
Only in Washington would we address the issue of an oversupply of doctors by funding not teaching doctors. Some would say, if this were a debate to increase spending not to educate lawyers, maybe it would be worthwhile. But, in fact, we are not going to do anything so silly as to pay not to train doctors or lawyers or any other professionals in this country. This is not the way to address the issue of oversupply. The issue of oversupply is real. 
The issue of training doctors is very important. In fact, I would like to increase funding. I wish that we could substitute what we would save here and put it into other parts of Medicare funding, perhaps rural medical education, which is suffering greatly. 
I believe in teaching hospitals. I do not believe in paying hospitals not to teach, and I hope we can correct that inequity. I hope we can legislate in a responsible way. I hope that we can put our money into Medicare, into medical education, into training doctors, into rural health care where we need the money, but I do not want to spend one dime not to train doctors with added funds. It doesn't pass the smell test, and I am proud to say that the University of Texas, from my home State, is not taking these dollars because they believe this is bogus. They need money to train doctors in the best way, but this is not the best way. 
Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am glad the Senator is on this point because in the original mission statement in the Dayton accords there was a provision to capture war criminals, but it was going to be a police force within the Federation. It was going to be a police force made up of all three of the sectors that would go after war criminals, hopefully in a way that would be responsible. That police force has not materialized. As the Senator from Kansas has said, we are substituting our NATO forces for the police force that is the mission in the Dayton accords. That is a change of mission by any way you read it.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for his remarks. I am pleased that he took the time to go over and visit our troops in Bosnia, to find out for himself what the situation was there. He is a distinguished new member of the Armed Services Committee. 
I think it is important that all Senators try to go over there because we have a lot at stake. Our troops are on the ground. Up to 12,000 will be there very soon. Their lives are at stake. In addition to that, our taxpayers are footing the bill for $3 billion a year so far, and they have the right to ask, what are we doing there? What are we doing with the $3 billion? Are we doing something that will have a chance to succeed? Those are fair questions. 
Americans are generous people. They are valiant. They are committed to freedom, and they want everyone in the world to live in freedom. They would risk their lives, as they have in this century, for the freedom of people who live in Europe and other places. They are willing to risk their lives. They are willing to pay from their pocketbooks, from their families the money if a policy has a reasonable chance to succeed. 
I am today raising the question, do we have a reasonable chance to succeed with the underlying policy? There is no question that our troops are doing a great job. There is no question that our new commander, Gen. Wes Clark, is absolutely correct when he says, you fool with American troops and you are going to face the consequences. I am glad we have issued the ultimatum because everybody is on fair notice that you can't throw rocks and shoot at American troops and get by with it. 
But it is the underlying policy that I question today. I am calling on the President of the United States, with the leadership of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, to step back and look at the policy. Are we trying to put the American standard of multiethnic, peaceful democracy into a place that is not ready? I think we are. And I think we are risking a lot doing it. So I am asking the President and his Cabinet members to come together and say, let's look again at Dayton. Let's look at whether the time is now for resettling refugees, for forcing people to live in this Federation with a joint Government of Croats and Muslims and Serbs, all of whom have committed, or had committed on them, terrible atrocities. And we are now saying come together, form a government, have a joint presidency, have a joint government, create a school system that will accommodate a Muslim religion and a Catholic religion and come together and bring all of this in in the next 9 months. 
Let us step back. Let us revisit Dayton. Let us see if we can make a Dayton that has a chance to succeed. I will support leaving our troops on the ground beyond June 1998; I will support the money it takes if we have a policy that has a reasonable chance to succeed, that will bring a peaceful coexistence. And I think the time has come to look at a division where people can come together of like mind and form a government that will serve their purposes where they can invest in infrastructure, where we can help them invest in infrastructure, and they can build their factories and they can have jobs and begin to live in peace with their neighbors who are different from them. 
That happens all over Europe. In fact, the lesson of history is that many times people who cannot live together split apart. You can name example after example. And it can be done peacefully. Why not let them come together in their own groups, form their governments, create their livelihoods. In the former Bosnia, there were taxes on the minority ethnic groups. There were restraints on what certain minority ethnics could do. They could not be doctors. They could not be small business people around the corner selling hardware. They could not be lawyers. They could only have certain farming-type jobs. 
That is not a recipe for success. Why not look at a division that might work. Let them have their government. Let them have an economy. Let us help them build the sewer lines and the roads and the streets and the airports and the factories so they can pull themselves up. Let them trade with their neighbors. Let that be the beginning of getting along together, whether they are Catholic or whether they are Muslim or whether they are orthodox, and then perhaps eventually, after they have had good relationships for years, they will be able to mix and move in to the other country. 
I hope that the President of the United States will not continue to say, well, if we just keep trying, we just stay at it, we will have an infinite commitment of American troops and American dollars along with our European allies, all of whom are also stretched in their budgets, all of whom care about their soldiers and their troops just as we do, all of whom, I believe, would like to see a policy that has a chance for success. They are there on the ground because they, too, are generous people. 
So I ask the President of the United States, I ask Madeleine Albright, I ask Bill Cohen, go back to the drawing board. Look at something that might have a chance to work. Do not be in a rut trying to put a round peg in a square hole. It is time to look for a round hole. What we are doing now is not working. Maybe a division will not work either, but let us try something that has a better chance. Let us learn from the experience and let us go forward. 
Mr. President, we are going to hear a lot more about this. I hope we will not wait 9 months to determine that this is not going to work. Let us start now. Let us give our troops a chance now. Let us give our taxpayers a chance now. Let us give the people of Bosnia more hope than they are seeing now. Senator Roberts talked about the experience of these poor Muslim people trying to move back into their old homes and the Serb factions kept them out, beat them up, finally burned their homes up. Mr. President, that is not a recipe for success. 
Let us step back. Let us give peace a chance by looking at something new. And let us do something now rather than frittering away 9 months and not having any better chance than we have today. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
On behalf of the leader, I would like to close the Senate.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, all of us have heartfelt grief for the people of Great Britain. That is why the Senate is acting in this resolution, saying this is a woman and a leader who cared so much about AIDS victims, people who did not have the chance in life that she did. I think she really did show many of us that if we will just reach out a helping hand to those less fortunate, it will make a difference. 
The Senate stands today in unanimous agreement that we grieve with the people of Great Britain and we will set aside a day of recognition and one in which all of us will be thinking about her accomplishments, the tragic, senseless death that she suffered, and hope that through her children and the Royal Family and all of the British Government and the people of Great Britain good things will come from the leadership she showed and the compassion she showed for others and that because she lived we will all be better people.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair. Today is a historic day. We will vote and pass the first substantial tax cut in 16 years, giving much-needed, long-overdue tax relief to working American families. We have been working for tax cuts for 3 years now, and we are making a downpayment on that commitment. 
I view the bill that we are debating today as the second half of an entire economic package. We passed the first half this morning. I was a somewhat reluctant supporter because, while it does take steps toward a balanced budget, we missed the opportunity for historic Medicare reform that would have created real consumer choice and preserved the program for the next generation. 
The Senate spoke on this issue. But the President's opposition to real Medicare reform prevailed in the final version. 
He also walked away from some very important decisions we made last year on welfare reform. We have hampered the ability of States to implement the welfare-to-work law. The President has already denied States, including Texas, the ability to privatize and consolidate welfare services. In Texas alone, such consolidation would yield annual savings of some $200 million. The President's continued opposition to true welfare reform carried the day. 
Mr. President, I did support the bill this morning because it is linked to the tax cuts we are now discussing, and it does bring us closer to a balanced budget. The tax bill is long overdue relief for hard-working American families. Republicans took the majority of Congress with a very clear mandate to make Government smaller, control spending, and let hard-working Americans keep more of the money they earn. 
We are trying to live up to that promise. We passed a budget plan that will lead to a balanced budget, and now we are succeeding in providing substantial tax relief for all Americans. 
Who will benefit from this plan? It is the mothers and fathers who will get help raising their children with a $500 per child tax credit; homemakers who want to build retirement systems through an IRA; young couples who are trying to buy a first home, pay for college for their children, or retirement for themselves; small business owners and farmers who have spent their lives building a business or farm and want to pass it to their children; investors who have provided the capital to start new businesses and create jobs. 
A $500-per-child tax credit will mean over 3.5 million families will no longer pay taxes at all. Instead of writing a $500 check to the IRS, families will get to keep the money they earn and spend it as they decide to spend it. Americans really do not need the U.S. Government to tell them how to spend their money. I think they should be able to choose for themselves. American families know best whether they need to spend money on their children, or save it for retirement, or enjoy a vacation. The Government shouldn't take that money and make their choices for them. In fact, with this tax cut, roughly 28 million families will pay fewer taxes. In my home State of Texas the child tax credit alone will benefit almost 2 million American families. 
With the passage of this bill, we will cut the capital gains rate to 20 percent. This will encourage and reward investment and create new businesses and new jobs. A low capital gains rate is important to our future and our Nation's ability to save and invest. Our current Tax Code punishes people for saving and investing. This is wrong. We are trying to change it. 
Lowering the taxation of capital gains will do more than release hundreds of billions of dollars of tied-up capital. It will bring immediate relief to investors, small businesses, workers, farmers, homeowners, and the elderly. We need to encourage investment so that we can generate the technology, the market, and the jobs of tomorrow. 
Today, more than 41 percent of American families own stock. Fifty-six percent of capital gains are reported by families who earn under $50,000. Two-thirds of mutual fund shareholders today in America have household incomes under $75,000. Fifty percent of those who claim capital gains are senior citizens, many of whom need this money to improve their quality of life. 
In the livestock industry in Texas, over 60 percent of those polled recently admitted to holding onto assets because they couldn't afford to give Uncle Sam 28 percent of a capital gains tax. 
We cut death taxes so that years of hard work and success won't be wiped out in one generation. According to a recent survey, 51 percent of family-owned businesses would have significant difficulty surviving in the event of a principal owner's death, due to the death tax. The death tax brings little revenue into the Federal Government--only 1.1 percent in 1997 of all of the Federal revenue. But it does affect hundreds of thousands of small business owners, family farmers, and ordinary Americans who work, save, and invest for a lifetime, just to turn more than half of their hard-earned dollars over to the Federal Government when they die. 
Mr. President, this is walking away from the American dream. What we have said for over 200 years to people all over the world is, if you come to America and you work hard, you will be able to keep the fruits of your labors and give them to your children to give them a little better start in life than you probably had. 
So walking away from that American dream is what we are trying to prevent today by having some relief in the death taxes that people have been paying. 
What does this mean for homemakers? We build on the progress that we made last year in giving for the first time the homemakers of our country the ability to save for their retirement security. This time we are adding to that by allowing the full deductibility of that $2,000 regardless of what the spouse earns or has in a pension. 
How big are these few changes? Let me just give you an example. 
Under the old law, a single-income, married couple saving $2,250 a year--which was their maximum--would have, over 40 years, starting at the age of 25, when they are 65 approximately $629,000 in their retirement nest egg. But today, because of the bill we passed last year, and this bill combined, after 40 years of setting aside the $4,000 that they will be able to earn tax free, this couple will have $1.119 million in their nest egg, an increase in savings of almost $500,000. 
So, Mr. President, when you put this together with the death tax relief we are giving, you can really see that we are making a difference for ordinary Americans. Economic growth does result from lower tax breaks. History shows us that expanded opportunity and prosperity flourishes under such conditions. 
These are the foundations for our democracy. As a result of the passage of this historic bill, Americans will be keeping more of the money they earn in their pockets. 
Sometimes I hear debate on this floor when people are talking about these tax dollars as if it is Federal dollars. Federal tax dollars belong to the Americans who earn them. We want Americans to keep the money they earn rather than having to send it to Washington for someone here to make a decision for their families. 
We are going to create new jobs, new investments, lower interest rates, lower home mortgage payments, lower car payments, lower student loan payments, and higher income for working Americans. 
Mr. President, it is not everything we hoped it would be. But it is a significant downpayment for the hard-working American families. That is something that I hope we can add to as we look toward the future going into the 21st century. Hard-working Americans should be able to realize the American dream of working hard, doing better for their family, and being able to give their children a start that maybe they didn't have. 
That is what this bill will start the process of doing for American families. I hope we can continue to work even harder for them in the future. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you. I had hoped we would be able to accomplish the necessary Amtrak reforms within the context of this tax bill. I believe that Members of the Senate from both parties were prepared to do that. Given that Amtrak has warned us it could reach bankruptcy by the spring of 1998, the reforms embodied in S. 738, which include labor reforms and limits on liability, are simply critical. I am committed to moving S. 738 as soon as possible after the August recess. The Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee shares my commitment to provide honest legislative reforms in order to release the tax credits to Amtrak. I hope the majority leader will work with me to assure timely floor action.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for wanting to talk about this very important issue, because, as we speak on the floor here today, I hope that the negotiations are about to come to an end and we will give the American family the first tax break they have had in 16 years. 
I think it is an incredible thing to say that we haven't had a real tax cut in this country for 16 years. As hard-working Americans have tried to improve their quality of life, it just seems like their expenses have gone up so much that we now find that the spouses are working more, sometimes just to pay taxes. That is not what we want in this country. We want spouses to have the option of staying home, if they want to, and not make them work because they can't make ends meet. If we are going to continue the American dream of increasing our quality of life with each generation, we are going to have to pare Government down, balance the budget, make sure that people are not paying any more taxes than we have to have to run a Government. 
I think the time has come for us to take a leadership role. In fact, that is what Congress is trying to do. We came into power in this Congress, starting after the elections of 1994, with very clear goals: to make Government smaller; to let people keep more of the money they earn; to stop talking about money in Washington as if it belongs to us, but to understand that, no, it belongs to the people who work so hard to earn it, and let's let people have that money back to spend the way they would like to, rather than the way people in Washington dictate. These are the things that we came in to do. 
We are very close. I hope we will be able to close this loop by the end of this week so that the people of America will be able to feel that they have more of the money they earn in their pocketbooks, rather than writing a check to the IRS in Washington. 
Fifty years ago--just 50 years ago--Americans sent 2 cents of every dollar to Washington. Today, they send 25 cents of every dollar they earn to Washington, and that is just the Washington part. If you add their State and local taxes on top of that, most Americans pay 40 percent of what they earn; 40 cents of every dollar goes to the Government. 
Now, Mr. President, I think that is wrong. I think that means Government is too big, and I think the time has come to do something about it. I hope the President will agree with us, agree with the leadership that Congress is providing on this issue and has been providing for the last 3 years, to try to correct the inequity in our tax laws. 
The bill that we have passed in Congress, which we hope the President will sign, will give tax relief to Americans who are paying income taxes; if they have children, a $500 per child tax credit--not deduction, but credit. That is something that they will get right off the top--$500 per child. If you have two children, you would get $1,000 right off the top. That is going to cut most people's taxes in this country by a lot. 
When I have asked my constituents in newspaper articles what they would like to see changed, No. 1 is death tax reform. Most people don't think that death taxes are American, because the American dream is that, if you work hard, you should be able to pass what you have accumulated on to your children to give them a little bit better start. That is the American dream. Why should people be taxed on money they have accumulated and already paid taxes on? Why should they be taxed again when they pass what they have worked so hard for to their children? 
The worst thing is when their children have to sell part of the family farm, or all of it, just to pay inheritance taxes. That is not right, Mr. President, and we are trying to change that. In the agreement we are trying to get with the President, we would raise that inheritance tax credit to $1 million. We are going to try to keep people from having to sell assets that are not readily salable, because when you tell people that family farm is worth $500,000 or $1 million, but they can't earn enough to feed their 
family or to make life better for their family, it is very hard to tell them that they have inherited $1 million when it is land that is really unproductive. So we are trying to raise that, so that you will not have to sell equipment in a small business or a family farm that you could not possibly sell on the open market for $1 million. 
So we are going to try to make a dent in that death tax. We are going to try to make it easier for people to sell their homes, which is most people's biggest asset, without having to pay the huge taxes that they now do. We are going to try to cut the capital gains tax to 20 percent. 
Today, 41 percent of American families own stock. They own stock in a pension plan or a mutual fund. That is how they are investing for their retirement security. We want people to be able to have a capital gains tax cut so that if they need to sell a stock, they will not have to pay a 28-percent tax rate on the capital gain. In fact, more than 83 percent of capital gains are reported by households with less than $100,000 in income; 56 percent of capital gains are reported by families with less than $50,000 in income; nearly one-third of capital gains are reported by senior citizens. This will help the senior citizens, particularly those that are having a hard time getting by. If that senior citizen could sell their home or sell their stock without being penalized so heavily, it would give them a little bit better quality of life. 
We are trying to give more help to people who want to save for their retirement futures with individual retirement accounts. A lot of people say an individual retirement account is not really a retirement plan. But I want to just give you one example, because I worked very hard for homemakers to be able to set aside $2,000 a year for their retirement security, and they can do that now. They are able to set aside $2,000 a year, just as those who work outside the home. I want people to know that if a couple starts, at the age of 25, setting aside $2,000 a year per person, by the time they are 65, they will have over $1 million in their retirement nest egg. That is a retirement plan. If a couple can just save $2,000 a year per person, starting at the age of 25, they can have $1 million for their retirement security. That is another reason that we want to do away with that death tax, because we want middle-income people to be able to save enough for real retirement security and not have it taxed away when they die, so that their children will not be able to have that little bit extra. 
Our bill will even make IRA's better because it will make them deductible in most instances, and it will make it easier for people to set aside this $2,000 a year. So if we can do that, if we can have a better savings rate in this country, if we can make people more secure in their retirement, if we can give a capital gains tax cut and a death tax cut and $500 per child tax credit, not only will we have kept our promise to the American people, but we will have provided, for middle-income Americans who are working so hard to do better for their children, an opportunity in which they can say, yes, I can see the difference, I can see this tax relief. That is what we are working for in this Congress. 
I hope the President will not stop us from giving tax relief to hard-working, middle-income Americans, because if he does, he will be making a great mistake for the prosperity of our country. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that is critically needed to reduce the regulatory burdens on our doctor's offices today. 
In 1988, Congress passed the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act as a reaction to reports about laboratories that inaccurately analyzed PAP smears. CLIA 1988 was intended to address the quality of laboratory test performance. Unfortunately, the regulations enacted as a result of the CLIA 1988 legislation did not reflect the intent of the act. What in effect happened following the passage of CLIA 1988 was a series of regulations that substantially increased the amount of paperwork to be performed in physician offices and now ultimately increases the cost of health care to the patients. There has been little, if any, documentation that the CLIA 1988 reforms resulted in an improvement in patient care. 
In fact, a Texas Medical Association study showed that the annual cost of the labor and administrative overhead added by CLIA averages $4,435 per physician. This is in addition to the cost of registration, controls, proficiency testing, and inspection or accreditation. At a time when the entire health care industry is under pressure to control health care costs, the CLIA regulations not only subject physicians to increased administrative costs but also decrease the amount of time devoted to patient care. 
One Texas physician describes his CLIA inspection as being left with a feeling that nothing of any real value was accomplished. Dr. McBrayer from the Texas Panhandle relates the inspection: 
We were written up for such monumental things as the fact that I had not signed the procedure manual for one of our lab machines. Therefore, everything done on that machine, including the training, was out of compliance. The fact that the manufacturer's rep had come and trained the staff was to no avail. Everything was out of compliance because I didn't sign it. It didn't matter that they had learned how to use it. That was irrelevant. 
The CLIA amendments I am introducing will reduce the burdens on physicians who perform laboratory tests in their offices and thereby free up resources and time to dedicate to patient care. In Texas alone, of the physicians who provided testing services in their offices prior to CLIA, 27 percent have closed their office labs, and another 31 percent have discounted some type of testing, as a direct result of the CLIA 1988 reforms. This has resulted in some areas of Texas experiencing physician shortages. Many physicians are concerned about the possible consequences to patients caused by the decreased access to testing or the delay in obtaining results. In the wake of the health care reform debate, it is important to promote quality-driven cost-effective ways of delivery care. 
Mr. President, the CLIA 1997 amendments will not jeopardize the quality of laboratory testing. This bill will exempt physician office lab tests from the CLIA 1988 restrictions that have caused many physicians to discontinue simple laboratory tests due to the excessive amounts of regulation involved in the performance of these tests. The CLIA 1997 amendments that I am introducing today in the Senate will have the narrow purpose of ensuring that essential laboratory testing performed by physicians remain a viable diagnostic option for physicians and their patients without the excessive rules and administratively complex requirements that currently exist, and, most importantly, eliminate the strain the CLIA 1988 legislation is placing on patients in rural areas who are losing access to necessary testing and care. 
I hope that all my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation, which will reduce health care costs and improve the ability of patients to receive laboratory tests in a timely fashion while providing the much needed regulatory relief to physicians all over the country.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, as you know, there have been a number of severe tornadoes, wind storms, hurricanes and other wind-related disasters in recent months which have killed scores of people and destroyed communities. Earlier this year, the small town of Jarrell, TX, experienced a tornado that killed 29 people, seriously injured many others, and caused millions of dollars in damage to homes and businesses. The President's home State of Arkansas was also hit by a wind disaster that resulted in loss of life. The home State of the Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee, Senator Hollings is still rebuilding after the devastation of Hurricane Hugo in 1989. 
Mr. President, there is important work being done at Texas Tech University to help improve design construction of buildings to make them more resilient to windstorms. The laboratory building will include space to house a wind tunnel, a structural and building component testing lab and a material testing lab. These laboratory facilities will be used to develop innovative building frames and components that are resilient to extreme winds and windborne debris and yet are economically affordable. The research will also produce results to help cope with the environmental effects of wind erosion and dust and particulate generation. 
The Department of Commerce, through the National Institute of Standards and Technology, does wind research. NIST in particular is engaged in research that complements the Texas Tech project. 
The Committee has provided $276,852,000 for the scientific and technical research and services (core programs) appropriation of NIST. Part of the increased amount is for continued research, development, application and demonstration of new building products, processes, technologies and methods of construction for energy-efficient and environmentally compatible buildings. 
Senator Gregg, do you concur that it is the intent of the committee to direct $3.8 million in funds provided to NIST for scientific and technical research and services for cooperative research between NIST and Texas Tech University to pursue this important wind research?

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I thank the chairman and ranking member of this important subcommittee, because they have seen, early on, the importance and the benefits, for our present society and our future children and grandchildren, of space research continuing to move forward to find how we can live better through experimentation in space. That is going to help all of us now and in the future. They have seen this and I am so pleased that the Senate has continued to ratify its faith in space. 
I cannot imagine that anyone in the past few weeks who has seen the Pathfinder exploring Mars, the pictures that are being taken by Pathfinder on Mars that show it to look about like Arizona--I cannot imagine that anyone would not be so excited about what we are going to be able to learn from this kind of continued exploration. So I think now, of all times, people who are big thinkers, who have a vision for our country, would not want to stop our efforts to explore in space. 
We have talked about the importance of the health benefits that we have in the microgravity conditions in the space station before. Senator Mikulski and I have worked on osteoporosis and breast cancer, trying to increase the funding. You cannot, no matter what you do, no matter how much technology you have--you cannot reproduce the gravity conditions that are in space, on Earth. You cannot do it. Yet we know that those microgravity conditions will allow us to watch the development of breast cancer cells and of osteoporosis in this weightlessness and perhaps find the cure for breast cancer. We can learn how to combat osteoporosis in the older, especially women, but also men. In fact, NASA research already has led to these developments in health. 
The cool suit for Apollo missions now helps improve the quality of life of patients with multiple sclerosis. NASA technology has produced a pacemaker that can be programmed from outside the body. NASA has developed instruments to measure bone loss and bone density without penetrating the skin. NASA research has led to an implant for diabetes that is only 3 inches across. It provides more precise control of blood sugar levels and frees diabetics from the burden of daily insulin injections. 
I was reading about Professor James Langer's discoveries. He is from the University of California at Santa Barbara. He wrote in Physics Today that, `Metallurgists have long sought to predict and control alloy microstructures.' This may seem a little off the wall, but in fact it is very important when they are trying to find the very best substance with which to make products. He found that this is best done in the microgravity conditions because gravity affects the way things can solidify. 
So you take all these scientific things and boil them down to: How does it make my life better? In fact, it does make our life better. It does make our health better. It does give patients who have multiple sclerosis or osteoporosis a better chance to have a good quality of life. I reject the idea that we would walk away from the possibilities for the future for better health and better quality of life, but also the products that will be formed from the scientific developments that we make with the space station. Once we have the research, then we take that technology and we make the products. And that is what has kept our economy burgeoning and growing and able to accept the new, young people who come into it after they graduate from high school and college; accept the new people who come to our country, looking for the American dream. 
Part of the American dream is the commitment to research. It 
is the commitment to the future. An important part of that is space and the space station. That is why it is so important that we keep this commitment to space research, to NASA, to the space station. And the Senate has done that. In the 4 years that I have been in the U.S. Senate, I have been very proud of the big thinkers and their ability to see the difference between shutting off our future and our possibilities and saying we can save a small amount here, not thinking that for every $1 we invest we get a $2 return in our productivity and in our gross national product. 
I respect the Senator from Arkansas. I know he believes sincerely that this is a waste of taxpayer dollars. I wish, before he leaves the Senate, that he would come around to seeing the benefits of space research so maybe in his last year here he would say: You know what? I think there is a future, it is worth keeping, that it will make life better for our children, that it will provide scientific jobs for our children, that it will keep the technology and the research and the innovations in America, along with our international partners. Because this is not just people who write in Physics Today. This is quality of life for elderly people who have osteoporosis. This is for the prevention of breast cancer. This is for the scientific base that has made America what it is today. 
To walk away from that would be un-American and it would be unthinkable. So I hope our colleagues will give us the resounding vote that we have had in the past. I hope they will resolutely stand for the future, for our children and our grandchildren, and for a great America for years to come. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am pleased that I was able to work with Secretary Rubin and Ambassador Barshefsky's staff on this amendment. I am confident that they will use this directive from Congress to make progress--in the spirit of NAFTA--to correct the personal duty-free allowance inequity. I hope that it can be passed by unanimous consent when it is brought to the floor. 
Mr. President, my amendment addresses the disparities that exist in the personal duty-free exemption's of the United States, Mexico, and Canada. The United States provides each United States resident who is returning from Mexico and Canada with a personal exemption from duty on merchandise valued at up to $400 once every 30 days. This is the same duty exemption every U.S. citizen is afforded when they return to the United States from any country. Mexico, however, has a two-tiered duty-free allowance structure. If you are a Mexican resident and live within 25 kilometers of the border, when you return to Mexico at a land border crossing, you may only return with $50 in duty-free merchandise. This has become known as the $50 rule, and it is crippling businesses on the U.S. side of the border in Texas, California, New Mexico, and Arizona. If you are a Mexican resident bringing more than $50 in merchandise, you must pay a 22.8-percent duty rate. 
This rule, Mr. President, makes it prohibitively expensive for a Mexican resident to purchase a washing machine, refrigerator, electronics, furniture, or any item costing more than $50 in the United States. In U.S. border communities, countless small businesses have closed their doors and thousands of American jobs have been lost. Our larger retailers are also suffering, as Mexicans who used to travel across the border for goods are now limited to purchasing them on their side of the border. 
Mr. President, my amendment is very simple. It directs the United States Trade Representative and Secretary of the Treasury to begin discussions with their counterparts in Mexico and Canada to achieve parity in the duty-free allowance structure of the three NAFTA countries. These officials will report to Congress within 90 days on the progress they are making to correct these disparities. If the situation remains unchanged, in 6 months these officials will propose appropriate legislation and action to bring the United States duty-free allowance into conformance with the allowance levels established by Mexico and Canada. 
Mr. President, this is an important issue for my constituents, and I look forward to this amendment's adoption.

What we have learned and what we have done for quality of life and for health research since his first foray into space has been, perhaps, more than even he could have dreamed would happen. 
I am very proud he is a supporter of the space station and the NASA Program and knows that what he did in the beginning is certainly not the end and certainly, I hope, we can continue the legacy that he has left for us.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we have probably the best relations with Mexico than we have had in this country in a long, long time. I think NAFTA has added to the good will and the trade between our nations. But there is one part of our trade relationship that is not at parity and is not in the spirit of NAFTA, and that is the exemptions for personal goods or for buying when you are on the border between Mexico and the United States. 
As a matter of fact, there is not parity in the exemption, and I think that is against the spirit of NAFTA. I am hoping that we will be able to change that, and that is what my amendment will attempt to do. 
The amendment is very simple. It directs the U.S. Trade Representative and the Secretary of the Treasury to begin discussions with their counterparts in Mexico to achieve parity in the duty-free allowance structure of all of our NAFTA countries, and the concern is between Mexico and the United States. 
These officials will report to Congress within 90 days on the changes they are making to correct these disparities. If the situation remains unchanged, in 6 months these officials will propose appropriate legislation to bring the United States' duty-free allowance to conform to the allowance levels established by Mexico and Canada. 
Let me give an example of what is wrong and why this disparity exists. The United States provides that each U.S. resident returning from Mexico has a personal exemption from duty on merchandise valued at up to $400 once every 30 days. Mexico, however, has a two-tier duty-free allowance. If you are a resident in a 25-kilometer strip along Mexico's northern border, and you return from the United States at a land border crossing, you may only return with $50 in duty-free merchandise. 
This has become known as the $50 rule. It is crippling business in our border retailers on the U.S. side of the border in Texas, California, New Mexico and Arizona, because if you are a Mexican resident bringing in more than $50, you must pay a 22.8 percent duty rate. Now, this makes it prohibitively expensive for a Mexican resident to purchase a washing machine, a refrigerator, any kind of electronics or any item costing more than $50, so it is inequitable. 
We believe in the spirit of NAFTA, in parity, in equity, any rule you want to apply, that it should just be the same. We have been talking about this for 3 1/2 years, since I came to the Senate. The border retailers in Texas told me that the $50 rule was being enforced by the Mexican Government. I have talked to the officials of the Mexican Government about this. I truly believe that President Zedillo intended to do something about it. He said he was going to right after he was elected. But we all know that the peso crisis occurred, and surely he had so many things on his plate that this was not on the front burner. I understood that. 
Now the Mexican economic situation is stabilized, and certainly, I think, it is on its way to full recovery, and I think this matter of equity and parity must be addressed. That is why my amendment would just ask the U.S. Trade Representative and the Secretary of the Treasury to begin these discussions, to report back, and if they are not able to make progress, then tell us what legislation should be passed to make this happen. 
That is the amendment. I hope both sides will agree this is in everyone's best interests, and I hope we will be able to vote on this or have it accepted early next week and that we can begin the process of making sure that the spirit, as well as the letter, of NAFTA is applied to both sides of our relationship with the country of Mexico. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay the amendment aside, and we will take it up at the appropriate time.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise to speak on the Dodd-McCain amendment that will put this charade of certification aside and try something new in the war on drugs. I think, Madam President, all of us want the same result; we want to stop the illegal drugs from coming into our country. Today, 13 million Americans use illegal drugs; 1.5 million use cocaine, 600,000 use heroin, and 10 million use marijuana. 
Madam President, it is coming in through Mexico. Twenty percent of the heroin, 70 percent of the marijuana in this country, and 50 to 70 percent of the cocaine comes in through Mexico. This is under the process we have now--certification--which is insulting, which does not have any positive consequences and, I submit, really only has negative consequences. 
Madam President, how is the best way for us to attack the issue of illegal drugs coming in from Mexico? Is it to insult our neighbor? Is it to berate them? What does that give us? It gives us a hostile neighbor. Is that going to help? I hear people on this floor talking about Mexico as if it is 2,000 miles from our border. Madam President, Mexico is our border. We share family ties, we share a trade relationship, we share problems for both of our countries in illegal drug transit. It is bad for Mexico, it is bad for the United States. And I submit that we share friendship. We know Mexico is not doing enough; they know it. I have met with President Zedillo on this issue. I am convinced that he is trying to do everything he can. He is attacking this issue. Berating his country is not going to help the situation. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote for the Dodd-McCain amendment. Let us try something new. Let us look for positive results in a partnership, not an adversarial relationship that cannot help us. It will not solve our problem and it could make worse problems on our border than we could ever foresee. Let's do something different; let's give it a chance. Thank you. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I assure the distinguished chairman, if the other two pending amendments' authors come to the floor, I will yield. 
I wanted to speak about an amendment that has just been agreed to. The chairman offered the Hutchison-Lott-Lieberman-McCain-Warner amendment earlier. It is something we have been working on, actually, for the last few days, trying to come up with language that everyone could support. In fact, everyone has now agreed to support it, so it is a sense of the Senate with 100 percent approval of language that says we are very concerned about the situation in Bosnia, we are concerned about the indicted war criminals not being brought to justice. All of us are concerned about that, because, under the Dayton accords, the three parties to the agreement, the Bosnian Serbs, the Bosnian Muslims, and the Croats, were supposed to do that and it has not happened. 
At the same time, our amendment states that the administration should consult closely and in a timely manner with the Congress on the NATO-led Stabilization Force's mission concerning the apprehension of indicted war criminals, including any changes in the mission which could affect American forces. I think this is a very responsible statement for the Senate to make because it is very important if there is a change in mission with regard to the apprehension of war criminals and if American forces are going to be involved, that the Congress understand that fully because that is not our understanding today nor is it part of the Dayton accords. 
So, having been burned in Somalia when there was mission creep without the complete accord of Congress, I think it is important that we learn from history and take the responsible role that Congress should take. 
I am concerned that we do this in a very, very clear thinking, responsible way. I look at the Washington Times from this morning where the headline is, `Serbs Threaten End Of Dayton Pact.' It has a quote from an ex-teacher--an ex-teacher. He says: `I used to wave to them, the NATO troops, and had my little daughter wave when they pass by. But now I told her to spit at them.' 
I think we have to understand that what we do has consequences. I hope NATO will carefully look at how we go about changing any kind of mission. Certainly we expect, in Congress, to have a role in that. But I also think it is important that we go back to the Dayton accords. The Dayton accords provide the three parties will apprehend war criminals. I hope that is what happens, because there were heinous crimes committed--heinous crimes. No civilized nation, no civilized person could look at what happened in Srebrenica--it was clearly an assassination of men and boys. It was ethnic cleansing. That's what it actually was. We ought to stand against that. We do stand against it. 
But, let's make sure that as we go forward we do it in a measured, responsible way so what we do is helpful, that we keep the Dayton accords, and that we do not have mission creep with American troops that would put them in harm's way, or in a combat situation if they are not prepared--if we are not prepared--for that eventuality. 
So I think we have taken a responsible step. I appreciate the work of the chairman. I appreciate the work of the Democrats and Republicans on this issue where we do want to speak with a unified voice. It is important that we do. That is what we have done today.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will shortly offer an amendment to this bill. It is an amendment that many of us are working on. We worked on it last week for the Defense authorization bill. It deals with Bosnia and exactly what our mission is in Bosnia, and the possibility that we are looking at a change to that mission without congressional consultation. 
I want to step back and talk about U.S. foreign policy in general over the last 4 years since I have been a Member of the U.S. Senate. 
What concerns me is the lack of focus and the lack of stability in our foreign policy that, unfortunately, creates a vacuum that can be filled by either our allies or our adversaries. Since the last 4 years have seen many missions with U.S. troops both under the U.N. umbrella and the NATO umbrella, I think it is important for us to take a step back and look at what happens when there is a vacuum. 
As I have observed since President Clinton has been in office, it seems that someone is always wanting the United States to do more. Sometimes it is our allies asking us to send more aid, put more troops on the ground, go into police missions--missions to capture; not kill. If you look at the use of our troops over the last 4 years, we have, in fact, been drawn into conflicts sometimes not really even knowing why we were involved. 
Starting with Somalia. Somalia was a U.N. mission. Our mission was to feed starving people and starving children in Somalia because we heard the reports coming back and saw the pictures of starving people. No one in the world could look at those pictures and not say we have to do something. So under the U.N. auspices, we did go to feed the starving people. 
But then there was a mission creep--from feeding starving people to capturing a warlord, Aideed. Because we had a mission creep that Congress was not prepared for, we lost 18 Army Rangers without even realizing that the U.S. mission had changed. What was the result? The result is that Aideed outlasted the United States. There was not much of a change in Somalia. Yet, we lost 18 Army Rangers. 
Then consider Haiti. Under the guise of installing a democratically elected President, United States forces in a U.N. mission invaded the island of Haiti. We spent $1 billion, American Defense dollars, dollars that we took from other Defense priorities, whether it was training or technology or new equipment. 
Today we are seeing the unraveling of the democratically elected President and that regime in Haiti--$1 billion later. 
Then we move to Bosnia. It seems that, since the day I walked onto the Senate floor in 1993, we have been trying to deal with the unrest, the war, and the atrocities in the former Yugoslavia. We started by trying to lift the arms embargo on one part of the population in the former Yugoslavia, because other elements of that population had arms. Some had gotten their arms even though there was an arms embargo. But the Muslim population received very few arms. Many of us in the Senate felt that if we could lift that arms embargo and let the Muslims have a fair fight, perhaps that war would have ended a lot sooner. But the President refused--refused--to provide the U.S. leadership needed to lift the U.N. arms embargo. 
Then we saw in 1995 a massacre of Muslim men and boys. We think as many as 10,000 died in Srebrenica and other places. It was clear that the U.N. mission could not do what it was supposed to do, which was to keep some sort of peace in Bosnia. We reached the Dayton peace accords and NATO entered Bosnia. The United States was pushed into putting U.S. troops on the ground. I believe they were pushed to do it because there was a vacuum of leadership and our allies said the only way that we could show our 
interest and support of Bosnia and peace is to have troops on the ground. Many of us felt that there were other things that we could do besides putting our troops on the ground that would have been helpful to peace in Bosnia--including putting our money into helping the Bosnian people build an infrastructure and economic base that would have led, I think, to a better peace settlement than we are seeing right now. We are seeing a bubbling up of the hostilities in Bosnia despite the fact that our troops are there. We are seeing the bubbling up of hostilities because there is still no economic base. It is that economic base, I think, that would provide hope for the future. 
But, instead, the President said we would put troops on the ground to keep the warring parties apart for 1 year--for 1 year. At the end of 1995, the President said we would be there for 1 year--until the end of 1996. As the end of that year approached, the President said we need to stay there--doing the same thing, not seeing much progress. He said it would be June 30, 1998 before we could withdraw. The Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen, reiterated when he came into office in his Senate hearing that it would in fact be June 1998. 
Just last week in the Senate took up a resolution to confirm that June 30, 1998 will be the end. We did so so all participants can count on it and they can start making plans for it, so that there won't be a vacuum that anyone else could fill with mandates for the United States. But the President has now said that he thinks it would be wrong for the Senate to confirm June 30, 1998 as the withdrawal date.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to support what the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin is trying to do, because I think it is most important that the U.S. Senate speak at this very crucial time to say, let's set a mission, let's set a timetable, let's be very clear with our allies about what that is going to be and, Mr. President, let's keep our word. Let's keep our word when we say this is our mission, this is our role, this is our responsibility, we are going to be there for you and we are going to leave June 30, 1998. 
The chronology is very clear. We have been trying to help the people of the former Yugoslavia for years. Many of us believed that they had the right to have a fair fight, but they didn't have a fair fight because part of that country was held to an arms embargo that did not allow them to fight for their lives, their families, their land and their sovereignty. We put amendment upon amendment on the floor to give those people a chance to have a fair fight: Lift the arms embargo on the Muslims, let them have a fair fight. But we could never adopt that--actually, we did adopt it, but we could never get the attention of the President. 
In 1995, we saw the horror of horrors, the massacre at Srebrenica 2 years ago where we believe, and are not even sure yet how many, but we believe as many as 10,000 Bosnians were systematically murdered. 
At the end of 1995, we sent in troops to keep the warring parties apart and try to have a peace which was put together at Dayton. We said that we would be there for a year at the end of 1995. At the end of 1996, the President said that it would be June 1998, and the Secretary of Defense was very clear that we would set the mission and we would set the timetable. 
What the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin is now trying to do is say, once again, we expect that timetable to be fair warning to everyone of what our intentions are. I think it is very necessary for the Senate to speak on this, Mr. President, because we are seeing an alarming mission creep happening in that country as we speak. 
I think our allies in NATO have every right to go forward with the missions which they have laid out. The mission of the United States has been made very clear, that if a war criminal is there in front of us, of course, we would capture that person. But we committed, and it has been said as late as this week by both General Joulwan and Wes Clark, who is the incoming head of NATO, that our mission would not be to go out and capture the war criminals, not because we don't think they should be captured--of course they should--and the responsibility under Dayton for that is with the parties, it is with the Bosnian Government. I think we should do everything we can to help provide a framework for the capturing of these people, but American troops should not be part of that kind of effort, because we are the targets. We are the superpower. I want us to be helpful, to bring peace to Bosnia, and I want those people who committed those atrocities to be brought to justice. It is unthinkable that within the last 2 years we would have seen the kind of atrocities that were perpetrated by those indicted at The Hague who were representing the Bosnian Serbs. So I want those people to be captured. I think it is important that they be brought to justice. 
But, Mr. President, if we are going to be part of any such operation, it is incumbent on this administration to come back to Congress and change the mission rather than having a mission creep, such as we saw in Somalia where we were not aware that we had changed the mission from feeding starving children to capturing a warlord, and it cost us 18 Rangers, because we are different. Our people who came back from Somalia said that when our troops would go with others down the streets of Somalia, the people would not be hostile to the Turkish troops, they would not be hostile to other troops, but when the Americans came forward, the hostilities would erupt. 
We are a major superpower in the world. We are the only superpower probably that has a history of not being aggressive toward trying to take over other governments. We want to be a beacon for what is good in the world. So I think it is important that we are helpful to our allies without being in 
every firefight. I hope that we can set a standard and a mission that will uphold those principles, that we are the beacon of the world for what is good. I hope we can come to a bipartisan agreement that will assure that our mission is clear. That is why I hope that we can work with the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, in his mission to be very clear in speaking as a United States Senate that we are going to keep our word in Bosnia, that we want to help the people there, we want to help them build their infrastructure, we want them to have new factories, we want them to have a peace that is based on economic security. I think the money that we are spending there is very important and perhaps if we are clear in our mission and our timetable, we will be able to show that economic stability will produce a lasting peace, perhaps better than just keeping warring parties apart. 
I think we have to be very careful as we move forward. I think we have to be clear in our mission, and we have to keep our word. We have to do what we say we are going to do, and our mission has been reiterated by our Department of Defense and our military leaders. I don't want the Senate to go forward without speaking on this issue. I hope that we can work with Senator Feingold, Senator Warner, Senator McCain, Senator Levin, Senator Thurmond, Senator Inhofe, and myself to make sure that our mission is clear and our timetable is set. 
Senator Lott, our majority leader, has been very clear with all of our allies and with us and to the press that the June 30, 1998, timetable is real, and if we don't speak forcefully, then by inches, we could change a mission that would be dangerous to our troops and, most important, dangerous to the steps we have taken in the Dayton peace accords, because if we have a flareup because of a change in mission, it could result in tearing down everything we have done so far in that country. It could decimate the Dayton peace accords if we allow a mission creep to go forward, a timetable to get fuzzy that we have not approved and have been clear that is what the United States commitment is. 
I hope that we will come to terms on Senator Feingold's amendment. I hope that we will come to terms on the mission that are very clear with regard to war criminals and what our role will be, such as the amendment that Senator Warner and I and others are working on with the help from Senator Lott and Senator McCain, Senator Inhofe. 
It is very clear that when a superpower speaks, our allies, as well as our adversaries, should be able to count on our word being good. Our word on when we will leave Bosnia should be good. It is June 30, 1998. The President has said so; the Secretary of Defense has said so. 
So let's make sure we support that and we do everything to prepare that country for peace. Ratcheting up the hostilities is a perilous course. I hope this Senate will speak for America so that we can remain the beacon of the superpower that does not have a personal interest but wants the world to do what is right. That is our mission, and I hope the Senate will speak. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from Wisconsin for his courage in pursuing this matter. I want to thank the Senators from Michigan, from Arizona, from South Carolina, from Rhode Island, and from Oklahoma who are working on this to make sure that we have something that everyone can support. I think it is a very strong message to the administration that sets out the concerns of the Senate. I think with what the House did on this issue, it is going to be very clear that Congress expects a June 30 exit date for the United States. I think, certainly, if something occurs, that we should be able to discuss after that time, but I think if we plan from today, we are giving plenty of notice to everyone what our intentions are. 
I think the most important issue that we must address in the next year is the issue that was promised to Senator Dole and Senator McCain by the President. That is that there would be arming and training of the police force, of the Bosnians, so that they would be able to have a sense of order in their country when the NATO forces would withdraw. I am concerned that that training and arming is not taking place, and that we may come upon the June 30 deadline for our exit and they won't be fully supplied with policemen and with the armed services that will be able to keep the peace. We have a year to correct that. I hope that the administration will make sure that our word is kept, that we would have a good solid police force that would be able to keep the peace in Bosnia after June 30, 1998. 
But I think the sense of the Senate provides for other options, other alternatives, as we have stated in the sense of the Senate, that if, in fact, it is not finally a peaceful situation, that the United States could leave and perhaps a NATO force without the United States could stay. And we are going to be there in a support role. We have always been there in a support role for peacekeeping. 
But I think we must keep our word. The Senate has spoken. The House has spoken, and now is the time for the administration to hear the message and get along with the business of getting an exit strategy, putting these people in control of their government, giving them the training that they need to be able to sustain that peace themselves. 
I appreciate very much the very bipartisan support for this sense of the Senate. I hope that the administration will hear our words and begin the strategy for the June 1998 exit of U.S. troops. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, as soon as this is worked out, I will not hold up the vote, but I just want to commend everyone for getting this very important bill through the Senate. The distinguished committee chairman, Senator Thurmond, our wonderful President pro tempore, has worked hardest to make sure that we have the armed services authorization with the policies in place that we need to provide for the strong national defense of this country. I commend him and his ranking member, Senator Levin, and all of those on the committee who have tried to make sure that we are using our tax dollars in an efficient way but with the foremost goal of providing the security of our country and for the support of the troops both in training, quality of life, and the technology that we need to make sure that our troops are the safest they can be when they are in the field and that they have the best equipment of any troops in the world, so that when they are called on to fight for the security of our Nation, they will be able to do the job. 
I commend the committee and I commend its leaders. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the solemn importance of the investigative hearings that have just begun by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee under the leadership of the distinguished chairman, Senator Thompson, and the distinguished ranking member, Senator Glenn. 
While it is unfortunate that some in Congress have attempted to portray this investigation as an effort by one side to make political hay, I want to briefly discuss why these hearings are crucial for all Americans of whatever party or ideology. 
Through the hard work and bipartisan effort of the Governmental Affairs Committee, there has been evidence uncovered and indications of much more evidence to come that our American political system was put up for sale and that an alarming number of foreign interests were ready and willing to buy. While there have been indications of a wide array of illegal activities in connection with the 1996 Presidential election, much of which the public is aware, Senator Thompson yesterday indicated that there may be much the American people do not yet know. 
The chairman stated yesterday that his committee has evidence that points to a concerted effort by the Chinese Government to improperly or illegally influence American foreign policy toward that country and toward Taiwan. Mr. President, if this is, indeed, the case, then in my view the American people must know the truth. They have a right to know whether the U.S. Government and U.S. officials who were charged with the duty of serving the interests of the American people instead served their own special interests and the interests of others.

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I strongly support the provision in the bill that deals with tax-exempt status of State workers' compensation funds. Senator Gramm and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the text of a letter we received earlier this month from the Governor of the State of Texas urging us to clarify the Federal tax statutes to maintain the tax-exempt status of this fund in light of the important role it plays in stabilizing the market for workers' compensation insurance in Texas.
