 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues for taking the time today to consider this legislation which is so important to my region. 
I introduced The Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act GLFWRA of 1997 as S. 659 in the Senate in April of 1997, in coordination with the introduction of the companion bill, H.R. 1481, in the House by Congressman Steve LaTourette. It's been a long process, but one in which bipartisan and bicameral cooperation at every step of the process served to create a better and stronger bill to serve the needs of the Great Lakes region. 
The Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act has eight Senate sponsors, including myself, and twenty-eight of our colleagues on the House are also cosponsors. This bill represents the consensus of a diverse collaboration of tribal, state, federal and international agencies with jurisdiction over the management of fish and wildlife resources of the Great Lakes. The bill also has received favorable review and broad support of organizations throughout the Great Lakes region for the approach it takes toward restoration of the ecological integrity of the Great Lakes ecosystem. 
The primary purpose of the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act is to implement proposals that address recommendations put forth by the Great Lakes Fishery Resources Restoration Study. To this end, the Act reauthorizes the existing Great Lakes Coordination and Great Lakes Fishery Resources Offices. The bill also sets up a proposal review committee under the guidance of the existing Council of Lake Committees to review grant proposals and identify projects of the highest priority for the restoration of the fish and wildlife resources of the Great Lakes Basin. The Act encourages, supports, and coordinates Federal and non-federal cooperative habitat restoration and natural resource management programs in the Great Lakes Basin. 
The Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act represents a new generation of environmental legislation, one that recognizes the complexity and inter-relatedness of ecosystems. This act seeks to address natural resource management in a comprehensive and conscientious manner by building partnerships among the Great Lakes states, U.S. and Canadian governments, and native American Tribes. Through regional cooperation, I believe we can address the environmental and economic concerns of the Great Lakes Basin and continue on the road towards the recovery of this precious natural and national resource. By passing this legislation, we in the Congress will be taking the right next step toward responsible stewardship of the Great Lakes as we venture into the new millennium. 
This fall, as I look back on the earth from space, I will be sure to look down on the Great Lakes. I know that they will be a cleaner, safer place for both humans and wildlife to live than they were at the time of my last flight because of the efforts we have made over the past decades. With the passage of this legislation, I will also be sure that they will continue to become even cleaner, safer places where fish and wildlife communities, and the human communities who enjoy them can continue to prosper.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today as we consider the fiscal year 1999 Defense authorization conference to draw the Senate's attention to what appears to be a brewing controversy over the state of our military's readiness. Yesterday, the Committee on Armed Services held a hearing with Joint Chiefs to discuss some readiness issues that recently have been brought to the committee's attention. I believe there are very legitimate concerns regarding recruiting and retention trends, increased Personnel Tempo, as well as pay and benefits comparability, spare parts availability, and growing depot and real property maintenance issues to be examined. 
I agree that we must pay very close attention to these issues because we are asking our men and women in uniform to do more today than we ever have during peacetime. We are asking them to do more, not so much with `less,' but with fewer and fewer people and that is placing a strain on our military. I believe we must proceed very, very carefully before any further reductions are considered. 
I am concerned that our problem may be more basic than these issues I have just mentioned. I have come to this Senate floor many times over the years and have spoken repeatedly in the Armed Services Committee to voice my concerns over the drawdown in our end strength. In my view, I don't believe we should have gone below 1.6 million in our active duty end strength. 
I am concerned that with fewer than 1.6 million in end strength our military strategy becomes a bit of a myth, Mr. President. I don't think we can fight two contingencies today with an end strength of 1.4 million. I'm not confident we could repeat Desert Storm and embark on a second contingency if something broke out in Korea. 
1.6 million is not a number I pulled from thin air. Rather, it is based on a time-proven formula that requires a force that basically is divided in three. One third of the force is forward deployed and fighting, one third of the force is training for deployment or in transit and one third of the force is maintaining the other two-thirds--manning the Pentagon, plowing the runways, etc. 
In the Persian Gulf, we had about 575,000 Americans deployed. That's one major regional contingency or one major theater war (MTW) as we are now calling them. To repeat Operation Desert Storm, we need an end strength of at least 1.6 million. Today, we appear to be falling below the manning levels necessary to conduct our peacetime operations let alone credibly maintain a combat force capable of carrying out two nearly simultaneous major operations. 
Mr. President, let me add at this point that I believe those commitments are important. We have alliance deployments in Japan, Korea, and Europe. We are conducting peacekeeping operations on the Kuwait border and in the Western Sahara. Our so-called `Operations Other Than War' also require American service members to be deployed to the Sinai, to Bosnia, to the Persian Gulf in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and on the border between Peru and Ecuador. We've had deployments to Rwanda, Angola, Somalia, Haiti and Cambodia to name a few other operations that have all contributed to the services' high OPTEMPO and PERSTEMPO. I support these operations. 
We literally have saved millions of lives through our presence in troubled areas of the world and I believe that that is an appropriate use of our military forces. The cold war may be over but the killing has not stopped. The United States has no territorial ambitions but we do need to remain engaged. The constant demands on our personnel around the world, however, are not without consequence. We are asking the men and women in our military services to be deployed for longer periods and more often than we have in the past. They have served well through a difficult and turbulent period. 
I understand, and I hope my colleagues understand, the rationale for continued reductions in our end strength. End strength cuts are being made in order to generate cash to pay for modernization programs. I agree that our service members deserve the best and most modern equipment available but I do not agree that reductions should be made simply to generate cash. Even if modernization programs can reduce manpower requirements in the long term, in the near term, we still need people to carry out our important worldwide commitments. The time has come to step back and consider how we are going to achieve our goals. We may need more funding for modernization. In my view, we also need funding for more people. 
We also need to impose more discipline before simply raising the topline. We should have given the Department base closure authority so we could get unneeded bases off the books. And we should impose more discipline on ourselves. This year we added about $2 billion in items that the Services didn't request in the procurement and research and development accounts. We added over $600 million in military construction add-ons. It is only in the past few years that the Congress has agreed that when adding military construction projects, those projects should at least be projects that the Defense Department wants. Even meeting that criteria, I am not sure that annually adding hundreds of millions of dollars for military construction projects just to `bring home the bacon' is necessarily the best approach to establishing and funding national security priorities. 
I am supporting this conference report because on balance I believe it is a good conference report but I do believe that the Congress needs to focus more carefully on true spending priorities particularly as we are learning that there may be some readiness funding problems.

 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a joint resolution commemorating the Inspector General Act in the year of its 20th anniversary. The Governmental Affairs Committee, on which I serve as Ranking Minority Member, has a long and bipartisan history with the IG community. In fact, I am very proud that I was an original sponsor of the IG Act and author of the 1988 amendments, both of which have played a major role in making our government function more efficiently, effectively, and with greater trust and confidence on the part of the American people. So, it is fitting that the Senate and House note this anniversary. 
Throughout government, IGs have had tremendous success. I note just some of these accomplishments as follows, from the latest (1996) PCIE report: 
Inspector General (IG) investigations led to $1.5 billion in `recoveries' in 1995. (This is money which has been recovered by the Government from people who have attempted to defraud it). In addition, based on IG recommendations, agency managers agreed to cancel, or seek reimbursements of, $2.3 billion from contractors or grantees in 1995. Also based on IG recommendations, managers changed how they planned to spend $10.4 billion to maximize return on the Federal dollar. Overall, between 1981-1994, IG's reported $340 billion in recoveries & funds put to better use from their efforts. 
In addition to IG work on program improvements, and the figures cited above, the report compiles other important IG accomplishments from FY 1995: $26.8 billion in recommendations that funds be put to better use; $7.2 billion in questioned costs; 14,122 successful prosecutions; 2,405 personnel actions; and 4,234 suspensions and debarments of persons or firms doing business with the Government. 
These facts suggest that IGs are doing the job we intended them to do, in spite of the fact that they are operating in a very difficult and more complex environment. The data also support the fact that the IG's first responsibility continues to be program and fiscal integrity; they are not `tools' of management. Even though, in this day and age, IGs need to make themselves `relevant' to both Congress and the agency, they first must help to make good programs work better, target those most vulnerable to waste and fraud, and help achieve savings wherever they can find them. The record proves this is clearly what the IG's have been about. 
The progress I have mentioned is particularly important since, if anything, the IG's role has only become more difficult in a new political culture dedicated to improving management. With the passage of the CFO Act, the Government Management Reform Act (GMRA), and the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), IGs have inherited some new authority and some new duties. They now have some responsibility to ensure that we have accurate, reliable, and complete financial information on which to base our policy decisions and, down the road, which measure how well each program achieves its goal and at what actual cost. In that context, IGs have a unique role in helping to solve management problems throughout the federal government. The test of their success in this new mission is much like the one applied to their old one and--as I have indicated--the measure of their success is already evident. 
As I approach my last months as a United States Senator, I look back with great pride on the accomplishments we have made so far among the more than 60 statutory IGs. I am the first one to admit that the IGs do not function perfectly. In fact, any government operation can always stand improvement. But I strongly believe that we now have in place a fair, effective, and useful--if partial--solution to some very serious management problems in government. To me, this represents a singularly important success for the Congress and the American people, and one upon which I am hopeful we will continue to build into the 21st century and beyond. 
I hope all Senators will join me in supporting this important resolution.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss S. 2176, the `Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998' introduced this summer by Senator Thompson, Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee with jurisdiction over the Act. I want to thank Senator Levin for managing the bill today. I also want to thank Chairman Thompson for the accommodations his staff has afforded Democratic staff in the negotiations leading up to this brief debate. We, on our side of the aisle, were blindsided, to say the least, by the filing of the cloture petitions last week as staff were negotiating the terms of a unanimous consent agreement on, and the substance of a managers' amendment to this very bill. 
As we know, the Vacancies Act governs the temporary filling of what we call `advise and consent' or PAS positions (Presidentially-appointed, Senate-confirmed) in the Executive Branch. As I have said many times before, I remain concerned about two important goals of any new law we pass: (1) As Senator Byrd--the best expert this body has on Senate procedure and constitutional law--has repeatedly noted, this is one of the Senate's most important and serious constitutional prerogatives in that we are expected--required, in fact, under the Constitution--to provide our advise and consent on the nominees the President submits to us for our consideration; and (2) maintaining the smooth functioning of government with the large number of vacancies we seem to have to deal with. On one hand, we have more slots in government than ever before which means more vacancies. On the other hand, our confirmation process is long and tedious keeping acting officials (many of whom are very qualified to fill their slots) in their positions for longer than we intend. 
Combined, these concepts make the continuity of the functioning of government a challenge to achieve, but certainly not impossible. We should be creating a process that reflects reality and provides the proper safeguards and enforcement mechanisms. 
I believe the bill as it stands now improves on current law, but I think there is still work to be done. The White House has issued a veto letter on this bill. While I consider this important legislation, I remain concerned about many of the issues raised by the Administration, and I have filed amendments to address many of these concerns. 
For instance, are we being too limiting in who can become an acting official? Current law mandates that an acting official can be the first assistant or anyone the President designates. We will be narrowing current law to include the first assistant or any PAS official the President designates. The importance of this change is that in the absence of a first assistant or at the President's discretion, we will be requiring someone whom the Senate has already approved to fill a slot for which the Congress has required the Senate's advise and consent. But do we really want a President to designate a PAS from HUD to assume the additional responsibilities of a PAS position at Department of Education? Or vice versa? Do we want these folks who already have plenty of responsibility as it is to assume the added responsibility of a second position? With the vetting process taking longer and the noteworthy downsizing in government that has occurred over the last 6 years, perhaps it's time to consider a hybrid category of who can be a temporary acting official. 
I intend to offer an amendment to add a third category which would include qualified individuals of a certain level or higher who are already within an agency in which a vacancy occurs. Such individuals--who could include high-level members of the civil service--would be familiar with the agency, its processes and culture; possess some institutional memory; and be fully capable of the task. This gives the President a larger pool from which to choose an acting official, particularly in a case where there is no first assistant, and the President must turn to another PAS official to temporarily fill the slot. In addition, it allows a larger category of who can act at the beginning of an administration to keep government functioning at a time when there 
are not many PAS officials. I think this amendment is critical to the success of the legislation, and I hope Senators on both sides will give it serious consideration. I will not be able to support the bill if this issue is not addressed in it. 
In addition, I hope to offer amendments which would give the President the authority to extend the period for a temporary official if a case of national interest arose and a nomination for the position had not yet been sent up. In such cases, under the amendment the President upon certification to Congress of the particular national interest--be it national security, natural disaster, economic instability or public health and safety--would be able to extend the temporary appointment one time for 90 days. 
Finally, I hope to offer an amendment which would further decrease the requirement for a first assistant who will be an acting officer and the nominee to 45 days. At the beginning of a new administration, there may not be enough PAS officials to perform their own duties let alone those of another position. This will be the case particularly where there is a change in party in the White House. In addition, because of the restriction in the bill on first assistants who serve in acting capacities who will also be the nominees, the administration will be required to fill the first assistant slot as well as the vacant PAS slot. My amendment would allow first assistants to be appointed, act in the vacant slot for 45 days and then be nominated to fill the slot on a permanent basis before the end of the 60-day period for which extensions are granted at the beginning of a new administration. 
I hope that other amendments that may be offered which would impose the same constraints on the Senate as this legislation would impose on an administration will also have a fair opportunity to be considered. While some see no connection between the Vacancies Act and the responsibilities of the Senate to act on nominations, I believe the two are inextricably linked. I do not believe we can go forward in reforming one process until we commit to reforming our own. 
I want to note that as the negotiations on this bill proceeded, we were not only looking to see how this law would operate in this second-term Democratic administration. Indeed, some day this law will be utilized by a Republican administration. With this in mind, we attempted to help craft a fair piece of legislation. 
In that vein, I want to emphasize again that the process by which this bill has come to the floor for such limited debate with no opportunity for action prior to the cloture vote, is discouraging both for our faith in a fair process and for the fate of this legislation.

 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, today, I introduce the Power Marketing Administration Reform Act, a bill that will require the Power Marketing Administrations, or PMAs, to sell power at market rates. The Tennessee Valley Authority, or TVA, will also be included in the bill's requirements. My bill is a companion to H.R. 3518, introduced by Representatives Bob Franks (R-NJ) and Marty Meehan (D-MA) in the House. 
PMAs have failed to recover their operating costs for too long. My colleagues in the Senate are well aware of my activities to rectify this discrepancy that has brought about a fiscal shortfall and significant environmental damage. I have been joined by many in this Chamber in requesting reports from the Government Accounting Office, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Energy, the federal department that oversees the operation of the PMAs. All of the reports on the PMAs and the TVA have indicated severe financial problems. 
According to the Congressional Budget Office, in a report released in March, 1997, selling PMA electricity at market rates rather than at the currently subsidized rates will raise approximately $200 million per year, money that will be returned to the U.S. Treasury. Later in 1997, CBO concluded that eliminating this costly subsidy would complement steps already taken by Congress to deregulate energy markets and to reduce government interference in market operations. 
When the PMAs were established during Franklin Roosevelt's administration, they served a useful and necessary purpose. Jobs were created for a nation that was struggling out of a horrible depression. Areas that could not afford the cost of purchasing power lines and generators for their residents were provided electricity at below market rates. At that time, below market sales were a good idea that allowed many more Americans than could afford electricity to enjoy its benefits. CBO concludes that over the past sixty years, many of the concerns that brought about the federal government's role in supplying power have diminished greatly. Nearly 60% of federal sales go to just four states: Tennessee, Alabama, Washington, and Oregon. In fact, nonfederal dams produced an average of 20% more electricity per unit of capacity than did dams supplying the PMAs. 
According to a General Accounting Office report entitled, `Federal Electricity Activities,' released in October, 1997, in fiscal 1996, Bonneville, the three other PMAs, and the Rural Utilities Service cost the American taxpayer $2.5 billion. In the four year period from 1992 to 1996, the government's net costs were $8.6 billion. In March, 1998, the GAO released an additional study entitled, `Federal Power: Options for Selected Power Marketing Administrations' Role in a Changing Electricity Industry.' Among the conclusions in this report were that for that same four year period from 1992-1996, the federal government incurred a net cost of $1.5 billion from its involvement in the electricity-related activities of Southeastern, Southwestern, and Western. Up to $1.4 billion of nearly $7.2 billion of the federal investment in assets derived from these activities is at some risk of nonrecovery. 
As for fairness in lending, the GAO found that the interest paid by the PMAs on their outstanding debt (3.5%) is often substantially below the rate that the U.S. Treasury incurred while providing funding to the PMAs (9%), resulting in a shortfall on interest alone of 5.5%. And rates charged by these PMAs were 40% or more below market rates.  
Mr. President, it is important to note that my bill does not close the PMAs or the TVA. Rather, it helps them to transition to a market-based operation whereby the vast majority of consumers who do not benefit from PMA below-cost power sales will no longer be penalized so that a few large power companies can purchase cheap, bulk power. My bill will provide for full cost recovery rates for power sold by the PMAs and the TVA. To accomplish this goal, PMA and TVA rates will be recalculated and resubmitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for approval. 
In addition, the bill requires that PMA and TVA transmission facilities are subject to open-access regulation by the FERC, and that regulation will be strengthened by authorizing FERC to revise such rates. Cooperatives and public power entities will be given the right of first refusal of PMA and TVA power at market prices. Revenue accrued from the revisal of these rates will go first to the U.S. Treasury to cover all costs. The residual amount will then be disbursed by formula to the Treasury to mitigate damage to fish and wildlife and other environmental damage attributed to the operation of PMAs and the TVA, and to support renewable electricity generating resources. 
Mr. President, these figures speak for themselves. In an era where the Congress has taken great strides toward eliminating the government's involvement in private industry, the PMAs are a white elephant. Sixty years after its inception, public power is less expensive, more accessible, and more widely available than ever before. There is no reason for the government to continue this wasteful subsidy to the fiscal detriment of the American people and the U.S. Treasury. I urge my colleagues to join me and my colleagues, Senators Moynihan and Reed of Rhode Island, in supporting this bill.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, in the next few weeks I will be casting my final votes and concluding my four terms in the Senate. During this last term, a significant amount of my time has been devoted to investigating abuses of our current campaign finance system. What I have learned is that this is a problem which cannot wait. I am pleased that one of my remaining votes can be cast in support of important reform, however, I am disappointed that the Senate will likely not pass this much needed legislation. 
Although I have always been a supporter of campaign finance reform--and indeed I personally believe that a system of campaigns fairly and equally underwritten by all Americans through some form of publicly supported financing is the only way to ensure public officials are not unduly influenced--but this last session has been a lesson for me on just how urgently we need to fix the campaign finance laws. 
When we originally passed the current campaign finance laws it was in the wake of allegations that the presidential campaigns of the early 1970s had accepted hundreds of thousands, even millions, of dollars from secret contributors not known to the voters. The goals of that law were right and for many years it served us well. But there are few things that change as quickly as campaigns and politics. By 1996 our law had been eroded to the point that it was barely recognizable. 
In 1996, we again faced a system totally out of control--filled with soft money and thinly disguised political advertisements masquerading as `issue' advertising funded by secret sources. We faced an election in which even the Members of this body--the people governed by the campaign finance laws--did not know what was legal and what was not. 
The amendment that is before us today and the bill that passed the House are a direct product of the chaos of the 1996 election. They are good legislation that address the two key problems of our campaign finance system--the proliferation of soft money and the use of thinly disguised `issue' advertisements. In addition, the legislation takes important steps to strengthen the Federal Election Commission. The goals of the bill before us today are the same as those of the original law: to deter corruption, to inform voters and to prevent wealthy private interests from exercising disproportionate influence over the government. 
There is no question that most problems we saw in the 1996 election stemmed from legal activity. There is also no question that both political parties and groups supporting candidates on both sides of the aisle in 1996 took advantage of these loopholes in their quest to win. The problems of soft money being used to purchase access and of secret contributors funding their own attack advertising campaigns without disclosing their identity can not be solved by any other means than by passing a new law. 
The proposals in this bill are carefully drafted to protect the First Amendment right of voters to engage in political speech. The legislation simply requires public disclosure and compliance with contribution limits. To those who see no problem with soft money advertising campaigns by parties and issue advertising by unknown and undisclosed contributors I can only wonder what they will say after the next time they run for re-election and discover they no longer have any control over the course of their own campaigns? 
No one can seriously argue that the system of soft money and secret issue ads is consistent with the spirit of the campaign finance laws. Together, the soft-money and issue-advocacy loopholes have eviscerated the contribution limits and disclosure requirements in federal election laws and caused a loss of public confidence in the integrity of our campaign finance system. By inviting corruption of the electoral process, they threaten our democracy. For parties to accept contributions of hundreds of thousands--even millions--of dollars, from corporations, unions and others to air candidate attack ads without meeting any of the federal election law requirements for contribution limits and public disclosure is a fundamental step backwards. 
Twice in the past year we have voted on the amendment before us today. Each time, although a majority of the Members of this body have voted in support of the bill--a minority opposed to reform has blocked its passage. 
Today we again take up this measure--but this time with a difference--this time the House of Representatives has worked together in a bi-partisan manner, recognized the critical need for reform, and passed a bill. By coming together and passing this reform legislation we in the Senate can take advantage of a narrow window of opportunity and turn these bills into a new and vital campaign finance law. This is a rare chance to fix a major problem. If we fail, it will plague us in many elections to come. 
Over the course of my Senate career, I have watched as public cynicism about government increases, and trust in government declines. In 1996, for the first time, less than half the people in this country eligible to vote cast a ballot. We must assure the integrity of our campaigns if we are to have any hope that young Americans will continue to have the faith in our government and in its public servants. 
If we do not act we here in the Senate will be responsible when the abuses witnessed by the American people in 1996 are repeated. All that will change is that amounts of money will continue to increase and public faith will continue to decline. In less than two months we will see the loopholes ripped open in 1996 resulting in an even greater flood of money into the system as each party tries to elect their chosen candidates, and the candidates battle to be heard against the flood of issue advertising. 
There is nothing I should like to be able to say so much as that I left the Senate having helped to pass into law the amendment before us today. I would ask that my colleagues join with me to cast a vote to enact into law these sensible reforms that we know we need. Only then can I depart with the confidence that we have acted to protect our electoral process from the apathy and cynicism that are a danger to democracy.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose cloture on the Cochran bill. 
I will agree at the outset that the many cosponsors of this bill, though haling overwhelmingly from a single party, probably believe they have the best interests of the nation in mind by giving their support to this bill. So I am not here today to challenge their motives or to impugn their character. I am here instead to state as concisely and sincerely as I can how and why I believe they are simply wrong. 
This bill is fatally flawed because it bases a profound national security decision--that is, the decision to deploy a missile defense system spanning the entire territory of the United States--upon one single consideration . . . its technological possibility. 
Voters across the land sent us here to Washington because here is where the tough decisions are made that face all Americans. They are tough decisions precisely because they rarely if ever involve only one consideration. They are tough because they often entail tough trade-offs in the pursuit of goals that our country simply cannot achieve all at once. As members of Congress, we have to consider politics, economics, short-term and long-term effects, impacts on other policies, legal issues, and other factors. We have to weigh all these considerations and reach a judgment on what will serve the interests of the nation. 
Yet here we are today, deliberating a decision that could well lead to the expenditure of tens or potentially hundreds of billions of dollars solely on the basis of a wish on a star. And that star is Star Wars. 
This is my main objection to the bill--I just do not think it is wise to base fundamental national security decisions on simply one criterion, especially one so notoriously ill-defined as the notion of a `technological possibility.' 
But I have other concerns as well. These relate to the potential cost of the policy enshrined in this bill. And they focus on the dubious technological objective that lies at the heart of what is known as `National Missile Defense.' I think it is certainly appropriate to ask some tough questions--as the Rumsfeld Commission did--about the foreign missile threat to determine if this threat is so grave or so imminent that it requires throwing twin babies out with the bath water: first, by abandoning standard US government procurement laws and procedures when it comes to acquiring major technological systems, and second by setting America on a course that is contary to our nation's arms control treaty obligations. And with respect to the consideration of what is actually possible, I also want to call my colleagues' attention to an article in the New York Times dated July 28 by Richard Garwin, a member of the Rumsfeld Commission. The article makes a persuasive point: that we cannot--must not--depend on a system for our defense which, even under the best circumstances, cannot accomplish its mission. In fact, it is not at all clear that any system we design could ever deal with all of the varied threats from different quarters. 
Mr. President, the American people are not dummies. I am convinced that when they listen carefully to both sides on this issue, they will recognize that nobody has yet come up with an improvement on existing US policy for missile defense. They will come to this conclusion precisely because our current policy is premised upon all of the many considerations I have just summarized . . . not just one. 
Americans understand that it makes sense not to force the government to buy costly, high-risk technologies that simply have the possibility of being effective. 
They understand that America's national security decisions must not be made without considering the impacts of these decisions on the defense choices that will be left open to other countries. 
They understand that in an age of balanced budgets, large new public sector commitments will jeopardize funding prospects for a multitude of other precious national goals. 
They will know how to assess the incorrect claim so frequently made by missile defense advocates that America is allegedly `defenseless' against the foreign missile threat. The closer they look at the $270-plus billion that we are spending each year on the nation's defense (not to mention the additional billions that we are investing in our diplomatic and intelligence capabilities), the sooner they will see the fallacy in the idea of a defensless America.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I would like to second the comments of my colleague from Michigan and add that I also have no objection to the McConnell amendment as it has been changed and offered today. 
The amendment as it is now constructed will call for a periodic vote of the Commission to re-confirm the General Counsel, but it will not allow a partisan minority of the Commission to act unilaterally, and it will not leave the position of General Counsel open until a successor is appointed, thereby paralyzing the enforcement efforts of the agency. 
I am also pleased that this amendment allows the current General Counsel to serve a term of eight years from enactment. I am confident that the amendment in its current form will be enacted into law and signed by the President. 
Finally, today we add crucial money to the FEC budget in order to help the agency to investigate and prove violations of the existing law. The additional 2.8 million dollars in enforcement funds bring our Senate appropriation for the FEC up to the same level offered in the House. These funds are an important step in allowing the agency the resources it needs to investigate and enforce our remaining campaign finance laws.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I urged last night to put this on the table. This would really knock the socks off any election law enforcement over at the FEC. We oppose this very much. It would mean there would be a restriction on the FEC that is not on any other agency or department of government as far as their general counsel goes and their staff director. 
The efforts to oust him over there, I think, are unconscionable. He has been doing a good job. This just stands starkly opposed to our efforts for campaign finance reform. 
At the appropriate time I will move to table this, but I yield the remaining time to Senator Levin.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment. If this is adopted, this means that this will be the only independent agency or department of Government to time limit the general counsel or staff director--the only independent agency in the Government. 
One of the FEC Commissioners has indicated to us what he thought would happen in this regard. He said it would cause chaos in the agency because, as the distinguished Senator from Kentucky has said, the Commission normally must have four votes for any action to ensure action is bipartisan. 
This means that if they were trying to get rid of the general counsel for whatever reason, the amendment would allow a minority of three to fire the general counsel because there wouldn't be a majority to retain, there wouldn't be the four votes. So there is concern about who they can get to even serve in a general counsel position in that situation. 
I think this will go a long ways toward destroying the FEC's independence in its own investigations under the law, because the general counsel will have to continually lobby for reinstatement. That just doesn't make any sense. I see no reason why we should be carving out the FEC, which is so important to us these days in trying to get elections laws straightened out, to be the only independent agency in all of Government to have such a time limit put on their general counsel or their staff director. 
They serve there, they have served for longer terms before, and served very honorably and well, but to place them under these different restrictions on voting, that would mean a general counsel could be ousted much more easily than I believe any of us would like to see and is something I don't think we should do. 
Mr. President, I rise to oppose this. If there are any others who wish to speak against this amendment, I will be glad to yield such time. How much time do I have remaining?

Mr. GLENN. One other item I would like to note for everyone's illumination on this. 
The House had a similar provision to that which is proposed by the Senator from Kentucky. They had a similar provision in the bill when it came to the House floor. They had a debate over there on this very provision which was described to me as being a bitter debate, a lot of rancor in it. It wound up with a bipartisan effort being put forward to strike this position on the floor of the House; and it was struck. They voted this provision out of the House bill on a bipartisan vote. And now this is an effort being made to put it back in on the floor of the Senate here. 
I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I send this to the desk, along with my cosponsors, Senators Jeffords, Kohl, Levin, Feingold, and Dodd. I offer this amendment to increase the budgeted funds a small amount for enforcement efforts by the Federal Election Commission. This agency bears the very difficult and thankless task of policing all of our campaigns in the whole Congress. 
Mr. President, I would like to point out, first, that this amendment was offered in the House, was debated there, and was approved. And the amendment I offer today adds exactly the same amount. It is just an additional $2.8 million to the FEC budget. 
The money would help the agency to investigate and prove wrongdoing. These additional funds are just a small step toward giving the Commission the resources that it really needs. 
In past years, we have seen attempts by Congress to stop vigorous enforcement of the law by failing to provide an adequate budget for this agency. Just last year, following an election in which unprecedented abuse of the campaign finance laws occurred, Congress refused to give money to the FEC to hire more staff to investigate these abuses. I thought that was a tragedy. 
Just last week in the House, we saw an extraordinary display of bipartisanship because the House defeated provisions intended to politicize the agency, and instead approved additional funds, as I mentioned a moment ago, for the Federal Election Commission. The extra money was set aside very specifically to help the FEC pay for investigations, many stemming from the events of the 1996 campaign. Those of us who support campaign finance reform--which is a clear majority in this body--agree that the system is broken and needs to be fixed. 
Until we can pass new laws, we must at least allow the agency we created to do its best to actively and vigorously enforce the existing law. This amendment takes an important step toward assuring that the FEC can do just that. This amendment is a renewed commitment by the Members of Congress to make a real effort to ensure that people who violate our existing campaign finance laws are found and are held accountable. This is the only way we can assure the continued integrity of our election process. 
Last year, we saw a lot of effort on campaign finance reform, and with Chairman Thompson, I had the privilege of serving as the ranking member of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' investigation into the 1996 campaign finance fiasco. During the course of those hearings, Chairman Thompson called on several campaign finance experts to testify. One of those witnesses was Norm Ornstein of the Brookings Institution who told us in testimony that he believed that the FEC would probably need at least $50 million--that is about twice what they are receiving--in order to become an effective enforcement agency. 
These funds I am proposing are a very small step. They just match the House funds that have already passed over there. It is a small step, but still leaves the agency woefully short of what experts think it needs. 
Let me give a little bit of perspective of the job facing the FEC. Right now, the FEC has 200 cases pending; 93 of those cases are under investigation and 107 cases, over half, are sitting in a file cabinet. Why? Why are these cases just sitting there in the cabinets with no action? They are waiting for staff to become available for these 200 cases. The FEC can only afford 25 staff attorneys. 
How about the investigators who could help the attorneys? The FEC has two, which they consider a great improvement from 1994 when they had exactly zero. They had none. By way of contrast, on last year's investigative staff of the Governmental Affairs Committee, we had 44 lawyers and a dozen investigators, and we weren't dealing with the whole aspect of everything the FEC has to deal with. We were dealing with only one limited aspect of what occurred during the 1996 campaign. We faced nowhere near the caseload that confronts the agency that is trying to do the best job it can on a real shoestring. 
I think we can all agree it doesn't matter how good the law that you have, if it isn't actively and vigorously enforced, it means nothing. It becomes a scofflaw. The Federal Election Commission already enforces a law readily exploited and bent in ways never intended. We, in Congress, fail to give the FEC the resources to find and hold accountable those who willfully violate these laws, who misuse soft money, who attempt to disguise political ads as issue advertising, and on and on. With all of the things we know that can happen, how can we hope to ensure the public has confidence in its elections and in its elected officials? 
This amendment is a very, very small and reasonable step towards allowing the FEC to accomplish its mission and enforce the law. I hope my colleague will support it. I repeat, it is one that has already passed in the House. We just matched the figure of $2.8 million that they have already passed in the House. I hope my colleagues will support my amendment. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, that's difficult to respond to, to say the FEC needs more resources. My distinguished colleague, my friend from Kentucky, says they need to monitor disclosure better; but how do they monitor that if they don't have the people to do it? They should crack down on violators. How do they crack down if they don't have the people on the staff to do it? They have a grand total of 25 staff attorneys. Until 1994, they didn't have any investigators. 
To say that we put them up a certain percentage this year, when estimates we had in testimony before the Governmental Affairs Committee were that we should probably double their budget to give them a fair shot at doing their job, which would put their budget up around, somewhere around $50 million was the estimate, instead of where it is now, to think if they could even come close to fulfilling the law and the requirements they are supposed to monitor with the staff they have, just isn't right. 
I said in my statement a moment ago, the FEC has 200 cases pending. They are only investigating 93. Why? It is because they don't have the people to do it. To say that they don't need more money and are quite adequately funded just flies in the face of logic. They do not have adequate staff. They can't even keep up with these things. These cases are years and years old. Many of them will not even be settled before the next election cycle comes around. They don't have the staff over there for any expeditious treatment. Ninety-three of those cases are under investigation, 107 cases are sitting in file cabinets for lack of people. 
In 1994, they didn't have any investigators and then they hired one. Then it was said later on they had 100-percent improvement in their investigative staff because they then hired two; they had two people on their investigative staff. None of these attorneys are people who are normally going out and doing all the spadework, doing all of the investigating, doing the fieldwork out in the field. To say that they have quite adequate funding because they went up a certain small percentage just flies in the face of logic. 
I know we are not going to probably change many minds on this particular subject, but if we are serious about ever improving our campaign financing and having the FEC as the monitoring body that does that, this is such a modest little amount of $2.8 million. I hope my colleagues will vote for this and match the House with the exact same amount the House put in. We wanted to match what they have done. 
They had a debate on this in the House and decided to put this in. It was because they felt they not only needed this, they probably needed much more, but could not get more through. I would like to see us do this an extra $15 million or $20 million. I know we are not going to do that here, but this is such a modest increase and they need it so badly that I hope my colleagues will agree to the amendment I am proposing when we vote tomorrow.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, today, we mourn the loss in our Capitol family of two brave men who gave their lives in service to our nation. 
Last Friday, in a running gun battle, United States Capitol Police Officer Jacob J. Chestnut and Detective John M. Gibson were killed in the line of duty. 
Mr. President, each of us who works in the Capitol feels a kinship to and a deep appreciation of the officers of the U.S. Capitol Police. We know that our lives are protected each and every day by the work that they do. In the twenty-four years that I have served Ohio as Senator, I have come to know many of the fine officers on the force. A former member of my staff is currently a member of the force and other staff members have officers among their immediate family members. 
This highly trained and professional force polices our nation's Capitol and performs numerous law enforcement duties as they monitor the entrances of our buildings, ensure the safety of the millions of tourists who visit the Capitol each year, and provide a kind word and a watchful eye as we come and go. These officers go about their duties with dedication and great skill. 
In a senseless, momentary act of violence, these fine officers gave their all. They gave their lives in the defense of all who visit and work here. Mr. President, we may never understand why such a tragedy occurred in our halls last Friday afternoon. Despite this lack of comprehension, we will always be certain that J. J. Chestnut and John Gibson fulfilled their responsibilities to our nation and will be remembered as heroes. 
I think that it is a fitting tribute that these officers will lay in state in the Capitol tomorrow, an appropriate commendation for the selfless sacrifice that they gave in the performance of their duties. My wife, Annie, joins me in extending my deepest sympathy to the families of Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson.

 Mr. GLENN. I want to commend Senator Mikulski and the other Members of the Subcommittee for incorporating elements of the Mikulski-Glenn Bill (S. 2064) to prohibit export of ships to be scrapped in countries with substandard environmental laws and practices. 
Senator Mikulski, with me as the prime cosponsor; introduced the original bill in May upon learning that the Federal ship-owning agencies, principally MARAD and the Navy, were retaining the option to export ships to countries with weak environmental and labor protection laws. They were retaining this option even after public reports and a GAO analysis that criticized Federal agencies for allowing the export of ships laden with PCBs, asbestos and hazardous materials. 
In the past, these ships were sent to developing countries to be scrapped. They would lie listing just offshore, giant metal hulks waiting to be cut up and disassembled--often by children in barefeet--with the hazardous waste from the ships' interiors unceremoniously dumped overboard. 
While I can respect the sovereignty of these countries in making their own environmental and labor laws--however inadequate they may be, I don't think that as a government the Feds should be contributing to that inadequacy by sending its own ships there to be scrapped in that fashion. 
The VA-HUD Appropriations Bill contains language that contains a 1 year restriction of Federal ship exports for scrapping. No exports can be made unless the EPA certifies that the destination country has environmental standards and enforcement `comparable' to the U.S. So it is not an outright ban on exports. The language supplements the other part of the Mikulski-Glenn Bill, which strengthens environmental and labor protection criteria in Federal contracts for domestic ship scrapping. Those provisions were unanimously adopted as part of the DOD Authorization Bill and $7.8 million has been provided for this effort in the DOD Appropriations Bill. 
We can protect our oceans, treat harmful hazardous waste safely, and scrap ships responsibly if we're willing to make the commitment to do the right thing. The language incorporated into the VA-HUD Bill takes that approach and resides there largely because of the effort and persistence of the good Senator from Maryland. I urge my colleagues to support that language, and to oppose any efforts to weaken it or strike it.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Heidelberg College in Tiffin, Ohio, as it celebrates the 40th Anniversary of its educational exchange program with Heidelberg University of Heidelberg, Germany. The program between the two schools is the longest standing exchange program between an American and a German university in the post-World War II period. 
When Heidelberg College was founded in 1850 by members of the German Reformed Church, it was named after the Heidelberg Catechism which was written at Heidelberg University in 1563. In 1958, cooperative relations were established between Heidelberg College and Heidelberg University and a student exchange program, the American Junior Year at Heidelberg University, was initiated. In 1973, the exchange became reciprocal with German students also studying at Heidelberg College. Over the course of the 40 years of cooperation, more than 1,400 German and American students have been able to participate in an academic exchange under the auspices of the Junior Year program. 
Heidelberg College has a rich tradition of global education dating from the second half of the 19th century when missionaries were trained for service in Japan. Over the past two years, the College has revitalized its commitment to global education through the establishment of the Heidelberg College Center for Global Education. The Center for Global Education is the cornerstone of Heidelberg's effort to place an international focus on its curriculum, its majors, and its programs. Through its Advisory Council for Global Education, composed of local, regional, national, and international leaders, a number of priorities and future directions for global education at Heidelberg College have been identified in order to make it a worthwhile initiative that will influence the lives of thousands of young people for years to come. 
I have been a long-standing advocate of increased exposure to global education for American students of all ages. I believe that it is fundamental for American students to have the opportunities to experience different cultures, languages, and individuals in order to compete in a world which is increasingly interdependent. I extend my best wishes to Heidelberg College for continued success in providing students from Ohio, and around the world, access to quality global education.

Mr. GLENN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, before I make the rest of my remarks, I want to say I support this legislation and will vote for it. I do want to bring up some points, though, that have not been brought up here today. I support this. It is good legislation that extends the exemption for food assistance already contained in the Glenn Amendment sanctions. This has been worked out with the leadership. And it is basically the language that Senator Murray brought out of committee, I believe. I think it is identical language--or close to it. So I want to congratulate her also on this. But let me put a different perspective on sanctions than some of those that have been expressed here today. 
The United States currently has in effect some 61 sanctions against different nations around the world. They are not all involved in nuclear nonproliferation. We have sanctions involved with such things as drugs, as terrorism, human rights, sanctions against Cuba. 
This legislation today does not address those. I do not think in some of these areas--for instance, on drugs, even if food was involved--we would be lifting these sanctions. But the United States has wanted to prevent nuclear war. Ever since the case of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, most responsible nations in the world have realized we need to control the threat of nuclear holocaust by sometime, somehow, some way reducing nuclear weapons. 
While that remained a long-term objective, it would become even more difficult if more and more nations developed a nuclear weapons capability. It was with that longtime hope that legislation has been passed for more than 20 years--much of it my legislation; that is the reason I feel a special relationship or a special responsibility here today--for more than 20 years trying to stop the spread of nuclear weapons while at the same time holding out hope for eventual weapons control and reduction. 
For many years I felt this was a rather futile gesture. I did not feel good about what we had done at all because we were not making much progress. But finally the cold war demise brought new hope for really gaining control of nuclear weaponry, and in a comparatively short period of time there was real optimism that control over these weapons could be gained. 
With the end of the cold war and agreement with the Soviet Union, we saw missiles suddenly being taken out of silos, weapons being taken down, cores of fissile material being removed, and real progress was being made. The Lugar-Nunn--Nunn-Lugar--whichever way you want to say it--legislation gave some help in that direction. That has been a big mammoth help. And with U.S. leadership, we have achieved something we would not have even thought possible a few years ago, 185 nations signed the NPT, and progress is being made on the CTBT, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which now has 149 signatories. 
So it was against that backdrop of really making some progress that the Glenn amendment was passed in 1994--which we are altering here today--with the belief that if we were even a little tougher than we had been, that this would really discourage other nations from moving toward nuclear weapons. That hope, of course, went down the drain when India's extreme Hindu nationalism took precedent over what most people around the world thought should have been more rational behavior. It was against that backdrop we passed the legislation. 
The sanctions passed in the 1994 legislation were meant to be tough and provided no Presidential waiver largely because of the very spotty performance in nuclear nonproliferation in past administrations. I would remind my colleagues today who are here decrying what has gone on here that this bill passed unanimously in the U.S. Senate. Everyone critical today--most of the people here were here in 1994. And so it passed unanimously in the U.S. Senate. 
Some feel that sanctions are just no good in any respect. But sanctions or the threat of sanctions as one of our diplomatic tools, I believe, has been effective in the past in helping to turn off either actual or incipient nuclear and missile programs. And we can give as examples Argentina and Brazil. Taiwan--I made a trip out there some years ago when we knew what Taiwan was doing in heading toward possible nuclear capability. South Korea was also on that list, and South Africa. And we may even have delayed some of Pakistan's access to the bomb which resulted in nuclear explosions. 
What we do today here in the name of our own U.S. economy--I want everyone to realize what we are doing--what we are approving are U.S. loans, taxpayer dollars, to replace the money the Pakistanis spent on developing nuclear weapons instead of on food for their own people. 
I also say, does this bring them any closer--with what we are about to do today, will this result in or do we have any under-the-table or tacit agreement that they will go ahead and sign the NPT, that they will sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty? We can say this is a carrot hanging out there, but our carrots to Pakistan in the past have been rebuffed by one falsehood after another for the last 17 or 18 years that I have been experiencing personally, including visits to Pakistan to talk to their top people when they denied having any weapons or any weapons program, clear up until the time they set off the bombs that they claimed they did not have all these years. 
So my reaction to this is, yes, for humanitarian reasons, I certainly do not want the Pakistani people themselves and little babies going hungry, and so on. So I am willing to go along with these humanitarian concerns. But we do need definitely to rethink sanctions across the board and what we mean by them. 
As time has gone along, and the nations of the world are no longer being forced to choose between the United States and the Soviet Union, the world really has become more multipolar in every respect, with business, industry, banking, economics, and so on. And so the role of sanctions has changed along with that. 
It has become increasingly evident through the years that the sanctions only become really effective if they have multilateral support, either from our major allies or preferably at the United Nations. I believe sanctions still have a major role to play in nonproliferation and in our fight against drugs and terrorism and human rights abuses and the situation in Cuba, and so on. I do not think we have to say all sanctions are bad, but they are only effective if they have multilateral support. 
Today we have economic arguments here because sanctions are going to hurt our own farmers in this country, and we may have some that will affect the manufacturing of jeeps out of Toledo, for instance, in my home State of Ohio, as well as farming interests there. 
So the world situation has changed, and we need, in each one of these cases, to consider the case on its own individual merits. In that regard, I have submitted legislation that was put in just before the last break. The legislation would alter the way sanctions are administered, and would be not only prospective but would be retrospective, also. And it would be basically this: At the time of an event or a determination that triggers a sanction against a given country, the President could, at his discretion, place a hold on the imposition of the sanction for up to 45 calendar days to decide whether to remove or impose the sanction or to say, `Here is a part that will work; here is a part that will not work.' Maybe the President would want to say, `None of it will work,' so he wants to recommend that we do away with that whole sanction for that particular country at that time. 
He would be completely flexible in what he could recommend, but he would have 45 days to either build the multilateral support that I spoke about or come to the Congress and say to the Congress: Here is what I recommend in changing this sanction in this particular situation. And then he would propose that to the Congress, and Congress would have 15 session days to act under expedited procedures--15 days. We would have a limit on what debate could occur, obviously. It would be given preferential treatment here, and we would consider the President's purpose in this and require him to give us his reasons why he wants to change this legislation, alter it, or how he thinks it could be better administered. Congress would have 15 days to approve or disapprove what the President had done. That gives the President ultimate flexibility, it seems to me, and would be a great step forward. 
For sanctions that are already in place, the President, on the anniversary of that sanction, would have to come back and say once again to us why it is working, why it is not working, what changes he thinks should be made in the sanction. And he would do that at the 2-year anniversary of the imposition of any sanction, and then would have to give us a report every year thereafter on that sanction as to whether it was working or not working and recommend any changes to make it more effective. 
I do not see any other way to make this whole thing work in the multipolar world in which we live now. Sanctions 15 or 20 years ago may have had more of a chance of an effect even though they were unilateral, but rarely in the situation we find ourselves in in the world community today. 
So while I am for this legislation today for humanitarian reasons, I do not go along with some people who talk about poor little Pakistan and how they are in the situation that they have brought upon themselves because they have deliberately misled us intentionally--one leader after another for about the last 15 or 16 years that I have been personally dealing with this. But I do not want to see the Pakistani people go hungry or anything like that, and so I go along with this today. 
It was mentioned a moment ago what a sad situation it was that we did not include the other parts that were originally posed in this legislation. If we had kept those proposals on this legislation, I can guarantee you I would probably have participated in my first filibuster in my 24 years in the U.S. Senate. I feel that strongly about it. 
I do think we have played a good role in stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and sanctions have helped--but if we take these off today as far as food sales go, maybe it will give us a lever; maybe it will give Pakistan an incentive to sign the NPT, sign the comprehensive test ban treaty, and hopefully that would encourage India. 
There is nothing in here for India, so I don't know whether we are unbalancing this situation or not. I don't know what the administration may have planned to sweeten the pie, sweeten the pot for India in this regard; also, to get them to move toward NPT and CTBT status. 
Make no mistake, these are not just some international loans we are approving, these are U.S. loans we are approving to Pakistan and will pass in the Senate. It still has to pass the House, obviously, and we hope this can get done in time to take place before the bidding starts on the international sales, as I understand it, by the 15th. 
I repeat, I think we need to rethink sanctions. The outline of what I have proposed is in legislation now. It has been filed. I hope we can move in that direction, because I think it would give the President the ultimate flexibility he needs without dumping congressional responsibility at the same time. It would mean whatever the President proposes with regard to sanctions we would have to consider on an expedited, privileged basis. To me, this is the way we should be going in the future. 
I know I am part of the task force that will indeed be looking at these options between now and September 1 when we have to have them submitted for the U.S. Senate. 
How much time remains?

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to the statements made by my distinguished colleague from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers. Some of his statements I agree with, and, obviously, some of them I do not agree with. One I agree with very strongly is, when he and I arrived here together, we became closest friends. He is one of my best friends, if not the best friend, I have in the Senate today. We vote in a very similar fashion on most things. But every year it seems we lock horns on this particular issue. I am sorry that is the case, but I feel as strongly in the other direction with regard to the space station as he does on the other side. 
Let me put this in a little larger context perhaps. Let me start out with the big picture of this country and what made this country great, because I have always believed that there is one thing that does set this country apart from other nations around the world. 
By the very nature of people coming to this country in the early days and their expansion across the unknown territory that we know today as America, they exhibited a questing curiosity, a questing spirit that led them not only to explore lands and oceans and skies and geography, but also to do not just the macro exploration, but the micro exploration in laboratories, classrooms of our Nation, and express our curiosity in learning new things. And that is at the heart of science. The heart of science is learning the new and putting it to use in ways to better our lives and understanding of the world around us--indeed, the universe around us. 
This questing spirit is at the heart of our history, from those first settlers who landed on our rocky shores, to Lewis and Clark pushing into hostile lands west of the Mississippi, to Thomas Edison and the electric light, to the Wright brothers struggling to break the bond of gravity, to the past and present-day pioneers in our country's space program. 
Along the way, there have always been plenty of doubters about our efforts to explore, to learn the new. There have always been those who said, `Well, we haven't solved all of our problems yet, so we should spend our money on the here and now until we get those answers and never look into other new areas; don't waste money on what might be.' 
There have been plenty of doubters about our efforts to explore the new, and one of the most famous is one I have quoted on this floor before, a distinguished orator and Senator, Daniel Webster. 
Daniel Webster used to get very impassioned. All you have to do is see the desk on the other side of the aisle which is always reserved for the senior Senator from New Hampshire. That is the only desk in the U.S. Senate that has a solid top on it. It does not raise. It does not have hinges. That is because Daniel Webster became so impassioned on the Senate floor, he used to bang so hard on the desks during his speeches, that he broke the tops of the desks. They finally got so tired of replacing the tops that they put on a solid top of additional thickness so he couldn't break it. That is how impassioned he became about some of the matters in which he believed. 
He rose in the Senate when our Government was considering buying lands west of the Mississippi from Spain and Mexico, lands that now make up more than half of the area mass of today's United States. Daniel Webster would rise during floor debate to say words to the effect of these: `What use can this area west of the Mississippi be, this area of cactus and prairie dogs, of blowing sand, mountains of snow, impenetrable snow to their very base? Mr. President, I will not vote one cent from the public Treasury to move the Pacific one inch closer to Boston than it now is.' 
We can see in the past we have had some of our greatest statesmen who have taken a rather myopic view of branching out and looking into the new and unknown. The Wright brothers faced their skeptics, too. Some people said at that time that if God wanted us to fly, God would have made feathers on us so we could fly. Yet, their curiosity and persistence led to airplanes and the aviation industry and really have changed the nature of the world and commerce and how we do business over this Earth. 
I hate to say we face reincarnation of some of those skeptics when debating our space program. I think people who take some of these views are just as misled as Daniel Webster and critics of the Wright brothers were years ago. Each year they ask, `Why do we invest billions of taxpayers' dollars for space exploration and research'--even though it does have a great promise, which I will go into in a few moments--`while we still have other problems right here on Earth we haven't solved? It is not just exploring the West. So why do we put new money into research and laboratories when we haven't solved the problems on which we are already working?' 
You can look at the macro research or micro research area, either one. We do research for one reason, and I can give a short answer for that: We do it to benefit people right here on Earth and to address those very problems they raise, and that has been true ever since I was involved in the space program many years ago during Project Mercury, and it is true today. 
I cannot think of one area of our society, whether it is communications or transportation or medicine, manufacturing, agriculture, the environment, education--that has not demonstrably benefited from our space program. 
I know my distinguished colleague from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, will say he is not against the space program--and that is true, he is not, he votes for it--that he is just against the space station. Yet, the space station, to my mind, is one of the most preeminent examples of where we stand the potential of benefits for the future beyond anything we can foresee at the outset right now. That is the nature of basic research. That is the nature of geographical research and exploration or research in laboratories. 
This year, as in years past, we will debate what the benefits are of the International Space Station. Fortunately, we have continued to fund the space station. I think it is one of the greatest cooperative scientific enterprises in the history of this world--in fact, the greatest. 
A total of 16 nations have teamed up to launch the most ambitious technical undertaking known to man. The first components will be launched later this year. As a matter of fact, the scheduled date is December 3 when the first U.S. node will be put up. The Russians will their first component, the Functioning Cargo Block on November 20. 
The station will be a laboratory in permanent orbit. Much of its research will be a continuation of work currently being done on the shuttle, which is more limited as a research facility because of several things, including space available inside it, and because of technical considerations and the length of time it can be in space. That is the main one, the length of time that it can actually stay in orbit. 
Let me go into a little bit about some of this research that I do believe is important. We had a recent set of experiments called Neurolab in April of this year. It was started on the shuttle and will be continued on the space station to a greater extent. It will deal with probably the greatest single frontier, the greatest unknown, the greatest area for potential advancement of anything we could think about, and that is a study of our human brain and our nervous system and how they operate. It can't be much more important than that. That is the part of the human body that is most complex and least understood by scientists. 
Neurolab flew this past April carrying seven astronauts and a whole host of different animals. It is NASA's view that it is the most complex and scientifically sophisticated research mission they have ever flown. Researchers used state-of-the-art techniques and technologies to gather information about how the nervous system's control of various body functions changes in the microgravity of space and how gravity influences the development of our nervous system right here on Earth--trying to get an insight from the lack of gravity as to how these whole systems work.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I thank the floor manager of the bill, the distinguished Senator from Maryland. 
I want to make a point on a comment that was made by the other Senator from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson, about the cost overruns and the budget situation, because the Chabrow task force report has been alluded to today, sometimes correctly and sometimes incorrectly. 
In this case, it was referred to incorrectly because, contrary to the assertion that the program has a large overrun, the Chabrow task force reported that the program was--and this is a quote: 
Diligent and resourceful in managing the unique challenges of this complex venture given the significant complexity and uncertainty of international involvement and the difficult task of staying within annual and total funding caps established prior to final program content definition. 
That indicates that there has been very responsible management. That is in the Chabrow task force report. 
Further, the task force stated, referring to the ISS, the International Space Station Program specifically, and their quote is out of their report: 
Although cost and schedule growth have occurred, the magnitude of such growth has not been unusual, even when compared with other developmental programs of lesser complexity. 
I think that is a compliment. I think we should also note that many defense research and development programs have exceeded development cost estimates by 20 to 40 percent, way out of the ball park of what we are talking about here, which indicates to me that major technical developmental programs have a degree of complexity that makes cost assessment very, very difficult--the point that I made in my original, more lengthy statement. 
We need to keep in mind what the Chabrow report said in their task force report, which is, to my way of thinking, complimentary to NASA about how they managed this program and kept things under control. NASA personnel numbers are way, way down. The NASA budget has been flat over the last couple of years, and yet we have gone ahead with more efficient management within NASA and I think they should be complimented for given the complex management environment in which they have to work. 
So the Chabrow report has been quoted here today, but I think the two quotes out of the Chabrow report should be noted. 
I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I want to reply to a couple of things which Senator Harkin indicated a little bit earlier. I was a little bit disquieted by the fact that he indicated that NASA is now an arm of the military Air Force. I don't know where on Earth that came from because NASA has never been that. Military payloads have been put up. But it has not spilled over in that direction at all. It is still going along as a civilian agency. It was declared to be by Dwight Eisenhower, and has continued to be that every since. 
As far as money being sucked out, there is $98 billion. We are talking about $2.3 billion in this bill for the next year for the International Space Station. Most of the hardware has already been constructed, or is in the final stages of being constructed. 
The fact is that we have doubled the budget for NIH over the last couple of years. It is not that we are not doing things in that area. 
I repeat what I said earlier. If we are to wait until every problem in our country is solved before we put money into basic fundamental research out there, that is just the wrong way to go. 
Senator Durbin talks about child diseases. Some of the protein crystal growth advances we are making these days is something that we can look forward to as maybe helping solve some of those childhood diseases. 
Back to what the Senator from Iowa said again, though, I will point out that on the very flight that I will be on this fall in October, we have three different areas of commercialization of space in which one of the projects is commercial protein crystal growth. I will not go into details. My 2 minutes won't permit. But in that area, we are in the commercialization of protein crystal growth experiments. We are into another one on the commercial generic bioprocessing apparatus that we are taking up in space. We have another one. I have already been briefed on these. We will be taking part in some of the research that is being done at that time. 
The other one is on what is called the cybex mission, and it is to perform IDA-funded, corporate microgravity biomedical cancer research; second purpose: perform other IDA corporate commercial microgravity research, and provide a turnkey service of commercial access to space. 
That is the way NASA has been going. That is the direction they want to go.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, we have addressed costs here. This $96 billion is a fictitious figure; $40 billion of that, by NASA estimates, includes shuttle costs that are going to go on anyway. Besides all those big figures taken into a 15-year account here, what we are talking about in this bill is for fiscal 1999? We are talking about $2.3 billion versus $2.1 billion for last year, not a huge increase. 
Now, there are always going to be competing needs for every bit of research. If we ever tried to solve all problems and to do everything we wanted to do before we made research, we would never have moved off the east coast. Basic research is a way of life, fundamental. This is a new laboratory we are working on. It is our experience that dollars spent on research seem to have a way of paying off in the future beyond anything we ever foresee at the outset. That has been the history of this country. We have gotten to the place now where much of the space program is increasingly going commercial. 
On the flight we will be on, STS-95, we will have three specific projects. We will have basic research, besides what we are talking about, in the physical sciences, in the bio area. We will have the Spartan spacecraft making the measurements of the Sun and solar winds. We will have research on aging, with which I will be involved. We will have ultraviolet measurements that will be probably the most accurate ever made in space. These things cannot be done except in zero-G, not on the ground. 
We are talking about payoffs in commercial areas with three different projects on STS-95. We are almost there. The figure was quoted a moment ago that 90 percent of our hardware has been built. I think 75 percent of the milestones have already been passed. The first elements are due to be launched later this year. I think the Russians are due to launch the first node, module, on November 20, and we are scheduled to launch the first United States one on December 3. 
It is a 16-nation commitment that we have. Certainly, it is better to be working peacefully together than to be thinking about war, which we were a few years ago. It is the biggest, most incredible scientific engineering experiment ever tried internationally. I think there can be incredible scientific possibilities and results from this, not only in medicine, but learning about our world and our solar system, inspiring our young people to explore and to learn. The benefits are not out there in space. The benefits are for us right here on Earth. That is the important part of this whole thing. The Chabrow report said this. Although costs in scheduled growth have occurred, the magnitude of such growth has not been unusual, even when compared with other developmental programs of lesser complexity.

Mr. GLENN. Madam President, if we go back in history, we see that the development of weapons of war have become more and more hideous as time goes on. 
One of the biggest steps forward in that direction--or steps downward, depending on how you look at it--was the development of nuclear weaponry near the end of World War II. I was involved in World War II and in the Korean war. I have been through combat. I know what it is like. When I came to the Senate, I could not imagine anything more horrible than the use of nuclear weaponry in future wars, if they ever came up. The horrors of conventional war are bad enough without imposing nuclear weaponry into that scenario. 
My desire to do something in this area motivated much of my work here in the Senate, and I have taken a leading position on this issue through the years. Some of it has been very controversial. There have been various approaches to this issue. I want to discuss just a few of those today. 
We have been hearing much talk in this body lately about the use and the value of sanctions, which is one of the tools we have applied to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to more and more countries around the world. This tool has been applied in many other foreign policy contexts as well, and I am the first to agree with those who say that we may have gone too far in the application of some of these instruments of foreign policy--some of them. There have been successes and there have been failures. It has been a rather spotty record all the way through. 
When you consider this whole issue, it seems to revolve mainly around two questions: First, in our international relationships, where do we use carrots and where do we use sticks, to put it in those terms. Where do we use enticements to people, to try and entice them into a certain behavior we would like to see, and where do we use sticks? Where do we threaten the punishments that they may consider ahead of time that might cause them not to go into certain areas of behavior we would like to see them avoid? 
Second, what role should sanctions play as an expression of disapproval or punishment in cases where it is manifest that behavior will not be significantly altered as a result of the imposition of sanctions? 
Now, the debate in Congress and in most of the think tanks around town and across the country has been most curious because they seem to want it both ways. They want sanctions in some areas and not in others, but not necessarily with regard to nonproliferation. 
If we consider some other areas, for example, probably the most salient example of the failure of sanctions from every perspective is the drug war. Now, all of us are against drug use. We want to cut out drug use, whether by cutting the flow from abroad or at our borders or within our communities or whatever. We have those sanctions on, but no one in Congress is standing up to proclaim that sanctions against persons or countries which are contributing to the illegal use of drugs ought to be eliminated. We want to keep those sanctions on. Why? In part, because the drug war is politically popular. The war against drugs is politically popular, and its effect on commercial activity by American business is mixed. We have some businesses in this country actually flourishing because of the drug war--manufacturing of equipment used in surveillance, construction of jails, so on. So those people are not about to go to the National Association of Manufacturers or the Chamber of Commerce to complain about unilateral U.S. sanctions. 
But the complaints about sanctions are now legion when sanctions are applied in other contexts, like the one I am addressing today--nonproliferation. This is not to say that the critics of congressionally mandated sanctions have no case. I agree with some of the points that they make. But there are extremists who take the position that sanctions are never effective and are therefore always inappropriate. There are also extremists who insist on taking a punitive approach to every vexing foreign policy problem. These folks never saw a sanction they didn't like, and any approach to an issue that doesn't take the hardest line is denounced as some sort of appeasement. I might add that quite often there are political points as much as public policy points trying to be made by some of the tacks that these people seem to take. 
Well, as the author of numerous pieces of legislation on nuclear proliferation that have included both carrots and the sticks of sanctions as tools for achieving certain nonproliferation objectives, I have tried to forge a balanced approach to the proliferation problem. Most recently, my 1994 legislation, which has been referred to as the Glenn amendment, was used by President Clinton to impose a variety of economic sanctions against both India and Pakistan because of their recent nuclear tests. Those sanctions were tough. We didn't pull any punches with those sanctions. Those sanctions mandated that military sales and any aid programs had to stop. It said we would block credits and loan guarantees by U.S. Government agencies. We would oppose any loans or cooperation with those countries under sanction from the World Bank, or IMF, the so-called IFITs, International Financial Institution Transactions. We would also block credit from private banks, and we would prohibit the export of dual-use technology to those countries which might be used for military purposes. 
Now, that is tough legislation. We didn't give a waiver authority at all. We had rather spotty experiences with Presidents in the past and we said we were going to make this tough; the President could delay the imposition of those sanctions for 30 session days if he wanted, but the President didn't have the authority to waive those sanctions, as is the case with some other legislation. That was done very intentionally. These sanctions now require congressional legislation in order to remove them. 
Let's look at the history behind the 1994 legislation--I think it is important to know--in order to understand why this legislation took the form that it did. It is tied up with the history of the cold war and U.S. nonproliferation policy. We could go back to the days of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Most people realized since those days that we needed to prevent a nuclear holocaust by somehow, some way reducing nuclear weapons. Now, that has remained through the years a long-term objective. And through many of those years it was very disappointing to see the spread of nuclear weapons go on, or nations trying to gain nuclear weapons capabilities. 
While nuclear reductions and ultimately nuclear disarmament remained our long-term objective, it would become even more difficult if more and more nations developed a nuclear weapons capability. And with that long-time objective in mind, we passed legislation over a period of more than 20 years trying to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, while at the same time holding out the hope for eventual weapons control. 
In 1978, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act, which I coauthored, was enacted. It provided for carrots on nuclear cooperation for countries that adhered to certain nonproliferation principles, and it provided the stick of sanctions--cutoffs of nuclear cooperation for countries engaged in dangerous nuclear activities related to bomb making, including nuclear detonations. The Presidential waiver was provided within that legislation. A year earlier than that--in 1977--I authored an amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act that provided for cutoffs of economic and military assistance to countries that received or exploded a nuclear device, or were engaged in--and this is important--either the import or export of dangerous nuclear technologies involving plutonium production and separation--either import or export, either way, whether the country was supplying the stuff or receiving it. 
I provided a Presidential waiver in this case also. This legislation, along with the so-called Symington amendment on nuclear enrichment technology transfers, resulted in a cutoff of economic and military assistance for Pakistan in 1979. While the Glenn amendment could have been waived, the Presidential waiver attached to the Symington amendment was impossible to exercise; only congressional action could remove the Symington sanction. Then we came to Afghanistan. After the Afghanistan war erupted--which coincided almost very similar in time to the installation of a new administration--the Reagan administration decided they could not provide military assistance to the mujahedin in Afghanistan without lifting the ban on assistance to Pakistan. The reason was that the material had to flow to Afghanistan through Pakistan. We could hardly get them to transport material through the Pakistani border area and across their territory to Afghanistan if we had sanctions on against Pakistan. So there was a waiver. 
The Administration went to Congress and asked for a repeal of the Symington amendment, but Congress wasn't willing to do that. We were unwilling to give the Pakistanis total relief from pressure to halt their evident nuclear weapons development program, so a compromise was struck. Congress agreed to a legislated 6-year waiver of the Symington sanctions, but at the same time passed an amendment that I offered to remove the ability of the President to waive a cutoff of economic and military assistance to any nonweapon state like Pakistan that explodes a nuclear device. 
In effect, the line in the sand on sanctions had been pulled back. My purpose in removing the waiver was simple. I didn't know how long in fact the Afghanistan war would proceed. I believed that just as long as it went on, the Pakistanis would count on the Reagan administration not to put nonproliferation policy ahead of cold-war policy. My amendment did provide for a possible 30-session-day delay of sanctions by the President following a detonation, but no waiver without congressional action. 
Now, turn over the calendar a little bit. In 1985, when it was clear that the Pakistanis were still going for the bomb--something we had known for a long time--which they consistently denied at all levels of their government, Congress moved the line in the sand a bit closer by passing the Pressler amendment, which also carried no Presidential waiver. It mandated a cutoff to Pakistan, unless the President certified that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear explosive device. Note the wording: The President could not certify they did not possess a nuclear explosive device. It was under this amendment that Pakistan was cut off from economic and military assistance in 1990, after the Afghanistan war ended--and I should add about 3 years after the Pakistanis actually had made the bomb that we knew they were working on all that time. 
But other international developments were going on all through this same period. In terms of world events at this point, we were witnessing the demise of the cold war and the beginning of the collapse of the Soviet Union. This brought new hope for really, truly, and finally at least gaining control of nuclear weaponry, after going through years upon years upon years of what we call MAD--mutually assured destruction--on both sides if anybody set off a nuclear weapon. Those were long years where we thought that nuclear nonproliferation was dead and wasn't something with which we really were going to succeed. But finally, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, this brought new hope for really gaining control of nuclear weaponry. 
In a comparatively short period of time there was real optimism that control over these weapons could be gained. I was one of those who changed my views on this completely during that time period, because I had been very pessimistic through the years. Even though I am the author of much legislation, as I just recounted, on this, I didn't feel that we were really gaining much in the world, and we were starting to move in place. And other nations were really trying to get nuclear weaponry. So we weren't really accomplishing much. 
But all at once I began to feel very optimistic at this time, because at the end of the cold war and the agreement with the Soviet Union we saw missiles being taken out of silos; weapons being taken down; fissile material being taken out; the cores of nuclear weapons being taken out and used for other purposes, for stockpile, or whatever. But they were no longer in the weapons aimed at each other halfway around the world. Real progress was being made. I began to feel pretty good about this. 
With U.S. leadership, we then worked to obtain progress on arms control and nonproliferation. Over a period of time we had 185 nations sign up under the nonproliferation treaty. Progress was being made on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, also, which currently has 149 signatories. If anyone had come to me and told me a few years ago that we would have that many signatories, that we would have 185 sign up under NPT and 149 for CTBT, I would have told them they were crazy to even contemplate such a thing. But that is what has happened. So things are moving in the right direction. 
Indeed, so much progress was being made on the test ban treaty and so much progress had been made on computer simulation of nuclear weapon tests that it was unclear whether any further nuclear explosions would have to take place anywhere. 
Back in the old days it was quite apparent that if a nation was going nuclear they didn't say they were a nuclear nation unless they had gone out and really tested a weapon. They couldn't just say their engineering was good, that they will rely on engineering and claim they were a nuclear state and that they knew the thing would go off. That wasn't the way it went. You had to take it out and test it. And if you didn't, you couldn't rely on nuclear weapons. What has happened with the supercomputer and supercomputer simulation is that the need for testing is no longer clear. The way it is now is we think probably you could have a nuclear weapons capability without doing any testing. 
So the hope was at that point--the hope we had in 1994--that much tougher sanctions would put the final nail in the coffin for nuclear tests. There wouldn't be any nuclear testing if we could just make this a tough law. So although the circumstances in 1994 were much different than those of 1981, the Glenn amendment of 1981 was updated with tough sanctions. It became the Glenn amendment of 1994. I thought it was working. And it was working until just a few months ago. Unfortunately, the hope on which the amendment was based went down the drain when India's extreme Hindu Nationalist Party overrode what most of the world thought should have been more responsible behavior and set off a nuclear weapon. And Pakistan responded in kind with their demonstration also to make sure they were not left out of things, too. 
So we are now faced with a situation which will test the mettle of our diplomacy in south Asia like few times in history, I guess we could probably say like never before. The sanctions that are being imposed because of the Indian and Pakistani tests will fall on both of them, and may help us--I hope it does--move the Indians and Pakistanis toward more responsible behavior in the aftermath of the tests. 
We must admit that the sanctions did fail in their primary purpose, which was to prevent a test in the first place. But I look at this as a setback, not the end of our efforts. One could only speculate if this failure was due to the sanctions' unilateral nature or whether the Indians would have tested under any circumstance. This is not to say that unilateral sanctions are never to be imposed as nonproliferation threats. Quite the contrary. For example, the threat of such sanctions was helpful in the special cases of Taiwan and South Korea, when both of those countries were taking steps toward proliferative activity some years ago. We could also indicate that there were other nations that we thought were moving perhaps in that direction, too, and who ultimately gave up their programs--like Argentina and Brazil, and South Africa. 
But anyway, to go back to Taiwan and South Korea, both of those countries were heavily dependent on the United States. So unilateral sanctions worked, and they worked well. I think our sanctions also worked for a while in maybe holding back some of Pakistan's advance in their nuclear weapons program, because we made it more difficult for other nations to cooperate with Pakistan as they were trying to achieve their nuclear weapons capability. 
But in general I believe it has been increasingly clear that with the dramatic expansion of the world community--sources of information, sources of equipment, sources of trade around the world--I believe that sanctions become really effective only if they have multilateral support. 
Let me repeat that because that is the basis of some of these things that I want to elaborate on just a little bit further. Sanctions become really effective only if they have multilateral support, whether through our allies or through the United Nations. Unilateral sanctions are not as effective as we would like to see them. That is the understatement of the day. And there are situations where the imposition or continuation of mandated unilateral sanctions may make a problem even worse. 
So I have come to believe that except in very special circumstances, such as those we faced in 1981, sanctions legislation that give the President no role in their implementation or continuation should be avoided, and laws which have been constructed in such fashion should be amended. That is the reason I am here on the floor today. 
In my 1994 legislation, the President has no role in the process of implementation or the continuation of sanctions. And the Congress, because of the tradition of no limit on Senate debate, can be hamstrung by a determined minority of Senators who wish to retain sanctions because of considerations that may have nothing to do with the original transgression. So we don't want to permit that to happen, either. 
So, accordingly, on June 26, just before the recess, I introduced the Sanctions Implementation Procedures Act of 1998, which is labeled Senate bill 2258, which, if passed, will be applicable to all country sanctions laws that do not contain a Presidential waiver which the President may exercise on the grounds of protecting the national interest. I want to, in order to give the President more leeway, get multilateral support, which is what I would like to see happen either with our major allies or through the United Nations. This bill would give the President the option of delaying any imposition of congressionally mandated sanctions for a period not to exceed the combination of 45 calendar days, followed by 15 session days of Congress. The President, if he chooses to delay the sanctions, must provide a report to Congress no later than the end of the 45-day period in which he discusses the objectives of the sanctions, the extent of multilateral support for the sanctions, and the estimated costs and benefits, both tangible and intangible. 
If in this report the President recommends that we don't go ahead with the sanctions--he recommends nonimplementation of the sanctions--then expedited procedures are triggered for 15 session days in both the Senate and the House of Representatives--both Houses of Congress--for the purpose of approving or disapproving the President's recommendation--in other words, expedited procedures which provide for no filibuster. We take it up in preference to other legislation. We give it priority. So it could not be delayed. 
Equally important, if the sanctions go into effect--let's say that the Congress says, `OK. Yes. Mr. President, we think this should go into effect,' or if the President just chooses to put it into effect and says, `Yes, we do have multilateral support, and, yes, we do have enough support to make the sanctions really bite to make them meaningful'--if the sanctions go into effect, they remain so for two years and then this procedure is repeated on the sanctions' second anniversary, and each anniversary thereafter. In other words, there would be a time certain after every sanction in which the administration would have to consider the effectiveness of it, a report to the Congress, and Congress then would either take appropriate action as they saw fit at that time or we let the sanctions continue on for another year. 
For sanctions already in effect at the time of enactment of this bill, this procedure is triggered at the next anniversary of the sanction if it has been in place for 2 years or more, or at the second anniversary for sanctions less than 2 years old. 
So this proposed legislation is retrospective and prospective both. We are trying to set down rules here that would apply and make sense on how we will operate in the future with existing sanctions that are in there now and ones that might be applied in the future under current and future laws of our land. 
Madam President, this bill does not give the President carte blanche to waive congressionally mandated sanctions, as some bills do, and does not allow a minority of the Senate to prevent sanctions from being lifted as is the case with some of our laws. 
We have worked on this very hard, and I believe this bill provides a balance of responsibilities between the President and the Congress. We do not cut the President out of the equation. We do not cut the Congress out of the equation. We recognize our constitutional responsibilities at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. This would apply in the imposition and removal of sanctions, and I urge the support of my colleagues for this bill. 
I know that a task force has been formed to look at some of the sanctions legislation, and I will be presenting this to that task force also for its consideration. There are several bills that will address this particular problem, but I think this bill really establishes a balance, and I hope I can rely on my colleagues for support when this subject comes to a vote. 
Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few comments concerning S. 2138, the Fiscal Year 1999 Energy and Water Development Appropriation Bill. 
The West Columbus Floodwall Project is an extremely important infrastructure project currently under development by the City of Columbus and the Army Corps of Engineers. Once completed this project will protect over 2,800 acres of urban development, and approximately 6,200 homes and businesses. Construction of this $118 million project was initiated in 1993 and was on schedule and budget for completion in 2002. 
The fiscal year 1999 civil works budget request for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers provided only $1.8 million for continued construction of this important project. The Committee increased the fiscal year 1999 funding to a total $7.5 million. Although I am grateful for the Committee's action, I am concerned because this project requires $16 million to keep it on track and moving forward. 
Mr. President, this project is unlike a lot of other flood projects in that it does not provide vitally needed flood protection for West Columbus until it is fully completed. Funding for this project at less than $16 million could delay it for up to one year and this area will continue to be exposed to an increased potential for flood damages of up to $455 million. In addition, the homeowners and businesses in this area will face continued zoning restrictions, and development of 2800 acres will be delayed. 
The city of Columbus has been damaged in the past by severe flooding of the Scioto River, which runs through the heart of its downtown. In 1913, 1937 and 1959, the city was devastated by flood disasters resulting in millions of dollars in damage to commercial and residential property, destruction of homes and businesses, and the loss of many lives. In 1990 and 1992, the city again experienced serious flood scares. If the West Columbus project were in place during previous recent flood events, damages would have been prevented. 
Mr. President, during the December 1990 rainfall and flood event, inundation and localized flood damages occurred in the Phase 1B/McKinley Avenue area. The Scioto River rose to a flood level approaching a 20-year frequency. If the project features had been in place at that time, the interior runoff would have drained to the stormwater pump station ST-8 and would have been pumped out of the interior. Instead, an existing storm sewer flap gate was held shut by the high Scioto River flood stage, preventing the interior runoff from draining to the river. Adjacent businesses were flooded until the Scioto River receded to a level that permitted the flap gate to open and allow interior runoff to drain to the river. 
During the July 1992 storm, rainfall in excess of 4 inches fell over the interior area along with a moderate rise in the Scioto River. An existing storm sewer flap gate was held shut and interior runoff could not drain to the river. If the proposed Dodge Park stormwater pump station had been available, it could have pumped excess runoff to the river, thus preventing flood damages that occurred along Rich Street. 
Mr. President, I understand that sufficient funding was not available for the many critically needed flood protection projects contained in this bill. For this reason I will not offer an amendment, however, I thought it was important to express my concerns and address the potential impacts of not funding this project at the required level of $16 million. I am pleased that the House was able to fully fund this project in their bill and it is my hope that during Conference, the Senate will recede to the House's position and provide $16 million for the West Columbus Floodwall Project. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the outstanding entrepreneurial achievement of a resident from my home state of Ohio, Mr. Ross O. Youngs. The President of Univenture Incorporated, Ross was recently named as Small Business Person of the Year. The decision was made by Vice President Al Gore and Aida Alvarez, Administrator of the Small Business Administration. Mr. Youngs was selected from a highly competitive field of 53 small businesses representing all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam. 
Ross Youngs began Univenture 10 years ago with an idea, hard work, perseverance and a limited budget. In the long standing tradition of the American Entrepreneur, Ross took a $20,000 personal bank loan and started a company in his basement. Over the following nine years, two Small Business Administration guaranteed loans helped Mr. Youngs expand production. Sales have risen in 10 years from $111,000 to $15 million. Ross Youngs' company Univenture has proven itself to be an outstanding example of American small business. 
Univenture is not only a successful company but also a contributor to the community in a number of ways. The firm works with a local organization to employ people with disabilities, Univenture supports the Columbus Police Department's Shop-With-A-Cop Program to provide gifts for needy children during the holiday season and contributes to the Wexner Center for the Arts. 
Mr. Youngs continues to be an example of outstanding achievement in business and his community. It is with great pride that I recognize Mr. Ross Youngs as the National Small Business Person of the Year during National Small Business Week. I extend my congratulations and wish him continued success.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for Senate ratification of the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on Accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. This is the fourth time that the Atlantic alliance, which rose from the ashes of World War II, has decided to expand. And each time, expansion has served the same purpose--to expand the area in Europe within which peace, stability, freedom and democracy could flourish. The NATO Alliance was remarkably successful throughout its initial decades. Today we are considering a step designed to ensure that the success continues into the next century. This is not a decision that NATO, the U.S. or the Senate takes lightly. It is a more serious issue which goes to the heart of the question of how the U.S. can best promote our interest in peace and stability in the post-Cold War era. After all, these new members will enjoy all the benefits and bear all the responsibilities which apply to the current members of this mutual defense alliance. The U.S. will be obliged to consider an attack on Warsaw, Budapest or Prague in the same manner we are not obliged to consider an attack on London, Paris or Bonn. Having fought in two wars, I am most cognizant of the solemnity of the obligation we will be undertaking through the ratification of this agreement. 
The 1990s, which witnessed the end of the Cold War and the demise of the Warsaw Pact, brought about a fundamental transformation in Europe. Where once we saw Europe divided into hostile, ideologically-opposed camps, we now see a continent increasingly united by a commitment to the principles of democracy and free market economics. 
Initially I had two principal concerns about the proposed enlargement of NATO to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic--the cost to the U.S. and the impact on relations with Russia. In the nearly ten months since NATO made the official decision to offer membership to these three nations, I have continued to examine these two areas and will summarize, very briefly, my conclusions. 
In December of last year NATO completed a review of the estimated increases in the costs to NATO's commonly-funded budget resulting from enlargement. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee's report describes how NATO conducted its review and calculated its cost estimate. 
NATO first identified the military requirements of incorporating these three new members into the Alliance. Teams of experts were then dispatched to each country to evaluate facilities, infrastructure, and current capabilities to meet NATO's projected military requirements. With this information, NATO then developed a cost estimate for bringing the current capabilities into line with NATO requirements. The NATO studies concluded that the cost of enlargement will total $1.5 billion over the next ten years. Thus, according to NATO, the additional U.S. payment to the common-funded budgets will average approximately $40 million per year over ten years. 
This amount does not seem to me to be excessive, given the U.S. stake in continued security and stability in Europe. Obviously, in addition to these commonly-funded costs, there will be considerable additional costs to the new members themselves, which each of them has pledged to meet. Yes, the United States may decide to help these new NATO members modernize their military forces; just as we have provided such assistance to many of our current NATO allies through, for example, the provisions of loans or loan guarantees, for the purchase of U.S.-made military equipment. However, Mr. President, that is a separate decision for the U.S. government, one that is neither required by nor prohibited by our decision to support enlargement. The responsibility for ensuring that their militaries are capable of meeting their obligations to the common defense rest with the new members themselves. 
It hardly needs repeating that cooperative relations between Russia and the U.S., and Russia and NATO, serve the interests of the U.S. and the Alliance. I am convinced that NATO enlargement and the development of a NATO-Russia relationship are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, since NATO made clear its intention to expand, NATO and Russia have concluded the `NATO-Russia Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security', signed last May. This agreement is designed as a means of regularizing and formalizing consultative procedures between NATO and Russia. 
Further, NATO is a purely defensive alliance, and a threat to no nation. The peace and stability within Europe promoted by the Alliance benefits the entire continent, including Russia. It may be unreasonable to expect Russia to approve of NATO expansion. But neither is Russia's unhappiness over the expansion likely to become the determining factor in Russian behavior toward the U.S. and the Alliance. 
In summary, Mr. President, I believe that these two major issues arising from NATO expansion have been satisfactorily addressed. I will support NATO expansion and hope that the Senate will ratify the expansion agreement by an overwhelming margin.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I think this Nation of ours came to be what it is, more than anything else, for one reason, and that is public education in this country was not what it had been in Europe. It had not been just for the kids from the castle. It had not been just for the rich kids or the wealthy young people. It had not been just for those who were politically well connected, who knew somebody. 
In this country, education came to be for every single person, and that grew as a national interest. It was implemented then for the K-12, as we know it now, through the States and localities and communities across this country. They formed local school boards, and we have school districts. Now every single State has a requirement for public education. 
We did not preclude other people who had parochial school ideas for their children, or whether they wanted to send their kids to boys schools or girls schools or a special interest of some kind, from forming those schools and from sending their children to those schools. But we looked at the public responsibility as being to the public schools that gave a good education to every single young person in this country.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, what my amendment would do is say we could keep the $2,000 that is in the bill now, but we would move that just to be used for post-12th grade education. In other words, we move from $500 up to $2,000, but we say it cannot be used for private schools, for private school vouchers, and so on. 
I think when we start down this track, we start toward the ruination or start opening the door, a toe in the door, for a ruination of our public school system. I want the finest public school system we can have. Voting a voucher system or taking public money off to support private schools is not the way to go about it. I urge support for my amendment.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I offered an amendment yesterday to the Coverdell educational IRA bill. The amendment I propose will simply delete the K-12--kindergarten through grade 12--expenses as an authorized deduction for education IRAs. The amendment will keep the increase in the annual allowable contribution from the current $500 to the maximum $2,000 a year. I think that is fine, that is good. 
But deleting K-12 and increasing the allowable contribution returns education IRAs to their original purpose of providing incentive savings incentives for higher education purposes. That is what the Federal Government has basically taken responsibility for through all the many years that we have been around here. 
We should be looking at this whole bill for what it is. It is tax support for private school education. I believe it is bad education policy. I believe it is bad tax policy. I also think it is probably going to pass. If it does, I think the President is going to veto it. He has indicated that that is his intention. 
If we look back to the days of our forefathers when people were coming to this country, they came here to have the opportunity for education. They were used to only the rich or--kids from the castle--being able to have formal education. 
There were basically two kinds of people. There were the educated and the uneducated. And that is another way of saying there were the wealthy and the poor. That is what education was all about. It was to enable everybody to move up, to have a chance, to use their God-given talents and capabilities and their own desires to move ahead, to make a better life for themselves. And in this country, in the United States, we knew that if a democracy was to succeed--we did not want to return to serfdom, and rule by a few, and wealth for just a few--education was key to making a democracy succeed. It was not a choice in our democracy, it was a must, or our country was doomed. 
And the freedom to be educated, that most important freedom to be educated, spread to communities and States. And they all formed and supported public schools for all--for all--of our people. And that is the important thing we are addressing here today--education for all of our people. It was a requirement that we have minimum education. 
This is my 24th year as a U.S. Senator representing the people of Ohio. And in that time, I have seen many attempts to divert Federal funds from public to private education. The approaches to accomplish this goal have been many. We had tuition tax credits; we had the voucher system; school choice; now educational IRAs for elementary and secondary education. 
The Coverdell IRA, I believe, is a backdoor voucher that will do nothing to improve public schools for our public schoolchildren. That is the responsibility of Government. If other people want to take money, for whatever reason, whether it is religious or whether they just want a different school for their kids, whether they want all boys or all girls schools--that was a choice we did not deny. We did not say that we are going to Federally subsidize that kind of educational choice. And we should not be trying to do it now. 
The educational expenses that the Coverdell bill provides would include tuition and fees at public, private, and religious schools. The bill does not target needy families. And I believe here is one of the biggest reasons against what is being proposed here with the bill.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the point I was going to make is this: Families in the top 20 percent of income distribution, would receive 70 percent of the benefit of this bill--70 percent. 
The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that more than half the savings would go to families whose children would attend private schools anyway. So 70 percent of the money, 70 percent of the benefit, is going to go to those who already are fully capable of sending their kids to private schools. So the bill subsidizes the savings and spending patterns that already exist. 
I do not think we should be heading back toward a bill that sends us back to the place where our forefathers started in Europe: where education is going to be best for the wealthy, where education is for those who have political connections, where education is available for the kids from the castle. That is not the way this country developed. Our country went ahead because we had programs that made education available for every single young person in this country--every single person. And that is what we should still be shooting for today. 
Cleveland, OH, has one of only two voucher programs in the country. The other is in Milwaukee. In Ohio, this program permits State funds to be used to send low-income children to private schools. 
It is the only program that allows the children to attend religious schools, parochial schools, with taxpayer funds. It is being challenged now before the Ohio State Supreme Court on that basis. It is funded at $12.5 million over 2 years. It is just finishing its second year right now, and results have been very spotty. 
As a matter of fact, there are other problems that have developed also. How about paying for taxicabs for the kids? They found out that the yellow schoolbuses that the school system depends on were not adequate to furnish the transportation for the young people that were going to be taking advantage of the voucher program. That wasn't foreseen. So student taxi rides account for more than half of the $4.8 million deficit in Cleveland's 2-year-old school voucher program. It shows how an unintended consequence can take over in some instances. The voucher program had to turn to taxi firms and provide payments to parents in lieu of transportation services. That is half the funding. 
There is no strong evidence at the end of the second year of the program that the voucher program increases student achievement. We need to have a better understanding of what makes a school successful before we institute a program that benefits a comparatively few young people and takes money out of the public school system. That should be our major concern--our desire to have a good public school system. 
Strengthening public education in this country is something we have to do. It is necessary if we are going to be competitive in the economic future of this country. Only by making high-quality education available to all American children --not a favored few, but all American children--will we help develop the skills they need to find meaningful high-wage jobs, while developing a capable and productive work force that is essential, literally essential, to the economic future of this country in this new worldwide economic environment in which we live. 
Education reform is one of the top issues before the country now. It is talked about all over, in magazine articles, and is on the cover of magazines. One that I read last night talked about the education problem. That is why I continue to oppose attempts to encourage the use of Federal funds for nonpublic education, whether in the form of tuition tax credits or vouchers or school choice. I believe including K through 12 in educational IRAs is the first step toward establishing a permanent voucher system. It just bleeds off necessary money from the public schools. 
We have a public school system of education in this country that is available to all children. If this educational system is not producing the high level of achievement this Nation now needs, we can't abandon them, we can't say we will just take less money and put it in the public school system. We can't abandon them. That is why I support the school construction amendment initiatives that will help reduce classroom size and directly benefit all our Nation's public schools by ensuring that all children attend safe and modern public schools. Senator Kennedy mentioned that a moment ago, and I agree with his remarks on that. 
I believe everyone should be saving for their children's education, but the difference between elementary and secondary education and higher education is important. Every child in this country is entitled to a free, appropriate, tuition-free education in every State. We have State laws in every State in our Union that require that. Higher education, going on to the college and university level, however, is optional and is tuition-based. It is hard for parents to save for college. I believe it is appropriate to provide incentives to help them do so. I have supported the prepaid tuition plans in the State of Ohio as a way that students can be assured of a quality education at one of Ohio's State universities or at one of their colleges there. 
The amendment which I am offering returns the educational IRA back to its original purpose--higher education expenses only. The only change I make is to keep the increase that is proposed in the contribution limit for education IRAs from $500 to $2,000. I think that is fine. This increase in the contribution will enable 
parents to save more per year for higher education. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment. 
We have a lot of problems in this country. The old property tax that has been around for a long time is no longer adequate to do the job. It may have been OK back in the days of Jefferson and Washington when we didn't have NASDAQ, the American Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange, mutual funds and so on. Most of the wealth at that time was in property, so a property tax was very appropriate to support the schools. Particularly over the last four or five decades we have now developed into being a service economy where two-thirds of our wealth, two-thirds of our national income, comes from the service industry. So the old property tax is no longer adequate to do our schools. We have to get away from that. 
Proposition 13 in California we are familiar with, did, in my view, wreck one of the finest education systems in the country. They are having a lot of problems that everybody else has around the country these days. 
We are the only industrialized nation in the world that does not have a national education system. I am not here today to say we should go to a national education system. That would probably get me run down the front steps of the Capitol pretty fast. But we have to do more from the Federal level. We are only a tiny part of our K through 12 education. I think it is just around 5 percent now. Most of that is in school lunch programs and things like that and not directly on educational matters. 
Our system in this country, as Lester Thurow pointed out in his last couple of books, our system is basically run by 15,000 independent school boards all saying, `We won't raise your taxes,' and then they get together and decide what they will do in the local school districts. They get elected on `we won't raise your taxes,' `We aren't going to vote on any other taxes; we will not raise your property taxes,' so we at the Federal level are increasingly up against this as to what we should be doing. 
What we see is we are becoming gradually less competitive in a worldwide environment. We can't let that happen. The answer is not, as in this Coverdell bill, to say we will siphon money off from the public school system and give it over to the private school system in the form of vouchers or IRAs or whatever, take it out and put it over there, away from the public school system and support them less instead of more. That doesn't solve our problems in this country. So we do have some other problems. We have to address those, but not this way and not with this particular piece of legislation. 
I noted this morning in looking at the Los Angeles Times their lead editorial today was entitled `Don't Drain Public Schools.' I ask unanimous consent to have this printed at the conclusion of my remarks.

Mr. GLENN. `Don't Drain Public schools.' That is exactly what we are talking about. We will drain public schools to the benefit of private schools, and 70 percent of the money will go to people already capable of providing, to the top 20 percent of the people already capable of providing for private schools for their kids if they want it. 
The insert in this article, and I will not read the complete article, the insert says, `Washington should help address the education deficits in the Nation's public schools, but shifting even a small amount of tax money to private schools is not the answer, at least not yet.' That about summarizes everything that I want to make a point of this morning. 
I think there is a vote on my amendment at 2:15 after our respective party caucuses. I hope people can think long and hard about this. I see this as a first step down a long slippery slope toward less and less support for our public school system, that which serves all America, that which enables people at the lowest level of economic advantage in this country to get opportunity through education and their own hard work to be a contributing member of society and make as much of a success of their lives as anybody else. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. GLENN. This amendment will simply delete the K-12 expenses as an authorized deduction for education IRAs. The amendment will keep the increase in the annual allowable contribution from the current $500 to the maximum $2,000 a year. 
Deleting K-12 and increasing the allowable contribution returns education IRAs to their original purpose of providing incentive savings for higher education expenses. I believe we should be looking at this bill for what it is; it is tax support for private school education, pure and simple. 
Also, I believe this is bad education policy and it is bad tax policy. And let me tell you why. 
We go back to the days of our forefathers: our own parents and grandparents and great, great grandparents coming to this country from Europe, where many were escaping persecution. One of the big things that they wanted for their children was an education. That's because education was, pure and simple, not for everybody. Education was only for the kids from the castle, or education was for the rich, or education was for the politically connected. And there were two kinds of people in those lands in Europe that our forefathers came from: wealthy and poor, educated and uneducated. 
When they landed in this country of ours and started expanding and started setting up communities, and became a United States of America, they knew that if democracy was to succeed, if they were not to return to serfdom, and ruled by a few, that education was not a choice; in a democracy it was a must or the democracy was doomed. 
The freedom to be educated spread to States and communities where public schools were established for all. That idea expanded and caught fire and took root. It was the beginning of our system of public education in this country. The public, taxpayers, continue to pay for this educational system. And, out of that education of all has come research, has come commitment, has come economics, has come agriculture, has come business, has come industry, has come health, has come standards of living that are the envy of the world; we have had longer life expectancy, all of those things, and more, because of universal education, the best we can have for our people. 
At the same time, if people, for religious reasons or beliefs, want education which reflects this or they want a particular kind of education--it used to be all-boys schools, all-girls schools, whatever; we supported that as long as those schools--were not supported with public money. We supported the right of people to have private schools, and support private schools as long as they paid for them. 
But the Government response was and is to provide not just a satisfactory educational system in this country, not just an educational system that will get us by, not just one that is OK, but what we should be shooting for is the best educational system in this world for all of our citizens in this country, through a public educational system. 
Public school systems now are having some problems, that is true. It is not much wonder when we look how they are set up. We don't have a national education as such. I am not proposing here today we suddenly say all States and local communities are taken out of the picture here and we are going to go to a national school system as other nations have. As a matter of fact, every major industrialized nation in the world has a national school system. 
But our school system in this country has come under some stress. It is no wonder, when we think back in the early days of this country when we had a tax for schools, it was paid for basically by the property owners. Back then we didn't have a NASDAQ, a New York stock exchange, an American stock exchange and mutual funds all over the place for people to invest in. Most of the people capable of supporting schools had their money in property, in real estate, real property. So it was natural that a property tax was put in place, and those people were the ones who wound up supporting most of our school systems. 
As it developed, we had other problems because today no longer is a property tax indicative of the wealth of this country, because two-thirds of our economy is now generated from the service industries in our society. So it is no wonder the property tax has become unpopular with an awful lot of people. 
Plus, we have another problem, too, in this country as far as making sure we get a good education for everyone. As Lester Thurow has been pointing out in his last couple of books, our basic K-through-12 education system in this country is run by 15,000 independent school boards all getting elected on the basis of `We won't raise your taxes.' That is some system. I think it is amazing that it has worked as well as it has up until now. 
Our K-through-12 education gets a little over 5 percent of their funding from the Federal Government. It is not something where the Federal Government tries to run the whole school system. But that is a little bit of background on what I think is very important: that every single child in this country should be able to get the finest, the best education of any place in this world. We should not be siphoning money off of our public education system to provide vouchers for private schools. 
This is my 24th year as a U.S. Senator representing the people of Ohio. In that time, I have seen many attempts to divert Federal funds from public to private schools. The approaches to accomplish this goal have been many--tuition tax credits, vouchers, school choice, and now educational IRAs for elementary and secondary education. These proposals all allow parents to select which school their children will attend and thereby competition, supposedly, with public schools. It is the presumed goal they will improve students' performance as a result of competition. There are problems coming up because public and private schools don't compete on an even basis. Private schools, unlike public schools, can refuse to accept students with disabilities or discipline problems and are not subjected to the same requirements. 
Each time these proposals come before the Senate, I am proud to say I have cast my vote in opposition because I firmly believe we must have the finest public school system in the world. That is what the Government should be supporting--not putting money off into other experiments. I want parents to exercise their right and responsibility to decide the school their children will attend--public, private, parochial. Nothing wrong with choice. However, it is not the responsibility of the Federal Government to pay them to do so. 
As I see it, the Coverdell IRA is a backdoor voucher that will do nothing to improve public schools, which are my main concern, for our public school children. This new IRA tax subsidy provides 
tax breaks for educational expenses, including tuition and fees at public, private, and religious schools. 
Also, the bill does not target needy families. In fact, here is one of the facts I was very much interested in: Families in the top 20 percent of income in this country--the top 20 percent of income in this country--would receive 70 percent of the benefit. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that more than half the savings would go to families whose children would attend private school anyway. So the bill subsidizes the savings and spending patterns that already exist. Let me repeat that: 70 percent of the benefit would go to families already in the top 20 percent of income. 
In other words, the analogy I made a little while ago regarding the land of our forefathers in Europe, where education was for the wealthy, for the privileged, for the kids from the castle, we are now taking a step back in that direction by helping mainly those who are already well enough off to send their children to private or parochial schools. 
As I stated, qualified educational expense is defined in the bill to include tuition, fees, tutoring, special needs services, books, supplies and equipment, including computers. The expenses must be incurred in connection with the beneficiary's enrollment in a public, private, or parochial elementary or secondary school, and the funds may be used to pay for expenses such as room and board and uniforms and transportation. 
Let me give a little bit of personal experience from Ohio. Cleveland, OH, has one of only two voucher programs in the country. The other one is in Milwaukee. In Ohio, this program permits State funds to be used to send low-income children to private schools. It is the only program that allows the children to attend religious schools with taxpayer funds. It is funded at $12.5 million over 2 years. Right now, the legality of the program is being challenged and it is before the Ohio State Supreme Court now. 
Let me say this, the program has been in effect now for 2 years. In surveys made recently of how the academics are going with the children in these schools, it is not all that great. So far, they have not been able to show any real results where the kids that are going to these private schools are any better off academically than they would have been in public school. Some of the proponents of the voucher system in Ohio and Cleveland say it hasn't had long enough to take effect yet. We are close to the end of the second year of this program now and testing has not shown much difference at all. 
Another problem that was unforeseen--and this may seem like a minor problem and maybe not one that will be a problem nationally, but it shows we have some unforeseen consequences sometimes when we start something like this. That is paying for taxicabs. Paying for cabs to carry children to private schools is one of the reasons the school choice program is in jeopardy in Cleveland. This is no small item. Students' taxi rides account for more than half of the $4.8 million deficit in Cleveland's 2-year-old school voucher program. More than half of the deficit goes to providing kids taxicab rides basically because the school officials had no yellow bus transportation available for the voucher students.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill naming the Federal Building and Courthouse at 85 Marconi Boulevard in Columbus, Ohio after one of my home state's most highly esteemed members of the federal bench, Judge Joseph P. Kinneary. 
Judge Kinneary has served on the United States District Court of Ohio for over 32 years. But Judge Kinneary's commitment to public service goes much further beyond these past three decades. He has given a lifetime to public service. In fact, that service continues even today where, at age 92, Judge Kinneary continues to serve as a senior judge carrying a docket of cases. 
I'd like to take a few minutes of my colleagues' time to talk about this amazing gentleman and what he's done for my home state of Ohio and our entire nation. 
Judge Kinneary graduated from the University of Cincinnati's College of Law in 1935. After practicing law in both Columbus and Cincinnati for two years, Judge Kinneary served as Assistant Attorney General of Ohio until 1939. 
But, as happened to many Americans in those days, World War II changed Joseph Kinneary's career plans. He served in the Army from 1942 to 1946, and worked as the Chief of the Legal Branch for the Field Headquarters of the Quartermaster Corps. 
After his war service, Judge Kinneary returned to private practice. In 1949, however, Judge Kinneary returned to public service and became the First Assistant Attorney General of Ohio. And, in 1961, President Kennedy appointed Judge Kinneary to United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio where he served until 1966. 
In 1966, President Johnson appointed Judge Kinneary to the District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Well-respected among his colleagues, he served as Chief Judge from January 1973 to September 1975. 
And, today, 32 years after his appointment to the bench, Judge Kinneary still presides and draws a docket that is approximately 80 percent of an active judge. I find Judge Kinneary's dedication to the people of Ohio and America inspiring, as I'm sure many of my colleagues do on hearing of his career. 
I can think of no better way for the U.S. Senate, for the entire country, to honor Judge Kinneary than to name one of Columbus, Ohio's, most important federal buildings and courthouses in his honor. So, it is with great thanks and a deep sense of honor that I introduce today a bill to name the Columbus Courthouse after Judge Kinneary. I urge my colleagues to give this legislation quick consideration and approval.

 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Fred Hitz, who will soon be retiring from his position as CIA Inspector General. I have known Fred since he worked in the Department of Energy's congressional affairs' office in the 1970's, and I have gotten to know Fred particularly well since he became the first statutory CIA Inspector General in November of 1990. As Fred heads off to teach at Princeton University--his alma mater, I would simply note that the CIA's loss will be Princeton's gain. 
As the first statutory CIA IG, all of Fred's moves have been relentlessly scrutinized as his mission was often met with a great deal of apprehension. Fred was faced with the significant challenge of establishing an internal, yet independent, oversight mechanism within the CIA that served the DCI, and had certain responsibilities to the Congressional oversight committees. Over seven years later, because of Fred Hitz's tenacity, integrity, and respect for the Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA Office of Inspector General has matured, and today provides the effective, professional oversight that Congress intended when the CIA IG Act was passed in 1989. This has been no small achievement. 
In over 7 years of service as the CIA IG, Fred Hitz and his office have generated hundreds of quality products, and have advanced the national security of the United States by demonstrably improving the efficiency and effectiveness of this important agency. Fred has overseen the conduct of increasingly sophisticated and highly visible audits, inspections and investigations that have enhanced the accountability of the CIA and preserved the trust of CIA management, Congress and the public. 
Fred has developed and promoted standards of accountability that have brought consistency and fairness to the Agency's handling of employee performance issues. He has greatly strengthened the Office of Inspector General by expanding the size of its professional cadre and the scope of its efforts, as well as by insisting that its audits, inspections and investigations be conducted with thoroughness, strict objectivity and an unwavering devotion to quality. In so doing, Fred has garnered the Office of Inspector General the respect, admiration and trust of CIA managers, counterparts throughout the Intelligence Community and the U.S. Government--and the Congressional intelligence oversight committees. 
As a result of Fred's leadership, the CIA's Office of Inspector General has become a bulwark of independence and professionalism, assuring the American people that their nation's premier intelligence organization is conducting its activities efficiently, effectively and under the rule of law. 
Mr. President, the CIA and the nation owe Fred Hitz a great deal of gratitude for his fine work at the Central Intelligence Agency. I wish Fred all the best in all of his future endeavors.

 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I am very proud to commend former Ambassador Milton A. Wolf of Cleveland, Ohio, on his recognition by the Ohio Senate. 
Ambassador Wolf is truly one of the leading citizens of my state and has spent a lifetime learning, building and helping his hometown of Cleveland, our state and nation and people all over the world. 
Milt Wolfe grew up in Cleveland and attended Glenville High School, but like many of us his education was interrupted by World War II. After serving in the Army Air Forces in the Pacific, Milt started out to be a doctor but went on to attend the Ohio State University and earned a degree in chemistry and biology and later at Case Institute of Technology a degree in civil engineering. In the construction business Milt built homes in Shaker Heights and Parma and Euclid. He went on to build high-rises and shopping centers. He continued his education and received a masters degree in economics from Case Western Reserve University in 1973. 
In 1977, President Carter appointed Milt as our Ambassador to Austria and a delegate to the U.N. Conference on Science and Technology for Development in 1979. He served as a host in Vienna for the summit conference between Soviet President Brezhnev and President Carter on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty in 1979. 
When Milt returned to Cleveland from Austria, he continued to serve by teaching economics at Case Western Reserve University. He has worked long and hard in support of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. This committee provides millions of dollars to a variety of humanitarian assistance programs of relief, rescue, and reconstruction in over fifty nations. As president of the committee from 1992 until 1995 and currently as Chairman of the Board, Ambassador Wolf has been able to directly help people all over the world. 
As a member of the Board of Trustees of the Ohio State University from 1986 until 1996 and Chairman of the Board in 1996 he made significant contributions as an educational leader of one the nation's largest universities. He clearly expressed his philosophy in education when he said that the wealth of the country is in it people. He said, `We have to have a highly educated population if we are going to compete in the next century.' 
Milt continues to support improvements in our educational system, but has never neglected his own continuing education. In 1993, Milt earned a Ph.D. in economics from Case Western. 
He continues to serve the community as a member of the Board of Trustees of Case Western Reserve University, and on the boards of the Cleveland Clinic, Mount Sinai Health Care System and the Cleveland Orchestra. 
Last November Ambassador Wolf received the Austrian Cross of Honor for Science and Art--First Class bestowed by the Ambassador of the Republic of Austria in New York. Last December the Ohio State University granted Ambassador Wolf an honorary Doctor of Diplomacy degree. 
In its resolution of recognition of Ambassador Wolf's receipt of the Austrian Cross of Honor, the Ohio Senate stated  
At a time when the international landscape is dominated by images of conflict and antagonism, and in an era when hostility both within and between countries could spell disaster for the whole planet, every attempt to forge closer ties among citizens of diverse backgrounds and beliefs is of urgent significance. In this context, you have shown how very much a diligent, conscientious person can accomplish, and you can be proud that your commitment to promote global harmony through language, learning, and letters has inspired many who know you to dedicate themselves similarly. 
Milt Wolfe has set an example for us all in his efforts for all people. He is a builder, an educator and a humanitarian. Milt is a successful businessman who made time for helping others. I am proud of his friendship. My wife Annie joins me in congratulating him on this much deserved recognition.

 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, one of the fundamentals of our great Republic has been public education and the benefits it bestows to our society. 
As the early American pioneers moved westward across the Appalachian Mountains, they chartered--in 1804--the first university in the Western Territory near the Hocking River in the town of Athens: Ohio University. Since then, the impact of this pioneering institution has reached far beyond the Appalachian foothills, across the nation and around the globe. 
Today, I rise to offer a tribute to a modern-day educator who represents the best characteristics of our public education system, Dr. Ralph Izard. 
For a dozen years, Dr. Izard has served as director of the E. W. Scripps School of Journalism at Ohio University. Effective June 30, 1998, after more than three decades of service to Ohio University and the academic community, he will retire. 
Mr. President, I recognize that journalism training occurs throughout our nation, however, those who rate post-secondary journalism education consistently rank Ohio University among the nation's best. 
Whether it's education, or politics or sports, it's tough to repeat as champions. Yet, that is the legacy of Dr. Izard at Ohio University. Year after year, the E. W. Scripps School of Journalism, under his direction, has produced premier writers, editors and public relations practitioners. 
Like all success stories, there are multiple reasons why the E. W. Scripps School of Journalism excels. Among them: a strong faculty and widespread private support from alumni and industry. 
E. W. Scripps is a legend in the publishing world. The Scripps' partnership with higher education through Ohio University is a national model for private support for public education. 
This success story includes another key ingredient; the leadership and professionalism of Dr. Ralph Izard. Involved in academia for 32 years, Dr. Izard never lost his focus on individual students, and he never lost his love of teaching. 
That's because he never stopped learning. As technology changed, Dr. Izard kept pace. He insisted journalism education adapt to change. Thus, college training remained relevant to students and the job market. 
So today, nearly two centuries after those early pioneers founded a university in Athens, Dr. Izard personifies their ideals of higher education by preparing thousands of their sons and daughters for the challenges of a new century. 
For his achievements, leadership and dedication to education, we salute Dr. Ralph Izard and wish him well in future endeavors.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, earlier today Senator Daschle, our minority leader, made some remarks in tribute to the longest-serving Senator from Kentucky to serve in the U.S. Senate, and that is Wendell Ford, our minority whip. 
I wanted to add my words of congratulations, in recognition of this person that I believe to be one of our most outstanding U.S. Senators. He is a very dedicated public servant. He is also a good personal friend. He is the senior Senator from Kentucky, Wendell Ford. I don't think it is any accident that the people of Kentucky have returned Wendell time after time, one election after another, to where he now has served here almost a quarter of a century. 
Wendell, of course, is a very personable person. He likes people. I think that was evidenced early in his career when I believe he was national president of the Jaycees. Later on, the people of Kentucky, after having elected him Governor for a term, then elected him to the U.S. Senate. He has served them well here over the last nearly quarter of a century. I had the honor and privilege to serve alongside him for all that time since he came to the Senate. He and I were sworn in at about the same time, and for the first few years we were here, by the luck of the draw, we sat side by side in the Senate Chamber. That was back in the time period when we had many all-night sessions, and you got to know a person pretty well when you sat and shared views with them during some of those extended debates and lengthy all-night sessions. 
Wendell is certainly known for his wit and humor. I remember once we were sitting here about 3:30 or 4 o'clock in the morning and a debate was going on. Wendell nudged me and said, `You know, John, the people back home think we are the ones that won.' I got a kick out of that. We were going through some very troubled times in the U.S. Senate at that time. 
The Senate class of 1974 was one that I think was remarkable not only because I happened to be one of those people but because it came in on the tail-end of Watergate. Watergate played an issue in that year's election. But the people we elected that year included a number of outstanding public officials who would continue illustrious public careers, including John Culver, Robert Morgan, Paul Laxalt, James Jake Garn, Gary Hart, and four Senators still serving--myself and Senators Ford, Bumpers, and Leahy. With the announced retirements that we have already, Senator Leahy will be the only representative out of that class of 1974 still remaining at the end of this year. 
The distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Senator Ford, has served on the Senate Rules Committee for many years, been chairman and ranking member. He became an expert on disputed elections quite early on in his service, because one of the first issues that that class of 1974 faced in the Senate was the disputed election in New Hampshire between John Durkin and Louis Wyman. In that case, the Senate determined that a new election was necessary. So Wendell got tossed into that maelstrom of disputed elections very early on. I say that hasn't ended through all these years either, because even during this last year he worked toward a successful solution in the Louisiana election dispute. 
I can say without any contradiction that Senator Ford is truly a Senator's Senator. He is rarely on the floor making long speeches and posturing before the camera. That is rare. In fact, he never does that. But his voice is heard. His influence is heard on almost all issues, because the Senate, his fellow Senators on the Democratic side, sought at this time to elect him as our whip, our No. 2 person in the hierarchy of leadership in the Senate. 
I think Senator Ford would appreciate the fact, coming from Kentucky--and I have heard him make comments about the horses, and all of his attention to the horses in Kentucky, and the big business that is in Kentucky, and his attention to things like the Kentucky Derby and so on. But he would appreciate it that we know him as a `workhorse,' not just as a show horse, here in the U.S. Senate. He is always working behind the scenes for whatever the interests are of the party or his interests for Kentucky. And he has provided strong leadership in his ability as a negotiator and his talents for finding compromise that have served both parties and the Nation extraordinarily well. 
He has been in the forefront of many issues during his career in the Senate, including such more recent things in just the last few years as motor-voter legislation, trying to make sure that every person in this country has a maximum opportunity to exercise the right to vote. Lobbying reform and campaign finance reform have been of particular interest in recent years. 
Of course, Kentucky is first. I just wish I could say that I have been as tireless an advocate for Ohio as he has been for Kentucky, because even when we have disagreed on things, we find a way to work them out. Wendell represents Kentucky and the interests of the people of Kentucky first. That comes out all the time. He and I have worked together on matters of mutual interest, including the regional airport in Cincinnati and Department of Energy facilities that are both in Kentucky and in Ohio. 
As I mentioned earlier today, Senator Ford's service in the Senate will surpass the length of surface of Alben Barkley, who had previously been the longest-serving Senator from Kentucky. Senator Ford will have served longer than any other Kentuckian in the Senate, including such statesmen as Henry Clay, John Breckenridge, Happy Chandler, and John Sherman Cooper. 
I think Wendell Ford adds an illustrious career that matches any of those other people the great State of Kentucky has sent to the Senate through the years. With Wendell, you always know where you stand, but he also knows how to disagree without being disagreeable at the same time. 
He is known for his wit, humor, and intense discussions. He knows how to break the tension with a little humor, a joke, or something that applies. 
I would be remiss if I didn't mention one other thing, and that is his dedication to his family--Jean, his wife, and his children and grandchildren. I remember last August, when other Senators were talking about what trips they were planning, and I asked Wendell if he was planning to travel, he said, `Yep; I'm going to travel to Kentucky to go fishing with the grandchildren.' That is exactly what he did, and I'm sure the grandchildren were the better off for it. 
So I'm pleased to join my colleagues in recognition of the long service of Senator Wendell Ford. He has been a very valued colleague and a personal friend to me in the Senate. His company will truly be one of the things I will miss next year, and I think, most of all, the people of Kentucky are going to miss the kind of leadership he has provided. We are here today not to talk about that, but to recognize that today marks the day when he becomes the longest-serving Senator to ever serve from the State of Kentucky. I want to recognize him for that. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, 
and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the legislation to reauthorize the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991. In 1991, the Congress passed the first ISTEA bill. Upon its enactment, ISTEA revolutionized transportation funding in the United States. Prior to ISTEA, states like Ohio gave substantially more in support of the national highway system than we received in return. While we understood that the completion of the national highway system was a goal worthy of support, in 1991 that system was 95% complete. It was time to shift our priorities and our resources accordingly. As one of the largest of these so-called `donor states,' I worked with my colleagues to enact a law that provided a better return on our transportation dollars, allowed flexibility for states and localities in determining transportation spending priorities, and that provided a record amount of funding for alternatives to highway transportation like transit, light rail, and pedestrian walkways. 
The second step in this new transportation journey, ISTEA II reduces further the inequitable relationship between donor and donee states, streamlines programs to improve their efficiency, and increases the flexibility of states and localities in spending highway funds for alternate modes of transportation. Mr. President, the bill provides a record return for donor states, ensuring that Ohio and all donor states realize returns of 91 cents on every transportation dollar contributed to the Highway Trust Fund. For Ohio, that translates to $5.2 billion over six years, an average of $868.9 million a year. Nationally, ISTEA II authorizes the spending of $151.4 billion over six years, averaging $25.2 billion a year. 
In addition to these formula funds, Ohio will receive $65 million per year over five years for the High Density Transportation Program, the Appalachian Development Highway System Program, and other programs important to our state. 
The bill provides $41.3 billion for transit over five years, including $500 million for rural transit, $100 million for welfare to work funding and other programs essential to the efficient operation of urban and rural transit systems. In total, ISTEA II provides an increase in transit funding of $9.8 billion. 
During ISTEA II's consideration, I cosponsored amendments that reduce the legal level of intoxication to .08 blood alcohol content (BAC) and that prohibit open containers of alcoholic beverages in automobiles. Their successful passage and implementation will assist law enforcement officials in reducing the all too real threat that drunk drivers pose to our families and friends. Mr. President, if one tragedy like those that have affected so many of us can be avoided, I believe these laws will have served their purpose. 
In addition, I maintained my strong support for the enhancements provisions of this law. These enhancements provide states with much needed funds for historic preservation, bicycle trails, and pedestrian walkways. I cosponsored an amendment to provide $25 million a year for six years in annual appropriations for the preservation of historic covered bridges. Ohio has the second highest number of covered bridges in the United States. Of the 144 covered bridges in Ohio, 126 of these will be eligible for this funding.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I concur that this is an important issue that our Committee takes very seriously. We held a hearing on the Commission's report last year, and I know that the Chairman has wanted to return to this matter this year. 
The question of establishing a statutory framework for classification and declassification has long been a matter of debate. Our own committee held extensive hearings on this subject in 1973 and 1974. 
The current system is governed by Presidential executive order, and, as the Majority Leader noted, this has led over time to inconsistencies in policies and procedures. Some have questioned, however, whether legislation is needed. I believe that it is proper for Congress to legislate on this subject, while of course still respecting the authority of the President in this area. This principle of shared authority was recognized in the passage of the Atomic Energy Act, the Espionage Act, and the National Security Act. If Congress acts now to establish a statutory classification and declassification system, we should take a similarly balanced approach. 
Balance is also needed in our approach to considering the legislation in the Senate. While S. 712 has been properly referred to our committee, the Committee on Governmental Affairs, the bill raises important issues of interest to the Select Committee on Intelligence, the Armed Services Committee, and the Committee on Foreign Relations. I am fully committed to working with each of these committees as the bill moves forward.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about some of the events on the floor here over the last couple of days. I think perhaps sometimes we need a different yardstick by which to judge some of these votes. 
We have now in effect, I guess, unless this campaign finance legislation is hooked onto some other legislation as we go ahead with our legislative activities of this year, that it is probably dead for this year. I hate to say that. I want to give a speech on some of the outcome of our campaign finance reform hearings that have been taking place in the Governmental Affairs Committee most of last year. I was unable to get over and give this at the appropriate time before the votes that we have had but still want to talk about this a little bit. 
I think sometimes on controversial votes, which these are, that there is a different basis that we should be looking at instead of just the party line, just party loyalty and voting down the line with those party leaders who have a particular view. Those views, too often, affect just the political interests of the amendment. How much money are we going to be able to get for this next election? That is the basis on which votes seem to occur. That is a very short-term view of things. 
Now, on some of these controversial votes I think there is another way to decide. It is what I call the `grandchild test'--the `grandchild test.' 
What you should do on some of these votes, I think, is think of what you would like the ideal political system to be when your grandchildren have grown up and long after most of us will have left the Senate of the United States. What kind of law do you want to see in place that deals with them fairly? What kind of law do you want to see in place that makes them feel that their voice is heard in Government as much as those who can contribute millions or at least hundreds of thousands of dollars worth, to get their voices heard? This may be after Democrats have reclaimed the Senate and the House and there is a Republican President. Who knows what the future situation may be. 
But a `grandchild test' puts it on a little different basis, it seems to me. Do we want a system that is dominated by interests that may not favor your heirs, your children, your grandchildren? Do we want them to have to contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars to have their voice heard, to be treated fairly? 
So the votes we have had over the past few days involve a matter of fairness, plain old fairness. In other words, fairness for all in our political system into the future. That is what the vote on McCain-Feingold was all about. Unfortunately, we cannot muster enough votes to overcome cloture. Although we had a majority of the U.S. Senate, the majority did not prevail because of the cloture that we would have been required to get to break a filibuster. 
Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity to discuss the legislation today, the legislation we passed, because over the past year I have had the privilege of serving as the ranking member of the committee on Governmental Affairs' investigation into campaign finance. In the course of the investigation I have come to understand that the existing campaign finance system is in shreds. 
Campaign finance reform is no longer something that I feel should be delayed, as we have delayed it by the votes of the last couple of days. I think it is absolutely crucial that at the earliest time we pass legislation addressing the worst abuses, if we can hope to maintain the integrity of our electoral process and the confidence of the American public. Over the course of my Senate career, I watched as public cynicism about Government has increased and trust in Government has declined. In 1996 for the first time, less than half the people in this country eligible to vote cast a ballot. 
To those who argue that the public doesn't care about campaign finance, it is clear from national polls that the public does care. Polls show that while over 70 percent of Americans want campaign finance reform, only 30 percent have believed it will happen. Three out of four people interviewed do not trust us in Washington to do what is right. That is three-quarters of the American people do not trust us to do what is right. What an indictment of our activities here in the Congress. 
I can't think of a better way to halt that kind of cynicism than by doing the unexpected and passing campaign finance reform and by fixing the system that breeds the cynicism and undermines public confidence. Poll after poll has shown the biggest single factor in lack of public trust in Government is the campaign finance system. I want to express my appreciate to Senators McCain and Feingold for their leadership on this issue. Their bipartisan cooperation has pointed us in the right direction. I hope we can follow their example and pass this legislation, hopefully even later this year. I hope they will take the opportunity on later legislation to attach this legislation on to it as an amendment and we will have some more votes on this, perhaps with a different outcome. 
We have a unique opportunity if we pass campaign finance legislation to restore faith in our American system and renew our commitment to the concept of Government for all of the people, all of the time--not a system where access to elected leaders is meted out according to campaign dollars received. That is exactly what we have now. 
The legislation that we have had before us over the past few days takes key steps to correct the two worst problems, the proliferation of huge amounts of soft money and the explosion of calculated issue advertising which exists outside the reach of existing laws simply because it avoids a key term such as `vote for' or `defeat.' But the proliferation of issue advocacy candidates are becoming footnotes in their own campaigns 
struggling to conduct substantive debates on issues of local importance against the din of millions of dollars of issue advertising by national interest groups. 
One has only to look to the campaign to replace recently deceased House Member Walter Capps taking place in Santa Barbara, CA, to understand the significance of this problem. Just last weekend, the Washington Post carried an article about this campaign which noted that while the candidates tried to focus on education and fiscal issues, hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent by national groups airing ads on term limits and abortion, issues which both candidates agree are high among voter concerns in the district but which have drowned out the candidates' own attempts to focus on issues of concern in their district. 
Almost every abuse examined in the course of the Governmental Affairs Committee investigation has its roots in the proliferation of soft money and of calculated political issue ads. For that reason, I want to say something about the recent Governmental Affairs Committee investigation from the minority's perspective and how it reflects on the committee's debate. 
The founders of this country envisioned that American political discourse would be based on the power of ideas, not money, and that our elected representatives would be chosen by the principles for which they stand, not the amount of money they raise. 
Unfortunately, elected officials in the United States have become so dependent on political contributions from wealthy donors that the democratic principles underlying our Government are at risk. We face the danger of becoming a Government of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich. We face the danger because candidates for Congress and the Presidency spent over $1 billion on their 1996 election activities, according to an estimate by the Annenberg Public Policy Center. In order to raise that enormous quantity of money, some candidates and party officials push the campaign finance to the breaking point and some pushed it beyond. The abuses that occurred during the 1996 election exposed the dark side of our political system and underscored the critical need for campaign finance reform, as well as the need to enhance the ability of the Federal Election Commission to enforce campaign finance laws, which I will speak about later. 
On March 11, 1997, the Senate voted unanimously to authorize the Governmental Affairs Committee to conduct an investigation of illegal and improper activities in connection with the 1996 Federal election campaigns. The Senate asked the committee to conduct a bipartisan investigation, one that would explore allegations of improper campaign finance activities `by all, Republicans, Democrats, or other political partisans.' 
Now this was a noble goal and there were widespread hopes that the committee would conduct a serious, bipartisan investigation, one that would investigate allegations of abuses by candidates and others aligned with both major political parties. In the end, however, the committee's investigation provided insight into the failings of the campaign finance system, but it certainly did not live up to its potential. 
Now the minority regrets the failure of the committee to expose the ways in which both political parties have pushed and exceeded the limits of our campaign finance system. Both parties have openly offered access in exchange for contributions. Both parties have been lax in accepting illegal or improper contributions. Both parties have become slaves to the raising and spending of soft money. 
Now, the committee examined a host of 1996 election-related activities alleged to have been improper or illegal. 
We heard from fundraisers, from donors, from party officials, from lobbyists, from candidates, and from government officials. We heard from a man, Roger Tamraz, a contributor to both parties. He admitted making 1996 campaign contributions for one reason--he wanted to obtain access to events held in the White House, period. He was willing to contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars to worm his way in there. In another instance, Buddhist Temple officials admitted reimbursing monastics for making campaign contributions at the temple's direction. Also, a wealthy Hong Kong businessman hosted the chairman of the Republican National Committee on a yacht in Hong Kong Harbor and provided $2 million in collateral for a loan used to help elect Republican candidates to office. 
Most of these cases when there was questionable foreign money, most of it was given back by Democrats and Republicans both. And there was a lot on the Democratic side; I certainly don't deny that. As soon as the taint was there, the money was given back. But not in this case. The debt of $800,000 still has not been paid back. This example remains the best single, completely documented example of foreign money really being solicited and used in the 1996 campaign of anything that the committee looked at the whole year, Democrat or Republican. 
The Committee's investigation exposed these and other incidents that ranged from the exemplary, to the troubling, to the possibly illegal. But investigations undertaken by the U.S. Senate are not law enforcement efforts designed to arrive at judgments about whether particular persons should be charged with civil or criminal wrongdoing, but, by Constitutional design, are inquiries whose primary purpose must be `in aid of the legislative function.' Accordingly, the most important outcome of the Committee's investigation is the compilation of evidence demonstrating that the most serious problems uncovered in connection with the 1996 election involve conduct which should be, but is not now, prohibited by law. Or as Senator Levin has put it, the evidence shows that the bulk of the campaign finance problem is not what is illegal, but what is legal. 
The systemic legal problems and the need for dramatic campaign finance reform are highlighted in our Report and in the following summary. 
In our democracy, power is ultimately to be derived from the people--the voters. In theory, every voter is equal; the reality is that some voters, to borrow George Orwell's phrase, are `more equal than others.' No one can deny that individuals who contribute substantial sums of money to candidates are likely to have more access to elected officials. And most of us think greater access brings greater influence. It was this concern over linkages between money, access and influence--amid allegations that Richard Nixon's 1968 and 1972 presidential campaigns accepted individual contributions of hundreds of thousands, even millions, of dollars--that spurred Congress to enact the original campaign finance laws. While those laws have evolved over the 20 years since that time, the goals have remained the same: to prevent wealthy private interests from exercising disproportionate influence over the government, to deter corruption, and to inform voters. 
Violations of the law's contribution limits and disclosure requirements have occurred since they were first enacted over twenty years ago. For example, corporations and foreign nationals prohibited from making direct campaign contributions have laundered money through persons eligible to contribute. Donors who have reached their legal contribution limit have channeled additional campaign contributions through relatives, friends, or employees. Indeed, the investigation of the 1996 elections was triggered by suspected foreign contributions to the Democratic Party allegedly solicited by Democratic National Committee (`DNC') fundraiser John Huang. Indictments and convictions have emerged involving contributors to both parties, including Charlie Trie, Maria Hsia and the Lum family on the Democratic side, and Simon Fireman, vice chair of finance of Senator Dole's presidential campaign, and corporate contributors to the campaigns of Representative Jay Kim of California on the Republican side. 
The most elaborate scheme investigated by the Committee involved a $2 million loan that was backed by a Hong Kong businessman, routed through a U.S. subsidiary, and resulted in a large transfer of foreign funds to the Republican Party. 
I am not trying to hit the Republican Party harder than the Democrats. There was plenty of wrongdoing on both sides. That is the point. The point is that we need changes in the law. 
While the Committee's investigation uncovered disturbing information about the role of foreign money in the 1996 elections, the evidence also shows that illegal foreign contributions played a much less important role in the 1996 election than once suspected and was discussed quite widely in the media. Whether judged by the number of contributions or the total dollar amount, only a small fraction of the funds raised by either Democrats or Republicans came from foreign sources. 
That doesn't excuse it. It was wrong. It should not have happened. But it didn't determine the outcome of the election. That is the most important point to make. 
The committee obtained no evidence that funds from a foreign government influenced the outcome of any election. It was alleged that they might have affected the outcome of the 1996 Presidential election. There is nothing, either in the documentation from intelligence sources or in the briefings we received, that could document that. 
So the committee obtained no evidence that funds from a foreign government influenced the outcome of any 1996 election, altered U.S. domestic or foreign policy, or damaged our national security. 
That doesn't mean it was right. 
The Committee's examination of foreign money brought to light an array of fundraising practices used by both parties that, while not technical violations of the campaign finance laws, expose fundamental flaws in the existing legal and regulatory system. The two principal problems involve soft money and issue advocacy. 
It is beyond question that raising soft money and broadcasting issue ads are not, in themselves, unlawful. The evidence suggests that much of what the parties and candidates did during the 1996 elections was within the letter of the law. But no one can seriously argue that it is consistent with the spirit of the campaign finance laws for parties to accept contributions of hundreds of thousands--even millions--of dollars, or for corporations, unions and others to air candidate attack ads without being required to meet any of the federal election law requirements for contribution limits and public disclosure. 
The evidence indicates that the soft-money loophole is fueling many of the campaign abuses investigated by the Committee. It is precisely because parties are allowed to collect large, individual soft-money donations that fundraisers are tempted to cultivate big donors by, for example, providing them and their guests with unusual access to public officials. In 1996, the soft-money loophole provided the funds both parties used to pay for televised ads. Soft money also supplied the funds parties used to make contributions to tax-exempt groups, which in turn used the funds to pay for election-related activities. The Minority Report details, in several instances, how the Republican National Committee deliberately channeled funds from party coffers and Republican donors to ostensibly `independent' groups which then used the money to conduct `issue advocacy' efforts on behalf of Republican candidates. 
Much was made the other day on the floor about the same thing happening on the Democratic side. That doesn't mean either one was excusable or right. But it happened, and it should not. 
Together, the soft-money and issue-advocacy loopholes have eviscerated the contribution limits and disclosure requirements in federal election laws and caused a loss of public confidence in the integrity of our campaign finance system. By inviting corruption of the electoral process, they threaten our democracy. If these and other systemic problems are not solved, the abuses witnessed by the American people in 1996 will be repeated in future election cycles. 
This will be only the beginning. All that will change will be the names, the dates, and the details, and the amounts will go up. We know that. As I said starting out, do you want your children or grandchildren to grow up in a system where their voices may not be heard in all of the venues of government because someone else bought their way in and has a bigger claim on the legislators' future than does your child or grandchild? 
The federal campaign finance laws provide that candidates should finance their campaigns with so-called `hard dollars'--contributions received in relatively small dollar amounts from individual donors and political action committees. Soft money--which can be donated by individuals, corporations and unions and in unlimited amounts--is not supposed to be spent on behalf of individual candidates. And yet it is: Tens of millions of soft dollars are raised by the parties and spent, through such devices as `issue advocacy' ads, for the benefit of candidates. The soft money loophole undermines the campaign finance laws by enabling wealthy private interests to channel enormous amounts of money into political campaigns. Most of the dubious or illegal contributions that were examined by the Committee involved soft money. 
The Committee's investigation also showed that the legal distinction between `issue ads' and `candidate ads' has proved to be largely meaningless. The result has been that millions of dollars, which otherwise would have been kept out of the election process, were infused into campaigns obliquely, surreptitiously, and possibly at times illegally. 
The issue of soft money abuses is inevitably tied to the question of how access to political figures is obtained through large contributions of soft money. It is also tied to the question of how tax-exempt organizations have been used to hide the identities of soft money donors. A system that permits large contributions to be made for partisan purposes, without public disclosure, invites subversion of the intent of our election law limitations. 
Despite a highly partisan investigation, the Committee has built a record of campaign fundraising abuses by both Democrats and Republicans. This record will hopefully be useful to the Federal Election Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and to the Department of Justice as they investigate the 1996 campaign. Most importantly, the Committee's investigation should spur much-needed reform of the campaign finance laws and strengthening of the Federal Election Commission. Congress should provide the Federal Election Commission with the necessary resources to significantly enhance its investigative and enforcement staff. Ultimately, the most important lesson the Committee learned is that the abuses uncovered are part of a systemic problem, and that the system that encourages and permits these abuses must be reformed 
not now, as a result of the legislative votes that we have had the last couple of days, sometime, and hopefully in the very near future. 
The McCain-Feingold legislation that we are considering here today goes a long way to address these abuses. The bill rids the system of soft money, and brings `issue advertising' funded by corporate and union interests within the campaign finance system. The legislation also takes great strides towards creating a more vigorous enforcement mechanism in the Federal Election Commission. 
Anyone who observed even an hour of the Governmental Affairs Committee's hearings in the campaign finance investigation over the past year, can have no doubt that the explosion of soft money, huge amounts received from corporations, unions, and individuals, has undermined the campaign finance system to the point where it does not work. 
It is not fair for all of our people--which should be the objective, making our Government and its laws fair to all of our people--because the trend has become to give special influence to more and more of the special interests across Government, in the executive branch and in the legislative branch right here on Capitol Hill. This is where Congress makes the laws of this land. We didn't even look into congressional activities during this series of hearings. 
The investigation revealed situations where contributors like Roger Tamraz openly used soft money contributions to buy the access to executive branch officials that he thought placed him in an equal position with his business competitors. It revealed situations where huge contributions, possibly from abroad were laundered through legal residents of this country. Without soft money these abuses would not have occurred. 
In the initial debate on campaign finance legislation, and in subsequent debates, we have heated discussions about whether it is appropriate to allow contributions of $1,000 vs $5,000. Yet today we are talking about a single contribution totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars. Mr. President I am hopeful that this body can join together in recognizing that individuals and organizations are using these contributions to gain access for their own limited and narrow purpose, and this unrestrained seeking of access is unhealthy for our democracy. 
The investigation also showed instances where parties in their thirst for soft money solicited foreign funds, then used the proceeds to fund get out the vote activities in 20 states. Without soft money, these funds would never have been solicited and would not have made their way into U.S. elections. 
The ready availability soft money combined with the national party's ability to air so called `issue ads' also resulted in an explosion of advertising which clearly benefitted both party's Presidential candidates. This apparently legal activity will be halted if we simply act to get rid of the soft money that is raised to pay for these ads. 
As an example, the other day on the floor here, the comments were made about how the President participated in issue ads and so on, and was active in determining what was going out and so on. Much was made of that. But I would like to give the other side of that, which was not brought out on the floor the other day, too. This is not to justify both of them, this is just to say both of them, I think, should be corrected. 
But, as an example, in the 1996 election, both the DNC and the RNC spent millions of dollars airing advertising that promoted their Presidential candidates. This advertising was paid for with mostly soft money. A review of some of the evidence gathered in the course of the report highlights the problem that parties use soft money to pay for advertising intended to help their candidates. Now, I don't deny some of the charges made against the Democratic National Committee. But, like the similar DNC advertising campaign: 
The RNC raised additional soft money, with Senator Dole's assistance in order to pay for the ads. 
The money for the ads was transferred to state parties in order to use more soft money for the ads. 
The ads were created, written, and produced by Dole for President's media consultants and pollsters, and the Dole for President consultants met frequently--usually on Wednesday evenings --with RNC officials and Dole for President campaign officials. 
The RNC ran the ads only in states where Clinton and Dole were close in the polls. 
I offer this example not to suggest that these activities were illegal. In fact this activity--and virtually identical activity was carried out by the DNC and the Clinton campaign--were most likely legal. However, this sort of advertising would not happen without the soft money to air it. If the soft money spigot is shut off, candidates and parties would once again be limited to using contributions raised in small increments, which was the intent of the law. 
If we fail to act in coming years we will probably see millions of dollars in so-called issue ads not only to help the Presidential candidates but also to help House and Senate candidates, all financed with soft money--a complete by-passing of the intent of election laws that are supposed to protect every single person in this country. 
A few examples of abuses of the issue advocacy exemption uncovered in the Governmental Affairs Committee investigation, but which were precluded from being presented in hearing include the following: 
An organization called the Economic Education trust, which seems to exist only as a bank account, hired its own political consultants, planned its own advertising campaign, then `shopped' for suitable nonprofit organizations to funnel the money for the ad campaign through. The trust spent millions of dollars on ads and mailings attacking candidates nationwide, including candidates in state races, without voters being aware of their existence. 
Another one, Americans for Tax Reform mailed millions of mailers funded with RNC money to voters in key Congressional districts. If the RNC had mailed the same pieces, they would have had to use hard dollars. 
Another one, at least two groups that each aired over one million dollars of issue ads, the Triad affiliated Citizens for Reform and Citizens for the Republic, aired advertisements that did not contain words of express advocacy but advocated no specific issue, contained inaccurate statements of candidates records, and attacked candidates on issues of past behavior and character. 
The proposals for addressing such activity are carefully drafted to protect the First Amendment right of voters to engage in political speech. The proposed legislation does not prevent any individual or organization from paying for communications but simply requires disclosure and compliance with contribution limits that govern other organizations. It is a shame we could not get that legislation through in the last couple of days. 
Let me talk about the FEC. I think that we can all agree that it doesn't matter how good a law you have, it has to be actively and vigorously enforced. Last fall the Governmental Affairs Committee devoted two weeks of hearing time to experts on campaign finance. Among the witnesses who testified before the Committee were former Federal Election Commission Commissioner Trevor Potter and current General Counsel Larry Noble. Along with other witnesses, their testimony revealed a agency unable to begin to deal with the mammoth task before it. The agency does not have the resources it needs to enforce existing laws. The FEC also does not have the ability to act quickly and effectively in response to complaints. 
The lack of resources the agency receives from Congress almost guarantees that the agency will fail in its efforts to uncover violations of the law in a timely manner. 
In testimony before the Committee on Governmental Affairs, Norm Ornstein testified that he thought, it was his opinion--and I don't think it was a studied opinion, but it was his estimate when asked a question--that it would take at least $50 million, almost twice what the FEC currently receives, and that might begin to give the agency the resources it needs. 
To cover all of our election laws, there are approximately 30 lawyers on the FEC legal staff who investigate violations of the election laws. Those 30 lawyers don't really go out and do field investigations. Mainly, they may take some depositions and a few things like that; but they are not really trained investigators as such. Less than 10 additional lawyers comprise the entire litigation staff, which argues in court. And amazingly, until 1994 the commission had no investigators. 
No investigators, and then they had one investigator. And it was pointed out during our hearings, they just recently, last year during our hearings, doubled the size of their investigative staff. A 100 percent increase--that got them up to 2 investigators. There were two investigators to go out and investigate complaints all across this country, as to what was going on. 
Let me contrast that. By way of contrast our combined staff on the Governmental Affairs Committee had 44 lawyers, just for this investigation. 
The Majority staff of 25 lawyers alone was almost equal to the entire FEC investigative staff. The Committee also had 8 FBI agents detailed to help in its investigation, as well as two investigators from the General Accounting Office and 4 investigators on the staffs. Yet when the FEC specifically asked Congress for the resources to hire more staff to deal with cases stemming from the 1996 elections, Congress specifically precluded the agency from hiring more staff. They wrote into law they could not hire more staff. Can we imagine anything more shortsighted than that? 
The FEC must fight for every penny it receives. For example, in fiscal 1995, the FEC had over 10% of budget rescinded half way through the fiscal year, the largest percentage agency recision government wide. 
In fiscal 1996, they sought $32 million but received only $26 million with some funds `fenced' for particular purposes. 
In fiscal 1997, they had travel budget limited and fenced such that it was difficult to conduct depositions and court appearances including those undertaken in connection with the Christian Coalition litigation--just to name one. 
That is just deliberately hamstringing the organization that is supposed to be enforcing our election laws, and Congress does that deliberately. Why? Well, you'll have to answer that in your own mind. 
But there are undoubtedly those who do not want to see our campaign finance laws rigorously enforced. 
The agency is also burdened by cumbersome procedures, which I believe the legislation before us today makes a good start at addressing. For example the FEC does not have the ability to seek an injunction that would halt illegal activity before the election was held. The FEC also cannot require electronic filing of disclosure reports that would soon permit every Internet user to see how much their local candidates had raised and spent and from whom. The FEC also lacks the ability to randomly audit campaigns to ensure compliance with the law. These reforms contained in the McCain-Feingold proposal will help the FEC to become a more vigorous deterrent to abusing the campaign finance system. 
Let me make some recommendations. 
Many of the proposals set forth in McCain-Feingold are also contained in the recommendations of the Governmental Affairs Committee's forthcoming report. The Minority, in its forthcoming report makes the following recommendations that can be enacted with passage of this legislation. We recommend that we eliminate soft money: Eliminating unrestricted contributions to political parties from individuals, corporations and unions is the most important step towards reducing the influence of money in the campaign finance system. 
Another one, address issue advocacy: A soft money ban, however fundamental to reform, must be coupled with reforms addressing candidate advertisements masquerading as issue ads. A provision that requires any communication that mentions a federal candidate within 60 days of a general election to comply with disclosure requirements and restrictions on the use of union and corporate funds would not prevent or ban any advertisement but would bring all political ads within the campaign finance system. 
Strengthen and clarify the statutory prohibitions against foreign contributions and contributions in the name of another which will be accomplished by the soft money ban contained in McCain-Feingold. 
We need to give the Federal Election Commission the resources it needs to do its job. Any reform, from the most modest improvements in disclosure to the most comprehensive revision of campaign financing, will not be complete if the agency charged with enforcing the law lacks the resources to do so. 
We should give the Federal Election Commission the authority needed to enforce the law. Not just the authority, but the resources to enforce the law. 
Improve public disclosure and mandate electronic filing for all candidates and political committees to speed the disclosure process and allow more disclosure to voters. 
Those would have been covered within the McCain-Feingold legislation. In addition to what was provided in that bill, however, we should enact, with passage of this legislation, some other things. The Minority report also recommends that whenever possible we do several things 
In addition to giving the FEC additional authority in general, as mentioned above, the minority also recommends several specific changes. No. 1: Increase the size of the Commission to an odd number of commissioners to avoid deadlock. Then we should grant the Commission the power to seek injunctions in Federal court. We should streamline the process for initiating investigations by eliminating requirements for a formal Commission vote, and formal finding that a violation occurred. And we should also permit the Commission to assess automatic fines for late disclosure reports. 
Those are things that would not have been covered in McCain-Feingold but which should be enacted anyway. 
Some other things the Minority report also recommends in, addition to what would be covered in McCain-Feingold. 
For all contributions over $1,000, require certification, under penalty of perjury, that a contribution meets the requirements of federal law, including that the contributor is a citizen or legal permanent resident and that the contribution was made from the funds of the contributor. 
We should reduce the costs of campaigns. During the 1996 campaign, federal candidates spent $400 million on television advertising. Congress should consider mandating some free time from broadcasters as one way to decrease the amount candidates buy and parties are required to spend to get out their message. 
We should also clarify and strengthen applicable tax law. Tax exempt organizations have become increasingly influential in federal elections, while operating under legal requirements that provide insufficient guidance on permissible campaign activity and disclosure obligations. 
We should also clarify campaign restrictions applicable to organizations operating under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code. 
We should also ensure public disclosure of all organizations whose primary purpose is to influence elections by requiring that all organizations claiming an exemption from taxes under section 527 also file with the FEC or the applicable State body. 
This next one is a very important one also. We should consider requiring the IRS to approve or disapprove all applications for tax-exempt status within 1 year and require that an application for exempt status be approved before an organization may hold itself out as tax exempt. 
What is done now is exactly what was done with the National Policy Forum, an arm of the Republican National Committee, and was involved with the transfer of Hong Kong money through a loan guarantee that got money that I mentioned earlier. What happened there was that the National Policy Forum filed for 501(c) status and then advertised itself as being a tax-exempt organization even though the approval had not been granted yet by the IRS. 
That is not unusual. Let me say on behalf of NPF and those who were involved with it at that time, it is not unusual when you file, you say you have filed and so you presume you are going to be a 501(c) organization and have tax-exempt status for anyone who makes a contribution pursuant to that status. 
What happened was, the IRS came back later on and said the NPF was not valid as an organization, did not rate the tax-exempt status that the 501(c) would have carried with it. So they disapproved that, but that disapproval came at least 3 or 3 1/2 years after the application was made. I do not believe any organization, whether it is for regular tax-exempt charities or political or any other organization, should be able to advertise itself as a tax-exempt organization until it has the ruling from the IRS. 
These recommendations are directed at improving the system for everyone. The legislation we have had before us the last few days is also about improving our system. I didn't think that this was partisan legislation, but it certainly came out that way. The net effect of enacting these reforms would be to reduce the amount of money spent on campaigns and to have all players in the political system abide by the same rules. 
In closing, I want to make one final point. Since 1976 I have supported public financing of campaigns, and it seems to me that it is a worthy use of Public Treasury funds to ensure that we have clean money and clean elections. The erosion of public confidence that I have witnessed can only be offset by taking the steps necessary to clean up our campaign finance system and renew the public trust in elected officials. 
Let me say this. Sometimes I think the States get out ahead of the Federal Government in taking action that is necessary to clean up certain things within our system of Government. Maine has taken the lead now, of course, in doing exactly that with regard to campaign finance. It is my understanding some 12 other States are looking into financing candidates' races in the general election in State races, or at least a major portion of that funding that is required. 
I believe that would improve our system of Government. I also believe that if we could have faith restored in our system by having taxpayer money that represents all interests of this country equally, and get back to having the Government represent all the people all the time, and not part of the time for all the people, and some of the time for the special interests who have bought their way in, that it would be the biggest value we have had in a long time. 
So I wholeheartedly supported the bipartisan McCain-Feingold bill that was before us. I believe it is just a first step. Eventually, Mr. President, I believe the answer to our concern is to eliminate the role of private money in campaigns. I think we should allow campaigns to be fairly and equally underwritten by all Americans through some form of publicly supported finance. That is the purpose of Government, to represent every American, not a 
favored few. 
Only when we have public financing do I believe we will be able to assure that loopholes will not develop and that special interests will not find new ways to bend the system to their own ends. 
As I sat in on months of hearings on our campaign system, I became more thoroughly convinced that only when we turn to a public system of financing campaigns will we fully solve the problems of campaign finance. That is why I joined with my colleagues, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts and Senator Wellstone of Minnesota, in cosponsoring a bill called the Clean Money Clean Campaign Act. It is based on the Maine plan and those 12 other States who are looking at it, to limit campaign spending, to prohibit special interest contributions, to eliminate fundraising efforts, to provide equal funding and a level playing field for all candidates and end the loopholes that have wrecked our current system. 
Through a publicly funded system, we can end the current abuse and establish a system that takes us back to our major responsibility, which is representing the interests of all the people all the time. I think that would go farther to clean up the system, restore faith and credibility in Government, and I think would be the biggest bargain the American public has had in a long time. 
If you look at it another way, money comes out of our economy some way into politics. Now it is dollars for access. Too large a percentage of the money comes in from special interests looking for special treatment. With better financing, we would then fairly represent everyone. It would be nice to have people believe all of us are working all the time for the greatest benefit for all of our people. I think that would go a long way to reducing the cynicism, the apathy, the lack of interest, the lack of trust, the lack of danger that it represents, because when people feel too threatened, they will also feel that they want to split off into smaller self-protective groups to have their voice heard in some council of Government, which was something that was to be necessary if a democracy was to survive, as Thomas Jefferson said. 
We don't want to see that. We think the two parties have represented our country well throughout our history, and we want to see these parties continue and not be siphoned off or not have their members siphoned off into smaller and smaller self-protective groups. 
I recognize fully the time probably has not yet come to move to Federal financing, but I believe the more the American people focus on the current system and its exploding abuses, the more likely it will be that the support will grow for such a change. 
So I would have liked to have seen us, over the past few days, pass the McCain-Feingold legislation that was before us, because I feel the situation is critical. We face elections in this country in less than 8 months in which the loopholes ripped open in 1996 will result in an even greater flood of legal but improper activity into the system as each party tries to elect their chosen candidates and the candidates battle to be heard against the flood of issue advertising. 
Mr. President, I want to close by repeating some of the thoughts I opened my remarks with. These votes are controversial votes. They too often split just along party lines and party loyalty on the basis of what will enable one group or another to raise the most money for this particular election. But I think there is another way to decide on this. It is another test that I label the `grandchildren test,' the `grandchild test.' 
What do we want our political system to be in the future in this country? Do we want our system to be a system that increasingly represents the few, the big interests able to put millions of dollars into a campaign, represents only the wealthy that can buy their way in by responding to ads that say that you will get to meet with the committee chairman of your choice if you make a certain large contribution, and down at the bottom it says, `Benefits upon receipt'? Is that the kind of system we really want 
for our children and our grandchildren in the future? 
I think I would much rather have an ideal political system in which our children and our grandchildren have a great faith in Government, that their interests are being represented most by their elected officials. I don't think we want a system dominated by interests that may not favor your own children or grandchildren. I don't want my grandchildren to think that they have to contribute thousands, not just thousands, but hundreds of thousands or maybe even millions of dollars, if they ever have that much money, to have their voice heard in Government in a democracy such as ours. 
So we have had votes over the past few days that, to me, were votes very simply on fairness--fairness that we have a commitment in this Senate to making certain that all of our people are treated fairly all of the time. That was what these votes were all about. 
I encourage Senator McCain and Senator Feingold to bring that legislation back to the floor again later this year. Maybe we can try again. Sometimes legislation that is important for the future of the country needs a number of votes before we finally get it through. I think this is an issue whose time has come, and it is an issue that is going to be critical if we are going to erase some of the cynicism and apathy toward Government that abounds too much in this country, particularly among our young people. 
That, to me, is the hazard of going on with this. I don't think this Nation of ours is ever going to be taken over by the likes of Russia, China, North Korea or any combination of nations around this world. I do worry about the future of our democracy when we have people, particularly our young people, who are so apathetic toward politics and Government that they don't want any part of it, wouldn't think of running for public office, don't want to get into a dirty thing like political races, wouldn't think of going out and trying to raise money to help our political parties get messages across. 
We have to erase that if we are to have the democracy that is our future, because our country can go downhill from that just as fast as it can from other adversaries that might have more military power but would not be able to take this country over. 
Mr. President, I hope that we bring this subject up again this year, and I hope that we have a more favorable consideration of it when it comes up again. 
I also want to recognize Beth Stein, who is with me here today, who has worked so long and hard on this, who has had a long experience at the FEC and contributed so much to our hearings this year and last year in trying to make sure we have a way to the future that is good for all of our people. I thank her for her efforts, and also all the committee members who worked so hard on this through the year.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1998--legislation designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Federal financial assistance and grant-in-aid programs. 
According to the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, there are over 600 different Federal grant programs to state and local governments and other service providers. Not only is that a large number of programs in the aggregate, we also have an abundance of separate grant programs even in areas where only one general purpose is being served. For example, in the budget subfunction of social services alone, there are over 80 different Federal grant programs. In elementary and secondary education, there are a similar number of Federal programs. 
Almost all of these different grant programs serve worthy goals and purposes. However, they inevitably carry with them separate redtape, regulations, and procedures that frustrate those at the state, local and nonprofit level who must coordinate the services and carry out the responsibilities in all these separate programs. Furthermore, in many of these grant programs, `getting out the money' is the primary emphasis. Administrative performance and efficiency are a secondary emphasis, or in some cases not emphasized at all, so we have little understanding at any level of government how well the programs are actually working. Part of this problem stems from the fact that the money passes through 3 sometimes 4 different sets of hands before it reaches its intended beneficiaries. So it's hard to know where responsibility lies when it comes to making sure that the money is spent efficiently, properly and in a way to maximize the goals and objectives of the underlying program. 
We've been working for several years in the Governmental Affairs Committee on ways to cut Federal redtape while improving performance. We tried to reduce Federal burdens with enactment of the Paperwork Reduction Act and Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, while strengthening the effectiveness of Federal programs with the Government Performance Results Act. 
This bill builds on those initiatives. It requires that Federal agencies develop plans that, among other things: establish uniform applications for related grant programs; develop common rules for Federal requirements that cut across multiple grant programs; and, emphasize use of electronic reporting via the Internet. Agencies would have 18 months to develop their plans, with OMB overseeing their development. They would work closely with state and local governments and the nonprofit community in the setting of performance measures to achieve the bill's goals. The bill sunsets in 5 years following a review by the National Academy of Public Administration. 
Americans want government services to work better. But they also want government to live within its means, to balance its books. In other words, they want more cost-effective government, and that's at all levels. I believe this bill helps lead us in that direction. I'm pleased that Chairman Thompson, along with Senators Levin, Lieberman, and Akaka, have joined me cosponsoring the bill and I look forward to considering it in the Governmental Affairs Committee.

 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay homage to one of our Nation's most dedicated and loyal public servants, Assistant Comptroller General of the United States, J. Dexter Peach. 
On January 2nd of this year, J. Dexter Peach retired following a distinguished 38-year career with the United States General Accounting Office, capped by 15 years as an Assistant Comptroller General. 
Mr. Peach began his career with the General Accounting Office in 1960, rising through the evaluator ranks to lead two of its major divisions--Energy and Minerals and the Resources, Community and Economic Development Divisions--serving as Assistant Comptroller General for the latter. He is an acknowledged subject matter expert on a wide variety of national programs and policy issues dealing with energy, environment, natural resources, and economic development matters and has an in-depth understanding of federal legislative and regulatory processes. As Assistant Comptroller General for Planning and Reporting, Dexter Peach had broad responsibility for maintaining the Office's planning system and assuring the overall quality of the agency's planning system and assuring the overall quality of the agency's products. 
Mr. President, I had the privilege of working with Dexter Peach in my capacity as both Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs. His critical work relating to energy issues after the OPEC embargo in 1973, earned him the Comptroller General's Award for contributions to energy issues of national importance. He has also received three Federal Senior Executive Service Rank Awards--a Distinguished Rank and two Meritorious Ranks. The American University also distinguished him with their prestigious Roger W. Jones Award, bestowed annually to a career federal civil servant for outstanding public service. 
Mr. President, the General Accounting Office was created in 1921 with the mandate to audit, evaluate, or investigate virtually all federal government operations--wherever they might take place. In other words, the GAO serves as a `watchdog' over the taxpayers' money--guarding against fraud, abuse, and inefficient allocation of public funds. 
GAO evaluations under Dexter Peach's guidance and leadership have saved taxpayers billions of dollars. During his career as Assistant Comptroller General, Congress has implemented numerous recommendations resulting from his work--including budget reductions, cost avoidances, appropriations deferrals, and revenue enhancements. He has also been instrumental in assisting the Congress by directing reports on the costs of cleaning up nuclear weapons complexes, environmental crises such as the Exxon/Valdez oil spill, efforts to preserve and protect the nation's drinking water, and issues dealing with the deregulation and safety of the airlines industry. 
In short, Mr. President, Dexter Peach's tenure at GAO has been characterized by success on every level; throughout his career, he has served as an example of a truly exceptional public servant. I am sure I speak for all of us here in the Senate in giving recognition to a man who has served this Nation with integrity, dedication, honor, and diligence--Assistant Comptroller General J. Dexter Peach.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2977, the Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 1997. 
H.R. 2977 properly excludes the National Academy of Science [NAS] and the National Academy of Public Administration [NAPA] from the Federal Advisory Committee Act [FACA], while at the same time ensuring that certain public sunshine and accountability measures apply to NAS and NAPA committees. Since the legislation did not have the benefit of a committee report in either the House of Senate, as ranking member of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, the committee of jurisdiction over FACA, I would like to make the following clarifications regarding the bill's provisions. 
Section 15 of the bill establishes procedures with which NAS and NAPA must comply as part of agreements with Federal agencies on work to be performed. I want to be clear that both NAS and NAPA should apply these procedures to standing committees in their future work for Federal agencies in addition to future committees that may be created, either temporarily or on a standing basis, to complete a specific project or projects under an agreement with an agency. In particular, it should be noted that any replacement or new member added to a standing committee should be done so in accordance with the provisions of section 15(b)(1).

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, earlier this week, we celebrated a national holiday, Veterans Day. We were not in session on that day, November 11, so I want to make a few comments about that day and what it means to our country. 
Veterans Day comes from the Armistice Day that ended World War I in 1918. The armistice was signed that day at 11 o'clock in the morning with the hope that that would be the war to end all wars. As we look back on what has happened since that time, we know that that is not what happened, however, that is the way World War I was billed at that time. 
Later, Armistice Day was changed to Veterans Day to better represent all the conflicts that this country has ever participated in. I think it is good that we have a day where we can reflect on, and commemorate those who took part in those wars. 
However, sometimes on that day, we are reminded that appreciation for the military, and for their sacrifices, does not get its proper attention. I am reminded of the old Kipling poem where he talks about how the lack of appreciation for our military occurs, or seems to occur, in those time periods when they are most needed. 
Kipling was British, and in Britain, GI's were called tommies. In his famous poem Kipling wrote:  
It's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, 
an' `Chuck him out, the brute!' 
But it's `Savior of 'is country' 
when the guns begin to shoot. 
We tend to forget about the sacrifices our military personnel when peace breaks out. History shows us that over the last 100 years or so, we have had approximately 17-year cycles of war and peace. It is amazing, almost uncanny, how our military buildups and downgrades fit into that 17-year cycle. In fact, the only conflict that occurred outside of that pattern was World War II, which was only about 4 years off the 17-year cycle. I can only hope that our current period of peace will break that 17-year cycle. 
On Veterans Day, we recognize those who have gone through these cycles before us. It is a time to point out some of the sacrifices they made, the devotion to duty that they were required to perform, and the courage that they exhibited. It is a time to say, `The professionalism of our military saved lives.' 
Veterans themselves, do not need a special day, because they remember their own experiences in the military. They do not need a special day because those times are forever etched in their memories. They remember the people that they were associated with, their friends, people of all walks of life. They remember the rich, the poor, the advantaged, the disadvantaged; all tossed together, rubbing elbows, in what is the finest military in the world. They remember the places where they were stationed, their training, and they certainly remember their days in combat, which is forever etched on their memory, like nothing else out of their past. 
Some survived and some did not. Veterans Day is a time to go back and remember those people. It is time, not just for veterans, but for all Americans, to remember that this country was built on the sacrifices of the brave men and women who served in the military, and protected our country. It is a day to remember and appreciate what made this country, the greatest nation in the world. 
Mr. President, another important day occurred early this week and I would like to make a few remarks about it also.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, Monday, November 10, was the 222d birthday of the U.S. Marine Corps. That day is celebrated by marines, and former marines, wherever they are, wherever they may go. 
Last year, on the Marine Corps birthday, I was on a plane with our minority leader and several other Senators, on a trip to the Far East. We were on our way to visit Ho Chi Minh City, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. We had just left Japan, and I was sitting there with my wife, Annie, when I remembered that it was the Marine Corps birthday. Because it is a ritual for marines to celebrate their birthday, no matter where they are, I told Annie that I was going back to the galley to get something to be our Marine Corps birthday cake. I know this may sound silly to some people, but to marines, it does not sound silly at all. 
So, right as I was getting ready to head back to the galley, 
other people on the flight started gathering around where we were sitting. It turned out that they also had remembered how important this day was to me, and my fellow marines. Not only did they know what the 10th of November was, they had brought a cake along with them. It was a beautiful cake and was decorated with the Marine Corps emblem. So probably like a lot of other isolated marines in the world, we had our own party. It was a very memorable celebration. 
This year I had the chance to participate in the Marine Corps birthday ball here in Washington, at the Marine Barracks. Once again, we had a wonderful celebration. 
The corps remains proud of the role it has played in the history of our country--as the 911 force, the emergency force that is always available when requirements dictate that the most best is needed now. 
The Marine Corps remains unique to the other services, in the respect that it has all elements of supporting arms in one unit. It has supplies for 60 days of combat. It has infantry, air, armor, and artillery. It has all the elements wrapped up in one unit, necessary to go in and be a very tough, hard-hitting organization for a short period of time. 
This was vividly illustrated in the Persian Gulf during Desert Storm. The Marine Corps came in with two divisions, completely equipped, and set up a blocking position, to give our other forces time to build up--a build up that over a several-month period came to number over 520,000 Americans. 
This was typical of the role that the U.S. Marine Corps has played as the ready force. And there isn't a Marine unit in existence that does not have some of its expeditionary gear, some of its combat equipment boxed and ready to go now and move within hours. If the Marine Corps ever loses that kind of readiness, I believe it will have lost its reason for being. 
So in their 222d year of existence, the marines continue to celebrate the traditions of the Marine Corps. They honor and remember the sacrifices of marines who fought in places like Belleau Wood, Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Bougainville, Iwo Jima, Pork Chop Hill and the Chosen Reservoir, and Khe Sanh. 
One thing that has remained the same though out the Marines history, and something that I am proud of, is in the way in that the Marine Corps recruits people. The Marine Corps recruits people to serve. They do not recruit on a promise of `Here's what is good for you, or here's what you'll get out of it yourself', they recruit by asking the question, `Are you good enough to serve your country?' And it is here, and later where they are trained, that the attitudes required to prepare them for battle, are instilled. It calls for each person to devote themselves to a purpose bigger than themselves, a purpose to each other, a purpose to the unit, a purpose to the corps, and a purpose to this country of ours. 
This was well spelled out in a Parade magazine article last Sunday, November 9. This article said so much about the training that is going on in the Marine Corps today, training that continues to be updated from one war to the next. 
This article was not written by some Marine Corps public relations person, it was written by Thomas E. Ricks, a writer for the Wall Street Journal. Mr Ricks starts out in the first part of this article by saying, `What is it about the Marine Corps that makes it so successful in transforming teenage boys and girls into responsible, confident men and women? He goes on to show how ordinary `Beavises and Butt-heads' can be molded into effective leaders. And he says of himself, `I majored in English literature at Yale, and, like everybody with whom I grew up and went to school with, I have no military experience. Yet I learned things at Parris Island that fascinated me.' 
He talks about `Lessons From Parris Island' that are instilled into these young people coming into the Marine Corps which are--first, `Tell the truth;' second, `Do your best, no matter how trivial the task;' third, `Choose the difficult right over the easy wrong;' fourth, `Look out for the group before you look out for yourself;' fifth, `Don't whine or make excuses;' and, sixth, `Judge others by their actions and not their race.' 
By my way of thinking, those are some pretty good objectives for anybody in our society to follow. And they are the building blocks that are instilled in all U.S. Marines as they go through boot camp.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, a man who worked with me very closely on the Armed Services Committee, Fred Pang, a man who rose to become the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management Policy, will retire from almost 40 years of service to our Government, on November 16. 
During these 40 years he has always kept one principle paramount in his service--that principle has been the welfare of the troops. Over his entire period of service, and especially during the past 3 years, he has constantly worked to improve the quality of life for our men and women in uniform and their families. 
Mr. Pang's long and productive association with the military of the United States dates back to his earliest days. Growing up in Hawaii, his father was a shipyard worker at Pearl Harbor and a survivor of the Japanese attack on December 7, 1941. Perhaps growing up in Hawaii during World War II helped shape Mr. Pang's propensity for public service, his fervent patriotism, and his penchant to participate in the defense of our Nation. In high school, Mr. Pang was a member of the Army Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps program at McKinley High School. Next, he joined the Naval Reserves, and following boot camp in San Diego, he served aboard two destroyers. While pursuing his bachelor's degree at the University of Hawaii, he enrolled in the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program, and upon graduation, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force. Thus, began his long and illustrious active affiliation with the Department of Defense. 
His 27-year Air Force career included a variety of manpower and personnel assignments, including a tour in Vietnam in 1968-69. Before retiring as a colonel in 1986, he was the Director Of Officer and Enlisted Personnel Management and the Director of Compensation in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management and Personnel--two of the most important and demanding personnel jobs in the entire Department of Defense for an active duty officer. During his stint in these jobs, he worked on many critically important projects with long-term implications for the professional personnel management of uniformed personnel. Most noteworthy was the research and analysis he did in support of the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act [DOPMA] of 1981. While this act was obviously the result of much hard work by many people and was, in the final analysis, a work of the Congress, the work done by Mr. Pang in the Department of Defense contributed immeasurably to its success. The fact that DOPMA has remained in tact for over 16 years as the governing law for all Department of Defense officer personnel stands in tribute to the work done by then-Colonel Pang and all others who contributed to its development. 
Upon his retirement from the Air Force, and after a very short, 6 months, time in the private sector, Mr. Pang again answered the call of his country and went to work as a professional staff member on the Senate Armed Services Committee [SASC]. As the majority staffer on the Personnel Subcommittee of the SASC, Mr. Pang was recognized as one of the leading experts and most influential people in the entire Government when it came to matters relating to the management of U.S. military personnel. Although his accomplishments on the SASC are far too numerous to list here, there is one facet of his service with the committee, which deserves mention. Following the end of the cold war, the Department of Defense was faced with the unprecedented task of drawing down an All-Volunteer military. Having lived through the post-Vietnam war drawdown, which was something less than successful, Mr. Pang was determined that we would not return to hollow military of the mid- to late-1970's. Working tirelessly, he developed a package of downsizing incentives including the voluntary separation incentive [VSI], special separation benefit [SSB], and temporary early retirement authority [TERA]. These programs have proven themselves to be extraordinarily effective in helping reshape our military as it was reduced by some 33 percent. The results speak for themselves. Today, we have a military that is of higher quality in terms of education and aptitude scores than ever before in history. The force was drawndown in a well-balanced manner so that today our service men and women are more experienced and capable than ever before. Additionally, when the drawdown began, many feared that minorities and women would be disproportionately affected. So good were the tools provided by Congress, developed mostly by Mr. Pang and so skillful was the execution of the drawdown that the military force of today is more richly diverse than ever before. 
Working with his committee chairman, Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, Mr. Pang recognized that the true peace dividend coming out of the cold war was the incredible number of high quality men and women coming out of the military and returning to civilian life. He conceived and developed an innovative and effective package of transition benefit programs that have proved to be successful beyond anyone's wildest dreams. Literally millions of service men and women have separated from the military since the drawdown began. Transition counseling packages written into 
law along with brilliant and innovative programs such as Troops to Teachers and Troops to Cops have ensured that not only have our recent veterans found meaningful and rewarding employment, but that their skills, developed in the military, are now being utilized to the fullest in the civilian sector. A great deal of anecdotal evidence exists that these transition programs have worked exceedingly well. However, as overall evidence of the effectiveness of the transition programs developed by Mr. Pang, notwithstanding the huge number of people separating from the military during the downsizing, the amount of money, as a percent of the budget, that the Department of Defense has paid out in unemployment compensation has not increased at all. People are finding jobs in the private sector, and they are finding good jobs. Through job fairs and transition bulletin boards, private sector employers have acquired new employees who have a great work ethic, who understand the concept of mission, and who are drug free. And society has acquired former service members who are outstanding role models for the youth of America. Much of the credit for this truly American success story has got to go to Mr. Fred Pang. 
During his tenure as Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Manpower and Reserve Affairs and as Assistant Secretary of Defense, Force Management Policy, Mr. Pang has continued and focused his leadership in the area of military and civilian personnel management and equal opportunity. Hard to put into words, but clearly evident from the accomplishments of the organizations that he has so skillfully led over the past 4 years, is the `can do', positive attitude that he inspires as a leader. During his tenure as Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, he dealt with some of the thorniest issues facing the Navy in many years such as the Tailhook scandal and the U.S. Naval Academy cheating scandal. Mr. Pang's integrity and commonsense approach to problemsolving did much to put the Navy on the correct course in dealing with these very difficult issues. As the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Force Management Policy, he completely revised and made right the Department of Defense Directive on officer promotion and nomination procedures. In the aftermath of Tailhook and other highly publicized officer promotion and nomination problems, the new directive, written under Mr. Pang's leadership, has not only put the processing of these critical actions back on an efficient and timely track, but has restored the faith and confidence of the Senate Armed Services Committee and of the American public in the officer promotion and nomination process. One of the major efforts of former Secretary of Defense William Perry was improving the quality of life of service and family members. He placed Mr. Pang in charge of this effort and appointed him as the chairman of the Department of Defense Executive Committee on Quality of Life. Under Dr. Perry's guidance and Mr. Pang's leadership, the Quality of Life Executive Committee has made major accomplishments in improving the quality of life of our service and family members, and, for the first time, we have established a series of measurements and standards for all quality of life services. Because of these efforts, the lives of service and family members worldwide have been improved and enriched. 
Mr. Pang has led the Force Management Policy organization to new heights of efficiency and accomplishment across the spectrum of civilian and military personnel management; personnel support, families and education; equal opportunity; morale welfare and recreation and resale activities; and women in the military. He is leaving a legacy of service to the Department of Defense and our Nation, and most importantly, to our men and women serving in uniform, of dedicated service and lasting contributions. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I deeply regret that we have been unable to vote on the nomination of Dr. David Satcher as the Surgeon General and the Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Public Health Service. 
As a graduate of Ohio's medical school system, Dr. Satcher is truly a commendable choice for our next Surgeon General. The expediency of his nomination process gives an overwhelming indication of the impressive and extensive reach of his medical career. It is a career in which Dr. Satcher has placed considerable emphasis on the medically impoverished. He has demonstrated an unrelenting compassion for those less fortunate, and to quote Dr. Frist, `allowed science to drive his decision making' throughout his brilliant career. 
Born in rural Alabama his interest in medicine grew after a near-fatal bout with whooping cough at the age of 2. Even though his parents had only the benefit of elementary educations, they instilled in him the passion and drive to pursue his dreams. He received his B.S. from Morehouse College and became the first African-American to earn both an MD and a Ph.D. from Case Western Reserve University, while being elected to the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society 
After excelling in medical school, Dr. Satcher began his career at the Martin Luther King Jr. Medical Center in Los Angeles. There he developed and chaired King-Drew's Department of Family Medicine and served as the interim dean of the Charles R. Drew Postgraduate Medical School. As interim dean, he directed the King-Drew Sickle Cell Center for 6 years and negotiated the agreement with the UCLA School of Medicine and the Board of Regents. 
Before being appointed to his current position of Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], Dr. Satcher returned to Atlanta to chair the Community Medicine Department at Morehouse School of Medicine, where he received the Watts Grassroots Award for Community Service in 1979. He then served as the president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville for the following decade. While at Meharry, he was the recipient of the National Conference of Christians and Jews Human Relations Award was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, and was appointed to the Council on Graduate Medical Education. 
In November 1993, Dr. Satcher was appointed as the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. With policies he initiated, he has been credited with increasing child immunization rates from 52 percent to a record 78 percent in 1996, and improving the Nation's capacity to respond to emerging infectious diseases. During his tenure, the CDC has placed considerable emphasis on prevention programs as its breast and cervical cancer programs have now been expanded to all 50 States. In his current position, Dr. Satcher has garnered even more awards, including Ebony magazine's American Black Achievement Award in Business and the Professions, the Breslow Award for Excellence in Public Health, and recently the Dr. Nathan B. Davis Award for outstanding public service to advance the public health and the John Stearns Award for Lifetime Achievement in Medicine from the New York Academy of Medicine. 
I believe HHS Secretary Dr. Donna Shalala described Dr. Satcher in the best manner, when she said that he brings `world-class stature, management skill, integrity, and preventive health care experience' to any office or title he may hold. President Clinton has stated that Dr. Satcher should concentrate heavily on reducing smoking, particularly among children. As an advocate for preventive health in family medicine, Dr. Satcher has worked to heighten awareness about all American's health and will continue to do so. 
Mr. President, I believe that Dr. Satcher will bring the same professionalism, dedication, skill, and most of all character to this new position that he has shown throughout his professional career. I strongly urge my colleagues to support his nomination to the post of Surgeon General of the United States.

 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, this year marks the 25th anniversary of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, which has united Canada and the United States in their dedication to protecting the biological, chemical, and physical integrity of the Great Lakes. The commitment of both countries to manage water quality on an ecosystem basis has been so successful that other regions often praise our accomplishments and strive to achieve the same high quality of management. I applaud the efforts of both countries in the last 25 years to achieve the goals set forth in the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and urge that they continue to work cooperatively to maintain and improve Great Lakes water quality during the next 25 years. 
On April 15, 1972, the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement was signed by President Richard Nixon and Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau as a binational pledge to reduce and prevent pollution in the Great Lakes. The impetus for this agreement was the deteriorated quality of the Great Lakes into which we discharged our untreated wastes. In fact, Lake Erie was declared dead because of its poor quality and the Cuyahoga River had even caught fire. Lake Erie and Lake Ontario suffered from high phosphorus loadings which caused excessive amounts of algae to grow and deplete the water of oxygen. Low oxygen levels in the lakes caused fish to die. Other contaminants discharged into the water entered the food chain and caused deformities in the fish and wildlife of the region. 
The initial agreement concentrated on reducing phosphorus and pollutants entering our lakes through municipal and industrial discharges. As a result of the 1972 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, phosphorus levels significantly decreased in the Great Lakes. In Lake Erie and Ontario, phosphorus loadings have been reduced by almost 80 percent. The United States and Canada achieved this binational goal through improvements in sewage treatment, lowering the levels of phosphorus in detergents, and reducing agricultural runoff. 
While significant improvements were being made in controlling phosphorus and other wastewater discharges, researchers showed that toxic substances were a major concern. Persistent toxic substances, such as DDT, DDE, mercury, and PCB's, bioaccumulate in organisms and increase in concentration up the food chain. Some substances have been shown to cause birth defects in wildlife and adverse health effects in humans. 
As a result, the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement was revised in 1978 to meet the challenge of controlling toxics and included an ecosystem approach to managing the water quality of the Great Lakes basin. The two countries committed themselves to achieving zero discharge of toxic substances in toxic amounts and the virtual elimination of persistent toxic substances. 
Due to the United States and Canadian commitment to reduce toxic substance releases, some major strides have been accomplished. The cormorant population in the Great Lakes region has significantly increased from 1950's to 1970's levels when the number of nesting pairs of cormorants dropped by 86 percent. Between 1971 and 1989, concentrations of DDE and PCB's decreased in cormorant eggs by more than 80 percent. 
An additional refinement of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement occurred with the 1987 protocol which reinforced the 1978 commitments of the two countries and highlighted the importance of human and aquatic ecosystem health. Provisions were added to clean up 42 local areas of concern in the Great Lakes and included the development and implementation of remedial action plans [RAP's] and lakewide management plans. 
A challenge to controlling pollutants entering the Great Lakes exists since toxics and other pollutants enter the system in numerous ways. Therefore, the 1987 protocol also focused on nonpoint source pollution, contaminated sediments, airborne toxic substances, and contaminated groundwater. 
Since the 1987 protocol, accomplishments have been made in the areas of concern. In 1994, Collingwood Harbour, ON, attained its restoration goals. The community worked together to insure that the contaminated sediments and deteriorated fish and wildlife habitats were dealt with in an innovative and cost-effective manner. On our side of the border, a fish consumption advisory was lifted for the first time in two decades at Waukegan Harbor, IL, in February of this year. The harbor is an area of concern which has been undergoing remediation efforts to clean up the largest known-concentration of PCB's and PCB contaminated sediments. 
Though toxic substances continue to pollute the Great Lakes and threaten the health of humans and wildlife, there also have been accomplishments in controlling some toxics. For instance, concentrations of poly-chlorinated compounds, such as dioxins and furans which are used in the bleaching process of pulp and paper mills, have decreased in the Great Lakes by 90 percent since the late 1980's. 
While improvements in Great Lakes water quality are evident, they have not come quickly enough nor have they addressed all facets of the problem. Moreover, the most difficult challenge laid out by the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement is still before us--the virtual elimination of persistent toxic substances. Much more work needs to be done in this arena. Fortunately, the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement is precisely the vehicle which will enable us to rise to the challenge of virtually eliminating persistent toxic substances in the Great Lakes. Though crafted 25 years ago, the agreement and its amendments remain, in its current form, a vital road map for the restoration and protection of the Great Lakes. I hope that my colleagues will join me in respecting this agreement so that future generations will be able to enjoy a thriving Great Lakes ecosystem.

Mr. GLENN. Thank you, Madam President. I thank my distinguished colleague. 
I rise as a cosponsor of this legislation to establish a national Commission on the Centennial of Flight. We have been very proud through the years to have worked with the people of Dayton, OH, in an effort to recognize the very exceptional contribution of the two brothers who ran the bicycle shop and dreamed of flight. They watched the birds and dreamed of flight, not knowing whether it would ever be possible. 
In 1992, it was my privilege to sponsor the legislation that established the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park which commemorates the extraordinary lives of Wilbur Wright, Orville Wright, and Paul Lawrence Dunbar, a black man, a poet, one of the finest poets, who was a close friend of the Wright brothers. 
That park and the memorial in North Carolina recall that on December 17, 1903, Orville Wright flew 120 feet in 12 seconds. Can we imagine that, 120 feet in 12 seconds? But it was under power. It was the airplane that is over in the Smithsonian now. It was under powered flight with an engine and propeller. It was the first sustained flight in a power-driven, heavier-than-air machine. 
There were three other flights that day. We don't often hear about those. There were three other flights that day, and Wilbur Wright set a new world record flying on one of those flights 352 feet in 59 seconds. It was more than the length of a football field. 
Very little attention was paid at that time. People were very doubtful. Octave Chanute reported the achievement in Popular Science Monthly in March 1904. But the first--I think this is very interesting--the first eyewitness report about those flights appeared in a publication called Gleanings in Bee Culture, and that was in January 1905. That was the first real eyewitness report of Orville and Wilbur Wright's flights. 
The work had begun in 1899 with a serious study of everything the Wrights could find on aeronautics. In 1900, to test their glider, they selected Kitty Hawk on the word of the weather bureau because of the steadiness of the winds and direction of the winds at that time. The test glider in 1900 and 1901 failed to achieve the lifting power that they thought they needed and anticipated. 
They went back to Dayton and built a 6-foot wind tunnel to conduct experiments with over 200 different wing models. They developed the first reliable tables on the effects of air pressure on curved surfaces, the principles that we use today and that you see on every airplane, whether it is a general aviation small light airplane or a giant 747 or whether it is the Concorde flying at supersonic speed across the Atlantic Ocean. 
They developed these 200 different wing models and experimented with them. They developed the first reliable tables on the effects of air pressure on curved surfaces. 
In 1902, they conducted over almost 1,000 tests with a more promising glider. In 1903, the Wright brothers had completed the construction of a larger plane powered by their own lightweight gas-powered engine. 
Arriving in Kitty Hawk in September, storms and mechanical difficulties delayed trials until December. On the 17th, four men and a boy witnessed the very first flight, and a memorable photograph, fortunately, was captured. Four men and a boy witnessed that first flight. 
Back home in Dayton in 1904 and 1905, the Wright brothers continued testing their invention at Huffman Prairie, which is the area adjacent to what is today Wright Patterson Air Force Base where they first achieved maneuverable flight. 
In 1908, Wilbur and Orville signed a contract with the War Department for the first military airplane. In September, Orville circled the parade ground at an altitude of 120 feet just across the Potomac River from us today, over at Fort Meyer in Virginia. 
When most people these days think of the Wright brothers, we tend to think of them as having lived a long, long time ago. We tend to think of the Wright brothers as being part of ancient history. We also think of their airplane, the Wright Flyer III, as being an incredibly primitive machine, at least by today's standards. And it was a primitive machine. There were no fancy guidance systems or high-tech controls. 
By swiveling their hips from one side to the other, Orville and Wilbur could steer the airplane. To this day, when young people come in, when school groups come to Washington and visit my office and they say they are going over to the Air and Space Museum, I always tell them to get up on the gallery level and look down on the Wright brothers' airplane and see how they controlled flight, because the person flying lay on the lower wing and had a wooden yoke around his hips. That wooden yoke slid back and forth and there was a wire that went to the trailing edge of the upper wing, and they would slide in the direction they wanted to go, slide their hips over, pull that wire and literally warp the trailing edge of the wing down and made more lift on the wing on that side and the airplane would turn in the direction their hips were slid toward. 
I am glad they developed later on in aviation a better means of control. We can imagine a 747 pilot today making an approach swiveling his hips back and forth. But that was the way the Wright brothers controlled those very early flights. 
The first flight at Kitty Hawk and Huffman Prairie seemed so far removed from what we did later on, from my own experience in orbital flight in 1962, or from the first lunar landing, or from living aboard the orbiting space station for weeks on end, as Shannon Lucid did. She was up there for 188 days. She will be honored at the Smithsonian this evening, as a matter of fact. 
Yet, all this occurred within a lifetime. 
I know we kid Senator Thurmond around here quite a lot about his age, but Senator Thurmond was born December 5, 1902. The Wright brothers did not fly until a year later, on December 7, 1903. So we have in this body right now a man whose lifetime spans all of manned flight, powered flight, from that first day at Kitty Hawk into space. Strom Thurmond has witnessed the complete history of flight. And we marvel at just how far we have come in an incredibly short period of time. We have literally gone from the Wright brothers to the Moon and beyond in a single lifetime. 
That is amazing. In that sense, I think it is fair to say that Orville and Wilbur Wright were our first astronauts, really, because they were the first who really did rise off the Earth's surface in a sustained way and make flight that then advanced to higher and higher altitudes until we are above the Earth's atmosphere now with different kinds of machines; though I think in some ways we could say that they were the first two who, as the poem goes, `slipped the surly bonds of Earth'--slipped the surly bonds of Earth and ventured into the air under the power of a motor. 
Everything since then has just been going higher and going faster. I also think it is fair to say the Wright brothers personified something that is behind every single leap or advancement in science or human knowledge since the beginning of time. The one characteristic they had--we could lump it all together and say that is something that is in the heart of all human progress--is curiosity and an innate curiosity about how we can do things differently or whether we can explore and find new shores or whether we can do experiments and do research in new areas. 
Whether you look at the voyage of Christopher Columbus, who brought Europeans to the shore of North America, whether you look at the experiments of Alexander Fleming--you know what Alexander Fleming was curious about? It was plain old green mold on bread. He did not know why the patterns formed around the mold the way they did. The green mold, it was a particular pattern. He was curious about that. 
You know what that led to? His curiosity led to the discovery of penicillin and the development of modern antibiotics. That curiosity about green mold on bread has led to increased life expectancy of people all around this Earth. We have gone up in life expectancy more in the last 100 years than in the previous 2,000 years, I read in a magazine just a short time ago. So the discovery of penicillin and Alexander Fleming's curiosity about green bread mold that led to that, has really revolutionized this Earth. 
Or we go ahead with the unexpected circumstance in a small electronic switching device that led to the development of the first transistor and ultimately to today's incredibly sophisticated computer systems. 
It is clear to me that curiosity isn't what killed the cat. It is also the goose that laid the golden egg for all of humankind. That is going to be true in the future as well as the past. In field after field, in discipline after discipline, in industry after industry, it is curiosity, that insatiable, relentlessly questioning spirit that keeps asking `why' that has moved our species ahead. 
The irony, of course, is any time someone or a group such as the Wright brothers, or a group of people undertake an exploration or undertake to demonstrate a new idea, whether in a laboratory, a spaceship, a bicycle shop or on a production line, there are many who question the wisdom of it all. Those naysayers who wanted to know when their bike would be fixed with the Wright brothers believed that if we were to fly God would have given us feathers, they said. 
So there was a joke about the Wright brothers at that time. `If God wanted us to fly, why don't we have feathers?" Well, they fortunately laughed along with everybody else, but at the same time went ahead with their work. They were not deterred. But if there is one thing we know for sure about research or any kind of exploration of the unknown, it is that it is impossible to know what we will see at the end or what it may lead to. 
I believe that today, as perhaps never before, we cannot afford to lose that kind of curiosity and questing spirit that the Wright brothers had. With it, we can continue to learn new things, first, for this Nation, putting them to practical application, staying ahead of global competition. That has been the story of this country's advancement. Without it, we will quickly become yesterday's leader, yesterday's leader, not tomorrow's leader but yesterday's leader, hopelessly trying to hold back the hands of the clock and to hold on to a past glory that can never be just retained or recaptured. 
So the spirit of the Wright brothers is needed as much today as before their very first flight. That is why today I am pleased to join with my colleagues--my colleague from Ohio, my colleagues from North Carolina--in introducing this legislation to establish a national commission to assist in the commemoration of the centennial of powered flight that will occur in 2003 and the achievements of the Wright brothers. Those who worked to build our national parks and memorials to the Wright brothers in Ohio and North Carolina where flight was born and first achieved will now work together to recall and remember the spirit of flight to be commemorated as we approach the centennial of flight in 2003. 
The spirit represented by the Wright brothers was captured in their own day by their good friend, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, who captured in the prophetic verse which he penned the triumphs that are remembered at the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park. One of his notations was:  
What dreams we have 
and how they fly 
like rosy clouds 
across the sky; 
of wealth, of fame 
of sure success . . . 
That is certainly what curiosity has brought us and what the Wright brothers brought us. 
Think of all that has occurred since that first flight at Kitty Hawk in 1903. Think of aviation today and all it entails and the giant industry. It has revised all the world's transportation, has revised our military, our security. All of that stemmed from that first flight in 1903. 
So we are happy to put in this legislation today. We hope that it is supported by all here, not just those from Ohio and North Carolina, because what started there in 1903 is something that affects everyone. It affects every State and every nation around the globe, even these days. And we look forward to this commission doing a great job in assisting in the commemoration of the centennial of powered flight and the achievements of the Wright brothers.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to assist in improving air transportation for the people and businesses of northeast Ohio and the Nation. 
The city of Cleveland has a major capacity improvement program underway at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. For some time, Cleveland and the city of Brook Park had been involved in a dispute regarding property crucial to the development project. To their credit, both communities were able to resolve their differences through a comprehensive settlement agreement that will allow the airport's improvement program to move forward. This important settlement agreement includes changing municipal boundaries and the noncontroversial, jurisdictional transfer of property. 
Mr. President, Congress has addressed similar restrictions many times by enacting specific provisions allowing the Secretary of Transportation to act in similar cases. As part of the comprehensive settlement agreement this is clearly in the public interest and will allow Cleveland to meet northeast Ohio's increasing requirements for better air transportation. 
Mr. President, since the closing of the settlement agreement is to occur before December 31, 1997, this legislation is needed prior to adjournment. I appreciate the support of the leadership of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I want to address the campaign finance matter that we have been involved with this year. I would like to start off by saying that I think sometimes we give the impression, with all of our horror stories about some of the things that have happened in campaign finance over the past few years, both on Capitol Hill and in the Presidential elections in both parties--that we sometimes emphasize to the point where we might add to the cynicism of the people of this country instead of helping placate or correct some of the reasons for that kind of cynicism. 
I want to add that I think the majority of elected officials here in Washington, the majority of the people that run for office, whether high political office here in Washington, in the Congress, or even running for the Presidency or Vice Presidency, or the people back home running for State offices, are by and large some of the finest, most dedicated people we have, and they are dedicated to doing just as fine a job as they possibly can. So I think that sometimes we tend to overdo the criticism to the point where it adds to the problem we are trying to cure. 
Having said that, there are problems, and there is no doubt about that. We have to look at the big picture sometimes. I think we get so bogged down into nits and gnats of what a particular advantage is this way to one party or that way to another party, that we sometimes need to stand back and look at the big picture of why some of us feel campaign finance reform is very, very important. 
Let's drop back to the point where we see how our political system developed, why it developed the way it did. You know, we have the finest constitutional system of government in the world. We are the envy of much of the rest of the world for our political system. It represents all the people more perfectly than any system of government that has been devised. Winston Churchill put it well once when he said we have `the worst system of government, except for every other system of government ever tried.' 
We do more towards representing the individual and more towards making sure that every single person has a fair shake in our society than any other government that ever has been, even with the problems that we have. And we have to admit we do have a lot of problems. I see these problems as being mainly ones of danger signs up there to cure these little specks of rot that have crept into our system that could do major harm to our body politic in the future if we do not correct them now. 
If we have such a great system of constitutional government, how about the people running that Government? The Constitution does not provide for how we are going to staff the Government. And mere words written on paper--be they the Constitution of the United States, and sacred though that it is--that does not guarantee that we will have a good running Government under that constitutional system unless we have good people in there to make that system work. That is the key, and that is fundamental, because that is what our political systems in this country are. Our political systems are basically the personnel departments to run that constitutional Government. 
Those political parties that we have right now that wind up after an election staffing and giving direction to that constitutional system of government--those political parties are not provided for in the Constitution. We don't find anything in the Constitution that says there will be so many people in the Democratic Party, so many people in the Republican Party, and so on. No. In fact, our political parties have just sort of developed over a period of time under our constitutional system. That is as it should be, I guess. They have evolved. They have changed through the years to better reflect the interests of the people of this country. 
But there is one thing you have to have to make that constitutional system of Government work. And that is in any democracy to long endure we have to have in Government the confidence of the people--the confidence of the people. Unless you have that, a democracy may not long endure because people will want to experiment with trying the other systems of government, or they will want to go up and join splinter groups that reflect more their own little, narrow interests of what their parochial views are in their local community and where they think the country should go in the future to benefit them personally. We will see more and more of that, if the confidence of our people in Government goes down. 
Look across the seas. We see Italy. I don't know how many it is now--50-some different Governments since World War II. I think they have averaged about one per year, or something like that. They only have a government by a coalition of different groups--disparate groups of people getting together and not making a permanent government for a lengthy period of time, and making temporary alliances for short-term advantage. That is not the hallmark of America. And to see us setting up any possibility of that kind of a situation would play a game of roulette for the future of this country. 
Our country was founded on the basis not that we take this group, set it aside, and give it certain advantages. Not that there is a ruling class up here someplace, and they have certain advantages, and we set one class off against another. Our Government was set up on the basis of the importance of each individual--not groups, not special groups, but each single individual; and each individual was a king in this country, each individual was royalty in this country, if you will. Our Government was set up not to have a royalty that dictated their ideas, and everyone else had to live under that kind of rule. We have our constitutional system here where authority wells up from the people through their elected officials. It was that confidence in those elected officials that let us move ahead and become the kind of Nation we have become. We are a representative form of government. We are not a perfect town meeting government as we 
have seen in New England--the most pure form of democratic expression I guess that we have in our country. We cannot take a referendum on every single vote, in a national referendum--on every single issue--as they can at a town meeting. No. We say we will send people to work full time representing us, and we will trust those people. We will trust those people--that is the important word--to make those decisions on our behalf. 
If we start having trust in those people eroded, and we see that trust going downhill, then I see a big danger for our country. Our Nation was founded on this representative form of government that represents all the people all the time. And any time we depart from that kind of a feeling in this country of our Government representing all the people all the time, we engender less faith in our system, and we set up a potential of a slide downhill in our ability to cope with the future. 
I don't think the United States of America is ever going to get taken over by the likes of Russia, China, and North Korea and Iraq, or anybody, or put together by any combination. Our country is going to be militarily secure, I believe, into the indefinite future as far as we can see because we are cognizant of the fact that we live in an uncertain world. We will have to protect ourselves. And we are so far ahead of anybody else in military technology and power that I don't see that as a hazard for the future of this country at all. But I do see a danger for our country if we have this increasing cynicism, this cynicism of our people that seems to be growing, and particularly among our young people. If that cynicism grows to the point where our young people in particular feel that politics is just too dirty, `I do not want to touch it, wash my hands if I shook hands with a politician, I just do not want to have anything to do with politics'--if they have that kind of view, then what happens? We will have less support for our political system; that is, the department of personnel for this constitutional system of Government; less support for those parties. We will have less trust of elected Government officials and our representative form of Government. We will have people tending more to split off into special interest groups instead of supporting mainstream parties that have served us well for all of the history of this country--when we get away from representing all the people all the time, we start down a slope that I think is a danger to the future of this country. 
One person, one vote, one person, one influence--let's say. We are divided up into so many million little bits of influence in this country in our system of government, one person, one vote, one influence--that is what people think about. We tell our kids. `When they are growing up, when you get to be old enough, you register to vote because your vote is every bit as important as the vote of the President of the United States.' And we mean it. And it is. That vote counts every bit as much when the tallies come out on election night--no matter what the rank of the person, be it some gutter bum who got registered and decided to vote, or be it the wealthiest person in this country, or be it the President of the United States. All the votes are equal in that tally. And it is a vote. It is representing those people who are elected to represent all the people and represent them all the time. And that is the basis on which they are elected. 
That one influence from each person is supposed to be that person's influence, and influence is the future of this country. That, throughout our history, has given us the confidence to work together. 
So, when I see a cynical attitude developing toward Government and politics and those in Government instead of confidence in elected officials, we see question marks all the time about whatever is going on in Government--automatic suspicions, automatic paranoia: `You better watch those people in Washington. They are out to get us,' in a certain way or whatever. That to me is the beginning of a danger signal. It is the beginning of the potential of a slide downhill and confidence in Government that to me can lead to many other problems and leave us less able to take 
care of ourselves as a nation in the future than we have been in the past. 
This is erosion of trust to the point where people want no part of politics. They just didn't want any part of it at all because of what they see. It is something that we don't want to see happen. 
It is rather peculiar because we see some of this cynicism developing and expressing itself in polls. When people are polled, they let their cynicism all hang out. It is right there in the polling--repeated polling that shows that cynicism has been growing with regard to how people view their Government. And the confidence they have. That is really amazing because we have had rare times in our history when economic times and the general social pattern across the country has been any better. There the lowest unemployment rate, the lowest inflation rate, and Federal employment is coming down. We have a chance of balancing our budget. The times are good, and unemployment is low. We have no big foreign threat out there to us physically. You think people would be very, very happy about this whole thing. But instead of that there has been this gnawing, growing, rotten little specks of cynicism growing on our body politic that I see as a real danger for the long term. 
I think we can come back to what I mentioned a little while ago. People no longer feel confident that their primary interests are our primary concern here in Washington. They feel, `Why vote? Why get out there and vote? Why participate in a political party?' Why try an exercise that one little bit of influence they have to put together with millions of other little bits of influence which will direct the future of this country? Why should they try to exercise that little bit of influence when they see that the real influence in Washington, the real influence in our political parties, the real influence in Presidential elections, in congressional elections, in Senate elections, is too often money? It buys access. 
Why do we think of Roger Tamraz on the Democratic side who is willing to put $300,000 into a Presidential race because he wanted to get in and try to influence somebody. If he could get to the President, or to the Vice President, or get to somebody, and if he could get them to say, `I will approve your oil pipeline' in Southwest Asia, he was going to make billions out of it. He made no bones about it. He put in $300,000, and he said the next time he would put $600,000 in. Fortunately, it didn't work, to the credit of the people that were in charge--the President, and the other people around there. 
But I will tell you. It raises a warning signal to us about what can happen. 
I used that example on the Democratic side. How about on the Republican side? How about when you put out invitations to a group called `The Season Ticket Holders' for $250,000 each. One hundred people can join this thing, and for that you are going to get a guaranteed dinner with the chairman of your choice in the Congress. It says it right in there. No problem. You are invited to all the policy matters. You are invited. If you are a businessman and you want to contribute $250,000, or have your corporation give that kind of soft money--and soft money can be given in any amount--then you are guaranteed that you will be able to come in and represent your business interests with the committee chairman of your choice. 
It is not in the executive branch. It is here where the laws are formed--right here in Congress. At the bottom of the invitation, it says `Benefits Upon Receipt.' 
We wonder why the people are a little bit suspicious out there about what is going on. 
That was out of the hearings we had in the Governmental Affairs Committee. I could go on and on with a number of other examples. I just used those two to make sure that we all understand that this isn't something that is just one or two or very few people. 
It is something that has become endemic in Government. It is something that is pervasive. It is something that is a rot on the body politic. It hasn't ruined it yet. Most of that apple, most of that body politic, most of whatever it is still is in good shape and the people are just as dedicated as they have ever been and the public servants are just as dedicated as they have ever been. But if we let this practice on either side of the aisle grow into the long-term future, we are creating a problem for the future of this country. And that we do not need and we do not want and we cannot afford. 
Trust is down. Suspicions are up. People cynically question those of us in office, and we cannot blame them. 
Now, some other things have caused some problems in this area, too. One is that campaign spending has gone up and up and up and up and up. A report from the Federal Election Commission --let's go back about 10 years. Let's go back to 1985 and 1986. That is just over 10 years. At that time, the total, all congressional campaigns--just congressional not including the Presidential campaigns--in the 1985-86 cycle, the total spending for everything to do with Congress, Senate and the House of Representatives, was $472 million. Ten years later it is $790 million--$790 million just for congressional races, House and Senate. 
This is interesting. The number of candidates has gone up in that period. I guess more people are running in primaries and so on that are subject to Federal elections. Back in 1985-86, there were 1,873 people who ran for national office, congressional campaigns. That has gone up to 2,605. I guess that should be encouraging to us in that maybe more people are running for office. I wish I knew the quality of those people who are running for public office and whether we are getting the best and brightest out there in the system instead of more people deciding to take a whack at running for Congress. Why not? I do not know how you could judge that. Someone could do a poli-sci, political science doctoral thesis trying to analyze that, as to what is happening to the quality of people running for office. 
When you go from $472 million in 10 years to $790 million, the money chase is on. The money chase is on, and 70 percent of it goes to TV. If you are not coming into people's homes via TV, you are not, in effect, knocking at the door, as we used to do and greet the people and have a handshake. TV has replaced all that. If you do not come into that person's living room and say hello to them via TV, you are not in the campaign anymore. That requires about 70 percent. So the importance of TV has gone up, and that has raised the cost of campaigning tremendously. 
I point these out as a danger to the future as I see it. We had one cataclysmic event back a few years ago, and that is what we all know of by the general term `Watergate.' The revelations of Watergate resulted in our saying enough is enough. Congress got to work. It passed some legislation, put some limits on, deciding we were going to regulate some of these things in the future, not let them run rampant like they were because the whole public psyche in this country had been jerked up short at that time. I tell you, everybody was disturbed about this, and we couldn't wait every day to hear what the new revelations were. 
Watergate, for the first time, resulted in the resignation of a President of the United States, something that, growing up, we thought would have been absolutely impossible. 
But out of those national concerns came reforms, and the reforms served us well, I believe. They worked. We had testimony yesterday from our former colleagues here, Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker, and a former colleague here also and later Vice President, Walter Mondale, before our Governmental Affairs Committee. They talked about how the reforms put in place following Watergate, they felt, really worked very well. There were some regulations put on. People had some questions about first amendment rights and all these different things that are brought up and discussed in the Chamber now also, but the reforms after Watergate seemed to have worked pretty well. 
But then came a series of court and FEC decisions that undermined it and created some loopholes for those Watergate reforms. We started seeing the rise of soft money, and it rose and it rose, and then it really went out through the ceiling in the last election. And that was by far the biggest change that had occurred. 
So we are now on a money chase, be it Presidential or be it here in the Congress. I have heard criticism on the floor, as well as in some of the press conferences of some of the Members here, being caustically critical of--and some of the press being caustically critical of--the President going out and fundraising when he says at the same time we need campaign finance reform. Isn't this being hypocritical? I say, no, I do not think so at all because we have not really changed the rules. As the President said, he is not interested in unilateral disarmament at this point. 
As I said at our hearing yesterday, if both sides agree that this money chase should not go on the way it is and we agree to limit both sides, then certainly the President should not be out fundraising. If we agree to that, the other side could agree to it also. It would be a little bit like if I was over in England and I got used to driving on the left side of the road and I liked that, and I came back to this country and I put in legislation to say, let's have driving on the left-hand side of the highway become the norm in this country and we are going to pass a law that permits that to happen, but I say I believe in this so fervently I am going to go drive on the left-hand side of the road even before the law is changed, you know what the result would be. I guess we can say the same thing here. I think the President is right in going ahead with fundraising as long as the law is the way it is and the Republicans are doing exactly the same thing. 
So I think some of our campaign practices need to be revised, and that is what we are talking about with campaign finance reform. 
You know what all the current practices are. We see them every day right here on Capitol Hill. Some people can't go through more than, let's say, a two-pay period here without receiving an invitation here in Washington or someplace to a barbecue, to a coffee, to a reception, to a dinner. Are these all situations where you go and you say, I have to pay $500 or I have to pay $100 or I have to give $1,000 or I can't go to this thing? No. A number of these things, quite a lot of them, as a matter of fact, mean just getting acquainted with people and doing the first stroking, if you will, and setting up a situation where you can go back later and ask for some money, and, hopefully, they will see fit, once you become acquainted with them, to contribute to your campaign. That is the nature of politics. That is the way it is. 
But then later on there are some people who creep into this whole process--even though I think the major part of the process is still legitimate and aboveboard--who do want special access. They are not looking to just support someone whose beliefs they believe in, whose statements of purpose, whose ideas of public office are something that they personally believe in--which would be the best of democracy, if we could guarantee that was the type of support being given to individuals. 
No; they are people who come in and then want to do what I talked about a little while ago. They want either to buy a ticket to become a season ticket holder and have that guaranteed dinner with the committee chairman of their choice or they are a Tamraz who makes no bones about it; he wants to get his pipeline approved, and he is willing to give $300,000 to get a shot at a few words with the President in hopes he can influence that person to come around to his way of thinking--which did not occur, I repeat. 
Is that influence imaginary? Buying access; is that imaginary? No, it is not. When we had insurance legislation here a couple years ago, it came out in the paper that some of the big contributors and big lobbyists were called in--I believe it was on an insurance bill--and actually wrote part of that bill on the Hill here. They called in the lobbyists who made the huge 
contributions and let them write their own portion of the bill. That was even defended by one of the Members by saying, well, they knew more about it than anybody else. They certainly did, but that did not mean they were going to write it in a way that was for the benefit of all the people all the time. They had bought their way in with influence, and they were writing it for the benefit of some of the people and the benefit of their special interest, you can bet on that, or they would not have been in here doing that. 
We saw recently the results of $50 billion being inserted into a bill to benefit the tobacco companies, the biggest contributors. Their chief representative, who reportedly in a magazine makes about $50,000 a month, former Republican National Committee chairman, was the one who apparently worked his way and got that in. That is what people are unhappy about. 
I have given both Democratic and Republican examples here because I want to point out that this is not something which is just all on one side of the aisle. 
Sometimes the States get out ahead of the Federal Government in these United States of ours. They get out ahead of us in that they can operate, they can act more swiftly to take on a problem as they see it developing. Some of the States have seen their political systems be corrupted, or the danger of being corrupted, by political influence at the local level, and they have taken some action. 
The State of Maine has recently passed legislation, the basic theme of which is they are going to try State funding for State races. They are saying, we are going to cure this thing; and rather than try to write more complex laws on top of already complex laws, we are going to say, no, we are not going to do that anymore. We are just going to say, in the best interests of the people in getting the government, getting our elected officials, to make sure they address the concerns of all the people all the time, once they get through the primary, then let's get them some financing here so they do not have to go out on this money chase and promise everything under the sun to get enough money to have a chance of winning an election. 
There are 12 other States, as I understand it, that are looking at a similar program right now. Maybe that is the answer for the future. We have seen court rulings and FEC regulations and rulings create loopholes that let people have access to getting around our election laws. Perhaps Federal financing is a way to correct that. I personally think that is something we will come to eventually, whether we like it or not. We will be forced into it because it looks as if, unless something drastic changes in the Chamber here--we may get a bill through, but it appears that it is going to be watered down enough that it may not be the overall comprehensive campaign finance reform that some of us believe, sincerely believe, is necessary if we are going to correct this problem into the future. 
I do not rule out the possibility that at some time in the future we are going to have Federal financing of Federal campaigns because I think the people of this country may demand that. I am one of the original cosponsors of a bill here in the Senate, the Kerry-Wellstone bill, to take a look at this, to see if we could not work out something that is satisfactory in that particular area. 
So I think we need to watch this experience of the States as they try to take back their State governments and make their State governments representative of all the people all the time, not all the people part of the time and special interests the rest of the time. We need to watch this very, very closely. 
Let me address one other area. We haven't had much discussion recently in the Governmental Affairs Committee hearings that we have been having, we have not had much emphasis on enforcement. 
There have been those who said we have all these laws on the books now. They are not working, so why add more laws on top of them and make more laws that won't work either? That is a pretty good argument, as a matter of fact. But I don't believe that is the way we ought to go. What we should do, we should make a FEC that can enforce the legislation, enforce the laws of the land, enforce the regulations they have put out, and make sure that anyone who violates those regulations is brought up short and is penalized and do it immediately, not years and years later. 
Instead of that, what have we seen? We have seen, through the years, the budget for the Federal Election Commission either remain about the same or actually be cut, from year to year. Instead of giving better enforcement, they are only able to give less enforcement. Maybe the people who have perpetrated those cuts on our system here had that in mind. Maybe they did not want to see the FEC be anything more than, what has been termed in the past, a toothless tiger. I think if we have laws they should be enforced. I think whatever is required to help the FEC do that, we should provide the money to do exactly that. 
This year we have reached even a ridiculous example. They asked for an additional $4.6 million over there in addition to their, I think it is, $28-point-something million. They asked for an additional $4.6 million to give them special investigative authority, investigative capability to go out and see what happened in the 1996 election. And the committees up here have not only not approved the additional money for them, they have sent word over there specifying they are not to hire more people. They are not to hire more people. That is the word that FEC is operating under from the committees on the Hill right now this very day. They are not to hire more people to look into these alleged violations of law that happened in the last election. 
In other words, we are creating a Nation of political scofflaws out there, if you will. Because they know you are not likely to get caught if you do something wrong, because that is just the way the system is. It does not have the capability of picking up all the wrongs in the system. So you have a chance of getting away with all sorts of misdeeds if you want to try it. 
So, we need a strong FEC. We had one estimate given to us the other day by one person who studies these things a lot of the time, that they thought the FEC budget should probably be doubled. It should be somewhere around the $50 million mark, instead of hovering around the $30 million or under mark. I would vote for that. 
I think we also need to make some changes in the Federal Election Commission, in that I don't believe they are organized on the proper basis. When we say you have six commissioners over there, three will be Republican and three will be Democrat, that sets it up for political bickering right off the bat. It is organized for political disunity going in. It is not organized to get to election fraud and violations without fear or favor, no matter what the politics of it are, Republican, Democrat, or independent. It is set up with three and three, which just breeds political gridlock. And that is exactly what they have had through the years, in many cases. Much of the time. 
One of the suggestions that had been made in the past is that we, instead of having the commissioners appointed on a political basis the way they are now, we should have the commissioners appointed from former Federal judges: People who would be stable; they have been used to giving fair consideration of the law and cases, that has been their training, that has been their background; and to be appointed for their nonpolitics, for their apolitical views, if you will, because they would best be able to judge, then, when a Democratic or Republican transgression occurs, they would best be able to give it the proper attention and proper consideration. Rather than just saying I am a Democrat so I better protect my Democratic interests over here no matter what, or I am a Republican so I'll see that we forgive that violation or whatever it is on the Republican side--no. That is not in the best 
interests of the people of the United States. The best interests of the people of the United States is in having a Federal Election Commission that enforces the law without fear or favor, wherever the violation occurs. And that means, I think, that we have to reorganize at the top level over there. 
Going into our committee investigations this year, we were faced with a tough choice. 
Before I leave that, for just a moment let me give a few figures here on the FEC, what their budget problems have been. For fiscal 1995 they had over 10 percent of their budget rescinded halfway through the fiscal year, the largest percentage agency rescission of any Government agency. In fiscal 1996 they sought $32 million but they received only $26 million, with some of those funds fenced for other particular purposes. For fiscal 1997 they had their travel budget limited and fenced such that it was difficult to conduct depositions and court appearances, including those undertaken in connection with the Christian Coalition litigation. In fiscal 1998, being considered right now, they asked both the House and Senate for $29 million, plus an additional $4.9 million--I correct my figure I gave a moment ago at $4.8 and $28 million, I guess I said--but they asked both the House and Senate for $29 million plus an additional $4.9 million just to deal with cases arising from the 1996 Federal election. The actual budget is still in conference, but they have been told specifically not to hire more staff to look into those problems of the 1996 election. 
Let me tell you one other thing, and this I think is rather amazing. I didn't know this until a few days ago myself. Their total enforcement cadre over there is 30 lawyers to oversee all these hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cases filed with the FEC. There are 30 lawyers. How many investigators would you think the FEC would have to go out in the field and investigate wrongdoing out there, get the information, go to boards of elections, bring that information back, really create these cases--how many investigators do we figure the FEC has? Do you know what the answer is right now, as of this day, the 1st of October, 1997? They have two, two investigators. And that is up from only one just a short time ago. I guess that is heartening. That is a 100 percent increase, isn't it? We have gone from one up to two. 
Two investigators for the FEC. Their lawyers in the enforcement division go out but they don't do investigations. They will go out and do depositions. They will go out and do a court case someplace that has been developed here, but their work is basically paperwork handled at the Washington level. So the investigative capacity at the FEC is not much, two people for the whole agency. 
I propose we somehow get some little cadre of FBI people who really know something about investigation and assign them, at least for a period here of a few years, to help out over there, doing real investigative work trying to clean up the problems of campaign finance where the laws have been broken. And there have been laws broken in a number of areas. 
Where do they need to look? Starting out our hearings this year I suggested we, instead of just going with Republican investigations or Democratic investigations, I proposed that we pick some areas where we know there are difficulties with campaign finance and then we bring those up, one after the other, and have a series of hearings on each one of these subjects. Let the chips fall where they may, Democrat or Republican, and find out what is wrong with the system, get it out there, get it out in the open. If we need additional law, let's have additional law. If we just need to enforce existing law better, then let's do that, too. But let's find out what the problems are first and then enforce them and make a system that really is run on a tight basis. 
What are some of these areas I want to look at? One is foreign money. There are all sorts of allegations about money coming in from wherever, whether it was the Chinese or Chinese Government, where it was being channeled, where it was coming through and who it was going to, and did it affect elections or did 
it not affect elections--we had all sorts of problems with foreign money potentially coming into the American system. We had one on one side looking at whether it is the Democrats are where the money is coming and John Huang and Charlie Trie, and did that money come from the Government of China? On the other hand, we had the spectacle of Haley Barbour and the Republican National Committee getting loans of money, $2.1 million out of Hong Kong, funding it through the National Policy Forum in this country and into the Republican coffers. So we had bipartisan foreign money problems, there isn't any doubt about it. 
So we should be looking at that? That is one area. There are other areas, though, that we have only touched on briefly in the last few hearings that we have had, that I think we also have to look at if we are going to really do the right job, looking into campaign finance reform or campaign finance violations, No. 1; and things the FEC should be monitoring on a steady basis. 
How about the second one, third-party transfer? If I have maxed out my contributions that I can give, I say, `I am maxed out.' But I turn to somebody else and I say, `OK, look, I'll give you $1,000 and you go over there and you give that in your name and that clears it and I'll just give you the money.' That is illegal. We have lots of information about that being done. That whole thing is an area we have really not even explored much yet, yet it was violated time after time after time. 
So, foreign money, do we have to look into that? Of course we do. The third party transfer of funds? Of course we do. 
Another area was the area of misuse of tax exempt organizations, so-called 501(c)(3) and (c)(4) organizations, where they have organizations given certain tax-exempt status and, for having that status, they are prohibited from political activity. But in this last election that whole thing ran amok. Organizations were being put together with that kind of charter and they were deliberately channeling money through. We have example after example of that, and we have not really had a chance to bring those things out yet, either. So that is another area we ought to be looking at. 
Another area the FEC ought to be following, if we gave them adequate resources to do so, is tax-exempt organizations. 
Then we had the biggest increase of all and that is in the area of soft money, where you can give any amount you want to give, any amount you want to give. If you are a billionaire you can walk in and put $1 billion down if you wanted to. Do you think that might buy some influence? I think it might buy some, yes. You can put down any amount you want. As I talked about a little while ago, we had the restricted membership of 100, if they would contribute $250,000 to that season ticket holder group that I mentioned just a moment ago when I was lining up one on the Democratic side and one on the Republican side to give some balance to this. The soft money can come in in any amounts now, but it is supposed to be just for party building. It is supposed to be used for things like get-out-the-vote drives and general advertising on general views of the Republican Party or the Democratic Party. Was that misused? There is no doubt whatsoever about the misuse of soft money and the pernicious influence that it had with this last election. The area of influence of soft money has just skyrocketed from election to election since the new FEC ruling just a few years ago. 
Another area is the straight old quid pro quo. We could add that as a fifth. If I give you so much money as a public official, then I want you to pass a certain law for me; and you do it. There are examples of quid pro quo also. So, these are all areas that we cannot ignore from the past. There are many of those things, just in those areas that I mentioned, that are flat illegal. Soft money is not illegal. It is perfectly legal now, but we have to make it illegal with McCain-Feingold, which I support fully and I am a cosponsor of. This is probably the most runaway part of campaign financing that we have had in recent elections--certainly in this last election. 
Now, along with soft money, that I make such a fuss about, there is one other part. If we are going to correct this, there is one other thing we have to do, too. We cannot just see the money that was formerly going to soft money, to the parties and being misused then, being put into State races or into congressional races. We can't just see that money then not go into soft money but go over into issue advocacy ads and independent expenditures for the so-called issue advocacy ads that can be put on in a particular campaign in the last few days and influence a campaign, quite apart from the person running in that campaign who doesn't even have control of who is coming in and putting on TV ads either for or against him or her. 
So we can't just do away with soft money and hope that will solve the problem, because soft money is probably going to gravitate over to the area of issue advocacy or independent expenditures. If we are going to correct one, we have to correct the other; we have to deal with them together. 
So the question is, how do we prevent soft money not only from going into issue advocacy ads or independent expenditures, but also we want to make sure that we don't create a loophole here where the soft money now will go by the many, many millions of dollars over to the States, which it would be legal to do right now, go to the States, and the State parties then would use it in particular campaigns within the State by putting on independent ads or issue advocacy ads in support of congressional candidates, even those that are not State races, but there is an interest in them. So you see how complex this whole thing becomes. 
Mr. President, those are a few views on some of the things that I see with regard to campaign finance this year. 
There are a couple of statements I would like to quote on the floor today. Will Rogers is looked at as one of our great political commentators, in a humorous way, from years past. He did it in a way that got the attention of the people. He was pretty caustic in his comments sometimes. He made a statement once that might be applicable today, though. He said:  
Wouldn't it be great if other countries started electing by the ballot instead of by bullet, and us electing by the ballot instead of by bullion? 
I think he was right. 
Another is a statement by Kin Hubbard, Frank McKinney Hubbard: 
When a fellow says, `It ain't the money but the principle of the thing,' it's the money. 
And you can bet on that. 
Jesse Unruh of California some years ago said: 
Money is the mother's milk of politics. 
And that's sure true. It is as true today as it has ever been before. 
Let me finish up where I started off today with this. I am afraid by our talk here about what is the potential for the future that we talk about this in such terms to make our point on the floor that sometimes we emphasize them to the point that we are about to increase what we are trying to prevent, and that is cynicism in this country. 
By talking about the difficulties of campaign finance and the transgressions against campaign finance law--which should never have occurred in the last election on both sides of the aisle, and they have to be corrected. I am not trying to say they are not important, but they are. My whole statement today has been along the theme that this is a beginning of a rot we have to correct. So I am not trying to minimize these things. 
I hope most of the people of the country realize that most of the people who run for high office do so with very good purpose in mind. Most of the people here, I would say, are very talented people. Most of them could probably be making more in business or in some corporate position or outside of public office than they do here. Not all of them, but certainly many people could. We have people running for office who are very fine people. 
But this is a danger when we see things like what happened in this last election--the potential with foreign money, although all the sums talked about or rumored, whatever came from foreign money is a tiny little pittance, just a tiny little nothing almost compared to what was spent. That $790 million I indicated was spent in the last election just in congressional elections. Not even the Presidential election is included in that. 
So a few million dollars that may have come from some foreign source is a fairly small amount, but it is a danger sign. We have to regulate that. We have to cut it off. We have to make our restrictions enforceable if we are not to see that grow into the future, and that is the danger; that is the danger. We have to make sure that with third-party transfer of money, we don't just 
find rampant disregard of our laws, and then people just saying, `I know my limit is' so and so `under the law, I will give you' this, this, `and somebody else, and I will contribute a lot more than my Federal limit was ever supposed to be and I won't get caught anyway.' 
We have to make sure that doesn't occur. We have to make sure the misuse of tax exempts, which ran rampant this last time, as conduits from people who had special interest money to put in --and they put it in by the millions. We have evidence of where that went and how it went. I hope we are able to put that on in the hearings before our campaign finance investigation ends on the Governmental Affairs Committee. 
All these areas--whether it is foreign money or third-party money or tax-exempt money or soft money or quid pro quo--all these areas must be enforced with existing law. Then we can go ahead with bringing soft money under better regulation than we have ever done in the past. In fact, there isn't any regulation on it to speak of now. Then we are making real progress. 
I believe the McCain-Feingold bill, which I fully support, is a start. I don't view it as anything more than a start. I don't think Senator McCain or Senator Feingold feels it is anything but a start right now, but it is a start. It is a start in showing people that, yes, we can act here in Washington; yes, when we do see a danger for the future, when we see some rot beginning on this body politic, we can cut that out, we can correct it, we have the capability to do it and we can restore confidence. 
Where we see cynicism and we see disregard for law, we see cynicism about what may be going on with our Government, we can replace that, once again, with real confidence, real faith in letting the people of this country know that we are concerned and are willing to do something about it. 
That is the reason why I support the McCain-Feingold proposal so wholeheartedly. They are important, and I am hoping that we can really have a vote up or down eventually. I know the so-called legislative tree has been filled that will try to thwart the passage of this legislation, but I am hoping we will really see a vote possible on this legislation before we finish with it. I guess the schedule is we will finish with it sometime next week. 
Mr. President, this was a rather lengthy statement. I will undoubtedly have more to say about this next week.

 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Capt. Frederic G. Leeder, USN, upon his retirement from the United States Navy, after 28 years of distinguished and dedicated service to our nation. 
Captain Leeder is a native son of Ohio and graduated from Ohio State University with a degree in journalism. Following his graduation from college, Captain Leeder was commissioned as an Ensign. After his graduation from the officers' program at the Defense Department's Information School, he then assumed a variety of public-affairs assignments overseas and stateside. His tours of duty included a North Atlantic Treaty Organization staff assignment and four joint-service assignments. 
Most recently, Captain Leeder served as Staff Director for Public Affairs at Headquarters, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) in Alexandria, Virginia. During his three years at DLA as principal spokesperson, Captain Leeder demonstrated unbounded stamina, keen insight, and exemplary professionalism. Possessing exceptional skill, foresight and composure, Captain Leeder dealt with representatives of the print and electronic media, engaging them on his terms. In just one example, last fall he competently worked with investigative reporters from a prominent news magazine and a major television network to ensure accuracy and fairness of nationwide reporting on a sensitive issue having significant national security implications. With his intelligent foresight and strong voice of reason, Captain Leeder, advised three different DLA directors, each from a different service I might add, on how to navigate through the often perilous waters of media and community relations 
Captain Leeder succeeded in striking that delicate balance of ensuring the American public's right to know and protecting the public interest throughout his career. An accomplished communicator, he truly has earned the gratitude of thousands of military families that have found comfort and reassurance in his words when loved ones serving on distant seas and shores have been in harm's way. Captain Leeder has served his country for 28 years with valor, loyalty, and integrity, winning the personal and professional respect of all who come in contact with him. Captain Fred Leeder is a master of his craft. 
On the occasion of Captain Leeder's retirement from the U.S. Navy, I offer my congratulations and thanks to this esteemed son of the Buckeye state, and wish him well in his future pursuits.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit and speak on behalf of my proposed concurrent resolution to honor Dr. Hans Blix, who will soon be retiring after 16 years of service as the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. 
Unfortunately, it is probably true that many Members of Congress do not fully understand what the IAEA is, what it does, and how it serves our national security interests. I think it is appropriate, therefore, to take just a few minutes to describe the agency that Dr. Blix has directed over these many years of distinguished service. 
I would like to begin by discussing what the IAEA is not. The agency is not an organization that specializes in public relations or advertising to herald its achievements. Its officials tend not to be flamboyant. It is not any appendage or puppet of the U.S. Government, though it surely does serve the national security and foreign policy interests of the American people. It is not a police force. It has no army. It has no clandestine intelligence service. It has no ability to finance its operations by raising tax revenues. Indeed, it has absolutely no guarantee that adequate funds will be available to pay for the agency's complex and ever-growing responsibilities. And like many other international organizations composed of diverse members--including some countries that do not even exchange diplomatic relations--it is not an agency that is immune to political conflict or controversy. 
So what then is the IAEA? 
The IAEA is a highly specialized agency in the United Nations system. It was created back in 1957, largely as a result of the Atoms for Peace initiative launched by President Dwight Eisenhower. Since its establishment, the IAEA has performed two basic tasks. First, it implements a system of safeguards over the peaceful uses of nuclear energy around the world. These safeguards consist of inspections, accounting measures, and material verification controls intended to ensure--in the words of the IAEA statute--`* * * that special fissionable and other materials, services, equipment, facilities, and information made available by the agency or at its request or under its supervision or control are not used in such a way as to further any military purpose'. 
After the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [NPT] entered into force a quarter of a century ago, the parties to that treaty established a system of nuclear safeguards whose objectives were `* * * the timely detection of diversion of significant quantities of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities to the manufacture of nuclear weapons or of other nuclear explosive devices or for purposes unknown, and deterrence of such diversion by the risk of early detection' (IAEA, INFCIRC 153, para. 28). 
After the war in 1991 to expel Iraq from Kuwait, the UN Security Council gave the IAEA the responsibility of ensuring that Iraq was complying with the Council's resolutions concerning the dismantling of Iraq's nuclear weapons capability, a mission that the agency continues to perform today. 
But the agency does not just implement safeguards. Its second key mission is to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in such fields as agriculture, medicine, nuclear safety, and the generation of electricity. Today, more than 90 countries receive nuclear technical assistance from the IAEA. This assistance typically comes in the form of equipment, expert services, and training activities. Funding for these activities comes primarily from member states' voluntary contributions. The United States, which played such an essential role in the creation of this agency, contributes about a quarter of the IAEA's regular budget, which in 1996 came to $63 million of the agency's $219 million budget. 
Now having just described what the Agency is not, and having reviewed briefly what the agency is, it should be quite apparent that any individual who can lead such an organization for 16 years, win numerous reelections, inspire the confidence of members of the world community--some of whom are not 
even talking to each other--enhance the technical competence of the agency, and accomplish all of the above on a limited budget, is no ordinary individual indeed. And that describes Dr. Blix about as best as I can describe him. He is a remarkable public servant. 
I would like to add on a personal note that I have had the privilege of meeting with Dr. Blix many times during his frequent trips to this country. I know the kinds of political, organizational, and funding problems he has had to handle over his long tenure of office. I appreciated both his candor and his extensive knowledge about the workings of the agency that has done more than any other to protect the world community against the nightmare of loose nukes. I will miss both his good humor and his wise counsel about the challenges facing the agency as it grapples with some of the world's most difficult international security problems. 
Though I wish Dr. Blix well in his retirement, I also look forward to working with his successor as Director General, Dr. Mohamed El Baradei. And as I prepare for my own retirement next year, I hope that all of my colleagues with responsibilities in the field of international nuclear affairs will miss no opportunity to educate themselves about this important international agency and the vital contributions it makes to the security of all Americans and, indeed, to the security of the world community as a whole. 
It is important for us all to understand not just where this agency has been but where it may be heading in the years ahead. 
We must recognize that safeguards do not implement themselves and will never suffice as a permanent guarantee against the illicit uses of nuclear materials. We must face the fact that some nuclear activities--such as large-scale reprocessing of plutonium or commercial uses of highly-enriched uranium--are probably unsafeguardable in the strict sense of the term and should therefore be discouraged internationally or, if economic reason and security considerations are allowed to prevail, phased out all together. 
We must acknowledge that nuclear power offers no panacea for either the Greenhouse Effect or the world's ever-growing demand for electricity. 
We must beware of efforts in the world community to expand the missions of this agency without also giving it the resources it needs to perform those responsibilities. 
We must understand that IAEA member countries that comply with their safeguards agreements and international nonproliferation treaty obligations are entitled to receive technical assistance from the agency--and that the United States has ample foreign policy tools available to influence its adversaries rather than turning the IAEA into a diplomatic playing card, a punching bag, or an arena for gladiatorial combat. 
If we recognize the strengths and limitations of the agency, I believe it will continue to serve the positive roles it has played over many decades in the service of world peace, security, and prosperity. And if the legacy of Dr. Blix continues to inspire the leadership of that agency in the years ahead, as I have every reason to believe it will, then the future of the IAEA will be bright indeed. 
I ask all my colleagues to join me today in congratulating Dr. Blix for his long and dedicated service in the pursuit of a safer world. Let us salute him and his agency for a job well done.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, if there is anything that sets this country apart from other nations around the world, it seems to me it would be our, almost our innate curiosity, our questing spirit that led people not only to explore geographically, but led them to explore in the laboratories of our Nation and express our curiosity in learning new things. That is at the heart of science, learning the new and putting it to use. We could run through a whole gamut of things in history. We could talk all night tonight about different things that have revolutionized our way of doing things on Earth. 
The Wright brothers were curious about whether we could fly or not, whether you could get the air to react enough off an airfoil so you could fly--and they were ridiculed for it. Some people said, `If God wanted us to fly, why, he would have made feathers on us so we could fly.' Their curiosity led to airplanes and the aviation industry and changed the nature of the whole world. You can say the same thing about curiosity about the internal combustion engine and automobiles and communications and how we transmit sounds from one place to another--the telephone, the Bells--computers and plastics and TV and nuclear energy and agricultural research. 
We never think of agriculture in this country as being such an example of basic research, yet, just in my own lifetime, the corn production in Ohio has gone from about 48 bushels per acre to something like 137 on the average and, in some places, going close to 240 bushels an acre in certain selected spots. That is just enormous. That did not occur because people are working three or four times as hard. It occurred because of basic, fundamental research, people curious about soil and about fertilizer and seeds and hybrids and so on. We can go on with antibiotics and anatomy and physiology and all the things we know in medicine these days. We could talk for many hours about where this questing, curious nature that we have in this country has led us. 
Part of the bill before us here involves the NASA budget. An area where we, as a nation, are expressing our curious, questing nature, is in the area of space and space research. Every year we are asked why do we invest billions of taxpayer dollars for space exploration and research. There is one very short answer to it. In my view, we do it is to benefit people right here on Earth. This has been true for the whole program. It was true ever since I was involved in the space program many years ago, during Project Mercury and our first orbital flights. There are a number of examples of research connected just with the space program, and particularly with the space shuttle experiments, that I think everyone can relate to. 
We will have applied science and scientific research going on through the years with the international space station project. Every year we debate this on the floor. Fortunately, to my way of thinking, we have continued to fund the space station. It is one of the greatest scientific engineering cooperative efforts in the history of this world. We have a number of things that are being looked into now on the shuttle that could be done better and longer term on the international space station when it comes along. Parts of it will start being put up at the end of next year. But a lot of things that have come out of the shuttle program so far are of very, very practical use right here on Earth. 
One experiment that I find most intriguing is protein crystal growth. It is fascinating. It brings a whole new input to medicine, to the thousands of different proteins and combinations that make up our bodies and literally stands to transform the way medicine looks at itself and the way we treat disease and what we can do with regard to immunities. 
Let me give just one example. We have a chart here I would like to have put up that shows what is going on with treating flu. A flu remedy is being developed with space-grown crystals, where you can better find out how the flu bug itself reacts. The loss of productivity due to flu is staggering. Its costs range as much as $20 billion a year. There are high-mutation rates of the flu virus. New data from the protein crystals grown in space and on Earth have unlocked the secret of the flu bug and revealed its Achilles heel. The secret lies in a small molecule which is attached to the host cell's surface and each flu virus, no matter what strain, must remove this small molecule to escape the host cell to spread infection. 
But using data from space and Earth-grown crystals, researchers from the Center of Macromolecular Crystallography are designing drugs to bind with this protein's active site, in other words, the lock on this site. This lock-and-key reduces the spread of flu in the body by blocking its escape route. 
In collaboration with its corporate partner, the CMC, the Center of Macromolecular Crystallography, has refined drug structure in preparation for clinical trials, and those clinical trials are starting. When tested and approved, relief is expected from flu epidemics by the year 2004. I give some detail on that because I think it is an example of the kinds of things that are underway that we can directly relate to the space program. We have some 20 to 40 million people every year that get the flu, and it causes some 20,000 deaths a year in the United States alone. This new data of space-grown crystals has helped unlock a secret to let us treat flu in a different way. That is just one example. 
Another example that can benefit from these same kinds of space-grown crystals is trauma from open-heart surgery, which often may lead to complications due to massive inflammation of heart tissue. Factor D is a protein which plays a key role in the biological steps that activate this immune response. Being able to block factor D's effects could enable heart surgery patients to recover more rapidly, and data from space-grown crystals allowed researchers to develop inhibitors which specifically block factor D. This drug is being readied for clinical trials. 
We have a new antiparasite drug from space-grown crystals. It is estimated that over 1 billion people in this world are infected with a round worm known as ascarids. It is a tiny parasite that infects the intestinal tract of vertebrates and is often fatal. Ascarids are dependent on a substance called malic enzyme to function properly. A new drug, developed in part by Upjohn, with the benefit of crystals grown on the USML-1 Spacelab mission, should interfere with normal functioning of malic enzyme and, thus, prove deadly to ascarids. 
Another example: Space crystals and the fight on AIDS. A new combination of drugs, which include protease inhibitors, have proven immensely successful in treating AIDS. In an ongoing experiment with DuPont Merck, NASA has crystallized HIV protease enzyme with an inhibitor to support structure-based drug design research, and the resulting drugs could represent the second generation of this successful approach to treating this disease. 
This chart shows some of the details. I don't know whether the cameras will pick this up well enough to show the interaction. This is something that gives real hope in the treatment of AIDS in the future. 
Another example on a different chart here indicates how diabetes patients may benefit from NASA's bioreactor research. The bioreactor is a tissue culturing instrument which allows microgravity researchers to grow tissues which are larger and more complex than other tissue culturing techniques. The bioreactor has the potential for changing disease treatment through tissue transplants. 
Forthcoming experiments plan to grow human pancreatic islet cells in the bioreactor for possible transplantation into diabetic patients. Trial runs with this technique have proven successful. If the upcoming experiments are successful, diabetic patients will not need to rely as heavily on insulin injections and will have less complications from their disease. 
Another chart: Modeling colon cancer with bioreactor. Mr. President, 166,000 cases of colon cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States, and it is a leading cause of death. Colon cancer tissue grown in a bioreactor develops remarkably similar to tumors extracted from humans. Studying these tissues outside the human body may allow researchers to understand how cancer spreads, as well as identifying new therapies which may prevent it. 
This bioreactor is a fascinating thing. It lets tissues be cultured in the same way they occur in the human body. If you go into a laboratory and try to do experiments there, quite often the 
experiment becomes far more two-dimensional because it wants to settle to the bottom of the petri dish. A bioreactor in space, with all the right fluids that simulate the body, allows growth in a 3-D situation. They can be studied better so possible antidotes for them or possible treatments can be put into a culture there that is very similar to what is in the human body. It is not just something that is flattened out in the bottom of an experimental glass in the laboratory. 
Growing cartilage with the bioreactor is another potential application. An application of the bioreactor is culturing cartilage tissue for replacement and transplantation. Experiments with the bioreactor and space indicates it can successfully culture cartilage tissue that is quite similar to human cartilage. 
I use these few examples today just to illustrate that they are very, very practical and very, very useful for our future on Earth. The international space station will make it possible to continue some of the same experiments for longer periods of time. I know that every year when we have the budget battles on the floor, we have attempts made to cut out some of the money for the international space station, which would cut out some of the scientific inquiry that we otherwise would be able to perform. Let me talk about it very briefly. 
NASA has already had some 1,000 or more proposals per year for ground-based and flight investigations involving the international space station project. Selection of principal investigators and commercial developers is beginning this year for flights starting in 1999, and this population will increase from 650 to 850 principal investigators and from 100 to 200 industrial affiliates by the time the station assembly is complete. 
About 650 life and microgravity sciences principal investigators are now participating at over 100 institutions of higher learning around the country, and the number of investigators is expected to grow to over 850 before assembly is completed. These researchers, in turn, employ about 1,400 graduate students at present, with that number expected to grow. 
What are they looking into? Well, a number of different areas, and I won't be able to go into all of them today. Biotechnology with an x ray diffraction system, for instance. Microgravity allows researchers to produce superior protein crystals, which I mentioned a moment ago, for drug development and to grow three-dimensional tissues, including cancer tumors, for research and cartilage for possible transplant. 
The long-term benefits: to provide information to design a new class of drugs to target specific proteins and cure specific diseases; to culture tissue for use in cancer research and surgery in bone and cartilage injury. 
Another area that can be looked into on the international space station also is in the area of materials science. Researchers use low gravity to advance our understanding of the relationships among the structure, the processing and the properties of physical materials. 
The long-term benefits: We advance the understanding of processes for manufacturing semiconductors, metals, ceramics, polymers, and other materials. We also determine fundamental physical properties of molten metal, semiconductors, and other materials with precision impossible on Earth. 
There are a number of people involved in this, people from the State University of New York, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and MIT up in Boston. Researchers indicate great progress from this new research tool in having projects in space in microgravity. 
Another area being looked into, and this one is a fascinating one, is combustion science, fluids and combustion facility, glove-box experiments, as they are called. Scientists are using low gravity to simplify the study of complex combustion processes, burning processes. Since combustion is used to produce 85 percent of Earth's energy, even small improvements in efficiency will have large environmental and economic benefits. 
The long-term benefits: Improved control of combustion 
emissions and pollutants reduce risk from incineration of hazardous wastes and enhance efficiency of combustion processes. 
These are only highlights of some of the prestation research that have already occurred. Dr. Robert Cheng and Dr. Larry Kostiuk, combustion science researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under contract to NASA, were awarded a patent for a ring flame stabilizer, which significantly reduces pollution from natural gas burners. Fitted into an off-the-shelf home heating surface, the device reduces nitrogen oxide emissions by a factor of 10 by increasing efficiency by 2 percent, and the device can be readily sized to industrial scales. That kind of experiment will continue on the space station. 
`Almost every chapter in the combustion textbooks will be rewritten as a result of the microgravity work,' said Prof. Howard Palmer, professor emeritus at Penn State University. And other statements by other scientists say the same thing. 
Furthermore, the international space station will continue research into fundamental physics. Scientists use low gravity to test fundamental theories of physics with degrees of accuracy that far exceed the capacity of earthbound science. Physics and low gravity expand our understanding of changes in the state of matter, including those changes responsible for high-temperature superconductivity. 
The long-term benefits will challenge and expand our theories of how matter organizes as it changes state, and that is especially important in understanding superconductivity and its advantages. We can also test the theory of relativity with precision beyond the capacity of earthbound science. 
Scientists will study gravity's influence on the development, the growth and the internal processes of plants and animals, and their results expand fundamental knowledge to benefit medical, agricultural, and other industries. 
The long-term benefits will improve the overall health of people of all ages. It can improve plants for agriculture and for forestry, and we will gain an advanced understanding of cell behavior. 
Biomedical research in space will provide unique insights into such things as how the heart and lungs function, the growth and maintenance of muscle and bone, perception cognition, and balance, the whole area of neuroscience, and the regulation of the body's many systems, called regulatory physiology. 
The long-term benefits will assist in developing methods to keep humans healthy in low-gravity environments for long, long periods of time; advance new fields of research in the treatment of diseases; enhance medical understanding of the role of force on bone in disease processes, including osteoporosis; advance fundamental understanding of the brain and nervous system and help develop new methods to prevent and treat various neurological disorders. These are the long-term benefits. 
I quote a friend and one of the most respected surgeons in this country--as a matter of fact, in the world--Dr. Michael DeBakey, chancellor and chairman of the department of surgery, Baylor College of Medicine, who said:  
The space station is not a luxury any more than a medical research center at Baylor College of Medicine is a luxury. Present technology on the shuttle allows for stays in space of only about 2 weeks. We do not limit medical researchers to only few hours in the laboratory and expect cures for cancer. We need much longer missions in space--in months to years--to obtain research results that may lead to the development of new knowledge and breakthroughs. 
We also can either look out into space or, from an observation point in space aboard a spacecraft, the international space station, look back toward Earth. That is planned with the Earth Observation and Space Science, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, and SAGE to be deployed in 2001. 
The space station will be a unique platform with multiple exterior attach points from which to observe the Earth and the universe. 
Conceptualized by Nobel prizewinning scientist Dr. Sam Ting, of MIT, the alpha magnetic spectrometer experiment will search the universe for antimatter and `dark' matter in an attempt to prove cosmological theory with direct evidence. 
Also, the stratospheric aerosol and gas experiment, SAGE-III, will also be delivered. It will obtain global profiles of aerosols, ozone, water vapor, and oxides in order to determine their role in climatological processes. It will allow cross-correlation of observations from SAGE's I and II at different latitudes and different time periods. 
I cite these examples to briefly indicate what a wide variety of scientific effort will go on with the international space station. 
Now, let me address these next remarks to two sets of people who may be watching or listening here today. How many of you are over 60 years of age? If you are not over 60 years of age I know that each of you hopes to live to be 60 or older. What I am about to say I believe is very relevant to you. 
For several years now NASA and the National Institute on Aging, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, have been working on some projects looking at what happens to astronauts in space. 
I became intrigued with this, and I have long been interested in issues associated with our aging population. In fact, when I first came to the Senate--I was sworn in in January 1975--I asked to be assigned to the Special Committee on Aging because I thought there was so much work needed to be done. 
Today, we find an aging population sometimes referred to as the graying of nations. I conducted hearings years ago on the graying of nations, and then had additional Governmental Affairs Committee hearings in New York called the Graying of Nations II. Dr. Robert Butler assisted in putting together those hearings. He was the first Director of the National Institute on Aging and did a superb job in getting that whole agency started. 
Nearly 45 million Americans today are 60 years of age or older. The demographic experts tell us that that is projected to grow to about 100 million over the next 50 years, by the year 2050. NASA has begun to formally explore the similarities between the aging process and what happens to astronauts in microgravity. There are physical changes that occur in space and the National Institute on Aging has been very interested in and has worked with NASA to review these changes. They are in the process now of coming up with very specific proposals as specific experiments. 
But there is a great similarity between what happens to astronauts in the short term--it starts 3 to 5 days after they have been up there on current missions--and what happens to the elderly right here on Earth by the normal process of aging. This is fascinating because of the similarities in osteoporosis, for instance, changes in bone density, changes in orthostatic intolerance--in other words, the ability of the body to keep blood in the upper part of the body so you do not just black out--the vestibular and balance problems, sleep disturbances, decrease in muscle strength, the decrease in immune response, and similar changes in cardiac activity and blood glucose. 
Now, these changes occur in the younger astronauts in space right when they go up today. They occur during the first 3 to 5 
days, or are noticeable, as I understand them, in the tests that have been run. At the end of the flight when they come back to Earth, the younger astronauts return to normal, their bodies recover, their bone structure is basically reformed again. They recover from it. 
Now, in the elderly here on Earth there is not that same kind of recovery. But what the National Institute on Aging and NIH is looking into with NASA is to propose experiments to see what happens if you did put an older person into space. What would happen? Would the changes that happen to the younger astronauts be additive to the older astronaut or would that person be semi-immune from those same changes? 
Would the change be to the same degree? What happens when you come back to Earth again? With these changes, would the older astronaut recover as fast as the younger ones? If not, why not? In other words, the questions being asked are basically what triggers these different systems and why do they change? Why do they change in microgravity? Why do they change in orbit? Would they change the same for an older person as they do for the younger people? I think this is a fascinating field. I am very hopeful that NASA and NIA will formalize this program primarily for the potentially enormous benefit that may come from it for hundreds of millions of people, not just people in this country, but people literally all over the world, and also because I can think of no more powerful and essentially untapped constituency for human research in space than the elderly. 
I will say a few words about the importance of international cooperation in space research, also. 
If you had told me some 35 years ago when I made my flight back in 1962 that in June 1997, a U.S. astronaut would be beginning the 16th month of continuous U.S. presence on a Russian space station, I certainly would not have believed it. 
As a veteran of the cold war and the space race, I guess I could not be more pleased to see this kind of progress. Obviously, there is tremendous symbolic value when former enemies work together cooperatively. But symbolism isn't the most important reason we cooperate. Again, it gets back to basic research. The quality of research is going to improve if we have the best and the brightest from 15 nations working on a project. 
The shuttle-Mir program, also called phase I of the international space station, is a perfect example of the benefits of such cooperation. As many of you know, this program consists of nine shuttle-Mir docking missions. The program is helping both the United States and Russia learn countless valuable lessons which will be put to use on the international space station. 
Now, obviously, the Mir space station has been having problems. We are aware of those from the daily news. Some problems are due to aging components of the station; some may have been due to crew or ground control errors. We will see what NASA and the Russian space agency leadership will recommend. 
Usually, for both the Russians and the Americans, space operations have been nearly flawless. For example, just a few days ago, the crew of STS-89 returned from a 16-day science mission which appears to have exceeded all expectations for scientific data. 
I would like to remind people of two things. First, space travel and research is still a risky and technologically complex undertaking. Things do not always go right. We are dealing with new fields of power and speed. There are going to be times when things do not always go right. So it would be completely inappropriate for us at the first sign of serious trouble to cut and run. 
Second, NASA emphasizes safety above all else. No one has ever intentionally put our astronauts in unsafe or hazardous conditions. Quite the opposite. I know from firsthand experience our astronauts are trained to handle emergencies of all sorts that can be foreseen. 
Some have suggested that before we send another astronaut to 
Mir, NASA must certify to Congress that it has done everything possible to make it safe. I find that an insult to NASA, because that has been their primary objective all the way through the whole program. For Congress to require that NASA had to certify it has done everything possible to make it safe before we would have another astronaut sent to Mir was about as unnecessary as anything I have seen since I have been around here. I think such a certification would be an insult to the men and women who work on this program every day. No one at NASA intentionally ever takes risks with people's lives. But space flight is risky, and we have to accept that. 
I do not know whether people realize the speeds involved up there. I meet with school groups quite often. I find them amazed when you say, well, we have to travel nearly 18,000 miles an hour just to stay in orbit up there. That is true. But that is such a large number, it does not mean much until you ask the same students, `What is 5 miles from your school? Is the mall 5 miles from your home?' It seems the mall has an attraction for a lot of the young people these days. To make that 5 miles trip in a spacecraft would take just 1 second. To stay in orbit you are traveling about 4.8 miles per second--per second. And when you come back in and start hitting the atmosphere again with the spacecraft, there is tremendous heat buildup just from the friction of the atmosphere, ionized layers out ahead that get up around 9,000 or 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and surface temperatures of, say, somewhere around 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. 
We confront many challenges we have come to take for granted almost that we can meet the challenge successfully. We have done it amazingly successfully throughout the history of the space program. It has not been perfect. So to think that it is going to be perfect is just a wish. 
Even if we were forced to curtail the Mir activity, we have already learned a tremendous amount from the seven shuttle flights that have been made to that station. 
Let me just enumerate a few of the accomplishments. 
Most importantly, we have conducted countless joint science experiments in a variety of disciplines. 
American astronauts have maintained a continuous presence in space for nearly 470 days. 
We have successfully conducted six shuttle-Mir docking missions, with three more missions for the future. 
Russian and American engineers, astronauts and cosmonauts, in performing joint operations, have developed mutual understanding in originally dissimilar design philosophies and established close rapport between counterparts of the two different cultures. That is important for the future. 
We have learned to plan and execute a typical shuttle mission to a space station. 
We have verified and developed rendezvous and docking procedures. 
We have conducted joint ground and mission control operations. 
We have learned to transport and exchange supplies. 
We have developed joint extra-vehicular activities. 
We are testing schedules for long-duration Mir and short-duration shuttle crew work rest cycles during the docked and undocked phases of missions. 
We are jointly resolving safety and acceptance testing differences. 
And we are developing in-flight training protocols. 
Most importantly, we are working together on joint research projects. 
These accomplishments place us in an excellent position for initiating and conducting the assembly and subsequent operation of the international space station with reduced risk, with greater confidence and reduced learning curve expenditures in time and costs. The only other way to gain this experience would be to wait until assembly of the ISS and then learn, and that is a little late. 
Now all of this is leading up to construction and operation of the international space station. Let me show just a couple of charts here. This effort will be the largest peacetime international science collaboration in the history of this world. These international partners will include Canada, Japan, Russia, Britain, Italy, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. 
On-orbit weight will be 470 tons, and almost 20 percent of that, over 85 tons, of hardware has already been built. 
This is an example of one piece of hardware now, one of the modules right here. When built it will have some 43,000 cubic feet of pressurized volume, which is the equivalent of a 747. 
When you think about the number of scientific breakthroughs that can come from such an orbiting laboratory as this, it is sort of mind boggling. 
I want to remind everyone of the critical importance of spreading the word about the benefits of human space flight. I hope staffs listening in the offices as well as Senators may go back to our communities in our States and find new outlets or organizations which may not have considered the significant impact which space research has had and could have and will have on their lives. If we can just invigorate and sustain such an effort I am very confident that the shuttle Mir and the international space station will merely be steppingstones to a much greater future. 
I have asked NASA to put together, if they can, a compilation of the of the scientific research projects that have gone on on each one of those shuttle flights. I hope I can get that this evening so we can put that in the Record tomorrow because I think it will show the diverse nature of the scientific experiments, some of the breakthroughs that have occurred because of those experiments, and I think that is the best way to show what has happened in the shuttle program and the potential that gives for the international space station. 
We have some other pictures of the space station that is already put together and is being worked on. This shows a technician working on this particular hatch. This shows two of the modules here that are already built, already tested out, and we have one unit that is undergoing tests down at the cape right now. 
This shows another view of what is being done. This is not something that is theoretical into the future. It is being done right now. 
This is a picture of some of the testing area where the hardware is being checked out. The hardware is roughly, as I said, almost 20 percent complete right now. Now, that 470 tons will be the final size of the vehicle once it is up there. 
I see this as an extension of the best that our country has to offer in the way of science and research and the questing nature of our people that have given us a standard of civilization beyond anything the world has ever seen. We have been a Nation that did not just say we will live on the Atlantic shore on the coastal plain. We moved beyond that to the Ohio River, to the Mississippi and on to the Plains. 
I read into the Record last year, and I may bring it to the floor again tomorrow, the statement by Daniel Webster, who for all his other brilliance was a skeptic, sometimes, and had a rather myopic vision. When they were considering buying lands west of the Mississippi from Spain or Mexico, Daniel Webster was against it and he rose and said words to the effect of `What use can this area west of the Mississippi be, this area of cactus and prairie dogs, of blowing sand, of mountains with snow, impenetrable snow, to their base? Mr. President, I will not vote 1 cent from the public 
Treasury to move the Pacific coast 1 inch nearer Boston than it now is.' 
That may show somewhat of a myopic view of even such a learned person as Daniel Webster, but it does. And that is repeated somewhat today by people who say, `What is the possible value of this?' The possible value is clear in just a few of the things I have mentioned here today. We have whole catalogs that have come out, things that have benefited science, research, medicine, and engineering in this country, and they are continuing. That is what this is about. 
For the first time we will have some 15 nations involved in an international space station, working together instead of preparing to fight each other, working together using the best brains out of each of those countries to do research that is of benefit to people all over this Earth. That is the importance of it. 
Some years ago when people would rise on this floor and say what possible benefit can it be, we now have a good story to tell them. It is a success story that every single American can be very, very proud of. 
I am happy to be supporting the station. I presume we will have some amendments proposed on the floor that will change some of the program and the way it is outlined. I hope we will not approve those. I think the program has been revamped now. It is very well thought out. It is being done at about the cheapest we can possibly do it and still keep safety paramount, which is No. 1. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record a paper, `Microgravity Research and Exploration' provided by the NASA Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications.

Mr. GLENN. We have in room S. 211, for the information of Senators or their staffs, a panoramic view that has been put together by NASA of Mars as taken from the Pathfinder. A full-sized model is out there for people to look at. It is intriguing. It is so tiny you cannot believe it is sending all this information back to us on Earth. 
We invite staffs or Senators when they come over for a vote which starts at 5:15 to stop in and look at it. It is very worthwhile and gives a different concept than just seeing the pictures on TV. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the amendment offered by my colleagues, Messrs. Harkin and Warner, which would authorize the resumption of certain forms of economic assistance and military training activities with Pakistan. 
The amendment would allow the provision of assistance by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation [OPIC], the resumption of military training activities, and certain other trade and democratic assistance to Pakistan. This aid had been terminated due to Pakistan's continued inability to keep its many promises and assurances to the United States concerning the peaceful nature of its nuclear program. The amendment would resume this specific assistance and do so unconditionally. 
I used the word, `unconditionally.' That means, the assistance could continue in the future to flow even if Pakistan acquired new uranium enrichment assistance from China or transferred its own technology to some other country. 
The aid could flow if Pakistan detonated a nuclear device or transferred nuclear weapons designs or components to some other country. 
The aid could flow if Pakistan once again attempts to violate United States nuclear export control laws by acquiring nuclear equipment or materials for its bomb program. 
The aid could flow if Pakistan starts the unsafeguarded production of plutonium, an activity that may soon commence with the completion of its production reactor at Khushab. 
The aid could flow, in short, with no expectation whatsoever that such aid would be accompanied by further progress in restraining Pakistan's bomb program. And in so flowing, the aid could help Pakistan--albeit in a restricted way--to alleviate the burdens of United States nuclear sanctions. In other words, America could be helping Pakistan to cope with United States nuclear sanctions, rather than signaling our fundamental national conviction in policy and in law that proliferation must have a price. Instead of making proliferators pay, we could be issuing special rewards for proliferation. 
The key here is obviously the word, `could'. The President would be left, under this legislation, with the delegated responsibility of determining whether the continuation of U.S. assistance in the face of any of the activities above would truly serve the U.S. national interest. And I for one surely cannot imagine any circumstance where such a determination could be made. 
Yet I hope that this amendment will not send the entire world exactly the wrong message about America's commitment to nonproliferation. 
The amendment must not suggest that America has lost the political will to keep nonproliferation as a key national security policy in our dealings with other countries. 
It must not signal that our country is more concerned with promoting its opportunities for trade and investment than it is about curtailing the global spread of nuclear weapons. 
It must not indicate that countries can make--and then systematically break--solemn promises to the United States concerning matters of profound importance to regional and international security, and do so without jeopardizing the flow of much-desired U.S. foreign assistance. 
Now all of us here today are familiar with the notion that America should engage Pakistan by providing increased United States assistance as a means of restraining its nuclear program. It would not be the first time that members of the Senate or the Executive had argued that additional military or economic aid would serve as a valuable instrument of nonproliferation. But I do not believe that the sponsors of this amendment today would sincerely make such an argument. We simply cannot turn a blind eye to history. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert at the end of my remarks a list of statements concerning the alleged value of United States foreign assistance as a tool of nuclear restraint in Pakistan. I urge my colleagues to read a few of such assurances that United States officials provided to Congress throughout the decade of the 1980's, the very decade, lest we forget, that Pakistan crossed its most significant milestones on its march to the bomb.

Mr. GLENN. I would like to remind my colleagues that most United States economic and military aid to Pakistan was cut off in October 1990 by President George Bush, when he was no longer able to certify that Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons or that the provision of further United States aid would reduce the risk that Pakistan would come to possess such weapons. That language, found in the Pressler amendment, sec. 620E(e) of the Foreign Assistance Act, has been substantially relaxed in recent years, in part by the actions of Congress, and in part by actions taken unilaterally by the Executive. Let me review briefly just how far America has gone already to relax these sanctions. 
The Brown amendment, which was enacted in February 1996, amended the Pressler amendment to allow the provision of all types of economic assistance, notwithstanding Pakistan's continuing non-compliance with the Pressler criteria. In addition to allowing the transfer of over a third-of-a-billion dollars of embargoed military gear to Pakistan--including spare parts and upgrades for Pakistan's probable nuclear-weapons delivery vehicle, the F-16--the Brown amendment also unconditionally authorized the resumption of the following aid: international narcotics controls; military-to-military contacts, including IMET; humanitarian and civic assistance projects; peacekeeping and other multilateral operations; antiterrorism assistance; an exemption from storage costs for embargoed military equipment; and delivery of military items sent to the United States for repair before the 1990 sanctions. 
For its sponsors, the Brown amendment suffered from one rather serious problem, however. That amendment failed to recognize that Pakistan was still in violation of the Symington amendment, sec. 101 of the Arms Export Control Act, and the likelihood of presidential waiver of the latter was extremely remote, in light of Pakistan's continued violations of that law. In short, because the Brown amendment neither repealed nor amended the Symington amendment, the Symington amendment continues to outlaw the provision of aid under the Arms Export Control Act or the Foreign Assistance Act to Pakistan. That is why the present amendment is being offered--it is being offered to liberalize the sanctions under the Symington amendment. 
I note that the International Financial Institutions Act only requires U.S. executive officers at those institutions merely `to consider' the nonproliferation credentials of the potential recipient country, and hence this does not prohibit continued aid via such institutions. Pakistan has received hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance from such institutions since October 1990. 
The Export-Import Bank Act only requires the denial of credits in the event of violations of safeguards or a US nuclear cooperation agreement; nuclear detonations; or persons or countries that willfully aid and abet non-nuclear-weapon states to get the bomb. 
A host of other legislative amendments have authorized the provision of the following forms of assistance to Pakistan, notwithstanding existing nuclear sanctions, via nongovernmental organizations: agricultural, rural development, and nutrition; population and health; education and human resources development; energy; 
appropriate technology; use of cooperatives in development; integrating women into national economies; human rights; environment and natural resources; endangered species; and private and voluntary organizations. 
So America has not been heartless to the lot of Pakistan's vast majority, its poor people. We have over the years provided billions of dollars of assistance intended to improve the living conditions of the people of Pakistan. 
Our grievance today is not with the people of Pakistan but with their Government. It arises in particular from the awesome and growing credibility gap between the peaceful words of Pakistan's leaders about their country's nuclear program, and the certain fact that Pakistan is continuing to develop nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them. 
Now some might argue that we should simply be grateful that Pakistan is not detonating nuclear weapons right now. We should rejoice that Pakistan is not transferring its bombs, bomb designs, or bomb components--right now anyway--to other countries. We should be happy that Pakistan has not yet imported a complete nuclear reprocessing plant or uranium enrichment plant from China, and be grateful that it is only technical assistance and components that Pakistan has received for its bomb program from China. By golly, we should celebrate the fact that Pakistan does not yet have an ICBM, or that it has not yet attacked Indian civilian or military positions with nuclear weapons hung under the wings of United States-supplied F-16 aircraft. Yes, we can surely be grateful for all the above restraint. 
But maybe, just maybe, all of this heroic nuclear restraint that Pakistan has exercised is due in good measure to the real and palpable costs that Pakistan would pay if it engaged in any of those flagrant activities--costs that include, but are no means limited to, the costs that are found in existing United States sanctions legislation. 
We must examine, however, not just at what Pakistan has not done, but also recall what Pakistan has done. Here is what Pakistan has done recently: 
Pakistan has acquired thousands of specially-designed ring magnets for its unsafeguarded uranium enrichment project, and reportedly acquired them just about the time the United States Congress was debating the Brown amendment in 1995. Pakistan's actions make a mockery not just of the Brown amendment, but also of America's nuclear nonproliferation policy as a whole. 
Pakistan is nearing completion of an unsafeguarded plutonium production capability with its production reactor at Khushab and, by some reports, a related nuclear reprocessing plant. 
Pakistan has in the eyes of most of the world, but evidently not yet those in our own State Department, acquired nuclear-capable M-11 missiles from China, and recently test-fired its HATF missile. 
On March 20, 1997, the trade publication, Nucleonics Week, reported that `Pakistan has completed its tests of its atomic bomb capability successfully through computer simulation.' This claim was made by one who should know, Pakistan's former Army Chief of Staff, Mirza Aslam Beg, and comes as a particularly bitter reminder of the Senate's unfortunate decision last week to vote down a proposal by my colleagues, Messrs. Cochran and Durbin, to tighten up export controls over high-powered computers going to Pakistan and other risky countries. 
In June 1997, the CIA Director sent to Congress an unclassified report on global weapons proliferation in the last 6 months of 1996--Report entitled: `The Acquisition of Technology Related to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions: July-December 1996'. Here is what the report had to say about Pakistan:  
Pakistan was very aggressive in seeking out equipment, material, and technology for its nuclear weapons program, with China as its principal supplier. Pakistan also sought a wide variety of nuclear-related goods from many Western nations, including the United States. China also was a major supplier to Pakistan's ballistic missile program, providing technology and assistance. Of note, Pakistan has made strong efforts to acquire an indigenous capability in missile production technologies. 
The report also said that, 
The Chinese provided a tremendous variety of assistance to both Iran's and Pakistan's ballistic missile programs. 
Needless to say, these are some of the key findings from just one recent unclassified U.S. government report, perhaps the tip of the proverbial iceberg. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record at the end of my remarks copies of some of these relevant reports.

Mr. GLENN. How are we to interpret such activities? Should we just write them off as due to India's own irresponsible nuclear and missile programs? Is it due to the so-called inevitability of proliferation? No, indeed, we need to redouble our efforts to roll back both countries' programs. Above all, we should not be engaging in acts that can reasonably be interpreted as rewards for proliferation. 
I do not myself see this legislation as a reward for proliferation and do not believe that its sponsors, including its supporters in the Administration, so view it. But I worry more about how others will perceive it, particularly those in Pakistan and in the various ministries of other countries that may be working on clandestine projects to develop weapons of mass destruction. How far can Uncle Sam be pushed when it comes to avoiding sanctions against the bomb? If past is prologue, it appears that the unfortunate answer is, pretty far indeed. 
Through this legislation, America has now made a gesture--based more on hope than on experience--that the Government and people of Pakistan will interpret as they wish. I hope they will recognize that America is sincere about its global commitments to nuclear and missile nonproliferation. I hope they recognize that America remains determined to pursue vigorously these commitments not only in Pakistan, but also in India, and indeed, wherever such illicit programs may exist. 
I also hope--as the profound direct and indirect costs mount of maintaining these dangerous nuclear and missile programs--that the Government and people of Pakistan will come in due course to realize that there is a more rational course to follow and a new day will dawn. It is a course charted by the governments and people of South Africa, Brazil, Sweden, Switzerland, South Korea, Taiwan, Germany, Japan, and numerous other countries that individually reached their own decisions that their latent nuclear weapons options are just not worth the substantial national security and economic costs of exercising those options. Make no mistake about it: cost assessments have been and will continue to be crucial to national leaders around the world in making such decisions. 
We will not come any closer to witnessing the dawn of that new day, however, if we continue on our current course of incrementally weakening the costs we impose for proliferation where it occurs. I remain concerned that while today's step is quite modest and incremental, the overall tendency is one that is suggestive of a weakening of America's resolve to pursue vigorously its key nonproliferation goals. Last week we gave the Senate's blessing to the disposal of licensing requirements for computers that were used in making hydrogen bombs. Today we loosen sanctions on Pakistan despite its ongoing nuclear and missile programs. Where will this process lead tomorrow? 
That is the question that remains unanswered by today's legislation. It is a question that I surely hope is on the minds of each Member of Congress and the relevant offices in the Executive. Indeed, this is a question that should be on the minds of all Americans.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to make a few comments concerning S. 936, the fiscal year 1998 national defense authorization bill. 
I worked this year with my colleague from Indiana, Senator Coats, on the Subcommittee on Airland Forces. This was our first year as chairman and ranking member on the subcommittee and I am pleased that we were able to work together very cooperatively. 
It was in the spirit of bipartisanship that we reviewed the administration's budget request, the services' so-called wish lists, the testimony of our witnesses and our colleagues' requests for funding of various programs. In our first meeting, we agreed that we would adopt criteria for assessing funding requests, not unlike the criteria Senator McCain and I established in the area of military construction several years ago. 
Section 1059 of the bill expresses the sense of the Senate that, in considering providing additional funding for the Reserve Component equipment, the Senate look to whether there is a Joint Requirements Oversight Council validated requirement for the equipment, that the equipment is in the Reserve Component's modernization plan and is in the Defense Department's Future Years Defense Program, that the equipment is consistent with the employment and use of the Reserve Component, that the equipment is necessary for the national security of the country, and that additional funds could be obligated in the upcoming fiscal year. Section 1059 expresses the sense of the Senate that these criteria be met to the maximum extent practicable. I appreciate my colleagues' willingness to apply these standards to our funding decisions, so that we can work to make sure we are buying things that we truly need. 
In accordance with the recent report of the Quadrennial Defense Review, the bill also adds about $150 million in funding for the Army's Force XXI [`21'], a `digitization' program that I agree has a great deal of potential. I am a strong supporter of the Army's efforts and I certainly agree that digitization of the battlefield offers tremendously enhanced situational awareness. 
My concern as we embark on this multibillion dollar effort is that, in our enthusiasm to exploit these technologies to our advantage, we should not ignore the vulnerabilities to which these systems could already succumb. 
We need to red team this technology--by this, I mean, we need to put ourselves in our adversaries' shoes and think about what our enemies would do to capitalize on our reliance on digitization. Would they jam us, would they spoof us, could they bring the whole system down? I believe that we need to be just as enthusiastic about testing potential vulnerabilities of digitization, because we can bet that our potential adversaries will be trying to undo us. 
So, we are requiring a report on digitization and I am pleased that, at my request, the report will also outline the Army's plans to address jamming vulnerabilities and to use electronic countermeasures. I will be looking forward to that report, Mr. President. 
I'd also like to take a moment to discuss one of the most difficult areas in the budget request: funding for tactical aviation programs. The Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps will all be modernizing their fighter forces over the course of the next two decades. The good news is the services will field the most modern and the most lethal aircraft in the world, the bad news is that these programs will be extraordinarily expensive. 
Over the life of the F-22, the F/A-18 E/F and the Joint Strike Fighter programs, we can expect to spend several hundreds of billions of dollars in procurement alone, never mind operations and support costs. Some thought that maybe the QDR would make dramatic changes to these programs, but the QDR essentially revalidated the requirements for these programs with relatively small changes in the number of aircraft to be purchased in the out years--and it is still unclear to me when, or even whether, those cuts in the number of aircraft we will buy are going to generate any meaningful savings. 
Making decisions on the enormous funding requests associated with these programs would be challenging enough alone, Mr. President, but when they are put in the context of the overall DOD budget and what just about everyone acknowledges is a sizable funding shortfall in future procurement accounts makes this task all the more daunting. 
The Subcommittee on Airland Forces had several very good hearings on these programs. We had service witnesses, OSD witnesses, CBO, and contractors present testimony on our requirements and our progress in these programs both from a technical risk and a cost standpoint. 
I have been very concerned that we not repeat mistakes made in the past, where Congress was left in the dark and we ended up with an unacceptably expensive program like the B-2 program. I'll be very candid, Mr. President, I have some strong reservations about what is currently happening in the F-22 program. The program is experiencing a $2 billion overrun in the research and development program, with a risk that there may be sizeable cost growth in the procurement program as well. 
The Air Force and the contractor assure us that they can absorb these overruns by re-structuring the program and by taking out some preproduction verification aircraft. Some argue that this approach increases concurrency in the program, while the Air Force argues that by slowing down the engineering and manufacturing development phase of the program that they will be able to reduce overall concurrency. I think the jury is still out on that Mr. President, and that we are going to have to watch this program very carefully. 
Reasonable minds are going to disagree on what the best approach is to addressing this problem. I am afraid that I must disagree with the committee's approach on F-22. The bill before us cuts $500 million out of the program--20 percent of this year's request. I just don't see how taking such a big cut out of the program can address the cost overrun. There's no connection between the two as far as I can tell, and worse than that, I'm concerned that cutting the program will only serve to increase the technical risk. 
I don't want my colleagues to misunderstand me. I agree that we need to be vigilant in our oversight of the F-22 program and we need to make sure that adequate controls are in place so that we don't end up with runaway costs. But, I think a better way to deal with the situation is to fence the money--put up hurdles that the Air Force must clear before it can have all of the money that's been requested. Once those hurdles have been cleared, the Air Force can move forward with the program as planned. Under the committee bill, even if the Air Force meets every program requirement, they will still be $500 million short at the end of the year--it seems more punitive than remedial, Mr. President. 
There are some other parts of the bill to which I am adamantly opposed. First, I take strong exception to the section included in the general provisions which would prevent the General Accounting Office [GAO] from conducting any self-initiated audits, under its basic legislative authority, until all other outstanding congressional requests have been completed. 
This language amends title 31 of the United States Code and is an unwarranted and unjustified intrusion into the jurisdiction of the Committee on Governmental Affairs. It represents a major policy shift in the operation and authority of GAO. One which this committee adopted without any consultation or input from the Governmental Affairs Committee. 
The Governmental Affairs Committee held an oversight hearing on GAO last Congress. There were several Members on each side of the aisle at that time who served on both committees. I don't recall any Member raising this as an issue or discussing problems regarding GAO's self-initiated audits to light. 
Moreover, the committee, under my chairmanship, contracted with the National Academy of Public Administration [NAPA] to comprehensively review GAO's management and operations. The NAPA study did not identify any problems related to GAO's conduct under their basic legislative authority, nor did it make any recommendations for our consideration on this issue. In fact, quite the contrary. Some analysts thought GAO should perform more, not less, self-initiated audits. In their view, GAO was often subject to rather parochial and narrow Member requests which only drained GAO's time and resources. I would note that GAO currently conducts 80 percent of its work in response to Member requests. A few years ago, it was far more evenly split. 
Since 1921, the Comptroller General has had broad authority to evaluate programs and investigate on his own initiative all matters relating to the receipt, disbursement, and use of public money. Self-initiated authority has provided GAO the flexibility to pursue critical issues that auditors and investigators uncover in the course of their work. It is essential to the maintenance of generally accepted standards of independence and impartiality. Any restriction of this authority would be akin to us muzzling the auditor. The effect of this provision would be that, for example, work could not proceed on the next set of high risk list reports until all Member requests--just think if a Member requested GAO to examine alien abductions--not only had been staffed, but had been completed. On large jobs, it may take well over a year to do the work. 
I know from my long service on the Governmental Affairs Committee that Members often disagree with GAO's conclusions on a particular report. That has happened to me more than once. But if we demand objectivity, and I think all of us do, then we must give GAO the independence and authority they need to do the job. We want them to be able to investigate mismanagement or fraud wherever it exists. 
I regret that this committee did not see fit to consult with GAO's authorizing committee before slipping this provision in a massive bill at the last moment. I know that I, during my chairmanship of the Governmental Affairs Committee, would at least have consulted with the Armed Services Committee if we were going to act on legislation affecting title 10. 
For these reasons, I will do all I can to strike this provision from this bill and I would hope my colleagues on both committees would join with me.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I am pleased the committee has adopted an amendment Senator McCain and I have offered which requires the General Services Administration to conduct a Federal screening of property conveyed by the Department of Defense. This amendment also requires that GSA provide Congress with a statement of value for any real property which is conveyed by the Department of Defense. 
This provision will codify a process which started when I was chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, and which was continued by Senator McCain when he was chairman. I congratulate and thank Senator Inhofe and Senator Robb for accepting this amendment. In previous years, this informal process sought to ensure that taxpayer's interests were partially protected, by conducting an expedited 30-day screen conducted by the General Services Administration for other Federal interest of each proposed land conveyance in the defense authorization bill. Because these land conveyance provisions implicitly waive the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, the committee cannot assure taxpayers that the Federal Government is not seeking to acquire property that is similar to what the legislative provisions are giving away. 
Now, Mr. President, some have suggested that screening this property for Federal interest is just a bureaucratic procedure that delays the productive use of property which the member in his or her judgment believes to be the best interest of his or her constituents. Others have suggested that this process is a waste of time because the expedited screening policy implemented by Senator McCain and myself never resulted in property being flagged for other Federal use. 
I would like to address each of these points. 
First, Federal screening is the law of the land. If Congress, and the Armed Services Committee in particular, believe that it is no longer necessary, the appropriate action is to amend the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act. 
Now let me explain why Federal screening of excess property makes sense. I ask unanimous consent to insert in the Record, at the conclusion of my remarks, a chart provided by the General Services Administration entitled, `Recent Examples of Excess Real Property Screened by GSA with Federal Agencies and Subsequently Transferred to other Federal Agencies for Continued Federal Use.' 
 Mr. President, this chart shows why Federal screening of excess property saves taxpayer dollars. The chart lists five examples, including two from the Department of Defense, where excess property from one agency was transferred to another Federal agency as a result of the screening process. The total value of property in these five examples is almost $36 million. What this means, Mr. President, is that the screening process saved Federal taxpayers $36 million because the receiving agencies were able to utilize property which the holding agency no longer needed. 
I would expect that my colleagues who speak of the importance of balancing the budget and are so-called deficit hawks would be interested in the result of GSA's valuation of these properties. 
So to conclude, I am pleased that the committee has accepted this amendment. As a result I do not intend to offer the amendment I have filed on the individual land conveyance provisions. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this provision is retained in conference.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of an amendment offered by my colleagues, Messrs. Cochran and Durbin, to correct a significant deficiency in our export licensing system. 
I will speak today of the current practice of allowing the export from the United States of high-powered, dual-use computers--machines that until very recently were called supercomputers--without any prior U.S. Government assessment of their end uses or end users. The amendment takes a significant step to correct this problem--not by banning the export of such machines, but merely by requiring exporters to obtain an individual validated export license before exporting them from the United States or reexporting them from elsewhere. 
The amendment specifically requires a license for the export of computers with a composite theoretical performance level equal to or greater than 2,000 million theoretical operations per second [MTOPS], when such machines are destined to a group of countries that now receive such computers--up to a level of 7,000 MTOPS--without U.S. Government end use or end user checks. 
The specific group of controlled countries--the so-called `Tier 3' countries--is described as follows in the Bureau of Export Administration's Report to Congress for Calendar Year 1996: `* * * countries posing proliferation, diversion or other security risks.' So we are dealing here with certain countries that our government, on the basis of all the information at its disposal, has determined pose risks to our security.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to speak as a cosponsor of the amendment offered by my colleagues, Messrs. Bingaman, Levin, Lugar, Domenici, and others, to restore $60 million to the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program, $25 million to the Department of Energy's Materials Protection Control and Accounting [MPC&A] Program, and $50 million to the International Nuclear Safety Program. The administration requested these funds because they are needed to serve our national security interests. I have heard or seen nothing to dispute this basic conclusion and therefore strongly support the full requested amounts. 
These funds serve our interests because they work to alleviate one of the gravest national security threats facing our nation. Acknowledged by the President and Congress, by liberals and conservatives, by the House and the Senate, by Republicans and Democrats alike--indeed by all thinking Americans--this threat arises from the dangers all of us would face from the further erosion of Russia's ability to protect its weapons-usable nuclear materials and the technology and dual-use goods needed to produce them. In light of this broad national consensus, I find it hard to understand why we are here today debating a proposal to slash the funds for the programs designed to alleviate this very threat. 
Congress should, of course, give close scrutiny to all Federal programs to see if further economies can be made. No one should look upon the Nunn-Lugar program as immune from vigorous congressional oversight. But when one considers the magnitude of the potential threats our country faces from these deadly materials, and considers these threats in light of the genuine progress that has been made (thanks to Nunn-Lugar) in reducing clear and present nuclear dangers in the former Soviet Union, it should be clear to all that Congress has, if anything, short-changed this program rather than over-funded it. 
I find these proposed cuts all the more remarkable given the committee's apparent determination to shovel hundreds of millions of additional taxpayer dollars at the National Missile Defense Program, despite the disturbing implications of that program for the future of the Antiballistic Missile [ABM] Treaty, and despite any serious accounting for precisely how these additional funds will be spent. 
In 1991, a far-sighted bipartisan coalition gathered to support a proposal offered by our colleagues, Messrs. Nunn and Lugar, to curb present and potential future proliferation threats emanating from the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1997, there continues to be a strong consensus both in Congress and across America that it is in our collective national interest to address these threats. Some misinformed commentators have attacked the CTR and MPC&A programs as a form of `subsidy of Russia's nuclear security' or `foreign aid.' Perhaps what the critics fear most is that the programs might actually succeed in achieving their ambitious goals, and thereby reduce the need for our government to spend additional billions more to address these grave foreign threats. 
I will leave it for others to speculate further about what must be motivating critics of the Nunn-Lugar program--and some of these criticisms might occasionally even be on target--but I remain convinced that the modest funds our country is allocating to CTR and MPC&A efforts are not only well within our means, but vital to our long-term national security and nonproliferation interests. And these funds are truly modest, compared against the billions we continue to spend on such programs as the B-2, the ever-expanding National Missile Defense program, the airborne and space-based laser programs, and other dubious programs that are well funded in the present bill. A $135 million cut to these Nunn-Lugar activities is the last thing this program needs. What, after all, has the program already accomplished? 
The CTR Program has worked and continues to work to ensure that significant numbers of strategic Soviet nuclear weapons will not be available for use against the United States and its friends and allies around the world. The program has worked to help reduce the risk of nuclear materials finding their way into black markets in unstable regions around the world. The program has worked to facilitate the removal of all nuclear weapons from Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakstan. The program has worked to help remove over 1,400 nuclear warheads from Russia's strategic weapons systems, and to eliminate hundreds of delivery vehicles for such systems, including submarine launched ballistic missile launchers, ICBM silos, and strategic bombers. 
The committee has claimed that the CTR Program can be cut because the loss could be made up with prior years' funds. Yet, Defense Secretary Cohen wrote to the chairman of the committee on June 19 that `All unobligated CTR funds have already been earmarked for specific projects'. The CTR Program continues to serve the national interest by helping to eliminate strategic arms programs in Russia and Ukraine--if anything, Congress should be debating today measures to accelerate these efforts rather than to chop them back. The committee's proposal would only work to convert the CTR Program into a competitive threat renewal program. 
A few years before Congress made the mistake of eliminating the Office of Technology Assessment, that organization produced an excellent report entitled, `Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction: Assessing the Risks' (OTA-ISC-559, August 1993). On page 6 of that report, readers will find the following unambiguous finding: 
`Obtaining fissionable nuclear weapon material (enriched uranium or plutonium) today remains the greatest single obstacle most countries would face in the pursuit of nuclear weapons.' 
Those were OTA's words, `the greatest single obstacle' to proliferation. Now, what kept Saddam from getting the bomb sooner than he could have? Access to special nuclear material. What is America's leading defense against future nuclear terrorism? Limiting access to special nuclear materials. We should not be cutting programs that help Russia to serve our common interest in limiting international trafficking in special nuclear materials. We should instead be reaffirming and even 
expanding such programs. Helping Russia to serve our interest in these ways is not foreign aid, it is part and parcel of our national defense strategy. 
The MPC&A programs run by the Department of Energy work specifically on this problem of enhancing controls over these special nuclear materials, plutonium and highly enriched uranium. I have seen the letter that the Energy Secretary sent to the chairman of the committee on June 19--Secretary PenAE6a wrote that the proposed $25 million cut in the MPC&A program would lead to a 2-year delay in achieving key program objectives. This program deserves our full support. After all, as Secretary Pena says, this program has secured `tens of tons' of nuclear material at 25 sites, and is working on enhanced controls at a total of 50 sites where this material is at risk in Russia, the Newly Independent States, and the Baltics. When we consider that we are dealing with a problem involving hundreds of tons of such material, it hardly seems wise for us now to be cutting back on our efforts to address this formidable threat to our national security. 
Another program cut by the committee is the International Nuclear Safety Program. That program is essentially an investment to reduce the risk that fallout from a future Russian nuclear reactor accident will not once again--only a few years after the disastrous Chernobyl accident--be falling down from the sky on United States citizens and other people around the world. There is no fallout defense initiative--or FDI, so to speak--in this bill that would offer any shield over our country or the territory of our allies against such radioactive debris from a future reactor explosion in Russia. The best initiative of this nature is the one in this amendment, to restore the funds needed to enhance the safety and security of certain old Soviet-designed power reactors in the Newly Independent States and Russia. 
So, in conclusion, I believe that the bipartisan consensus behind Nunn-Lugar, which is represented in this bipartisan amendment offered today, is alive and well because it addresses genuine threats to our security. I hope all Members will support full funding for these programs.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, section 1040 of the fiscal year 1998 DOD authorization bill (S. 936) amends title 31 of the United States Code to effectively prevent the General Accounting Office [GAO] from conducting self-initiated audits--work performed under GAO's inherent authority without a formal Member request--unless all congressional requests then-pending have been completed. 
Since 1921, the Comptroller General has had broad authority to evaluate programs and investigate--on his own initiative--`all matters relating to the receipt, disbursement, and use of public money.' Self-initiated authority has provided GAO the flexibility to pursue critical issues that auditors and investigators uncover in the course of their work. It is essential to the maintenance of generally accepted standards of independence and impartiality. 
Title 31 is under the purview of the Governmental Affairs Committee [GAC], which has jurisdiction over GAO's organization, management, and authority. It represents a major policy shift in the role and operation of GAO, adopted without benefit of any hearings, legislative record, or prior consultation with GAC. 
At GAC's June 17, 1997, reconciliation markup, Senators Levin, Glenn, Thompson, and Domenici discussed this provision and indicated their strong reservations. Following that markup, Chairman Thompson and Senator Glenn sent a letter to the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee [SASC] requesting a sequential referral of the bill for the purpose of reviewing this provision as contained in title X. We were unable to get the consent needed for such a referral.

 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, next week the eyes of the world will be focused on Hong Kong when the British dependent territory reverts to Chinese control. The end result of a negotiated agreement between the United Kingdom and China, the reversion itself is widely accepted and not a matter of controversy. Nevertheless, how China will handle the dynamic and thriving territory of Hong Kong in the near and longer term future is a matter of great interest, and of considerable difference of opinion. 
I count myself among those who are cautiously, I underscore cautiously, optimistic about the future of Hong Kong. The principle reason for my cautious optimism is a belief that, in this area, China will be guided primarily by consideration of its economic self interest. Many have likened Hong Kong to the goose that laid the golden egg. That characterization is well deserved. Simply put, China has an enormous stake in continued economic growth and prosperity in Hong Kong. Over the last several years, economic growth in Hong Kong has averaged 5 to 6 percent a year; Hong Kong is now the eighth largest trader in the world; and its GDP of almost $24,000 per capita exceeds that of several western industrialized nations. Hong Kong is an international business and financial center. The Hong Kong and Chinese economies are already intertwined and codependent. Hong Kong is a source of substantial investment in China and a conduit for Chinese exports around the world. 
To a large extent the Chinese leadership has staked its legitimacy and its future on the ability to bring growth to China's economy and an improving standard of living to its people. Over the next 5 years China will have to find jobs for an estimated 216 million new or displaced workers. Reason would argue that China simply cannot afford to substantially tamper with the economic growth engine that is Hong Kong. 
In addition to the negative economic consequences of mishandling the Hong Kong reversion, China has other incentives to try hard to make things work. China has advertised the Hong Kong one country-two systems principle as a model for any potential future discussions on reunification of Taiwan with the mainland. While it's still unclear whether or not this is even a feasible proposition, you can be sure if things do not go well in Hong Kong, any possibility of talks with Taiwan on reunification will continue to remain remote for the foreseeable future. Finally, the success or failure of the Hong Kong transition will have a substantial impact on United States-Chinese bilateral relations, as well as on the worldwide perception of China. 
Having outlined the reasons for my optimism, I must now explain why I temper that optimism with a healthy dose of caution. I am not sure, Mr. President, that the leadership in Beijing understands what it takes to nurture the robust and thriving socioeconomic system of Hong Kong, particularly the relationship between the political and economic spheres. I am not sure that the Chinese leadership will necessarily favor their economic interests over political or perceived security interests, if the two sets of interests collide. 
The record of the period of preparation for reversion is mixed. Hong Kong continues to thrive economically and business confidence remains high. China has agreed to Hong Kong's continued membership in international institutions as a separate entity and to the continuation of Hong Kong's experienced and professional civil service. On the other hand, China's decision to replace the elected legislature, Legco, with an appointed provisional legislature and certain statements by Chinese officials concerning definition of freedom of the press have caused considerable unease among Hong Kong's democratic political organizations, in the United States and in Britain. 
The great unanswered question is whether the Chinese leadership will be willing and able to effectively implement the one country-two systems model, preserving Hong Kong's economic prosperity as well as the political freedoms the people began to enjoy under British rule. If alternatively, they begin to roll back the political freedoms and individual liberties, in my view, the economy will not be immune, and they may well end up sacrificing that fabled golden goose. 
We may not know the answer to that question for several years. As I said earlier, the eyes of the world will be on Hong Kong next week. But, those eyes will not be taken off Hong Kong on July 2. You can be sure the world will continue to watch China's stewardship of Hong Kong with intense interest for many years. 
And, we shouldn't just watch. The United States should do everything it can to support the people of Hong Kong. The United States should encourage China to see and understand that its own interests are best served by maintaining true autonomy for Hong Kong. Anything less would be a failure.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to cosponsor the Regulatory Improvement Act of 1997. This legislation, introduced today by my colleagues Senator Carl Levin and Senator Fred Thompson, reflects a bipartisan effort to establish a balanced, comprehensive governmentwide standard for Federal rulemaking. 
As former chairman and current ranking member of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, I have worked for over a decade to improve the Federal regulatory process. I must note that with me at every step has been my good friend and colleague, Senator Carl Levin. Now, we are joined by our new Committee Chairman, Senator Fred Thompson. I am very happy to take part in this bipartisan effort. 
Regulatory reform has seen many forms in Congress over the years, from S. 1080 over 15 years ago, to several bipartisan bills in the 104th Congress--S. 291, our unanimous Governmental Affairs Committee bill introduced by Senator Roth and me, the Dole-Johnston S. 343, and the Glenn-Chafee S. 1001. While these bills differed in many ways, they all had one thing in common, a bipartisan resolve to reform the Federal regulatory process. 
The regulatory process is important because in our system of government, Congress relies on agency regulations to ensure the effective implementation of the laws we enact. Improved public health and safety and environmental protection are some of the successes provided by this process. 
Unfortunately, despite these successes, congressional oversight has shown there are too many instances where agencies have regulated without sufficiently analyzing the costs and benefits of regulation. Individuals, businesses, and State and local governments pay too high a price for such thoughtless rules. They also are often burdened by statutory requirements that force agencies to impose overly prescriptive requirements, unnecessary unfunded mandates, or unjustified costs. 
So, while I have supported many programs to improve health and safety and the environment, I have also worked to improve the regulatory process. This has involved legislation and oversight in several different areas. For example, the Paperwork Reduction Act, which we strengthened in 1995, requires Federal agencies to reduce burdensome information collection activities, such as forms and regulatory reporting requirements. The Unfunded Mandates Act of 1994, which I introduced with Senator Dirk Kempthorne, requires Congress and Federal agencies to account for unfunded legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on State and local governments. Most recently, I supported enactment of the Congressional Review Act, which provides for expedited congressional review of new regulations, so that we, as politically accountable public representatives, can take responsibility for implementation of the laws we enact. 
These initiatives addressed several parts of the administrative process. Still lacking is a comprehensive statutory framework for regulatory analysis. The search for the right mix of these regulatory analysis requirements was at the heart of the regulatory reform debate in the early 1980's, in the last Congress, and now again, in the legislation introduced today. 
I believe that this legislation would establish the needed reforms in a balanced and fair manner. It would require cost/benefit analysis and risk assessment of major rules, and 
require periodic review of existing rules. These basic requirements will improve regulatory decisionmaking and ensure that Congress and the public are better informed about regulatory impacts. 
I believe that such regulatory reform can improve our Government and reduce regulatory burdens without harming important public protections. As I said many times during the debate in the last Congress, true regulatory reform must strike a balance between the public's concern over too much government and the public's strong support for regulations to protect the environment, public health and safety. The legislation developed by Senator Levin and Senator Thompson strikes this balance. It requires: 
Cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment of major rules; An agency cost justification statement to explain whether a rule's benefits justify its costs and whether it is more cost-effective or has more net benefits than other alternatives. If the agency cannot make that determination, it must explain why not, and if feasible describe an alternative that would, if permitted, be cost justified; peer review of cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments; OMB regulatory review, with sunshine protections for fairness and accountability; judicial review of relevant regulatory analyses, but only in the context of review of the final rule and the rulemaking record; and periodic review of existing rules. 
All in all, I believe these are the necessary core elements of an effective regulatory reform bill. Nonetheless, past debates have shown that the devil is in the details. This legislation will be no exception. There are several areas, in fact, that I believe should be examined closely in committee hearings to ensure that the regulatory process is improved and not impeded by this reform effort. 
First, the legislation's most fundamental provision is the requirement that all agency major rules must have a cost-benefit analysis. I believe that given 16 years experience with regulatory review under Presidential Executive order, it is appropriate to establish a statutory bottom line that all major rules must be accompanied by a cost-benefit analysis. While a cost-benefit analysis should not control decisionmaking, it is a very useful tool for decision-making, and should be used to the extent both practical and permitted. 
We need to be sure, however, that this requirement is not used to undermine program-specific statutory requirements that may, for example, preclude consideration of certain costs or alternatives. While I believe that a cost-benefit analysis should be done to inform every major rulemaking decision, if a statute requires a certain approach to decisionmaking, the agency has to be bound by that requirement. 
I think it will be very important to discuss this issue during committee hearings and decide whether the bill's formulation is sufficient. A more explicit savings clause may be needed. While we want to improve decision-making, we do not want paralysis by analysis. And we do not want to create new avenues for litigation to undermine statutory requirements. If there is a problem with a statute, Congress should be informed and Congress should correct the problem. 
The bill's second basic requirement is for evaluating the risks that would be addressed by a major rule. This is also a fundamental provision, but here too, I believe it will be very important to explore the bill's specific risk assessment language in more detail during committee hearings. For example, while science can provide critical data with which to inform a rulemaking decision, often times general observations cannot be reliably reduced to single point conclusions. Thus, I am concerned that the bill's use of the phrase `most plausible estimate of risk' could lead to the arbitrary selection of a single risk figure, when a range of risks is all that the scientific evidence would support. I agree that agencies should not be led by speculation, but we must not lose sight of the fact that caution is always in order when it comes to protecting public health and safety, and the environment. 
Finally, committee hearings will also be needed to explore the practical impact of the legislation's requirements for agency advisory panels, both for peer review of regulatory analyses and identifying current rules for review. These panels can provide a fair and effective means of providing important information to agencies. But they can also be used to unfairly sway decision-makers and obscure behind-the-scenes lobbying. Care must be taken to ensure that such panels are broadly representative and do not introduce undue delay or waste agency resources. Again, our committee hearings will be important to discuss these issues. 
Senator Levin and Senator Thompson are to be commended for the work they have done to sift through the contentious regulatory reform record and draw out the core requirements and many of the needed details for effective regulatory analysis. I believe we are very close to having a bill that should pass the Senate unanimously. I support this legislation and urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity today to support my colleagues, Senators Kerry and Wellstone, in cosponsoring this much needed reform of our campaign finance system. I believe that simple principles should be applied in our democracy. We should encourage the active participation of the greatest possible number of citizens and restrain the undue influence of narrow and divisive factions and special interests. 
I believe that our democracy must be built on common rather than special interests and that our elections should depend upon common sense rather than dollars and cents. Only through an open and fair election system can we guarantee that our democracy will be open and fair. Only then can the notion of consent of the governed have any true meaning. 
I believe that many of the statements made here today underscore the need to reform our current system. I have been working with Senators Kerry and Wellstone to provide a workable alternative that will go a long way toward bringing long overdue improvements to our electoral process. 
Let's face facts. Our current system of paying the bills for American elections is awash in money, largely unregulated and often unreported. The improvements made a generation ago to provide partial public financing for presidential campaigns and contribution and spending limits for all federal elections have been eroded and are now overwhelmed by Supreme Court decisions, overly partisan competition for money, increased costs of advertising and special interest contributions. Nothing undermines the legitimacy and integrity of our elections more than the belief that special interests have special privileges. 
Many American voters believe that campaigns are too expensive, that special interests wield too much influence, while the average voter has too little, and that elected officials spend too much time raising money and not enough time solving the Nation's problems. 
The McCain-Feingold proposal to provide voluntary campaign spending limits is supported by a number of Senators and I am pleased to be a cosponsor. However, even with the much needed improvements in that legislation, I believe that the only way to eliminate any doubt about who influences elections is to provide financing underwritten by the American people. 
The Clean Money, Clean Elections Act built upon the plan proposed in Maine would limit campaign spending, prohibit special interest contributions to candidates, eliminate fund raising efforts, provide equal funding and a level playing field for all candidates, and end many of the loopholes that have wrecked our current system. 
Let's end this current abuse and establish a system that leaves no doubt that only the clean money of the American people pays for American elections. 
Building on that Maine ballot initiative, nearly 20 States are now reviewing how they can improve their elections. Federal legislation is needed to bring these reforms to Federal elections and we propose to bring those improvements into the congressional debate on campaign finance reform. 
This proposal will provide: 
The most comprehensive reform of all the proposals currently under consideration; the lowest spending limits: the most free time and discounted media; the strictest limits on special interest money and influence; the most competitive election financing; an end to the money chase and dialing for dollars. 
As the Nation's attention turns to the campaign finance investigation in the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, I want everyone to understand that highlighting these issues will be of little use if action is not taken. Certainly, the investigation should be conducted in a full and fair manner. But at the end of day, I believe that we owe it to ourselves as a people to end our current campaign finance system and bring true reform. 
I am pleased to join my colleagues who are long time advocates of serious campaign finance reform and look forward to working together to enact this important legislation.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I want to voice my very strong objections to the 2000 census language in this bill. It bans the use of sampling--and any other statistical technique--to count the American population for purposes of apportionment. It's unfair--it will cost the American tax payers about a billion dollars--it's political--it just doesn't make sense. 
Let's talk about fairness. Without sampling, the Census bureau tells us that the 2000 census may be about as accurate as the 1990 census. That's the best case scenario. But in 1990, the census missed 10 million people. It counted 6 million people twice. And it counted another 10 or 20 million people in the wrong place--maybe even in the wrong congressional district. Is that our idea of fairness? Is that our idea of `one man, one vote?' 
And many of the people undercounted in the last census are poor. Many of them belong to ethnic and racial minorities. We excluded some of America's most vulnerable people from the democratic process. Is that our idea of fairness? Of course not. But that's the kind of census we will have if this language passes into law. 
Let's talk about cost. The Census Bureau tells us that a non-sampling census could cost almost a billion dollars more than a non-sampling census. Much of that additional cost will go toward various efforts that the Bureau knows will have only marginal pay-off. But if the Bureau can't sample, it will have to make every effort--even marginally effective efforts--to count people the traditional way. Without sampling, we're talking about a higher cost census to deliver a less accurate population count. Is that a responsible use of tax payer dollars? Does that make sense at the precise moment in time when both Congress and the American people are committed to the painful process of balancing the budget? 
And let's talk about common sense. Statistical sampling is a rigorous, reliable, scientific tool. You can't find a statistician who disagrees with that. That view is supported by GAO, the Commerce inspector general, the National Academy of Sciences, and a host of professional organizations. 
The Bureau has been using statistical sampling in the decennial census for decades. The census long form--which goes to only one in six households--is a perfect example of a kind of sampling that is widely accepted. Virtually every arm of Government--Federal, State, and local--uses long-form data for enforcement of laws like the Voting Rights Act and for tailoring programs to the cultural diversity of our population. And we are not plagued with law suits challenging the reliability of this data because it is based on sampling. 
Ironically, the language in this bill would allow continued use of sampling for the long-form. In fact, it allows sampling for every purpose except that most important one--counting the American people for purposes of apportionment. On the one hand, it acknowledges that sampling is valid and valuable--a scientific tool. But on the other hand, it denies us the use of that tool just where it would be most valuable. That makes no sense at all. 
Finally, despite what I read in the newspapers, I have seen no data whatsoever validating the apparent political assumption that an accurate census means fewer House seats for Republicans. It is true--as I have already stated--that many of the undercounted people are poor or members of minority groups. But other groups are undercounted, too. We undercount people in rural areas--that's a third of the 1990 undercount--and many of those areas are Republican strongholds. We undercount people who are renters rather than homeowners, and statisticians tell us that disadvantages the Sun Belt States--where Republicans are also strong. Just last week the 2000 Census Advisory Committee discussed the politics of the undercount. That committee consists of census and population experts representing the statistical community, every level of Government, and every large minority group. The committee was unable to determine who would be the political winners and losers in an accurate census. 
This isn't about Democrats versus Republicans. We undercount people of every race, gender, age, State, and political persuasion. The real winners and losers in the sampling debate are the American people. Our system of Government guarantees equal representation for all Americans--regardless of race, ethnicity or economic circumstances--whether they live in the country or the city--whether they own their homes or rent them. That should be our goal--our only goal--in planning the 2000 census. 
In my home State of Ohio, we had a slight overcount in 1990. But I don't fear the political consequences of an accurate census. My commitment is to the fundamental principles of America's system of Government. And I'm confident that the citizens of Ohio feel the same way. Give us a fair, accurate census, and let the political chips fall where they may. 
I know full well that the Census Bureau's plan to use sampling is highly controversial. I have some reservations about it myself. Some people say that sampling doesn't meet the constitutional requirement for an `actual enumeration.' Some say that sampling is inherently subjective because it is based on statistical assumptions. These are questions that must be resolved. 
On the constitutional issue, however, the Governmental Affairs Committee recently heard testimony from a panel of attorneys who are not friends of sampling. The panel included Wisconsin's Attorney General James Doyle. He led the charge against sampling in 1990 because statistical adjustment of that census would have given California an additional House seat at Wisconsin's expense. We also heard from Stuart Gerson, the Assistant Attorney General who advised the Bush administration not to adjust the 1990 census. Both testified that the constitutional requirement for an `actual enumeration' doesn't require a headcount. What it requires--what the Framers intended--is the most accurate census possible. That's what we should be aiming for. And those who tell us that sampling is inherently unconstitutional are trying to scare us into a census process that doesn't meet the Framers' goal. 
What's critical right now is for census to continue its planning process--continue to appear before congressional committees--as it is doing before the Governmental Affairs Committee--and continue to explain its plans. Most importantly, the Bureau must test the proposed census plan in the 1998 dress rehearsal. Only after this process is complete will we know whether sampling will yield a better census--a census that includes every American. The census language in this bill would make that impossible. 
My heart goes out to all the Americans who are counting on us for the disaster relief this bill will provide. I want to give them that relief. It is extremely regrettable that in our legislative process this has also become a bill that jeopardizes the most fundamental principle of our Democratic society--every American's right to equal representation. If the census language in this bill passes Congress today, it will add to the other reasons that may persuade the President to veto the bill--and send it right back to us. Then perhaps we can get on with the job of providing relief to the thousands of people who are counting on us, and let the Census Bureau get on with planning the best decennial census in American history.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the important resolution before us today, the concurrent budget resolution. This is truly a remarkable occasion. We are considering the outlines of a plan that will balance the budget over the next 5 years. 
This bipartisan proposal achieves a number of important accomplishments. The most significant of course is balancing the budget by 2002. I believe that the Budget Committee Chairman Domenici and ranking member Lautenberg have done an outstanding job in their work to bring this agreement to the floor of the Senate. 
Without a constitutional amendment, this agreement will balance a budget that has been the focal point of national debate and a goal supported by most every candidate for President and Senator for at least as long as I have been in office. 
Four years ago we proposed cutting the budget deficit in half. After many difficult and contentious votes, Senate Democrats along with a tie breaking vote from Vice-President Gore helped enact a program that set us on a course of real deficit reduction. Many criticized that effort and predicted economic disaster. But now after 4 years of economic growth and reduced deficits we are in a position to finish the job. After 4 years, our deficit has been reduced from $290 billion down to $67 billion. 
This proposal outlines a plan to extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund for at least a decade. It will expand beneficiaries' choice of private health plans by allowing preferred provider plans and provider sponsored plans to compete in the managed care programs in Medicare. Additional preventive health benefits are provided and beneficiary copayments for outpatient services are limited. Part B premiums are maintained at 25 percent of program costs and any increases necessary for home health care benefits are phased in over 7 years. Low income seniors are protected from any potential home health premium increases. 
In order to ensure that important areas of service are adequately protected this agreement identifies priorities such as education reform, Pell grants, child literacy, and Head Start. 
Two very important initiatives are anticipated in this agreement. The first provides $16 billion to expand health coverage to up to 5 million children who do not now have health insurance. The second revises last year's welfare reform to restore necessary benefits to disabled immigrants. I believe that the President's initiatives on these issues are commendable. 
Although important progress is made in this agreement, I want to make clear that I have a number of concerns. 
I have worked on and voted on budget agreements before and I recognize some of the pitfalls. My first concern is the question of tax cuts. If the first priority of this agreement is to balance the budget, I do not believe that we should make that job any harder. This agreement calls for a net tax cut of $85 billion over 5 years. Why can't we eliminate these cuts and balance the budget sooner? Why can't we apply those funds to establish a budget surplus and apply it to debt reduction?. Or at least, why can't we wait to determine if this agreement and its underlying assumptions prove successful? What happens to our deficit reduction and balanced budget efforts in the event of an economic downturn? There is no assurance that this agreement will be as successful as the one 4 years ago. 
I recognize that tax incentives have historically been employed to stimulate a sluggish economy. Although some may argue our economic growth could be even higher, last quarter's 5.6 percent growth is the highest in 10 years. The stock market is at record highs, a core inflation rate of 2.5 percent in the last year is the best in 30 years, the monthly unemployment rate of 4.9 percent is at a 25 year low. I am not convinced that this is time to use tax cuts to stimulate the economy. I believe that deficits should be reduced in good economic times. If tax cuts are to be used in good economic times what tools will we have in a less favorable economy? 
The tax cuts anticipated in this resolution are calculated to cost a net $85 billion over 5 years. I am concerned, however, that beyond the scope of the 5 year resolution the cost of these tax cuts will go even higher. Indeed the agreement expects that the 10 year cost will rise to $250 billion. 
Even though this agreement provides for a balanced budget in 2002, entitlement spending is expected to soar beyond the turn of the century. Yes, we improve the solvency of Medicare in this budget and put it on a firm footing for 10 years, but beyond that time frame Medicare costs will rise. This agreement continues to use the surplus provided by the Social Security system to reach a balance. Beyond the turn of the century the surpluses will provide retirements benefits for baby boomers. I am concerned that again we are putting off finding a solution to these problems when relatively small steps taken now can avoid much larger steps that will undoubtedly need to be taken later. 
During the consideration of the resolution I supported efforts to provide additional support for children without health insurance, additional support for early childhood development, and additional support to rebuild crumbling schools. Although we were unsuccessful on these amendments, this will not be the end of the work. Those battles will continue throughout the reconciliation and appropriations process and I am hopeful that we will have some success. 
Let me say further that I recognize that just because this agreement does not solve each and every problem is no reason to oppose it. The perfect then becomes the enemy of the good. Important progress is made here and although not perfect I intend to vote for the good.

 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I agree with a May 10, 1997, New York Times editorial regarding legislation to ban so-called partial-birth abortions and the alternatives to it which we are considering today in the Senate. The editorial states, 
These proposed bills, while well intentioned, still interfere in judgments best left to doctors and their patients. Some of the 40 states that have passed or are considering bans on `partial-birth' abortions have fallen into the same trap. Whether at the state or the Federal level, these political intrusions into medical practice and attempts to limit women's access to abortions deserve to be defeated. 
I am opposed to the Government making medical decisions that should be handled by qualified physicians on a case-by-case basis. During my 22 years in the Senate, I have voted to uphold the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe versus Wade decision that a woman's right to choose whether to have an abortion is protected, within specified limits, under the constitutional right to privacy. This means that a woman can make her own choice, based on her moral and religious beliefs and in consultation with her family, her physician, her priest, rabbi, minister, or whomever she chooses. I respect the heartfelt views of those who are opposed to abortion, but I do not believe they should be imposed on those who hold a different but equally firm conviction. 
Having said that, I did support Senator Feinstein's amendment as a substitute to the partial-birth abortion ban. Senator Feinstein's amendment would have banned postviability abortions, but like Roe versus Wade, it includes exceptions for cases where the attending physician makes a medical decision that the abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the woman or to avert serious adverse health consequences. As you know, under the provisions of Roe, States can pass such laws now. If this amendment had passed, I believe late-term abortions would remain available to women who need them for serious medical reasons. 
I opposed Senator Daschle's amendment because I believe its health exception could provide roadblocks to a woman seeking a late-term abortion for serious medical reasons. I have concerns about the constitutionality of the health exceptions in this amendment because they are more restrictive than those in Roe versus Wade. 
Mr. President, the American people overwhelmingly support the right of a woman to choose regarding abortion. This does not mean they are pro-abortion, it means they are pro-choice as I am. I urge my colleagues to oppose the partial-birth abortion ban, which is clearly unconstitutional, and to allow women and their physicians to make the best decisions based on each individual case.

 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, arson poses a serious but preventable threat to our society. This week, the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA] is launching a community-based campaign entitled, `Target Arson.' 
Developed by FEMA in conjunction with the National Arson Prevention Initiative, `Target Arson' will educate young people on the dangers of fire, the importance of parental control of access to matches and cigarette lighters, and the need for adults to set good examples for children. I have long been a supporter of efforts to prevent and combat arson. During my second term in the Senate, I sponsored legislation that was enacted that requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI] to include arson statistics in its Uniform Crime Reports. This legislation increased our ability to detect, prevent, and prosecute arson crimes. 
One out of four fires is intentionally set. More than 500,000 fires were set deliberately last year, over one-half of which were set by juveniles. These fires killed more than 500 people and caused approximately $1 billion in property damage. Through this education campaign, `Target Arson' will emphasize the 100 percent preventable nature of this offense. 
Mr. President, I join FEMA and its director, James Lee Witt, in supporting this important educational program. I urge my colleagues to support arson education in the schools in their States.

Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I commend my colleagues, Senator Stevens and Senator Hollings, for working out this amendment, because it will let the Census Bureau proceed with planning and testing of statistical sampling. 
We need the best possible information before making a final call on the design of the 2000 census. The language we have agreed upon, as my distinguished colleague from South Carolina has just said, will let us get that information and get it in good shape, I believe. Thousands of Americans are waiting for the disaster relief to be provided by the legislation on the floor today, and they need this money to rebuild their homes and their lives. I am very relieved we are working together to get this aid to those needy people. 
I know full well the Census Bureau's plan to use sampling is highly controversial. I do not like sampling any better than anybody else. The only problem is, there is no better way to get a more accurate count of all the people in this country than by using all the regular procedures we have used before plus the sampling. There is no better way, even though none of us like it. We wish it were a perfect situation where we could go out and count every single American, just like the Constitution says we are supposed to do. But, as Senator Hollings said just a moment ago here, you cannot do that. We normally do not get full returns on all the census reports. We wind up traditionally with about 10 percent of the people not sending returns back, even though census takers call multiple times on their domicile or their businesses. So we wind up having to do some sampling to get a more accurate census, and that is what the whole thing is all about. 
So, it is controversial. Some people say the sampling does not meet the constitutional requirement for an actual enumeration. Those are the words, `actual enumeration,' in the Constitution. Some say sampling is inherently subjective because it is based on statistical assumptions, as it has to be. 
We have been arguing about this ever since 1990, when post-census surveys showed that 1.6 percent of the population had been missed. That may not sound like a big figure, but it is big if you are laying out plans for Federal appropriations that have to apply to these certain areas. The Bush administration decided finally not to use sampling to adjust that census. They decided the census statistical adjustment plan had too many problems. Here we are 7 years later. I must admit that, like my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, I, too, have some reservations about sampling. 
But we have to remember that the Census Bureau is not looking at sampling because they think it is the ideal method. Quite the contrary, an accurate, direct count would be the best. The problem is, a direct count has never worked in the past. And every census is more difficult than the last one. That is because our population keeps getting larger. It is more mobile. It is more culturally diverse, while public cooperation keeps declining. That is why the bureau is looking at new approaches. 
A complete sampling ban would require the bureau to cancel current testing plans and contracts, and that would just waste money that has already been spent for good purposes. 
A complete ban would require hurried development of new plans for next year's Census Dress Rehearsal. That would waste more money. Finally, a complete ban would require hurried development of a new plan for conducting the 2000 census. That would require many more census takers and would cost a lot more money. This is the tragic part, it might lead to a much less accurate census, more 
 litigation, and more suspicion of Government. The language we have worked out prevents all that waste and keeps all our options open. At the same time, it lets the Census Bureau know the seriousness of our concerns. 
Let me tell you a little bit about the 2000 census--something the Governmental Affairs Committee is looking at right now. The census will set a new record as the largest peacetime mobilization in American history. The Bureau will hire 600,000 temporary workers, knock on 120 million doors, and count about 270 million people. 
By statute, the entire process has to play out smoothly over 9 months. The questions will begin on Census Day, April 1, and the results have to be given to Congress by December 31. Census Bureau officials tell us that, if they use sampling, they can keep the cost of the 2000 census down to about $4 billion, a little less than the 1990 cost of $25 per household. Without sampling, it will cost the taxpayers a whole lot more--perhaps as much as another billion dollars. 
Most important of all, the census is a highly serious enterprise. It is the process we use to make sure that every American--every American--is fairly represented in the governing of this great country. It is so fundamental to our democratic system that the Constitution specifically requires an actual enumeration of our population once every 10 years. 
These facts tell me that the decennial census calls for our very best thinking, our very best planning, and the very best scientific tools the statistical community has to offer. To quote the Commerce Inspector General: 
We continue to believe that, if carefully planned and implemented, sampling can be employed by the Bureau in the 2000 census to produce overall more accurate results than were produced in the 1990 census, at an acceptable cost. We further believe that the Congress should allow the Bureau the freedom to complete its work on sampling and then select the optimal census design based on all of the available information. According to the bureau's plan, fundamental work on all potential uses of sampling will be finished by December 1997. We do not believe an informed design decision can be made until this work is completed and the various design components are tested during the April 1998 dress rehearsal. 
I think the Commerce IG gave us some very good advice, because some hard facts have begun to emerge from the wealth of opinion about sampling. 
Fact: The Bureau has been using statistical sampling in the decennial census for decades. The census Long Form--which goes to only one in six households--is a perfect example of a kind of sampling that is widely accepted. If Congress bans sampling completely, we will not be able to use sampling for the Long Form any more. But the information gathered by the Long Form is still required by law. So we will have to send the Long Form to every single household across the country. And the American taxpayers will have to foot the bill. 
Another fact: It is inherently impossible to count everybody correctly the traditional way. All the experts agree on that. There will never be enough time or money. There will always be people not at home no matter how many times the census taker calls. When President George Washington received the first census data in 1790, he also got an estimate of the undercount. That has been the story ever since. In 1990, the census missed 10 million people. It counted 6 million people twice. And it counted another 10 or 20 million people in the wrong place. After that experience, everyone involved agreed that a better plan, a scientific plan, had to be developed for 2000. 
Another fact: The undercounted people are some of the most vulnerable in our society, minorities, poor people, both rural and urban, the non-English speaking, the homeless. These are the people we are excluding from the democratic process. 
Still another fact: Virtually all statisticians say that our scientific tools have been developed and tested to the point that we can finally fix the undercount problem. That view is supported by GAO, the Commerce IG, the National Academy of Sciences and a host of other professional organizations. 
Yes, 1990 sampling methods were flawed. That is precisely why the Census Bureau has spent 7 years developing a reliable plan for 2000. It is precisely why the Census Bureau needs to keep testing and planning, and it needs to go on with that right now and not have it cut off. 
What about the constitutional arguments? On April 16, at one of our committee's two recent hearings on the census, we heard testimony from Wisconsin's Attorney General James Doyle. He led the charge against sampling in 1990 because statistical adjustment of that census would have given California an additional House seat at Wisconsin's expense. Mr. Doyle testified recently:  
I think the Constitution requires that we make the best effort we can to an actual headcount, and I recognize that is a very complex task, and I recognize that within that task, we have to leave a good deal of discretion to the Census Bureau to, in fact, make some counts where you are not actually counting actual human beings. 
For example, you go to a locked apartment building and you go back there 5, 6, 7 times. At some point, somebody has to make a reasonable estimate on how many people are in that locked apartment building, and there are other kinds of procedures that the Census Bureau has built up over time to try to build that accuracy. 
So I recognize that there has to be a good deal of discretion given to do things other than summon everybody to Bethlehem and count how many people are there. 
At the same hearing, we also heard testimony from Stuart Gerson, the Assistant Attorney General who advised the Bush administration not to adjust the 1990 census. 
Mr. Gerson said, and remember, this is a person who advised against sampling in the Bush administration: 
Whatever an enumeration means, it does mean an accurate count and that should be our guideline--it does appear that the Constitution would permit a statistical adjustment if it would contribute to an accurate count. 
Note the caveat: `if it would contribute to an accurate count.' Both of those legal experts agree, and again, one of them led the fight against adjustment in 1990, that the key to the constitutional requirement for an `actual enumeration' is accuracy. They both agree that sampling is legally acceptable under two conditions: The Census Bureau has to make a good faith effort to count everybody the traditional way; and the Bureau has to demonstrate that sampling improves accuracy. 
Let us look at whether the Census Bureau's plan can meet those requirements. The plan itself was described in our committee hearing of March 11. We heard from Commerce Secretary William Daley, from Ev Ehrlich, the Commerce Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, and from Martha Richey, Director of the Census Bureau. As they explained, the first proposed use of sampling is to help count people who don't send back their census questionnaires by mail. The Bureau won't even start this sampling until after they have first made the greatest effort in the history of census-taking to convince Americans to send back their questionnaires. 
First, questionnaires will be mailed to every household found on the combined Census/Postal Service national address list. To insure the most complete national address list possible, the Bureau will also get several updates from local governments. Every household in America will get precensus letters and post-mailout reminders. Questionnaires will be available in town halls, post offices, 
community centers, and even stores. And finally, the Bureau plans an aggressive outreach campaign of school presentations, community meetings and paid advertising--all to give every single American every possible opportunity to participate and be counted in the time-honored way. I would say that passes the first test of constitutionality, a good faith effort to do an actual head count. 
Even with all this effort, experts project that only 65 percent of the American public will be counted using these methods. Our population is just too big, too mobile, too diverse, and too apt to ignore Government requests for information--even when it is this important. 
The question for the Bureau is, how do we count that last 35 percent? As the lawyers have told us, the Constitution and Federal law require our best effort. 
The census plan is to follow up the mail process with a large sample of those who did not send back a questionnaire. That sample will be large enough to make sure that census takers contact at least 90 percent of the people in each census tract. Yes, that means census enumerators will go into communities, just as they always have, to count at least 90 percent of Americans in the traditional way, by headcount. Then, and only then, will statistics be used to estimate the last 10 percent of the population. 
What about the second constitutional requirement? Can the Bureau demonstrate that sampling improves accuracy? At our second oversight hearing on April 16, we heard testimony from Prof. Lawrence Brown of the Wharton Business School. He strongly opposed adjustment of the 1990 census based on the sampling plan the Bureau used to generate the `corrected' counts. Professor Brown didn't think the Bureau's sample was large enough, and he didn't think the statistical model was valid. But he told our committee last month that the Census Bureau's plan for 2000 addresses the concerns he had in 1990. He told us the Bureau's plan can work. And he told us we will again have an undercount if we do not use sampling. 
On the charge that sampling is inherently subjective, Professor Brown said: 
Certainly, there is some subjectivity in how the process is designed and how the analysis is--conducted. But if all of this planning is done in advance, it is very very hard for me to see how one could direct these subjective decisions towards any desired goal. 
Notice the caveat: `if all of this planning is done in advance. * * *' That is just what the Census Bureau proposes to do over the next year. And this new language we have agreed on today will permit that work to 
move ahead and still give Congress the final decision. 
As Professor Brown's testimony proved--even for experts who questioned sampling in 1990--the Census Bureau seems to be on the right track for 2000. At this point in time, it is very hard to find even one statistician who doesn't think that sampling should be able to improve the accuracy of the 2000 census. The Bureau is doing its research; it is testing its plans; and it is having its plans reviewed by experts. 
Everything the Governmental Affairs Committee has learned so far tells me we need to keep the sampling debate open. And we need to give the Census Bureau a fair hearing. To disrupt the planning process now would set the Bureau back a year or more. And it would lock the Bureau and the Congress into a traditional census that we know will cost much more and we know will be inaccurate. 
I have already told you that I have some personal reservations about sampling. I wish it were possible to get an actual head count directly on every single American. I am sure the American public has concerns as well. We all get survey calls at home, around dinner time, usually. We also know about polls--surveys that conclude one thing or another--often depending on who paid for the poll. We know all this. We know that surveys can be used in many different ways. So, we have to agree that the Census Bureau has a very heavy burden to prove to Congress and the American people that its survey methods are objective and scientifically sound, and that they will produce accurate, reliable information. The Constitution requires no less. 
What is critical right now is for census to continue its planning process--continue to appear before congressional committees--as it is doing before our committee--and continue to explain and review its plans. Only after this process is complete can we decide if the 2000 census will be a success. 
At this point in the debate, I am less worried about the constitutional and scientific issues than I am about the Census Bureau's management capacity. GAO and the Commerce IG agree with me on that. The viability of sampling depends on the Bureau's capacity to design and faithfully execute a good plan. Our debate here today proves that Congress is not yet sure of the Bureau's abilities. 
The Bureau has to give us more information. And we have to be willing to listen. The Bureau also has to show us that they have the management capacity to carry out a sampling plan if we approve it. These are the questions I think we should be focusing on. 
It is time for some plain talk--about the stakes involved here. Most of those people undercounted in last census were 
poor, and many of them belong to ethnic and racial minorities. We cannot tolerate any undercount. Our system of government guarantees equal representation for all Americans--regardless of race, ethnicity or economic circumstances--certainly regardless of political affiliation. I can only hope that my colleagues will not trade off this fundamental principle of democratic government for assumptions about partisan political advantage. 
Let me remind you about where the undercount is found. Look at the States that had high undercounts in 1990--New Mexico, 3.1 percent; Montana, 2.4 percent; Texas, 2.3 percent; Mississippi, 2.1 percent; Idaho, 2 percent. This is not a Democratic versus Republican issue. The undercount is a problem for every Member of this body. We undercount people in rural areas--that is a third of the 1990 undercount. We undercount people who are renters rather than homeowners. And we undercount over 12 percent of native Americans who live on reservations. 
Let's not throw away our opportunity to fix the undercount, without taking a good hard look at whether we have to and what are our options. Funding formulae, equal protection, civil rights, State and local planning, school building, targeted aid, business planning--almost every aspect of American life--would benefit from the best possible census in the year 2000. 
My heart goes out to all the Americans who are counting on us for the disaster relief this bill will provide. I want go give them that relief. I want to vote for this bill. So, I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment. I congratulate Senator Hollings, Senator Stevens, and their staff for working this out. Let the Census Bureau get on with planning what could be the best census, the finest census in American history. And let us get on with providing relief to those tens of thousands disaster victims who are counting on us. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to bring my colleagues' attention to a recent and very significant decision by a dispute settlement panel of the new World Trade Organization [WTO]. The case is extraordinarily complex and I congratulate Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky and her staff at USTR on their skillful handling of this matter on behalf of the United States. 
To summarize the issue, the United States, Mexico, Ecuador, Honduras, and Guatemala went to WTO dispute settlement seeking an end to an EU banana trade regime which discriminates against banana exports from certain Latin American countries and against certain United States and Latin American banana marketing companies. The EU regime has deprived Latin American countries of market share and export growth in the EU and has taken business away from United States and Latin American banana marketers, giving that business over to European marketing firms. 
The WTO panel's decision is a major victory for the United States and our Latin American partners in the case. The panel found that the EU banana regime is founded on over 20 violations of international trade agreements, including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT], the General Agreement on Trade in Services [GATS], and the Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures. 
This case has implications much broader than simply the banana trade. The United States has many, very contentious, on-going agricultural trade disputes with the EU, and for that reason U.S. agricultural interests have been watching the banana case with great interest. First, this case is an example of the successful use of WTO dispute settlement to resolve these agricultural trade issues. Further, according to the American Farm Bureau, the panel's report `helps establish clear parameters for the implementation of agricultural tariff rate quotas [TRQ's]. These parameters will help prevent TRQ's from becoming the very type of nontariff barrier the Uruguay Round sought to eliminate.' 
In addition, this case is the first test of the General Agreement on Trade in Services. The United States was instrumental in ensuring that GATS was included in the final Uruguay Round Agreement. It is in our interest to see the MFN and `national treatment' obligations, traditionally applied to goods in trade agreements, now extend to services, an increasingly important portion of U.S. foreign commerce. The panel decision in the banana case interprets broadly the GATS protections against government policies which discriminate against foreign service suppliers. This is an important precedent and a significant victory for U.S. interests. 
Once again, Mr. President, I complement USTR on a job well done and urge the administration to persevere through the inevitable appeal process, doing everything necessary to ensure that this important ruling is not undermined. I sincerely hope that, with the panel's decision in hand, a negotiated solution to end the discriminatory banana regime can be found. However, if not, the United States has a WTO-sanctioned right to retaliate, which we should not hesitate to invoke, if necessary, to achieve full EU conformity with the panel ruling in this case.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, this week our nation celebrates the 27th anniversary of Earth Day. In 1970, the inaugural year of Earth Day, the Nation's consciousness was raised about the plight of our environment. The Great Lakes were held up as some of the worst examples of human abuse; Lake Erie was given up for dead, the victim of unrestrained pollution and the misuse of its precious natural resources. The Cuyahoga River caught fire and phosphate-based soap suds washed up on shorelines throughout the Nation. The Great Lakes region responded to the alarm with unprecedented vigor. 
In 1971 I headed the Governor's Task Force on Environmental Protection in Ohio, a forerunner to today's Ohio EPA. In a spirit of regional cooperation, the surrounding States, Native American Tribes, and Canada entered into collective agreements that recognized the Great Lakes as a set of shared resources within a single ecosystem. Important environmental legislation was designed and implemented to combat pollution and clean up the environment. 
Since that time, water quality has improved dramatically and fisheries scientists are witnessing recovery of fish populations in each of the lakes. Lake Erie is experiencing rebounds in lake whitefish populations thought impossible just 10 years ago. This past summer, the Fish and Wildlife Service announced that lake trout populations in Lake Superior are now self-sustaining, needing no further stocking. There are many success stories in the Great Lakes, suggesting the ecological health of our lakes is on the mend, but the job is not yet complete. Degraded habitats, reduced fish and wildlife populations, and the threat from nonindigenous species still imperil the well being of our lakes. 
Today my colleague from the House of Representatives, Congressman La Tourette of Ohio, and I will introduce a bill into the House and Senate that will continue the recovery process of the Great Lakes and their associated natural resources. This bill, the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act of 1997 builds upon the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act of 1990. The 1990 act authorized the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to undertake a comprehensive study to first, assess the status of fishery resources and their habitats and second, to gauge the effectiveness of management strategies used to protect these resources. The study's findings recommend a definite course of action for the continued restoration of the region's natural resources. The full implementation of the strategic plan for management of Great Lakes fisheries and the institution of a comprehensive and standardized ecological monitoring system for all lakes are just 2 of 32 specific recommendations set forth by the study. 
The Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act represents a new generation of environmental legislation, one that recognizes the complexity and interrelatedness of ecosystems. This act seeks to address natural resource management in a comprehensive and conscientious manner by building partnerships among the Great Lakes States, United States and Canadian Governments, and Native American tribes. Through regional cooperation, I believe we can address the environmental and economic concerns of the Great Lakes basin and continue the recovery that began some 27 years ago. By supporting this legislation, we in the Congress will be taking the right next step toward responsible stewardship of the Great Lakes as we venture into the new millenium.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise with a great deal of pleasure and pride to inform my colleagues that the 1997 National Teacher of the Year is Sharon Draper, an English and language arts teacher at Walnut Hills High School in Cincinnati, OH. 
Ms. Draper won the 1997 Ohio Teacher of the Year Award and was selected from four finalists to the receive the Nation's top teacher award. President Clinton presented this award at a White House ceremony. 
In addition to her talents as a teacher, Ms. Draper is an accomplished award-winning author. Her novel `Tears of a Tiger' won the 1995 Corretta Scott King Genesis Award. Her second novel, `Forged By Fire,' has been recently published. 
Ms. Draper's dedication and outstanding commitment to education as well as her efforts to improve education are the envy of every school system and Ohio is justifiably proud of her accomplishment. 
At a time when our education is under a great deal of scrutiny and in need of much improvement, it is important to remember that there are many examples of educational excellence. Certainly one outstanding example is Sharon Draper. 
I had the opportunity to meet with Ms. Draper and it was an honor. I was at the White House to participate in the ceremony where she received the Teacher of the Year Award. 
Ms. Draper's 25-year teaching career has been filled with creativity and enthusiasm. I understand that she requires a research paper in her senior level classes. When her students turn in their paper the day before the prom she gives them a T-shirt that proclaims `I survived the Draper paper.' She says that she was probably born to be a teacher. 
I am pleased that the Council of Chief State School Officers and Scholastic, Inc., have selected Ms. Draper as Teacher of the Year. I know that her students, school, the city of Cincinnati, and our State are very proud. I congratulate Sharon, her husband Larry, and children Cory and Crystal for the contribution they have made to public education.

Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair, and I ask the Chair to please notify me when I have used 6 minutes. 
Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention with its 28 agreed conditions. 
So far in this century, we have witnessed the use of chemical weapons in Europe, in China and in the Middle East, and we have seen the absolutely revolting photographs of victims of chemical weapons attacks at the Iraqi village of Halabja and the Tokyo subway. Some of us may have seen the famous photograph of the great violinist, Isaac Stern, performing in Israel while wearing a gas mask during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. Let there be no doubt about it, these weapons do present a clear and present danger to our security and the security of our allies around the world. They have not acquired the nickname, `poor man's nukes' for nothing. They are cheap to make, easy to conceal, and can have devastating effects. 
Since 1995, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs has held six hearings titled `Global Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction,' which documented in vivid detail the gravity of the threat our country faces from both chemical and biological weapons. The three committee prints covering these hearings contain over 2,000 pages of relevant documentation. While I was chairman of that committee, I chaired personally four hearings on `Global Spread of Chemical and Biological Weapons.' In 1989, that produced another 746 pages of documentation on these threats and the various choices facing our country by way of responses. 
Mr. President, today is not the day for additional hand wringing over these nightmares. Today is the day finally to do something truly constructive to alleviate these threats and stop the hand wringing. In this case, constructive means multilateral, since we are dealing here with a truly global threat, not one susceptible to solution by unilateral U.S. legislation. For example, bills like S. 495, which passed a badly divided Senate last week after virtually no serious debate and without a single hearing, would, if enacted, impose yet another death penalty, while opening up several new loopholes for continued U.S. possession of both chemical and biological weapons. Fortunately, we have an alternative approach to consider. 
Today, we can vote on a resolution providing our advice and 
consent to ratify a treaty that does not just address the problem of halting the proliferation of these weapons, but a treaty that will also set the world on a course finally to eliminate such weapons everywhere. Though we will not obviously achieve these goals overnight simply by ratifying the CWC, we will be taking a crucial step toward achieving that ultimate goal. 
My argument, simply put, is that we just cannot solve the global problems of the CWC destruction, proliferation, terrorism and warfare by acting alone. The international framework, machinery, reporting procedures, and enforcement and verification mechanisms of this treaty will complement and reinforce--not compete with, substitute for or compromise--our own national military, intelligence, and diplomatic efforts against the global CW threat. 
The time has now come to put into place the international legal foundation necessary to eliminate chemical weapons once and for all. I am proud to be here on this historical occasion to speak on behalf of and to vote in favor of U.S. ratification of this treaty.  
Mr. President, let me get into some highlights of the CWC. The CWC bans the development, the production, stockpiling, use, and proliferation of chemical weapons. It requires the destruction of existing weapons, chemical agents, and CW production facilities. It breaks new ground with a system of verification that is the most extensive in the history of weapons of mass destruction. 
On November 23, 1993--over 3 years ago--President Clinton sent this treaty to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification. Though the Senate has proceeded very, very slowly with the consideration of this treaty, the rest of the world seems prepared to go forward with or without us. Over 160 countries have now signed the treaty and 74 have already ratified it. So with or without U.S. ratification, the treaty will enter into force on April 29 of this year. At that point, world commerce in chemicals and chemical equipment will begin to take place within a multilaterally coordinated system that imposes real costs on nonparties to this convention. It is one reason why I support this treaty. 
There is a widespread consensus among the military, the intelligence and the defense experts inside our Government that this treaty will serve our national interest. This consensus is bipartisan. Indeed, the convention was negotiated during the Reagan administration, signed by President George Bush and sent to the Congress by President Clinton. 
Except with respect to nonparties, this treaty is completely nondiscriminatory: It obligates its parties not to develop or to possess chemical weapons, period. It does not divide the world up into one set of countries that may have these weapons and another set that may not. It works from a different premise, one more closely aligned with its cousin, the Biological Weapons Convention--by outlawing such weapons among the parties to the treaty, it will significantly strengthen international diplomatic efforts to make the prohibition truly global. 
To ensure compliance, the treaty provides a verification system that operates on two dimensions. First, it provides for routine monitoring of potentially sensitive activities at declared chemical weapons sites, storage areas, and relevant civilian chemical industries. Second, it provides for a system of on-site challenge inspections operating on the principle of managed access to ensure the protection of proprietary information, constitutional rights, and national security interests. These inspections will be conducted by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW]. This system of verification has been worked out not just in consultation with industry, but with the strong and continuing support of industry.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, No. 5. Other Criticisms. These are not the only lines of attack that critics have taken against the treaty in recent years. 
First, would the CWC require a new strategic nuclear doctrine that actually encourages the use of tactical nuclear weapons, given the unavailability of a CW alternative? Not very likely, given that our military has unparalleled conventional military options that are available to respond to and to deter any CW attack. In this respect, critics who urge the retention of a CW arsenal underestimate the power of our conventional military capabilities and overestimate both the value and likelihood of the use of tactical nuclear weapons. Typically, such critics also tend to ignore the impact of making such nuclear threats upon our global nuclear nonproliferation policy. 
Second, it is true that the parties to the CWC are nation states, not 
nonstate entities such as terrorist groups that may seek to acquire such weapons. Though the treaty offers no guarantee against CW terrorism, the treaty's transparency provisions will at least operate to make it more difficult for terrorists to acquire equipment or materials for use in making such weapons and that in itself is a positive feature of the treaty. In particular, it will make it much more difficult for terrorists to engage in large-scale production of chemical weapons without detection. Since the CWC has never been intended to serve as a substitute for national efforts against sub-national terrorism, I find this whole argument that the treaty is weak on terrorism to be a red herring. 
I find it quite interesting that Japan--which was the victim of a recent chemical weapons attack by terrorists--has already ratified the CWC. In fact, Japan's Diet ratified the CWC within a month of the Sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subway. Though the treaty may not have been able to guarantee that this specific attack would not occur, Japan's leaders have obviously concluded that their country would still be better off with this treaty than without it. So would our country. 
Third, critics have argued that the treaty lacks teeth. In fact, the CWC does not repeal the fundamental principle of national sovereignty that has dominated world affairs for over 300 years. The treaty does not intend for the OPCW to perform as a police force in a world state. Though the treaty provides procedures for mobilizing international action against treaty violators, sanctions must still be implemented by individual state parties to the treaty. 
Nonparties to the treaty, however, will feel the teeth of this treaty. They will have a harder time participating in the world market for chemicals and chemical equipment. The few remaining CW states will in time feel the inevitable political pressures that come with the possession of internationally outlawed weaponry. And as the taboo on possession settles in the world community, so will the likelihood of strong international action against countries that would actually use such weapons. Sanctions against all forms of proliferation could always be strengthened, and I would certainly hope that this would be a high priority national security goal of this and future administrations. But the lack of mandatory sanctions in this treaty should not be confused with any lack of teeth--it will fall to the national diplomats, the leaders, and ultimately the people of the states that are CWC parties to sharpen this treaty's teeth. Though teething pains can be expected in the years ahead, sharper teeth will come. 
Fourth, and most recently, critics have pointed to trade and cooperation provisions in the treaty as evidence of an alleged obligation to provide chemicals and chemical equipment that will help treaty cheaters to make chemical weapons. Frankly, this argument is hogwash. The very first article of this treaty obligates its parties `* * * never under any circumstances * * * to assist, encourage or induce, in any way, anyone' to acquire chemical weapons. Given this obligation--and given the treaty's inspection system and national intelligence capabilities to back it up--the only appropriate response to the accusation that the treaty will encourage peaceful trade and scientific exchanges is, so what? 
The administration has been more than reasonable in accommodating the concerns of the critics. The fact that agreement was reached on 28 conditions hardly suggests a posture of stonewalling by anybody. But I cannot support any of the five additional conditions that have been offered concerning Russian chemical weapons activities, requiring terrorist states to join the CWC before we do, asserting a unilateral U.S. right to bar certain inspectors from certain countries, requiring 
the United States to seek the renegotiation of key provisions of the treaty on certain trade and CW defense issues, and adopting a verification standard based on a concept of military significance that is both inappropriate and unworkable. To the limited extent that these final conditions touch upon legitimate concerns, let us address these concerns inside the tent of the CWC, not by howling in the wilderness outside that tent. 
CONCLUSION 
Mr. President, I would like to conclude my remarks on a personal note. I have come a long way when it comes to the issue of CW disarmament. On May 21, 1985, I joined with three of my Senate colleague to argue in an Op-Ed in the Washington Post in favor of modernizing America's chemical weapons arsenal. At the time, there was scant prospect of a Chemical Weapons Convention. The Soviet Union was sitting on a huge CW arsenal and was threatening United States interests around the world. And our old so-called unitary chemical weapons were at best a national embarrassment, at worst an actual danger to American citizens and our own troops. I favored the safer binary weapons--safer for our own troops if they ever had to use them. 
But times have changed. The Soviet Union has ceased to exist and there is significant support inside the Russian Government to follow through with Russia's obligations under the CWC, support which America has every reason to encourage in any way it can. Yes, there still are countries in the world today that have chemical weapons. There still is a terrorist threat involving such weapons. There is still a CW proliferation threat. Russia, though it will hardly be alone in this respect, will no doubt still seek to compete with us in many arenas of world affairs. And many of those old unitaries are still sitting around like rusting relics of a by-gone age. 
Yet the world today is closer than ever to outlawing one of the most dangerous weapons that mankind has every devised. As a U.S. Senator for over 20 years now, I have at times encountered some of my colleagues who were simply unprepared to reconsider policy positions that they took in considerably different times and circumstances. I am determined not to follow that practice.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the only other thing I would add is that I have examined this treaty and listened to arguments both pro and con. I am convinced the time has finally arrived to move the campaign to eliminate chemical weapons into high gear. The CWC certainly offers no panacea to all risks concerning their proliferation or use of chemical weapons. It does, however, represent a substantial step along the way to alleviating these risks and, therefore, deserves the full support of the Senate and the people of the United States. I urge all my colleagues to vote for ratification. 
I thank the Chair. 
Exhibit 1 February 24, 1997. 
Hon. Trent Lott, 487 Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. 
Dear Senator Lott: We, the undersigned scientists, urge you to work as a matter of national urgency to bring the Chemical Weapons Convention to a vote in the Senate before April 29 of this year. That is the date when the Convention will automatically enter into force, with or without the United States. 
Negotiated by the administrations of Presidents Reagan and Bush, and signed by the United States under President Bush in January 1993, the Convention was formally submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification by President Clinton in November 1993. Since then it has been the subject of thirteen hearings before the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on Armed Services and the Select Committee on Intelligence. The Secretaries of State and Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Director of Central Intelligence and the representatives of the Chemical Manufacturers Association have all testified strongly in favor of ratification. More than 65 countries, including all of our major allies, have ratified. 
If the Senate fails even to vote on the CWC, after three administrations have been its leading architects and proponents, the United States will have surrendered by default its essential leadership in combating the proliferation of chemical weapons. 
Respectfully,

Mr. GLENN. I yield myself such time as I shall use. 
Mr. President, today is April 15. We do not need to tell everybody that. It is tax day for most Americans. On this day, honest hard-working citizens voluntarily--voluntarily--share their most personal and sensitive financial information with their Government. 
All Americans should have unbridled faith that their tax returns will remain absolutely, unequivocally confidential and zealously safeguarded. That is the hallmark of our taxpaying system, and if this trust is breached, it shakes the whole foundation of our very Government, because it means our people are losing faith in their Government. 
That is why I am proud to be standing here today as one of the authors, one of the sponsors, the Democratic sponsor of legislation to outlaw what I have come to term as `computer voyeurism.' That is the unauthorized inspection of your tax information by those not entitled to see it, not the people legitimately working on your tax account. 
In 1993 and 1994, as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I held hearings which first exposed this insidious practice. We came across it almost by happenstance. 
In 1990, I was pleased to work with my distinguished colleague who just spoke, Senator Roth, then ranking member of the committee, to pass into law the Chief Financial Officers Act. That measure required major Government agencies to do something for the first time which our own private businesses take for granted. That is, producing annual auditable financial statements so we know how much money is being spent, where it is being spent, and how it is being spent. 
I figured that of all the Government agencies which should be able to balance its books and come up with a good auditable statement, it would be the IRS; it should be able to account for all the revenue taken in, and the IRS would be the agency we would look at first. In fact, before the CFO Act, we had no idea of the differences between what revenues the IRS reported it was collecting and what was actually on the books. Little did I know then how wrong I really was. 
For 4 years running now, the IRS has not been able to pass its own audit. The General Accounting Office, which we asked to go in and help audit the IRS, still cannot even render an opinion on the reliability of the IRS's own books due, in part, to missing records, unsubstantiated amounts, and unreliable information. If we have that situation in the IRS, you can imagine what the situation is in some of the other agencies of Government. 
The IRS, I guess if we put it in our own household terms, it would be records in a shoe box under the bed. If your return was being audited and you could not come up with the documents, you would be called on the carpet for that. You would not get too much sympathy. But all that is another story, one of which the Governmental Affairs Committee has held numerous oversight hearings on. 
But it was through these initial GAO CFO audits we first discovered the problems IRS was having in preventing and detecting employees who get their kicks, apparently, out of surfing through other people's tax returns, ones they are not supposed to be working on or looking at. 
Our hearings revealed that in the years 1989 to 1994, more than 1,300 IRS employees were investigated on suspicion of snooping through private taxpayer files. Those probes resulted in disciplinary action against 420 workers, primarily in the Southeast region where the investigation was concentrated. 
My investigation found that some IRS employees had been browsing through the financial records of family members, ex-spouses, coworkers, neighbors, friends and enemies, and celebrities in particular. 
They also had submitted fraudulent tax returns and then used their computer access to monitor the IRS review of those returns. 
They used the computer to issue fraudulent refunds to family and to friends and, in fact, one employee was reported to have altered about 200 accounts and received kickbacks from inflated refund checks. 
We, in Congress, at that time were absolutely stunned at these revelations and did not believe it could happen, but it did. But it did not light a candle to the firestorm across the country from outraged--appropriately outraged--American taxpayers because we got a wave of indignation. Taxpayers were shocked to know that the most personal information they voluntarily, and in good faith, provide to the Government could, in effect, become an open book for others' private entertainment. 
Even worse was the pitifully low number of employees fired 
for committing these awful actions. It turned out that no criminal penalties existed for these kinds of browsing offenses. 
Mr. President, above the entrance to the main IRS building in DC are inscribed the famous words uttered by Oliver Wendell Holmes:  
Taxes are what we pay for a civilized society. 
Unfortunately, what American citizens have been subjected to in this case is downright uncivilized behavior. 
At our hearings, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue pledged to implement a `zero tolerance' policy. Warnings of possible prosecution for unauthorized use of the system began appearing whenever workers logged on to the main taxpayer account database. Explicit memos went out to all employees warning them against such unauthorized activities. 
Finally, a new automated detection program, called EARL--electronic audit research log--was installed on the primary computer system to monitor employee use and alert managers to possible misuse. 
To evaluate the effectiveness of these actions, particularly the new computer detection system, I asked GAO to conduct a review. I also asked the inspector general at the Department of Treasury to perform an inspection. 
In the meantime, we worked with the Treasury Department, the Department of Justice and the IRS to come up with a legislative solution for closing the legal loophole that let browsers off the hook from criminal punishment. 
That effort culminated in the legislation, the Taxpayer Browsing Protection Act, which I introduced in 1995 during the 104th Congress and as S. 523 for the 105th Congress. 
The goal was simple: to make willful browsers subject to a criminal misdemeanor penalty of up to $1,000 and a year in jail, and if any IRS employees are convicted of such an offense, they would be fired immediately. Zero tolerance should mean what it says--absolutely, positively no tolerance. 
That legislation was incorporated into this amendment and was the basis for the bill as is currently being considered in the House. 
We were not able to pass my bill in the last Congress--we did come close to trying to move it in the Senate--the issue has gotten more exposure now due to two recent court cases. 
Just last year, in Tennessee, a jury acquitted a former IRS employee who had been charged with 70 counts of improperly peeking at the tax returns of celebrities such as Elizabeth Taylor, Dolly Parton, Wynonna Judd, Michael Jordan, Lucille Ball, Tom Cruise, President Clinton, and Elvis Presley, just to name some of them. 
More recently, just a few weeks ago, a Federal appeals court in Boston reversed the conviction of a former employee who had been found guilty of several counts of wire and computer fraud by improperly accessing the IRS taxpayer database. It is reported that he had browsed through several files, including those of a local politician who had beaten him in an election, and a woman he once had dated. The Government had alleged that this worker was a member of a white supremacist group and was collecting data on people he thought could be Government informers. 
In both of these cases, though there was unauthorized snooping, because there was no subsequent disclosure to third parties, no criminal penalties could be meted out. As the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held: 
Unauthorized browsing of taxpayer files, although certainly inappropriate conduct, cannot, without more, sustain a felony conviction. 
Sounds ridiculous, but that is what the court ruled. That was their interpretation of the fine print of the law. I doubt these kinds of decisions give great comfort to honest law-abiding citizens. 
I should note that last year, Congress passed the Economic Espionage Act of 1996. My good friend, Senator Leahy, played a major part in this effort. This law does provide title 18 criminal penalties for anyone intentionally accessing a computer without authorization, or exceeding authorized access, and obtaining any information from any Department or agency of the United States. This section may be helpful in prosecuting future cases, since it would apply to tax information stored in computers. 
This provision is not enough in our efforts to deter and punish browsing, for, according to the IRS, it does not apply to the unauthorized access or inspection of paper tax returns, return information in other forms, such as documents or magnetic media, such as tapes. 
That is why we, all taxpayers, need the protections originally espoused in the bill and incorporated in this amendment to specifically fill this gap and ensure unauthorized browsing or inspection of any tax information in any form is subject to criminal penalties, and that is what this does. It will also provide those criminal sanctions within the Internal Revenue Code so that the confidentiality scheme governing tax information and the related law enforcement mechanisms are preserved in the same section. 
While I do feel the recent court decisions have spurred us on, I also believe the new findings contained in a GAO report I released last weekend entitled `IRS Security Systems: Tax Processing Operations and Data Still at Risk Due to Serious Weaknesses,' have brought this problem to the forefront. 
This report is the evaluation I asked GAO to undertake in 1994 in response to the actions implemented by the IRS to prevent browsing and enforce its zero tolerance policy. 
It was released by GAO earlier this year; however, because some of the specific details could potentially jeopardize IRS security, the report was designated for `Limited Official Use' with restricted access. 
I have been involved in this important issue for a long time and because I believe the public has a right to know, I requested that GAO issue a redacted version of the report suitable for public release. I thank GAO for their hard work in this matter and also the IRS for their cooperation in making this possible. 
The findings of GAO's report are disturbing. Even more important, their conclusions are reaffirmed by the IRS in a comprehensive internal report of their own compiled last fall. 
In addition, I should add, they are buttressed to some extent by a review I asked the Treasury Inspector General to conduct on IRS computer security controls and the Service's progress in addressing the shortcomings. That report, too, is `Limited Official Use.' But I can tell you, while there have been some positive actions taken to proactively confront this problem, we are nowhere near any satisfactory resolution. 
The bottom line is although the IRS efforts in this area are well-intentioned, unfortunately they have come too late and fall far short of the commitment and determination sorely needed to tackle this problem head on. 
The findings of GAO's report are disturbing. Just as important, their conclusions are affirmed by the IRS in a comprehensive internal report of their own compiled last fall. 
GAO found that serious weaknesses in IRS's information security makes taxpayer data vulnerable to authorized use, to modification, or to destruction. According to GAO, the IRS also has no effective means for measuring the extent of the browsing problem, the damage being done by browsing, or the progress being made to deter browsing. 
Finally, and this is something I am having GAO look at further, we do not know to what extent the detection and control systems exist in other IRS databases, besides `IDRS,' the primary taxpayers' account system looked at here. That may be open for further problems. 
I was struck by the candor in the IRS's own internal report on the `EARL' detection system. That report found its progress in management programs to prevent and detect browsing `painfully slow,' as they determined. Quite distressing to me, the IRS internal report indicated that some employees felt IRS management does not aggressively pursue browsing violations. Some workers, when confronted about their snooping activities, saw nothing wrong and believed it would be of no consequence to them even if they were caught. Hard to believe. 
Mr. President, we have to fix that. When you have over 1,500 investigations of browsing cases since my last hearings 2 years ago, and only 23 workers fired, something just is not right. That does not sound like zero tolerance to me. 
I have a more detailed summary of the major findings contained in both the GAO and internal IRS report which I ask unanimous consent to have printed at the end of my statement.

Mr. GLENN. I also point out the effectiveness of controls used to safeguard IRS systems, facilities, and taxpayer data. GAO found serious weaknesses in these efforts, especially in the areas of physical and logical security. 
For example, the facilities visited by GAO could not account for over 6,400 units of magnetic storage media such as tapes and cartridges which might contain taxpayer data. Now, IRS responded last week they have located 5,700 of the units, but that means that 700 are still unaccounted for. That begs the question: Where are they? Are they deemed lost? And can they be misused? Each of the units can store tax information on thousands of Americans. We need to know where they are. Moreover, GAO only visited selected facilities. I just wonder if the IRS is able to track all of its inventory at the other major sites not visited by GAO. We would like to know what the results are there, too. 
GAO also found that printouts containing taxpayer data were left unprotected and unattended in open areas of two facilities, where they could be compromised. I do not want to say much more on this portion of the report than I have already said, except that these matters and the others referred to by GAO must be dealt with swiftly and effectively. 
I am glad to have brought this matter to the Senate's attention and am pleased to have the support of colleagues. I commend the efforts of Senator Coverdell in this area. He has added very significant provisions to some of the original language. I think we have an excellent bill. I want to congratulate him for taking the initiative in bringing this up. 
The first of the sections that Senator Coverdell brought would require that a taxpayer be notified by the Secretary of 
the Treasury when a criminal indictment or charge is brought against an IRS employee for unlawful inspection of that taxpayer's return or return information. This is something I remember Senator Pryor, our former colleague, bringing up before the Commissioner at one of our earlier hearings. 
The second new section will provide taxpayers with a civil remedy in such unauthorized inspections as similarly provided under current law for unlawful disclosures. This provision clarifies that civil liability will not be a remedy in cases where the inspection is requested by the taxpayer or in any instance which results from an accidental review of a return or return information. 
I want to be clear about that last point in reference to the legislation at hand. I do not want to compromise IRS employees' ability to do what they are supposed to be doing, especially in the areas of return processing, examination, and inspection. Under this bill, IRS employees will continue to be able to inspect tax returns or return information as authorized by the Internal Revenue Code or tax administration purposes without penalties. Only intentional, willful, unauthorized inspections will be subject to prosecution, where you knew or should have known it was wrong. 
As the report by the House Ways and Means Committee states: `Accidental or inadvertent inspection that may occur--such as, for example, by making an error in typing in a TIN [Taxpayer Identification Number]--would not be subject to damages because it would not meet this standard.' 
These are good provisions and I welcome their inclusion. I also want to thank my distinguished colleague, Senator Roth, who sat with us as ranking member of the Governmental Affairs Committee during our hearings last year during consideration of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2, pledged his commitment and support for bringing this legislation to the floor. 
Let me say a word about the men and women who work at the IRS. The vast majority of the people who work at the IRS are just as fine a people as there are in this room or anywhere else in this country. They are dedicated. They are trying to do a good job. I do not want to unduly scare anyone that this is commonplace or that their privacy has been violated. You have a few bad apples over there, but I am sure most of the people over there want to turn in themselves because most of the people of the IRS, including the Commissioner, are proud of the work they are doing. 
The Commissioner has done a good job in many areas. I have been complimentary of her. Her plan to deal with the IRS is a good one. The way of getting it downhill to the centers and the different regions and having it done there did not occur the way it should have, with what I thought was a very good plan. I do not want to condemn all the IRS over there. Normally, the people look down on the tax man every April 15. We know that. It is not popular to pay taxes. The people working there are doing a great service for this country, and we want to weed out those few bad apples that may be over there. 
I have visited some of the sites and I know what some of the IRS employees are up against. It is not an easy job. They are, by and large, a dedicated bunch, committed to their job and laboring under difficult conditions with very outmoded systems. Unfortunately, in this day and age, they must also fear for their own personal safety. However, even just a single incidence of this behavior is one too many and cannot be tolerated. 
The IRS has a moral and legal obligation to uphold when Americans provide the Government with their most personal and private information. The IRS must have the complete trust and confidence of taxpayers. That means we cannot tolerate any of this browsing or mishandling of accounts. The American people expect and demand nothing less. 
I thank you, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. GLENN. I thank my distinguished colleague from Georgia. I know we are approaching the time when we are supposed to have a vote. 
The American people have to have the utmost confidentiality in the IRS. We have to have somebody collect the taxes that does everybody in this country good, that builds roads, the airways, does everything, so those who say we are mad at the IRS and we will do away with it, if they will just think what they are saying, what we need is to have zero tolerance for browsers and misuse of the system. That is what this addresses today. Our legislation will get the snoops out of the IRS. Our legislation says if you are going to snoop, you are going to jail. It is that simple. 
If you are going to snoop, you are going to pay also. You are also going to lose your job. I think browsing angers me just like being violated personally, almost. Everybody has to feel that way because you trust your Government. We say we are giving this information willingly, honestly, and then they are misusing it. They are browsing, and the information may not remain confidential. We don't know what is going to happen to it. The American people deserve better than that. 
I deplore those who are guilty of engaging in IRS-bashing. And it always seems to build to a crescendo on April 15. I repeat that most IRS employees are just as honest as anybody in this room or anybody in America. They are dedicated workers. They want to clean out this snooping and they want to see this problem go away just like all the rest of us do, so that more Americans don't lose faith in our voluntary tax system. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add John Kerry of Massachusetts and Senator Kohl of Wisconsin to the bill as cosponsors.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Government Restructuring and Reform Act of 1997, legislation whose objective is to reorganize the executive branch into a form and a structure that is capable of meeting the challenges of the 21st century. The bill is cosponsored by my distinguished colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman. 
We are in an era of contraction at the Federal level. Some of this contraction is needed in my opinion, in some areas I don't think it's a good idea. But it is a fact. Many programs are being cut, others have been eliminated or consolidated into block grants to the States. Agencies and departments are being downsized and in some cases eliminated. In the last Congress, the Bureau of Mines, Office of Technology Assessment, Interstate Commerce Commission, and Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations were all terminated. In addition, agency rules and paperwork are being pruned. And Federal employment has been cut by over 250,000 positions in the last 4 years and continues to fall. 
These are big and historic changes, spurred on by our efforts to reach a balanced budget and the desire of the American people for a more cost-effective Government. 
However, despite the overall downsizing effort, the basic structure of the Federal Government remains unchanged. In fact, the basic structure of the Federal Government has changed little in the last 25 years, despite structural changes in the private sector, the economy, and our society over that same time period. The Federal Government has been the last to follow suit--and that's as it should be in a democracy--but that does not mean it should be immune from change forever. We cannot keep the status quo in the existing executive branch structure while continuing to downsize, cut budgets and programs and reduce personnel levels and also expect these same Federal agencies to perform effectively and maintain adequate levels of service. We'll end up with what I call the hollowing out of Government. We'll have the same agencies and departments in place doing most of the same activities as they do now. But with less money and less people on hand, these activities will be carried out less effectively. We'll have a less costly Federal Government, but not a more cost-effective one. That is, unless we address reorganization and consolidation of Federal agencies and functions in a comprehensive, well-thought-out way. 
Reorganization issues are very difficult, perhaps among the most difficult issues we face in Government. It raises questions that don't have simple, right and wrong answers. Should we have greater centralization of Government functions in less, but larger Cabinet departments? This is the traditional, centralized model of how Government bureaucracy is organized. Or should we decentralize and spread Government functions across many smaller agencies and departments? Such an approach fits what many call the entrepreneurial model of Government organization. 
Well, I can think of pros and cons to both approaches. To add to this difficulty, reorganization necessarily involves questions of turf and jurisdiction. Turf battles in this town are as hotly 
contested as any policy issue. I know this through experience. Several years ago I proposed consolidating the Government's trade and technology functions into one Cabinet department and I faced very stiff opposition. Likewise, turf is just as jealously guarded at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Ask the President's National Performance Review. They proposed integrating the Agency for International Development into the State Department in addition to consolidating the Federal law enforcement agencies only to be faced down by the bureaucracy. So I don't think comprehensive reorganization can be tackled successfully by either the Congress or the executive branch. 
That's why I'm in favor of establishing a Government commission to examine executive branch organization. My bill establishes a nine-member, bipartisan Commission to make recommendations to the President and the Congress in 2 years on consolidating, eliminating, and restructuring Federal departments and agencies in order to eliminate unnecessary activities, reduce duplication across programs, and improve management and efficiency. This Commission would be not just any old Commission, producing some big thick study that would wind up largely unread in some recycling bin, or on the dusty shelf of academia. Rather the Commission's recommendations would be submitted to the Congress and have to be considered on a what I call a flexible fast-track basis. They could not perish in committee, as so often occurs with commission reports and recommendations. 
There is precedent for such a commission. In fact, the few successful Government reorganization efforts that have taken place have come about because of the work of a commission. Let me give you some background. 
The Hoover Commission is probably the most famous Government restructuring commission from recent times. It was formed in 1947 and chaired by former President Hoover. The 12-member commission operated until 1949 and issued 19 reports to the President recommending various changes in the structure of the Federal Government. From these recommendations, President Truman submitted eight reorganization plans to Congress in 1949, of which six became effective. The following year he submitted 27 reorganization plans, 20 of which became effective. Included among these plans were the creation of the General Services Administration, the expansion of the Executive Office of the President, and the creation of a centralized Office of Personnel. 
A second Hoover Commission was formed in 1953 and made 314 specific recommendations over the following 2 years, 202 of which were implemented. However, generally this Commission was not considered as successful as the first Hoover Commission, as it engaged itself in more controversial matters of policy rather than solely focus on management and organization as the first commission had done. 
Our next restructuring effort of note was put forward by President Nixon's Ash Council, which was in operation from 1969 to 1971. Headed by Roy Ash, chairman of Litton Industries, the Council supplied the President with nine memoranda detailing with specific reorganization and consolidation proposals. The Council recommended the formation of OMB, the EPA, and NOAA from the consolidation of existing programs. These proposals were all implemented. The Council also recommended the creation of several super-Departments, including a Department of Natural Resources, but these proposals ultimately did not pass the Congress. 
The next notable Commission came during the Reagan years, the Grace Commission, which was established by Executive order in 1982 and was in operation through 1984. The panel was composed of 161 corporate executives and it issued a massive 47 volume report with nearly 2,500 recommendations. Many of its recommendations were policy-based rather than organizational in nature, hence they generated controversy and polarized debate in the Congress. Still, many of the recommendations were 
implemented, primarily through executive branch action. And the Commission did call for stronger financial management in the Federal bureaucracy. That's something we have built on in the Committee on Governmental Affairs through enactment of the Chief Financial Officers Act. 
More recently, the Committee on Governmental Affairs passed legislation to establish a bipartisan reorganization commission as part of our efforts to make the VA a Cabinet department. That Commission became law, Unfortunately, in order to pass it, we had to place a mechanism to trigger the activation of the Commission through a Presidential certification that the Commission was in the national interest. Unfortunately, that certification was not made, Had it been, perhaps we would have in place today the blueprint for the Government of the 21st century. 
Then in the 103d Congress, we reported out a Glenn-Roth-Lieberman Commission bill by a 12 to 1 vote. But we did not move it to the floor because the President's National Performance Review was just getting underway and we wanted to see what it might come up with before establishing the commission. 
Finally, last year the committee reported out a version of a government reorganization commission; however, it was tied to legislation dismantling the Commerce Department and thus died. Late in the session, Senator Stevens developed a substitute retaining the commission but dropping the dismantling provisions, We came close to an agreement and my hope this Congress is that we will reach one. 
For a more detailed history of government restructuring commissions I would refer my colleagues to an excellent report prepared by CRS titled `Reorganizing the Executive Branch in the Twentieth Century: Landmark Commissions.' 
I believe that a commission would complement nicely the efforts of the NPR. The Federal work force has been reduced by over 250,000 positions, Federal paperwork and redtape has been simplified, procurement reform has been enacted, and unnecessary field offices at the Department of Agriculture has been closed. These accomplishments are due in significant part to the work and the efforts of the NPR. 
However, the NPR has generally not focused on government restricting. In the instances where it has made proposals--I noted two examples earlier in my statement--they have been rebuffed by the bureaucracy, the Congress or both. 
Recent congressional efforts have fallen short also, as several of my colleagues learned in advocating the dismantling of four Cabinet departments--HUD, DOE, Commerce, and Education. Those efforts were heavy-handed in my view and would have created more problems then they would have solved. 
In closing, I believe an examination of the experience of the private sector in restructuring and downsizing is instructive in differentiating between the right and wrong ways to downsize. A 1993 survey of over 500 U.S. companies by the Wyatt Co. revealed that only 60 percent of the companies actually were able to reduce costs in their restrucuting efforts. Both the Wyatt Survey and a similar one conducted by the American Management Association concluded that successful restructuring efforts must be planned carefully with a clear vision of their goals and objectives, and that proper attention be given to maintaining employee morale and productivity. Otherwise, the costs of reorganization may outweigh its benefits. 
There is a right and a wrong way to reorganize and downsize. I believe that the Commission approach is the right way. I hope my colleagues will support this legislation.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the date of April 15 is indelibly etched in the minds of most Americans. For it is on or by that day that honest, hard-working citizens voluntarily share their most personal and sensitive financial information with their Government. 
All Americans should have unbridled faith that their tax returns will remain absolutely confidential and zealously safeguarded. That is the foundation of our taxpaying system. If this trust is breached, then the bonds that tie citizens with their Government may break, with disastrous consequences for us all. 
In 1993 and 1994, as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I held hearings which first exposed that vulnerability. We found out that hundreds of IRS employees had been investigated for what I term `computer voyeurism', where they call up returns of friends, enemies, celebrities, relatives, or neighbors just to snoop and satisfy their own prurient interests. Even worse, in some cases, IRS employees either altered their own returns to get refunds, or conspired with other taxpayer friends to change their returns and get a kickback from those refunds. 
My investigation revealed serious flaws in the IRS' ability to monitor, prevent, and detect browsing. 
In response, the IRS Commissioner pledged a zero tolerance policy to protect taxpayer privacy and vigorously discipline those who abuse this trust. The Commissioner also implemented a new system called EARL--Electronic Audit Research Log--to help identify inappropriate and unauthorized access to taxpayer information stored in the IRS' main computer system. 
That primary system, IDRS--Integrated Data Retrieval System--handles more than 100 million transactions per month and is used by over 55,000 IRS employees. At least one-third of those employees are authorized to input adjustments to tax account records. 
I had asked the General Accounting Office [GAO] to review the progress made by the IRS in reducing computer security risks and in curbing browsing. Earlier this year, GAO produced that report. However, because some of the specific details could jeopardize IRS security, that report was designated for `Limited Official Use' with restricted access. 
Due to my involvement in this important issue, and because I believe the public has a right to know, I requested that GAO issue a redacted version of the report suitable for public release. I would like to thank GAO for their hard work in this matter and also the IRS for their cooperation in making this possible. 
The findings of GAO's report are disturbing. Even more important, their findings are reaffirmed by the IRS in a comprehensive internal report of their own compiled last fall. 
Before I get to the specifics, I just want to say a couple of things. 
Point One. The vast majority of IRS employees are dedicated and committed to their jobs, and labor in extremely difficult conditions with very outmoded systems. Unfortunately, in this day and age, they must also fear for their own personal safety. 
Some 99.9 percent of them would never engage in such snooping or fraud. It is not as if every American has reason to believe that his or her privacy and tax return information has been compromised. But even just a single incidence of this behavior is one too many and cannot be tolerated. 
Just last year, in Tennessee, a jury acquitted a former IRS employee who had been charged with 70 counts of improperly peeking at the tax returns of celebrities such as Elizabeth Taylor, Dolly Parton, Wynonna Judd, Michael Jordan, Lucille Ball, Tom Cruise, President Clinton, and Elvis Presley. 
More recently, just a few weeks ago, a Federal appeals court in Boston reversed the conviction of a former employee who had been found guilty of several counts of wire and computer fraud by improperly accessing the IRS taxpayer database. It was reported that he had browsed through several files, including those of a local politician who had beaten him in an election, and a woman he once had dated. The Government had alleged this worker was a member of a white-supremacist group and was collecting data on people he thought could be Government informers. 
In both of these cases, because of a loophole in the law, no criminal penalties could be meted out. The reason? No disclosures had been made to third parties. 
I doubt these kinds of decisions give great comfort to honest, law-abiding citizens. That is why today I am reintroducing my legislation--the Taxpayer Privacy Protection Act--to close this gap and ensure that any unauthorized access or inspection of return information, in whatever form, is punishable as a criminal offense and that employees so convicted are fired immediately. 
I know that the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee is interested in passing such a bill as are several of my Senate colleagues including Senator Coverdell. I commend everyone for their interest and looking forward to making this bill--finally--a reality. 
Let's pass this by April 15 and send a signal across the land that those who violate the privacy of tax paying Americans will be fined, will be fired, and will be jailed. The public rightfully expects no less. 
Point Two. The IRS has recognized this serious issue and has undertaken some responsive actions. Warnings of possible prosecution for unauthorized use of the system appear whenever employees log onto the taxpayer account database. They have installed automated detection programs in some of their systems to monitor employee use and alert managers to possible misuse. And, the IRS has just created a new Office of Systems Standards and Evaluations to centralize and enforce IRS standards and policies for all major security programs. I have confidence that this Office, if given the proper resources, will be a positive force in this effort. 
The problem, however, is that these efforts, while well-intentioned, have come too late and fall far short of the commitment, management, and determination sorely needed to confront this matter head-on. 
The sad fact is that with 1 week to go until tax returns are due, one thing is clear: the IRS has flunked its own audit and has let down the American people. 
The agency promised zero tolerance for browsing. Today's information suggests that they have failed to live up to that pledge--1,515 new cases of browsing have been identified since our last report. Of those only 27 have resulted in employees being fired. I don't know what kind of new math they may be using, but that doesn't sound like zero tolerance to me. 
GAO even found that the 1,515 figure may drastically underestimate actual incidents because--and I quote--the agency's `ability to detect browsing is limited'. 
Overall, GAO found that IRS' approach to computer security is not effective. Serious weaknesses persist in security controls intended to safeguard IRS computer systems, data, and facilities and expose tax processing operations to the risk of disruption and taxpayer data to the risk of unauthorized use, modification, and destruction. Further, although IRS has taken some action to detect and prevent browsing, the fact remains that the IRS has no effective means for measuring the extent of the browsing problem, the damage being done by browsing, or the progress being made to deter browsing. 
This finding is candidly confirmed in IRS' own internal report: 
 progress in developing efficient prevention and detection programs has been painfully slow. The program has suffered from a lack of overall consistent, strong leadership and oversight. 
Quite distressing to me is the finding, as stated in the IRS' own report, that employees, when confronted, indicate that they browsed because they do not believe it is wrong and that there will be little or no consequence to them if they are caught. 
Before summarizing the major findings, I also want to point out another facet of this report. That is, the effectiveness of controls used to safeguard IRS systems, facilities, and taxpayer data. GAO found serious weaknesses in these efforts, especially in the areas of physical and logical security. 
For example, the facilities visited by GAO could not account for about 6,400 units of magnetic storage media, such as tapes and cartridges, which might contain taxpayer data. Further, they found that printouts containing taxpayer data were left unprotected and unattended in open areas of two facilities where they could be compromised. 
I really don't want to say much more on this portion of the report than I have already. Except that these matters, and the others referred to by GAO, must be dealt with swiftly and effectively. 
I have summarized GAO's findings in a handout. Where appropriate, I have also included references from IRS' own recent internal report on their browsing deterrence and detection program. As I mentioned earlier, that report--[Electronic Audit Research Log (EARL) Executive Steering Committee Report, Sept. 30, 1996]--and I commend the IRS for its candid and frank evaluations in it--affirms most of GAO's findings, conclusions, and recommendations. 
I will briefly highlight the major findings in these attachments:

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I think it is good to review how we got to the current situation we are in, because this was not our doing on Governmental Affairs. It was not our suggestion that we be given the duty of investigating campaign finance reform. It was not our suggestion that the jurisdictions of other committees that might have an interest in this be given to us. 
What happened--and I am recounting this mainly from press reports of what happened, and I presume they are accurate--was that there were several committees who saw themselves as wanting part of this investigation into campaign finance reform. 
You had the Commerce Committee because there were trade matters involved that there had been some allegations about. Senator McCain, who has a big interest in campaign finance reform, chairs that committee and could take an active role in what might happen with campaign finance reform. 
The Judiciary Committee was concerned about some of the legal matters regarding elections, and they had some things they were going to look into. 
The Foreign Relations Committee certainly had an interest in this because foreign money supposedly came back in to our election campaigns here. So they wanted to find out what happened to foreign relations and foreign policy and were any of those things altered as a result of money coming back in. 
The Rules Committee, which has a jurisdiction over election law, certainly had an interest in this particular area. 
The Governmental Affairs Committee, of which I am the ranking member, also had their own interest in this in that we are basically the investigative committee of the Senate. We have investigated such things as drugs and drugs coming into the country and organized crime and fraudulent health programs and nonproliferation around the world of nuclear weapons and terrorism and a whole host of things that we have a broad experience investigating. Our mandate to do investigations is the broadest on Capitol Hill. We have been accustomed to doing this through many, many decades. 
The suggestion was not made from the Democratic side that all these conflicting jurisdictions be combined into the Governmental Affairs Committee. This was a suggestion that was made by the Republican leadership. In fact, it was not only a suggestion, it was decided by the Republican leadership on their side of the aisle that these other jurisdictions would not be exercised and that this investigation would be focused in the Governmental Affairs Committee. 
This was not a suggestion made from the Democratic side. It was Republican leadership that decided this. And so to act now as though we were somehow usurping authority of another committee by proposing a broad investigation on the Governmental Affairs Committee just is not the case. That is just not the way it happened. 
I can tell you exactly what happened. And once again, this has all been out in public print. This is not something I know from being in meetings because I have not been in meetings that were involved with any of these decisions to assign it to the Governmental Affairs Committee. 
But what happened, when it got to the Governmental Affairs Committee, was this: Senator Thompson had an interest in a broad investigation. I had an interest in a broad investigation. We had some ideas on scope. We sat down in a couple of meetings, and we worked out an agreement that was broad in scope, as it should be, because this whole investigation into campaign finance reform does not involve only illegalities, those things that are against the law. It involves much more than that. 
Any fair observer of the campaign finance system agrees that in addition to illegalities, there are many, many things out there that are legal but probably should not be. All the abuses of soft money, as it is called, that came up in this last election, all those abuses were so onerous to most people across this country that they just want us to get into campaign finance reform. 
Every single poll that has been done across this country shows that people want campaign finance reform. They also see that polling has been interesting in that it has indicated that they think both parties, both campaigns this last election cycle--the fault that can be pointed at one direction or another is not all one direction, it is bipartisan. We have a bipartisan problem here, and we need a bipartisan solution. 
Part of it is looking into illegalities where the existing law was violated. There is no doubt that that has to be done. The other part of this problem is looking into the soft money in 
particular and independent expenditures that were so vile, so onerous in this last election. 
So when Republican leadership assigned this overall investigation of campaign finance to the Governmental Affairs Committee, it was not at our request, but at his suggestion, at his direction, so that the responsibilities would not be in quite a number of different committees but would be centered in the basic investigative committee of the U.S. Senate. 
Now what happened? 
Senator Thompson and I, in the two meetings I mentioned, sat down and we drew out a broad scope in which we planned to look into not only illegalities but also into the equally disturbing areas of where campaign finance reform is needed that involve soft money and independent expenditures. 
In this last election I remember reading a newspaper account of a Congressman who, after the election, said he wound up feeling like a ping pong ball in the middle of this and he had no control over it because there were so many outside influences coming in and putting ads on that he did not even know anything about that he felt like a ping pong ball in his own election and completely out of control of the situation. 
Now, if we are going to take any fair look at campaign finance reform, it is going to have to involve illegalities, of course. We plan to look into those. But we got to have soft money. Our scope, as we had outlined it on that committee, was put out. It disturbed some people. 
Let me say, when Senator Thompson and I agreed to the scope, it was then taken to the committee. The committee has three members on the Governmental Affairs Committee that are also members of the Rules Committee. When this was brought before them, after considerable debate, the committee agreed upon the scope of our investigation. They voted on that and approved it. It was agreed upon. 
What happened when that got to the Rules Committee? The fact is that on the Rules Committee some of the people that are the most adamant against any campaign reform consideration at all disagreed strongly with what was being done and that any look be taken into the soft money area. When it got to the Rules Committee with the request for the additional funding of the $6.5 million that had gone over, that disturbed them very much. 
So what happened? They delayed funding in the Rules Committee because of their objection to us looking into soft money and some of the things that are legal but probably should not be what we were going to look into. They wanted to protect their ability to raise soft money because they outdo the Democrats about two to one in soft money raising. 
Obviously, it is a factor in not only having gained control of the Senate but in maintaining control of the Senate. They objected over on the Rules Committee to the funding that had to be approved by the Rules Committee for additional funding for investigations. 
Now, at that point things were stymied. They dug in their heels over there and were not going to approve any money, as I understand it, for investigation unless our jurisdiction on the Governmental Affairs Committee was reduced and those jurisdictions involving things we were going to look into with regard to soft money were brought over to the Rules Committee where they obviously would have much more say in what happened to that than they would if the jurisdiction stayed with the Governmental Affairs Committee. 
That is how we got to where we are. So a reduced amount was agreed upon over in the Rules Committee but with the proviso that the Governmental Affairs Committee could investigate only illegal activities. Only illegal. That took out any investigation, any investigation whatever of soft money, unless it proved to be illegal, only illegal. But most of the soft money problem is legal. I do not think it should be. Our investigations in that area were going to, I think, lay out a good case of why we need campaign finance reform changes. 
That is how we got to where we are. It was at least implied here on the floor yesterday and even this morning I think it could be implied that we somehow had overextended our jurisdiction on the Governmental Affairs Committee. It was leadership on the Republican side that combined all these other committees' interest and assigned to the Governmental Affairs Committee the task of looking into all of this whole campaign finance reform area. 
Now, what about the substitute amendment that is before the Senate now, the substitute to my amendment? What it does, as I see it, and I just got it a few minutes ago so I have not had a chance to look into it in that much detail, but what it does basically is say that we are taking back the authority of the Governmental Affairs Committee that we were asked to do. We did not ask to do it, we were assigned that task. They are now taking back our authority to look into any of these matters, any of the matters relating to Federal elections generally, including the election of the President, the Vice President, Members of the Congress, and corrupt practices, as I understand it. 
Let me read this through. It is a short amendment.  
Strike all after `(b)' and insert the following: 
`The additional funds authorized by this section are for the sole purpose of conducting an investigation of illegal activities in connection with 1996 Federal election campaigns.' 
Now, my amendment would change that and change the scope back to what it was originally in the Governmental Affairs Committee. So that refers back to what we were assigned to do. 
It goes on with subsection (c): 
Referral to Committee on Rules and Administration: Because the Committee on Rules and Administration, not the Committee on Governmental Affairs, has jurisdiction under rule 25 over all proposed legislation and other matters relating to--

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, this debate comes down to a simple choice: You are in favor of campaign finance reform or you are opposed to campaign finance reform, and that is what the argument is all about. I believe both sides of the aisle want to correct things as far as illegalities are concerned, I don't have any question of that. But the other area that is so big is the area of independent expenditures, soft money and all the other practices that grew up and came to a peak in the 1996 election. 
There was no doubt that the public was demanding that we look into this, and there were various committees that wanted a part of that activity. There was the Commerce Committee, Judiciary Committee, Foreign Relations Committee, Rules Committee, and Governmental Affairs Committee. The Republican leadership decided to talk the other committees into not exercising their jurisdictions they normally would have in this area and assign that to the Governmental Affairs Committee, which has the broadest investigative authority on Capitol Hill. 
My friend, the Senator from Virginia, read into the Record a little while ago the Governmental Affairs Committee's jurisdiction out of Senate Resolution 54, which details what we are to look into with the money that comes out and we are given each year. It involves the whole gamut of anything to do with the Federal Government in any way, shape, or form, any type of corruption, anything we want to look into on that. We have exercised that jurisdiction through the years. 
It was assigned to the committee. Senator Thompson, chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, and I worked out an agreement on what the scope of this investigation would be. We didn't have agreement on the money yet or some other things like that, but we at least had the $1.8 million we agreed to. Today, we are going up to the $4.5 million that was stated, but we object strongly to cutting back on our normal jurisdiction of what we can look into. 
Why is this being cut back? Because a few members on the Rules Committee that has to pass on our additional money for investigative activity over and above our normal committee budget dug in their heels, the people who are publicly outspoken against any campaign finance reform, and they are the ones who, on the Rules Committee, were able to stop that type funding, unless they got an agreement, unless a deal was cut. 
So a deal was cut that we would not be able to look into any of the things involved that we wanted to look into with regard to soft money and independent expenditures with regard to Capitol Hill, with regard to congressional campaigns, Senate or the House. They were dead set against that. They didn't want that looked into. The reason, I guess, is because Republicans outdo the Democrats about 2 to 1 in this fundraising area and particularly in the area of soft money. It was crucial, as we see it, a couple of years ago in changing the majority in the Senate, because money is the mother's milk of politics. It is really what has more impact than anything else. So they objected to any changes or to any investigation in those areas.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, they wanted to cut out any investigation of Capitol Hill. That is the reason we came to this situation. It was not that most Members don't want to correct campaign finance reform on our side. We asked for campaign finance reform legislation to be brought to the floor all this year. We would like to see the McCain-Feingold proposal voted on. 
But regardless of that, we think that an airing of everything to do with what happened in campaign financing over the past several elections, really, as this has built up to a crescendo that just inundated us in 1996, we think that should be looked into to lay the base for real campaign finance reform and give us that kind of educational base. 
What happened? Those who were against this got a deal cut, and instead, all the things we were going to look into which was submitted as the original part of Senate Resolution 39 from the Governmental Affairs Committee to the Rules Committee for approval were all struck, the total language, and the additional funds in the last part of this that are operable in Senate Resolution 39 as brought to the floor state that funds can only be used for the sole purpose of conducting an investigation of illegal activities. That takes out all those other areas of soft money that we wanted to look into. 
The amendment I proposed would restore the scope of the investigation, as the chairman and I and as all members of the Governmental Affairs Committee, including those who are on the Rules Committee, voted out of committee. They voted for these things to go into this type of scope. 
They did not disagree with it then. But as part of the deal that was cut then, that kind of scope was taken away from us. Now I would propose, with my amendment, to restore that. 
What has happened this morning is now the majority leader has proposed an amendment to my amendment, a second-degree amendment in the nature of a substitute, that would again say that `the Committee on Rules and Administration, not the Committee on Governmental Affairs, has jurisdiction under rule 25 over all proposed legislation and other matters relating to--(1) Federal elections generally * * * [and] (2) corrupt practices * * * [and] the Committee on Governmental Affairs shall refer to the Committee on Rules and Administration any evidence of activities * * * [that] are not illegal but which may require investigation * * *' In other words, this takes us back where we were. It second-degrees my amendment and takes us back to the intent of Senate Resolution 39, which cut back the authority on the committee. 
There has been a good discussion of this this morning. But to my way of thinking, this boils down, very, very simply, to one area. And one thing that is correct is, it is a choice. Do we want campaign finance reform or do we not? 
We want the broadest possible investigation so we can come out with good campaign finance reform that I think will be follow on to McCain-Feingold if we are ever able to get it to a vote. On the other side, they do not want any investigation in this area and are opposed to campaign finance reform. That is the bottom-line choice we are talking about here. 
I will end with that because my good friend from Virginia has been very kind in granting me extra time here. I have run over several minutes, I know. I thank him very much.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I do not object to this proposal for 5 minutes for debate equally divided on the amendment, and following debate, we proceed to vote. There has been a lot of negotiating going on here, as has been obvious to everyone. I think we have some satisfactory procedures worked out that will be generally far more acceptable than what we had prior to that. I look forward to the vote. I think that most people on both sides will probably be happy to vote for this because this is a way we get to a final solution out of the disagreements we have had here. I look forward to the vote.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I don't want to get into another debate before we even get around to this vote, but I think the focus on where the wrongdoing is can be either on illegalities or on improprieties with the change that has been proposed by the leaders. I would not want to let it be said right now or let it be indicated that the main focus--what the main focus will be, I think, is up to the committee chairman and the ranking minority member to work out. I think we have language in here that will do that. It might be inappropriate at sometime to take up an illegality if it was looked at as fairly minor, or a giant impropriety over that, in our judgment, needed to be looked at first. I would not agree at this point that this vote we are about to take specifies exactly which direction we would go. I hope that my colleague will agree with that.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I welcome the remarks by Senator Thompson. I think his statement is excellent. I think it does provide a new basis for starting ahead with these investigations, a better basis than where we were before, I am sure he would agree. It is a new day, and we can make a fresh start. We can set priorities, and those priorities can be set as a matter of judgment between us on not only just what is illegal, you would have something that is barely illegal but some giant thing that is improper that we now can look at on a priority basis, and we can make those judgments. And that is fine. I agree with that. 
I think what we have called scope, or whether you want to call it jurisdiction, we are on a much better basis than we were before, and I think we are now prepared to move ahead. I will have some other remarks in the colloquy that is to be provided in this half hour. I know that Senator Dorgan had a couple of particular things he wanted to mention. He has another commitment. And I ask if he might be able to do that now. How much time?

Mr. GLENN. I thank the Senator. 
Mr. President, the colloquy we had proposed earlier, I, in my part of this, can be rather brief, and I would allot myself such time as I may require. 
I feel very certain that the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, my chairman, will agree with this. But let me just put this forward as a colloquy so we can help clarify some of the understanding that has gone into this today. 
With the addition of the term `improper,' to expand the scope of the investigation to be conducted by our committee, the Governmental Affairs Committee, it is my understanding that the committee's jurisdiction to investigate now includes activities which are improper, even though they may not be in violation of any law or regulation. The term `improper' means not conforming to appropriate standards, and that is a broad term. I believe that the scope of the committee's investigation would cover--and this is the important part here--would cover the areas set forth in the prior unanimously approved scope of the committee's investigation that was voted out unanimously by the committee. 
I would also assume that allegations of illegality or impropriety by a reputable source, such as the sources previously used by the committee to issue the subpoenas, shall be sufficient for us to initiate investigative action if necessary. 
Would that be basically the Senator's understanding of what we have done here today?

<DOCNO>105-glenn-oh-6-19970311</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. GLENN. OK. I will certainly accept that answer now. I think the indication of what has happened here today with regard to the compromise in this particular area and on this bill is something that I think, with all the discussion, both on the floor here and privately with the different groups that have met today, shows we have made a lot of progress. It is our view that I am not going to try and pin the Senator down on every single one of these points and go through them one by one. I don't think that is necessary. I think what he has indicated is in general we are going to look into these things where there is impropriety involved, in addition to illegality, and we will make judgments on what is most important. 
We have broadened the scope tremendously from what it was before and it certainly fits more into the line of what was unanimously approved as the scope by the Governmental Affairs Committee by a unanimous vote. That has been the trend of this today, and I think this gives us a whole new broadened level of investigation and one that we welcome, because I think it will lay a better base for campaign finance reform over the long term. That is going to be very good, something that people of this country certainly need. I think, had this been just restricted just to straight violations of law, to illegalities, we would not have had that kind of scope. 
I know, with the time limits we have here today, I would like to move on. I certainly accept the Senator's view of these things as he has expressed them. I know Senator Levin had some concerns he was going to express about the processes, and have a colloquy in that particular area to try and delineate some of these things a little better and I yield him such time as he may require.

Mr. GLENN. Basically, yes, Mr. President. I think it is right that the Senator from Pennsylvania brings this up out of his own prosecutorial background. He knows how long court cases can be extended. He has had more experience, probably, than anybody in the Senate Chamber on that. So he sees a pitfall that we will have to deal with. I agree with that. 
I agree, also, that it is impossible for us at this point to say what might occur in this area and what court cases there might be or other delays or leads that we are having to follow up on that may not be wound up or not be brought to conclusion at that exact date. I think what it points out is that, as members of that committee, and as chairman and as a member of that committee, we just have to be aware that if anything like that starts to occur, we bring it back to the floor as fast as possible. That is rather key to this whole thing, because our authority is only as the Senate gives it to us to go ahead with this. 
So it is incumbent upon us to bring it back here as fast as possible to get an extension every time, or whatever else is necessary to do. I hypothesize here as to whether this happens or that happens, but the point the Senator makes is an excellent point and one we are going to have to be aware of through the years.

Mr. GLENN. I would like to engage the senior Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Tennessee in a colloquy regarding the issue of referrals to the Ethics Committee. The resolution before us, as amended, states that `the Committee on Governmental Affairs shall refer any evidence of illegal or improper activities involving any Member of the Senate revealed pursuant to the investigation authorized by subsection (b) to the Select Committee on Ethics.' 
In the event the Governmental Affairs Committee develops facts which implicate a Senator or Senators in any illegal or improper activities, as those terms are used in this resolution, they shall report such findings promptly to the Ethics Committee; however, such reporting does not preclude the Governmental Affairs Committee from continuing its investigation, provided it is not for the specific purpose of determining the culpability, or lack thereof, of such Senator or Senators.

Mr. GLENN. Madam President, we are now into the second week in March. The Senate has been operating for approximately 2 months. I don't know that we have had much in the way of accomplishment during that time period. Certainly, there are national problems that should be addressed. 
For example, we ought to be working on balancing the budget instead of just trying to pass amendments, which we tried to do, 
and it failed. We also have a series of problems with our health care system. Managed care may be saving money, but there is increasing evidence that it is happening at the expense of lower quality of health care. So, for uninsured Americans, that continues to be a major problem. As far as health care goes, we are going to have a debate, I guess, about partial-birth abortion. 
In other areas, the stock market has gone through the roof. Unemployment is at a 25-year low. But there is concern about the future, and about Social Security and Medicare. But there are no serious proposals by the Republican majority to deal with these issues. Well, today we have an opportunity. We have an opportunity to have the possibility of beginning a serious discussion about a serious issue: the campaign finance system used by both political parties in the United States. 
The American people are disgusted by what they see in campaign finance. And they should be. Along with the steady drumbeat of antigovernment ideologues, it is a major factor in America's loss of faith in our institutions of government. It is that serious. All you have to do is look at the polling data and such things as decreased participation in voting. If this trend continues, if America goes downhill because of the lack of confidence in our Federal Government, I say that we face a crisis that could literally threaten the foundation of democracy in the United States. 
There is a remedy to avert this crisis, as I see it, and to begin the restoration of public support for this system of government. The remedy requires that we reform the campaign finance system. It is a wonderful place to start because it certainly needs reforming. 
Will this get a serious examination by Congress, or will we get sidetracked by a partisan political circus? The jury is definitely out on that at this time. We have before us a resolution to fund a Senate investigation which, if the scope were made broader than it currently is, has enormous potential as a tool to stimulate public pressure on Congress to enact meaningful campaign finance reform, honest campaign finance reform. 
Recent revelations about fundraising involving 1996 Federal races are disturbing. They involve both parties in both congressional and Presidential campaigns. The truth is that the current fundraising system, both Presidential and congressional, is scandalous. Having said that, in my opinion, most Members of Congress are honest elected officials, both over in the House and here in the Senate. They are honest elected officials trying to do a good job, albeit from different political philosophies. But that is our system. But the general public perception that money gets its way in determining policy is, indeed, true for too many. 
There is a public perception that access follows money, and anybody who has been around Capitol Hill very long knows that sometimes it does. Access can alter the balance of arguments weighed by a Member and his or her staff when deciding a course of action, be it a vote on the floor or in committee, a colloquy on the Senate floor, introduction or cosponsorship of a piece of legislation, floor speech, insertion of language in a committee report, or a communication with an executive branch agency requesting an action, or the withholding of an action. 
But even when there is no connection whatsoever between a donation by a person to a politician and the latter's specific action as a legislator favoring that person, the perception of a payoff, even the possibility of a perception of a payoff, is corrosive to public trust in our Government. We must dispel this growing perception that Congress or parts of Congress are for sale if we are to reverse electoral apathy and restore faith in our Government. Gift bans have not done it. Honoraria bans have not done it. Only deep changes in the campaign finance system will do the job, and it will not be easy. 
The question is what should be the relationship of the Governmental Affairs Committee investigation to the drive for effective bipartisan campaign finance reform? The resolution before us, S. 39, as amended by the Rules Committee, states that the supplemental funds to be given to the Governmental Affairs Committee for this investigation are for the sole purpose of an investigation into illegal activities in the 1996 Federal election campaign. 
There are two things wrong with this statement of scope for the investigation. The first thing is that it is a bald-faced attempt by the Republican majority of the Rules Committee to undo a unanimous bipartisan agreement among the members of the Governmental Affairs Committee to have a broad investigation that would examine improper as well as illegal activities along with previous campaigns. Contrary to the claims of the Rules Committee chairman that his language tracks the Watergate resolution, the fact is that the Watergate resolution called for an investigation of improper and unethical activities as well as illegal ones. 
I am looking at a copy of the Watergate resolution that was passed in the Senate back in 1973. It was submitted by Senator Ervin, Sam Ervin and Mike Mansfield. In part 15 on page 8, it says they are `to look into any other activities, circumstances, materials or transactions having a tendency to prove or disprove that persons, acting either individually or in combination with others, engaged in any illegal, improper, or unethical activities in connection with the Presidential election of 1972, or any campaign, canvas, or activity related to such election.' 
That is the language of one of the parts of what the Watergate Committee was to look into--any illegal, improper, or unethical activities in connection with the Presidential election of 1972. 
The narrowing of the scope of the Governmental Affairs investigation by the Rules Committee is nothing more than a blatant pander to those elements in the Republican Party that do not wish to reform the campaign finance system and who are quite willing to scuttle the Governmental Affairs investigation if necessary to avoid creating public pressure to pass a decent bill. 
How does narrowing the scope to illegal activities avoid this problem for the Republicans? The first thing to understand is that the problem with the campaign finance system is not just what politicians do that is illegal. It is what politicians do that is legal that is an equal scandal, and it happens every single day on Capitol Hill and with both political parties. 
Let me give you an example. Let us talk about soft money. That is the best example. One of the most pernicious influences in politics these days is soft money. Let me give you an example of that. Let us say Senator X, whoever it might be, solicits $50,000 or $500,000 in soft money from a potential donor to his or her party, ostensibly for party-building purposes, get-out-the-vote drives or the like. But the party can then turn around and use the money on an issue ad during the Senator's reelection campaign that helps him or her and hurts the opponent. 
According to the Department of Justice, Senator X can even do the solicitation for that $500,000 from his or her office because the solicitation is not for his or her campaign specifically but, rather, for the Senator's party. 
This practice should be illegal, but it is not. Suppose Senator X wants a direct contribution to his or her campaign from a potential donor, direct to his personal campaign. In that case, 
Federal election law prohibits the donor from contributing more than $1,000 per person, and it must be in the donor's own name. 
But that same donor can go out and collect checks of $1,000 for Senator X from everyone he knows, bundle them together, and send them to the Senator's campaign. Let us say Senator X calls from the Senator's office for those donations. If Senator X calls, he is committing an illegal act. But if Senator X calls from outside, it is OK. 
Suppose Senator X is so grateful, wherever the call came from, for the donor's willingness to help that the next time the donor is in town and wants to talk to Senator X about a legislative matter he has an interest in, Senator X not only lets him into his office but he welcomes him and listens to his pitch. And suppose that Senator X is sufficiently concerned about maintaining the donor's political help that the Senator does what the donor wants on the issue and there was no discussion linking the donation to the donor's request or to the Senator's action. 
In that case, there has been no bribe. But it is certainly the case that Senator X made his decision on the issue as a result of the donor having had access to the Senator, access that was based at least in part on the donation the Senator was given. 
Now, suppose Senator X made the original call to the donor from the Senator's office phone instead of from an outside phone. That would be a violation of law. You cannot do that. 
Let me pose the question. Which is the worst ethical lapse, making the phone call from a legally prohibited place or letting the money influence the Senator's vote? I submit that the answer is not even close. Senator X's constituents and the people generally will have been ill served if he lets money influence his decision, and that overshadows the question of whether the phone he used was a private phone or a Government phone. 
What is the point of this fictitious example? Well, the resolution before us, which limits the scope of the investigation only to illegal activities, would allow an investigation of whether Senator X committed an illegal act by using a Government phone for the direct solicitation if there was an allegation that he had done so but would allow no investigation of the contribution, and if a soft money contribution was involved, whether Senator X's party had spent that money on certain ads helpful to the Senator's campaign, a legal practice but one that should be illegal. 
It is not just the independent expenditures by the major parties that is the problem. There are also the independent expenditures by outside private groups including tax-exempt organizations that should be investigated for possible collusion with party organizations. The Washington Post had an article yesterday concerning nonprofits. To quote them: `Mysterious organizations that funded a flurry of attack ads at the end of the 1996 election,' that were targeted mainly against Democratic candidates. No one apparently knows who supports them. One group, the Coalition for Our Children's Future, spent $700,000 on ads, mailings, phone banks, to help Republican candidates from Louisiana to California. 
Another group, Citizens for Reform, spent $2 million on ads, including a mailing labeling a Democratic candidate for Congress as sexist and anticonsumer. And this organization is tax exempt. They are not supposed to deal in political matters. In the case of tax-exempt organizations, collusion with a political party would be illegal but would not involve criminal penalties. In the case of a so-called 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization, which is prohibited from engaging in political activity, there is the question of whether the placing of certain issue ads should be considered political activity under certain circumstances. 
Will this be investigated by the Governmental Affairs Committee under the funding resolutions' current scope statement? That will depend on how the word `illegal' is interpreted. I must say, at several points along the way we have had different interpretations of that word.

Mr. GLENN. That is only the beginning of the problems with this resolution. It also requires that if any evidence of illegality is discovered in the 1996 campaign activities of a Member of Congress by a Member of Congress, then such evidence is to be referred to the Ethics Committee. 
Does that mean the committee's investigation is to be terminated at that point? And, if the evidence comes to the attention of the committee before an investigation has even been initiated, does that mean the committee is to defer to the Ethics Committee for the investigation of the Member? Does referral to the Ethics Committee mean that Governmental Affairs will defer to the Ethics Committee on any possible criminal referral to the Department of Justice? We need answers to all of those things, obviously. 
What if we are into an investigation and there is something that pops up that looks as though it might be an ethical matter and might be illegal, which this committee would be permitted to deal with? Since there is this special provision with regard to ethics in the Senate, in referring it to the Ethics Committee, do we have to stop any investigation before anything comes out beyond a point where there has been just an allegation of illegality? 
So, let me return to the question of the meaning of the word `illegal' in the resolution. What is the standard to be used by the Governmental Affairs Committee to determine that an activity involves an illegality and is therefore subject to an investigation? Is illegality meant to be equivalent to criminality? Or is it broader and includes activities that are in violation of law but subject to only civil penalties or no penalties at all? The answer to this question will determine whether the activities of tax-exempt organizations engaged in political activity will be investigated. 
I believe the questions I am raising need to be answered during this debate so Members will know precisely what they are voting on when the time comes. These questions also need to be answered in order to examine whether the 54 subpoenas issued thus far by the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee are within the new scope of the investigation. 
Let me turn to some other deficiencies in the resolution. These are also deficiencies of omission. My remarks stem once again from my belief that a balanced investigation of fundraising by both parties, highlighting legal transgressions as well as their legal but ethically dubious fundraising activities, could be effective in pointing the way toward real reform. Conversely, an unbalanced, partisan investigation suggesting that the problems lie solely or even mainly with one party would be destructive to forging a consensus and would lead to political games, possibly including an attempt to pass reform legislation crafted not so much to fix the system as to give one party a fundraising advantage over the other. 
As the ranking Democrat on Governmental Affairs, I have urged the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee to follow standard Senate practices and enter into a written agreement that the investigation will be carried out in a bipartisan manner with an agreed-upon agenda and with fairness. That involves ensuring that both the majority and minority: have contemporaneous access to all documentary evidence received by the committee; have the right to be given adequate advance notice of, to be present at, and to participate equally in all depositions and investigatory interviews; have equal opportunity to obtain and present relevant evidence on the subjects of the committee's inquiry; and, are treated equally and without discrimination in the discharge of the committee's administrative responsibilities. 
I regret to say that no agreement on these matters has been reached thus far. This has most egregiously shown up in the way subpoenas have been handled thus far. 
I am hopeful that passage of a funding resolution for the committee's investigation will be the occasion to put this investigation back on a bipartisan track. I believe that failure to do so will redound to the credit of no one and mark the first major stain on this committee's record of bipartisan cooperation during my 22-year tenure on it. 
Finally, I must comment on that part of the resolution that provides for authorization of some $450,000 in additional funds for the Rules Committee to examine those aspects of campaign fundraising that are outside the scope of the Governmental Affairs Committee's investigation under the terms of this resolution as currently written. It is certainly true that the Rules Committee has legislative jurisdiction over campaign finance reform and, therefore, can look into soft money and independent expenditures, among other things, as policy matters. 
But the Rules Committee is not basically an investigative committee. I could not recall the last time it ever issued a subpoena. We made some inquiry into this and found that no subpoenas have been issued by the committee since at least 1980. We do not know whether any were before that time or not. They may do hearings, but that is not the same as an investigation as conceived under this resolution. 
Let us not deceive the public about this. Recent press reports clearly indicated that at least two members of the Rules Committee, Republican members of the Rules Committee, would not vote for the funding resolution for the investigation that originally came out of the Governmental Affairs Committee because the scope of the investigation would have included legal as well as illegal congressional fundraising practices. Those Members were concerned that the result of such an investigation might be to raise public pressure on Congress to pass campaign finance reform legislation. 
The fact is, there is little support for campaign reform among my Republican colleagues. The McCain-Feingold bill has only one other Republican cosponsor, and that is Senator Thompson, to his credit. So we know what game is being played with the Rules Committee rewrite of the previously-agreed-to scope of the Governmental Affairs Committee's investigation. It is a game in which legal but improper congressional fundraising is kept off the table while a parade of Presidential fundraisers for the Democratic Party and the Clinton-Gore campaign are brought before the cameras at televised hearings, to give the impression that all the problems are with the Democratic Party and there is no need to change the laws. 
I do not believe it will work. I do not believe the American people are that naive. I believe they will see through such a strategy were it to unfold. Chairman Thompson has said congressional fundraising should be on the table. I agree with him. That is one of the reasons I was disappointed when none of his first 65 subpoenas were directed toward congressional fundraising. I and my Democratic colleagues will attempt to broaden the scope to include legal activities that are improper, which is where many of the major campaign finance problems are, and which should be thoroughly investigated by the Governmental Affairs Committee. So, I hope--in fact I invite Chairman Thompson to join me in cosponsoring an amendment I plan to offer to broaden the scope, and I invite him to join me in voting against tabling any such amendment. 
I also invite all Members of the Senate, Democratic and Republican, who truly want to change our system to join us. 
Let us look at it from your children's perspective of 20 years from now. Whichever party is in the majority--and that may have changed in that time, maybe before that--but look at your children as adults out there, taking part in the political system at that time. Whichever party is in the majority at that time, I am sure we can all hope that political fundraising will not be the mess that it is today. One way to gain that end is to assure that investigations are carried out now without fear or favor and spotlighting the dark corners, whether illegal or legal, but in either event, wrong, improper, and unethical. 
The resolution before us does not take us in that direction, and that is why I also urge Senator Thompson, even if we fail to pass such an amendment, to seek every opportunity at our committee level to examine and thoroughly investigate any alleged illegal fundraising activities by Members of Congress, in the House or Senate. That will at least be a start, and I pledge my full support to such efforts. 
So I await with interest his proposed agenda and subpoenas in this area. 
At the appropriate time today, before we finish this debate, I will have an amendment to submit. I would like to lay it down this evening. I doubt all the people on either side of the aisle who wish to speak on the amendment will return before we go out of session, but I would like to have time later on to submit the amendment before we go out of session this evening. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GLENN. I thank my friend from Mississippi. I just want to reinforce what the Senator from Virginia just said. Senator Ford, as ranking minority member on the Rules Committee, would normally be on the floor, managing this bill. Since I had been ranking minority member over at Governmental Affairs, which is involved with this very deeply, he asked me to take his place here today. I should have noted that at the beginning of the session today, before I made my speech. 
But he will be missed. I was sorry to see my good friend, Wendell Ford, who came here the same time I did, make a decision to 
not run again. I know some of the pangs of going through that decision, having gone through those pangs myself just a short time ago. And I am sure I will want to say more tomorrow, but that is the reason he is not here floor-managing the bill.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise not for a lengthy statement here, but just to say that most of the remarks on the other side of the aisle this afternoon have been involved with `The China Link,' as it is called on the diagram I see on the other side right now, and with the China connection, with Mr. Huang, Mr. Chung, Mr. Trie, and what may have happened. 
I am not quite sure what relevance all these things have to do with S. 39 that is before us on the floor now and which we are debating. Because everyone is agreed, everyone I know on the Rules Committee, the Governmental Affairs Committee, the White House, the President, everybody is agreed that some things went awry in this area. And even the President has said, yes, he wants to see this brought out. Let us find out what happened. Let us correct it. Let us cure it and let us get on with it. 
I do not know whether our debate here on the floor is going to take up time pushing this idea that somehow, or implying at least, that we are trying to avoid some sort of discussion or the President is trying to avoid some kind of discussion on Huang, Trie, and others, because I do not think that is the case. I know the Justice Department, as I understand it--and this is just from news reports; I have not talked to the people over there--but as I understand it, they have 25 FBI agents assigned to investigate exactly this matter that we are talking about on the floor this afternoon. So if we need to, on the Governmental Affairs Committee, get into those areas because they involve, obviously, allegations of illegality, we will do so. 
So I just want to make that comment that we are united, I think, in the Senate on both sides of the aisle and down to Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House on finding out what happened with Mr. Huang, Mr. Chung, and Mr. Trie, and bring that information out so we can correct whatever the situation was or get new legislation if that is needed to correct it. So we are all committed to that. I yield the floor. 
Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. GLENN. I thank my friend. I reply that the Governmental Affairs Committee has more broad jurisdiction on investigations than any committee here. It doesn't mean that we do those things legislatively then, but we are a committee that does investigations. We have done broad investigations in drug matters, for instance, and investigations and hearings regarding that. Yet, we turn that legislation over, we turn our information over to other people to form the legislative background they need to bring it here to the Senate. 
We have conducted hearings on espionage in the past, and we certainly don't have authority in those areas. But we are given broad investigative powers and staff and money to look into these things as part of our regular jurisdiction. 
This committee was known through the years as a committee that took on organized crime. It was known back in those days, originally, as the Truman committee, PSI subcommittee that we have, and the McClellan subcommittee. We took on organized crime. But we didn't do the legislative matters, the legislating that had to be done. We turned the results over to other committees. 
More recently, we have looked at fraudulent health programs involving the District of Columbia here and West Virginia and, I believe, part of Virginia, also. We didn't propose to do the legislation in those areas. For many years, I have personally been as involved as anybody in the Senate on matters regarding nuclear nonproliferation. Yet, primarily, that was not something we had to go ahead and put legislation in on, although I did use that to put legislation in many years ago. We have had investigations on terrorism, and it fell to other people to have the legislation.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I will not make prolonged remarks this evening, but I must reply to some of the things that have been said here because the implication, at least, has been that somehow Governmental Affairs was usurping jurisdiction or something, and that Rules are protecting their turf in making sure this jurisdiction was not taken over by Governmental Affairs. I think we need to briefly review the bidding and how we got where we are. 
When all this matter of campaign finance reform first came up, there were a number of committees in the Senate that thought they had a piece of this and wanted to have hearings or were quoted in the paper as saying they might look into it. We had Commerce, Judiciary, Foreign Relations, the Rules Committee, and Governmental Affairs--all were involved. What was decided in centering this in Governmental Affairs was not a decision made on the Democratic side at all. To concentrate this in the Governmental Affairs Committee was a decision of the Republican leadership, that they did not want this strung out all over the lot. And with Governmental Affairs having the preeminent investigative authority in the Senate, they would concentrate everything there. The newspaper reports, at least, indicated that the leadership got the other committee chairmen to sign off with that approach, and it was announced that the Governmental Affairs Committee was going to take the lead in this. 
That was not a decision made on the minority side. That was a decision made and carried out on the majority side. So there was no effort whatsoever by anybody to take some jurisdiction away from another committee. 
Now, let us follow this through just very briefly as to what happened. When did the Rules Committee finally get interested in this and decide it was in their jurisdiction? Only after the funding request came from the Governmental Affairs Committee and the members on the Rules Committee, who really do not want campaign finance reform, blocked the funding, period, not in an official committee meeting, but in a meeting just of the Republicans on that committee. 
Why did they object to the funding rules? Because they have an objection to campaign finance reform. This got into a real impasse, a real impasse with Republican leadership. So, then it became a deal cut to say we will water down what Governmental Affairs is going to do and we will let the Rules Committee handle this, because we have members opposed to campaign finance reform on the Rules Committee. 
It has been pointed out that we have members now on the Rules Committee that are also on the Governmental Affairs Committee, three crossovers, three people with dual membership on both committees, who voted on the Rules Committee to do what this Senate Resolution 39 that we are debating is supposed to do. But I would point out, those are the same three members who voted unanimously on the Governmental Affairs Committee, unanimously on the scope, unanimously on what was to be looked into, unanimously there would be no-holds-barred, unanimously we would look into soft money, 
unanimously we would look into legal, illegal, improper, whatever--wherever the track led us. That is what they voted for on the Governmental Affairs Committee, and that is the reason it went to the Rules Committee that way. 
It was only after members of the Rules Committee put this whole thing into a quagmire of dissent and were going to block any funding that this so-called compromise arrangement--or capitulation, I would term it--was worked out. And that is just exactly how this thing developed. 
So, all the talk here about how the Rules Committee members voted this so it must be right because they are also on Governmental Affairs ignores that they are the ones who voted unanimously on Governmental Affairs for the scope, for everything we wanted to look into. We hoped we could work out a goal. All of these things that were voted out of committee only got objections after it got over to the Rules Committee where any funding was stopped by the people who basically do not want any campaign finance reform. 
I hate to be so blunt, but that is exactly----

<TEXT>
Mr. GLENN. No, let me correct that, because what happened on this was that was a proposal from the Democratic side. It was voted down on Republican side. And the $6.5 million was voted out of committee to the Rules Committee and the Democrats, who had thought we could get by with a much lower figure because every other committee had, going into this investigation with the idea that you always could come back and ask for money--which was done in the case of Watergate, with five different allocations of money. They voted out of committee $6.5 million. That is what went to the Rules Committee. So we had gotten past that hurdle there. We were going with $6.5 million over at Rules, and that is when Republican members on the Rules Committee objected to going forward. That was not the Democratic side. That is how we got to where we are right now. 
So I am sure we are going to have more debate on this tomorrow, but I just thought I better indicate here, this was not Governmental Affairs trying to usurp jurisdiction. That jurisdiction was given to us by the Republican leadership in trying to combine all of the different committees that wanted this investigation into one investigation, under the prime investigative committee in the Senate, which is the Governmental Affairs Committee. That was a decision of the Republican leadership. We had nothing to do with that on our side of the aisle. It only came apart, even after it was voted out of the Governmental Affairs Committee unanimously, by all Republican members, and got over to the Rules Committee and ran into trouble with some who want no campaign finance reform and objected so strenuously that a deal had to be cut to let them have some jurisdiction back on the Rules Committee in the areas of soft money that they are so afraid will be changed, and brought it back over there where they would have more of a chance to control it. 
We, then, on the Governmental Affairs Committee, were charged with looking into only illegalities. That is a far narrower standard, when you get to investigating matters. We had hoped to have, and what the Republican members on the Governmental Affairs Committee had all voted for, was a broad investigation, no-holds-barred, let's set the basis for campaign finance reform 
for the future. That is basically what is being denied now. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, before I introduce my amendment, I would like to correct the statement I made in the earlier debate. 
The Democrats voted against the $6.5 million recommendation that came out of the committee, but we were outvoted on that at the end. We had favored the smaller amount and letting the committee back for additional allocations of money as were required later on if paydirt was being hit, if the hearings were being fruitful. 
So, the original resolution to rules went with a partisan vote on the money, but not on the scope because there was unanimous agreement on the scope. And that is what now is largely at issue here. So I just wanted to correct that so there would be no misunderstanding on it.

 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to remind my fellow colleagues that today marks the 27th anniversary of the entering into force of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, or NPT. All too often, the contributions to U.S. security made by multilateral arrangements like the NPT go unrecognized. 
I will speak today of a treaty that--with the accession by Oman last January--now has 185 members. That is more than any international security treaty in history. Though it is true that the NPT has not eradicated the global threat of nuclear weapons proliferation--and that it faces some daunting challenges ahead --the treaty has undoubtedly served U.S. interests well and deserves the respect and support of all Members of Congress and indeed all Americans.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to submit a Senate resolution funding the Committee on Governmental Affairs for a special investigation of Federal election campaign fundraising and expenditure practices. 
Mr. President, this resolution is in response to the growing need for a fair, bipartisan investigation of the disturbing pattern of campaign fundraising at both the Presidential and congressional level in recent elections, as well as the need for campaign finance reform. 
The resolution incorporates the investigatory scope agreed upon by a vote of the Governmental Affairs Committee at its meeting on January 30, 1997. It also incorporates procedures to help ensure that the investigation will be bipartisan. This is critical to the success of the investigation, if success is defined in terms of forward movement of reform of our campaign fundraising practices. And reform can only occur if the public realizes the truth about campaign fundraising--that the abuses do not lie only on one side. 
Indeed, an unbalanced, partisan investigation that suggested that all the problems lie solely or even mainly with one party would be destructive to forging a consensus, and would lead to more political games, possibly including an attempt to pass reform legislation crafted not so much to fix the system as to give one party a fundraising advantage over the other. 
As the Ranking Democrat on Governmental Affairs, I have urged the Chairman and the other Republican members of the committee to follow standard Senate practice and enter into an agreement that the investigation will be conducted in a bipartisan manner with a balanced agenda, a clear statement of mission and legislative purpose, a fair set of rules of procedure, a timeframe for completion of the investigation with provision for extension if necessary, and a reasonable amount of money. 
Unfortunately and most disappoint-edly, agreement has eluded us thus far, despite many hours of discussion. 
Much attention has been lavished in the press on the difference between the proposed funding of this investigation by the Republican side--originally $6.5 million, subsequently reduced to $5.7 million after receipt of assurances that 10 FBI personnel would be detailed to the committee--and the Democratic side--an initial outlay of $1.8 million with provision for additional funds to be considered if necessary. But the length of the investigation and the fairness of the investigation are or equal importance. 
Length is important because an investigation that includes congressional fundraising as one of its foci should not extend significantly into an election year. 
Fairness is important if there is to be any credibility to the investigation. 
There has been, in my view, a certain amount of disinformation that has been disseminated about the position of the Democratic side regarding this investigation. I will have much to say about that at a later time. For now, I believe it is important for the public to know precisely what Democrats have been proposing for this investigation. This resolution incorporates these proposals. 
The resolution calls for a fair, bipartisan, adequately funded, potentially yearlong investigation into both Presidential and congressional fundraising practices, and requires that the McCain-Feingold bill be brought to the floor for consideration no later than May 1, 1997. 
I believe this is a reasonable proposal and I urge its passage.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to add my comments to the many others who have voiced their opposition to Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget constitutional amendment. 
Mr. President, like the others before me, let me preface my comments by stating clearly that I support balancing the Federal budget. I have for a long time. I wanted to balance the Federal budget clear back when it was only $1 trillion way back in the days when Jimmy Carter was still President. I note that the total Federal debt at that time was still under $1 trillion, totaled up for every President between George Washington and the end of the Carter years. 
So I do not come lately to this idea of balancing the Federal budget. I wholeheartedly agree we need to exercise discipline to both balance the budget and eliminate the deficit. But, Mr. President, I do not believe that changing our Constitution to require a balanced budget is in this country's best interests. For reasons I will outline, I believe that a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget is far more likely to cause more trouble, more harm, than good. 
The amendment before the Senate would dramatically change the way our political process has worked for over 200 years. While there have been times when partisan fighting may have caused what many term gridlock, I do not believe it is necessary or desirable to turn the fundamental concept of our system of Government on its head. 
Moreover, this amendment would ensure that gridlock is the rule rather than the exception. By requiring supermajorities in order to conduct the routine business of the Congress, this amendment overthrows the concept of majority rule and empowers minority factions to hold the Congress and the country hostage. I submit that this type of minority control of our Government is the exact evil the framers sought to eliminate in the drafting of our Constitution. For this reason alone I oppose the balanced budget constitutional amendment. 
It is not hyperbole when I say it is dangerous to our form of Government. Compounding the problem, Mr. President, is the fact that the proponents of this amendment would topple one of the basic tenets of our Government, as I see it, for no reason at all. 
First, from a historical perspective, the constitutional amendment is not needed. The only time in this country's history outside of times of war, the Great Depression, or recession that we have run up a significant deficit, one viewed as unmanageable, is in the preceding two decades through our time right now on the floor. We had the experiments in supply-side economics back during the last 12 years before President Clinton came in, which ran our debt from $1 trillion up to nearly $5 trillion. 
But we are no longer debating how we got into this situation we find ourselves in, pointing fingers, or placing blame for a deficit so staggering that it is beyond our comprehension or imagination. Instead, a more productive political consensus does now exist to bring the budget into balance and eliminate our deficit. So I do not think we need a constitutional requirement to balance the budget. Congress and the President, working together, have the ability, and now, I believe, the will to bring our budget into balance. 
Now, everybody describes this as being a political climate that is overly divisive. I agree. Congress in both Houses, on both sides of the aisle, and the President, all profess to want a balanced budget, and I do not doubt that. I think everyone does, and they want to eliminate the huge deficit that is the legacy of the 1980s. Now we have different ways we are looking at this thing, but we have made substantial strides in at least getting unanimous consent or unanimous opinion that this is something that we do have to deal with and do have to deal with now. But there are still some very basic disagreements on how to achieve the balance and how to reduce the deficit. 
The Democrats and Republicans alike have proposed balancing the budget by the year 2002, and the deficit has been reduced from 5.1 percent of our gross domestic product in fiscal year 1986 to only 1.4 percent in fiscal year 1996. Mr. President, 5.1 of GDP in 1986 down to 1.4 percent just 10 years later in 1996. Right here and right now we are working toward achieving the very goal of the balanced budget constitutional amendment without sacrificing our democratic form of Government to get there. 
I might put those figures in a different term. When President Clinton came in, our national budget deficit was running at $290 billion a year. We passed on this very floor one of the toughest votes that many of us have made since being in the Senate. We passed during the Reconciliation Act in August of 1993 the President's program, without having one single Republican vote--not a one in either the Senate or the House of Representatives; not a one--and there were all sorts of predictions about what horrible things were going to happen to the economy and the millions of unemployed that would be added to the rolls. What happened? Well, that did not happen and we have gone on with a very, very, strong economy, and we have gone from a budget deficit of $290 billion down to $107 billion for the latest estimate for 
what 1996 will turn out to be. 
We are in the middle of doing something right here. We are doing it right now with action that we have taken in this Congress. This is not something we are waiting for and hoping for some magic wand like a balanced budget amendment. This is something that we are doing right now and we are headed toward a balanced budget. I grant anyone that wants to discuss this, we, in fact, are looking forward to some times out here where it will be tougher to do that, tougher to balance the budget. We know that. But that will require some equally tough votes on this floor. 
I hope when we make those tough votes on this floor we have support from the other side of the aisle that we did not have when we made that vote the summer of 1993. Now, in Treasury Secretary Rubin's words, a balanced budget constitutional amendment `could turn slowdowns into recessions, and average recessions into more severe ones,' and he added, `it would seriously increase the risk of default on our national debt.' 
Those are quotes taken from Secretary Rubin's February 2, op-ed in the the Washington Post. I ask unanimous consent that his Washington Post op-ed piece be printed at the end of my remarks.

Mr. GLENN. It is a thoughtful piece that makes a very powerful argument against this amendment. 
Economists consider a balanced budget requirement to be what they would call procyclical. In other words, adding to the cycle instead of correcting the cycle. It makes it worse. It is an economic autopilot. When revenues are slow coming into the Federal coffers because the economy is slow, deeper spending cuts have to be made to make up for the revenue shortfall in order to keep the budget in balance. 
We have AFDC, food stamps, unemployment insurance, trade adjustments assistance, all of these things cut in during the beginning of a recessionary period, and the farther we get into that approach to a depression the more these programs sort of prime the pump or level things off. There is no way that can be shown better than the chart that has been on the floor here many, many times in the past. I will hold this up to illustrate, but we have seen this real economic growth, and you can see what happened on this chart. Way back in the 1880's and 1900's on the wide cyclical swings and what happened post World War II, and we got some of the countercyclical programs in place. 
Look how the economy has just leveled out in that period of time. The economy has leveled out with no great huge swings down like we had during the Great Depression when I was a boy back home in New Concord, OH. These are things that would happen again, we would get back into the wild swings, if we, indeed, had the balanced budget amendment passed, because there is no other way to get the money to take care of the requirements of a balanced budget amendment unless you either cut many of those programs back or raise taxes. That is the other source of revenue. If you did that, either one of those things would be exactly the wrong thing to do and would add to the inclination, the trend, toward a cycle that we want to stamp out, not make worse. 
It is sort of a perverse, Look, Ma, no hands approach to budget, the exact wrong thing for a slow economy. That is why Secretary Rubin says the balanced budget amendment `can take an economic slowdown and turn it into a recession and then take a recession and make it even worse.' 
I submit that is probably exactly an analysis that most economists would show happened back during the days of Herbert Hoover when he tried to raise taxes to make sure we were not going into more of a deficit position. 
I cannot believe the proponents intend to force us into this kind of an economic straitjacket. I know the people across the country want a balanced budget. So they say, `Balanced budget amendment, oh, that sounds great, that sounds magical after the 
last 12 or 14 years when we had budgets run sky-high and deficits running sky-high.' So that sounds very attractive. 
I think when the people of this country know what will be cut, they are informed about what will be cut, informed they will have difficulty within their communities with AFDC and food stamps and unemployment insurance and things like that that are administered by the States, but partly with Federal dollars, then I think they would realize this is more of a danger than anything they have come up against for some time. 
Mr. President, I grew up during the Great Depression. I was about 10 or 12 years old in the depths of the Great Depression. During those 4 years we had 20 percent of the country unemployed and 1 year when almost 25 percent were unemployed. What happened? The country had hit a situation it had never been able to handle before. 
We always were proud in this country of families taking care of families, of communities taking care of themselves. They didn't look for outside help. In those days of the Great Depression, in the town of New Concord, OH, my hometown, everybody planted big gardens. My dad rented an extra couple of acres, in addition to our big garden, and we grew our own food and took it down and gave it to neighbors. We shared in those days. That's how we got by. 
But everybody wasn't that fortunate. In some of our cities, we had soup kitchens on the corner where people could get something to eat in order to keep them going. We used to see what we called the `bums' going by on Route 40, and that went right by our house, as a matter of fact. We called them the `bums' because they were people who were, quite often, walking or getting a ride in a railroad boxcar across country someplace. They would get off sometimes and come up to the house and knock on the back door and ask my mother if she could give them something to eat. She never turned anyone down that came to that back door, I can guarantee you that. They were good people, down on their luck. I'm sure some were deadbeats that weren't much to begin with. But they were Americans and they were hungry, and it was the Great Depression and it was tough. 
The movie reels of those days show the Okies heading west out of the dust pit in Oklahoma with the mattress on top of the car, because communities had lost control. What happened? Programs were put in by Roosevelt--programs that we still argue about on the floor of the Senate to this day--and they primed the pump. That is the point I want to make. They primed the pump. They may have been very wasteful for 1 or 2 years, but they primed the pump and got our economy going again. You can make a million jokes about those time periods, but they are not a joke, as far as I am concerned, because I remember them very well. 
I remember one conversation between my dad and mother that I will never forget as long as I live. We had finished dinner and I went in the other room. I heard them quietly talking at the kitchen table, and they were discussing whether the mortgage was going to be foreclosed on our home. You talk about striking terror in the heart of a 10-year-old boy--that was me. I didn't know where we were going to go. That was a bad one. Do you know what happened? FHA was put in, and it was possible to negotiate a mortgage then with that kind of a Government guarantee that helped people like my dad and mom have a shot at keeping the home. Lots of mortgages were foreclosed and people could not keep their homes. Those are the days we were living in then. 
The point I'm making is that the pump-priming efforts at that time worked. They largely put our economy back to work again and got it going again. It wasn't perfect and never had been completely healed until we got through World War II, I guess. That was the ultimate primer of pumps, World War II. Anyway, the program of having countercyclical funds that cut in when a recession starts or when a downturn really gets serious is something that works. It works just as well as it did back in those days of the Great Depression. It worked, obviously, from the time, since 1946, that we started the first of these programs, and we have built on similar programs since that time that really do work. 
A balanced budget amendment would force us, in a time when we are in deficit, to dig into those things and cut down on those funds, or raise taxes, either of which would be exactly the wrong thing to do at that cycle of depression or near depression. 
Another truly frightening consequence of the adoption of a balanced budget requirement is the fact that it puts the creditworthiness of the United States of America at risk. Mr. President, this is a concept that I admit I find to be almost unimaginable. By requiring a supermajority to raise the debt ceiling, this constitutional amendment would allow 41 Members of this body--not a majority, but a minority of the Senate--to trade the creditworthiness of this country for the passage of legislation that otherwise would not pass the Senate. In other 
words, it is what has been termed in the past as the `tyranny of the minority.' 
Try and imagine what default by the Government of the United States of America would do to the world's financial markets. I can't. I am not saying this will happen necessarily, Mr. President, but I cannot support an amendment to our Constitution that would allow a minority to dictate legislation to a majority of the Senate or place our creditworthiness at risk. 
I want to take a minute to talk about what this amendment would do to our ability to make expenditures in order to respond to emergencies, natural disasters, or even military operations, like Desert Shield, where we were not technically engaged in a military conflict. I will only take a minute. This amendment prevents us from doing anything in these situations without the agreement of a supermajority, for all intents and purposes--even for military. The practical implications of this amendment are that Congress may be able to offer assistance to tornado or hurricane victims, or victims of any other natural disaster, if that disaster happens early in a fiscal year because only a majority vote would probably be necessary while we are still on budget, while things are looking well. But if a disaster happens in the third or fourth quarter of the fiscal year, those disaster victims are on their own, unless three-fifths of the Congress agrees to provide some sort of assistance. 
These same accounting practicalities will not be lost on our potential adversaries, either. I don't think it is too big a leap of logic to say that Saddam Hussein would not have to be a financial genius to figure out that if he wants to make another run at Kuwait, it is better to move the republican guard units in the third or fourth quarter of a fiscal year, because it will take the action of three-fifths of both Houses of Congress to approve funding for any military operations, which would bring the budget out of balance. 
Mr. President, that is a completely unacceptable way for the United States of America to act, I feel. That is the straitjacket that this balanced budget amendment would put us into if it were passed. 
So, to me, these are some very serious flaws in the constitutional requirement. There are also separation of powers concerns raised by this amendment. Let us take the situation in which it is discovered during a fiscal year that the budget will not balance and that outlays will exceed expenditures. If the Congress fails to approve additional spending by the required three-fifths majority, the President might feel compelled to impound funds in order to bring the budget into balance. Now, the President would decide what to fund and what not to fund. Mr. President, let me state that again. The President, in that situation, would decide what to fund and what not to fund, because that is what he would be required to do by law. This represents a shift in power to the President that once rested with a simple majority in the Congress. 
A similar troubling situation would be where the budget goes out of balance or never gets into balance, and the President does not correct the situation. Say the President doesn't want to do anything about this. He says, OK, we are not going to correct it. What do we do? In that circumstance, do you know what would happen? The courts would step in and decide which programs would be funded and which programs would not be funded, again, taking away what has heretofore been a congressional prerogative. 
Then there are equity issues that argue against passage of the balanced budget constitutional amendment. This amendment is a policy decision not just about how to keep the books, but also about who will benefit from Federal spending programs. It cannot be denied, and should not be overlooked, that the Tax Code's tax breaks to individuals and corporations are a type of Government spending. Not everyone realizes it, but when an individual's or corporation's tax burden is reduced by a tax break, that is Government spending, and we should not forget that. Eliminating 
these tax breaks is considered increasing revenues. Under the balanced budget amendment before us, Congress can increase revenues only by a majority vote of both Houses. 
In contrast, cutting funding for programs requires only a majority vote by those present and voting or could even be passed on a voice vote. This is not an esoteric point, Mr. President, because in program terms, this amendment creates a presumption in favor of cutting funding for programs because it is easier to do. I argue that this presumption favors the more affluent in our society, because their Federal spending programs, known as the Tax Code, are more difficult to cut than the spending programs of the less affluent. 
That kind of an imbalance just plain is not fair. 
Finally, Mr. President, I must mention the relationship that exists between this balanced budget amendment and Social Security. As the baby boom generation reaches retirement age, Social Security expenditures will increase dramatically. 
And despite the fact that some action has been taken in anticipation of this demographic shift in the population, this balanced budget amendment would have us pay for baby boom Social Security out of current year revenues and will likely break the bank. 
Right now, we are paying more into Social Security so that we can generate surpluses to pay for the baby boomers when they reach retirement age. This approach is far sounder than expecting to pay this enormous expense out of a single year's revenues. I'm afraid that the only way we would get there under a balanced budget requirement is either to reduce substantially the benefit baby boomers receive or cut radically other Government programs. 
This is just another example of where, in my view, a constitutional requirement to balance the budget in the manner proposed will do more harm than good. 
Mr. President, we all want to eliminate the enormous deficits of the recent past. We all want to bring the budget into balance and keep it in balance when it makes sense to do so. And, it would be a lot easier to stand here and have the American taxpayer believe that supporting this legislation is a simple way to solve all of our problems. 
But it's not the right thing to do, Mr. President. This legislation forces this country into a budgetary straightjacket and it limits democracy as we have known it for more than 200 years. 
It's unsound from an economic perspective and it is unfair to the less wealthy. It puts this Nation's security at risk and it prevents us from responding to disasters. 
And it could result in the elimination of virtually all Government programs except Social Security once the baby boom reaches retirement age. 
As I said, Mr. President, it would be easy to say that I support the legislation before us because the concept of requiring a balanced budget appeals to the average American--but only on a superficial level. 
Regrettably, for the reasons I've outlined, the solution isn't so simple and I cannot support this legislation. 
Mr. President, let me just summarize once again. 
We are on the way to a balanced budget now with the existing Federal budgeting processes. We have been since the summer of 1993. I do not think most Americans yet have gotten this fact driven home to them. They are so accustomed to deficits coming out of Washington that they can't believe that we really are heading toward a balanced budget. We can't do it all in 1 year or we would destroy the economy. But what we have done is, with the budget reconciliation bill that was passed in August 1993, we are proceeding step by step toward a balanced budget. It has gone from a budget deficit of $290 billion a year when President Clinton came into office down to an estimated $107 billion for the year 1996. That is certainly measurable progress. It was estimated earlier that would go down this year to about $40 billion. That may be revised up a little. We have to take some action to do that. 
But to go the drastic step of a balanced budget amendment that would deal so unfairly with so many people I think is something that we do not want to do. 
Mr. President, we have programs that are called countercyclical. Those programs cut in as the economy gets worse. They automatically cut in and dampen that slide and bring it back up again. It prevents things like the deep Depression of the early thirties and all of the wild swings that used to occur back before we had some of these countercyclical programs. 
There is no way that you can get by it with a balanced budget amendment. You are going to be cutting some of these programs like AFDC, Social Security, food stamps, unemployment insurance, maybe Medicaid, and trade adjustment assistance. Those are all things that would be targets for potential cuts. The money has to come from somewhere. With the balanced budget amendment you have no choice but to cut, or, if you want to keep the balance, raise taxes, either one of which would be absolutely wrong on an economic cycle basis. 
Mr. President, for all of those reasons, and others that I have not even mentioned here today but which Mr. Rubin refers to in his Outlook piece in the Washington Post that I asked to be placed in the Record, I think it would be unwise to go for a balanced budget amendment that puts us in an economic straitjacket. I think we need to continue our efforts here on a bipartisan basis, on both sides, here and over in the House, and do the things that we see are working right now with our budget. Continue those, and we can have a balanced budget if we all work together on this without violating the Constitution or without going back into the Constitution, which will enable us to do it.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I just wanted to thank my good friend for those overly generous and very kind remarks. 
It was not without a lot of feeling and emotion that I made the decision not to run again in 1998. But, as I said, we have never invented a cure for the common birthday. And at the end of my next term I would be 83, if I assumed that I won. It was for that reason and that reason only that I chose not to run. 
My good friend, the minority leader, is absolutely right. I think one of the biggest things we have to face is some of the disparaging remarks about Government when some people talk down Government. And we are going to be working on those things over the next 2 years. 
I happened to be in the cloakroom. I had been in another meeting, and just happened to come out here on the floor. I had not realized that this was going to be a time when the minority leader was going to be making the remarks. And I just wanted to say how much I appreciate it.

Mr. GLENN. Today I am releasing a report, prepared at my direction by the minority staff of the Governmental Affairs Committee, on property and asset management at the Department of Energy. The report, aptly titled `Lost and Still Missing,' discusses at some length the chronic personal property management problems at the Department, problems that have resulted in the loss of millions of dollars worth of taxpayer-purchased equipment. Recently, DOE has made some progress in tackling this problem, but much more needs to be done. 
For many years, missing property and equipment and poor inventory controls have been a major problem at the Department of Energy. Estimates by the IG and GAO of the value of lost and unaccounted for equipment have ranged from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. Missing equipment includes computers, furniture, machine tools, electric pumps, and cameras, plus more exotic items like semi- and flatbed trailers, electronic switchgear, nuclear fuel reprocessing equipment and technology, diesel engines, cranes and armored personnel carriers. 
So we are not talking about a few missing pencils and paper clips. These are costly items. And all too often it appears that this material just flies out of DOE inventory and disappears into thin air. 
Furthermore, equipment in working order and usable supplies have been sold as surplus for a small fraction of their market value. Other equipment has been left outdoors to be ruined by the elements. 
Finally, many of the missing items are national security sensitive and did not go through proper demilitarization and declassification procedures. 
Our review also found that the problem of missing property and poor inventory controls is not unique to any one DOE site, but is prevalent at numerous sites, including, among others, the Portsmouth Gas Centrifuge Enrichment Plant, the Rocky Flats Plant, the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Fernald Environmental Restoration Corporation, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The specific problems at each site are discussed at length in the report. Some go back a couple of years, others are more recent. Let me give you a few examples. 
Rocky Flats, CO--GAO identified $29 million in missing equipment. Missing items included: a semi-trailer, a boat, forklifts, furnaces, over 1,800 pieces of computer equipment, and 8 armored personnel carriers. The armored personnel carriers are a story in their own right. DOE initially donated the 8 carriers to a military museum, but did not demilitarize them. The museum gave one of the carriers away, which was subsequently resold twice before winding up in the hands of a man who supplies props to Hollywood movie studios. Since then, DOE has repossessed the vehicles. 
Idaho National Engineering Laboratory--DOE sold as surplus national security sensitive nuclear fuel reprocessing equipment to a scrap dealer for $154,000 who then tried to sell it to a British company. Once the Department discovered its mistake, it bought back the equipment for $475,000. A separate sale to the same individual included between 25 and 50 personal computers whose hard drives were not sanitized in accordance with Department and GSA regulations. Unfortunately because INEL's records were so poor, it was not possible to determine exactly how many computers were sold, or, more importantly, whether they contained national security sensitive or restricted data. 
Sandia, NM--An on-site inspection by the inspector general revealed that computers, machine tools, furniture, and rolls of cable were left outside for long periods of time. When Sandia officials tried to reuse the equipment, they discovered that it had been ruined by the elements. Other equipment had been improperly mixed with radiologically-contaminated items. 
Portsmouth, OH--Equipment valued at $35 million was sold for less than $2 million. DOE's own documents indicate that some of this equipment may be nuclear proliferation sensitive. This includes technology used in the enrichment of uranium. 
Why do these problems exist? It is a simple two-word answer. Poor management. 
In some cases, the Department failed to provide effective policy, or negotiated management and operating contracts that did not meet its own regulations on property management; in others, the field offices failed to provide adequate oversight, especially in the development and review of property management systems. These failures have been compounded by antiquated property tracking systems with poor records, lack of proper training for employees charged with property management, wide variations in local policies that implement Department regulations, and, for one site at least--Rocky Flats--a failure, both in the field and at headquarters, to follow up on cases where there was reason to suspect theft. 
The main reason for the Department's pervasive and decades-long problems with property management likely lies in its perception of the importance of its national security mission. This perception has resulted in the downgrading in importance of more routine responsibilities, such as proper accounting, custodianship, and disposal of equipment and other personal property. As one high-ranking Department official was quoted in the Washington Post: `When it's the life and death of civilization, people start being sloppy about some other things.' That statement is grandiloquent excess at best, and utter nonsense as an excuse for poor management. In any case, the Department must finally recognize that its cold war mission is over. Now more than ever, the taxpayers are demanding cost-effective Government. 
In and of themselves the personal property problems discussed in the report are significant and deserve management attention. The importance of addressing these problems is further 
compounded because DOE is just beginning to address long-term downsizing issues associated with the changes from its cold war mission. For example, within the next 10 years, DOE's installed capacity to produce and test nuclear weapons will be reduced to 10 percent of its cold war level. As a result DOE will need to dispose of thousands of fixed assets--including buildings, real property, vehicles, equipment, precious metals, fuel, et cetera. To manage this asset disposition process efficiently, DOE will need to carefully take to heart the lessons learned from the personal property management problems discussed in this report. 
Recently the Department has taken encouraging and good faith efforts to correct some of these deficiencies, including the renegotiation of the personal property requirements in both new and existing M and O contracts, and implementing guidance and regulations on the handling of proliferation sensitive property. However, these efforts must be continued and expanded. 
The report contains a number of recommendations on ways to improve personal property management. Our principal recommendation is that the Department establish a centralized Office of Property and Asset Management that would report directly to the Secretary. Currently, personal property, real property, and asset management responsibilities are spread across too many offices, both at headquarters and in the field, and that is one reason why the Department has such a problem. No one is accountable. 
I will be taking this and the other recommendations up with Secretary-designee Pena as he goes through the confirmation process. I am sending letters today to both Chairman Murkowski and Ranking Member Bumpers of the Energy Committee in the hope that they will address the matter during confirmation hearings. This issue needs to be addressed at the highest level, not relegated to the bureaucratic backwaters as all too often has happened in the past. 
In closing, our review is based on reports from the General Accounting Office and the DOE inspector general, documents obtained from the Department, interviews with Department officials, committee hearing records, press accounts and official DOE responses to questions that both the staff and I addressed to the Department. We have copies of the full report for those who would like it, and they could request it from my office.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to my friend, the senior Senator from Tennessee and the chairman of our committee, and heard him describe an investigation that he plans to conduct as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee. I welcome his comments. 
As the ranking member of the committee and as someone who was chairman for some 8 years, this can be a most important hearing for our committee. Today I want to publicly pledge to him my best efforts to cooperate in establishing the bipartisan atmosphere that he called for and that I believe Senator Thompson genuinely wants to have as we go forward. 
I am pleased that Chairman Thompson in his opening remarks mentioned the importance of defining the scope of the investigation and its purpose. He also talked about principles that should be applied if the investigation is to be successful. 
I will refer back to these principles a little later in my remarks. But I think it was helpful that Chairman Thompson included a partial list of areas to be considered. There is no question that the issues raised in his list are among those that ought to be examined, and I support them. I agree with him fully when we talk about the informing function of Congress, but I agree with it more as a starting point than as an end to our investigation. 
I think it becomes far more meaningful that instead of just limiting this to the 1996 Presidential campaign, we also use this informing function to recommend what can be done about the situation we are investigating. I think that is what the American people want. 
So I think that a more meaningful, fair list must include additional questions about improper practices in national campaigns. In addition to looking at the problem of foreign contributions, which certainly should be looked at, the Governmental Affairs Committee must look, for example, at the problem of soft money used by unregistered organizations without disclosure and without limitation to influence elections, and the misuse of Government offices and staff for political purposes, and abuses of power in coercing campaign contributions, the misuse of charitable and other organizations and promises of special access to Government-elected officials. The Governmental Affairs Committee should look into these types of practices whether examples are found in connection with the executive or the legislative branch. 
My point, Mr. President, is this: There is no end to the questions that might be asked about improper or illegal fundraising and spending in political campaigns. So we need to establish objectives for the investigation without making the inquiry too narrow and thereby risk at least a perceived partisan approach. Defining the committee's objectives will help determine the scope of the investigation, but, most of all, the committee's scope should be determined by the committee's purpose in these investigations. Any major Senate investigation --and this will be one--ought to have a clear purpose. 
To make an analogy, I recall many of my colleagues asking on this Senate floor not too long ago when we were considering United States entry into Bosnia, what is the exit strategy? Demands were made for an exit strategy before there would be a vote. 
That was a reasonable question then, and I think it is a reasonable question in regard to this inquiry. In each context, the exit strategy is inseparably linked to purpose. What is the purpose of this investigation? Or perhaps the better question to ask now is, what should be the purpose of this investigation? 
The chairman has stated he intends this exercise to inform the public. That is one of our purposes as an oversight and investigatory committee, so I support that fully and completely. I do not think it is enough that we view our purpose as informational only. We need to take the next step. We need to correct the problems with our campaign system. That is what the American public wants. I think that is what we want on both sides of the aisle. That is what both political parties have said they want. It means that to correct the problems, we are going to have to investigate then wherever those problems may be, not just on a narrowly defined limit of the last election. 
All the questions posed by my distinguished colleague in his remarks point to campaign finance practices that may be illegal or, if not, in my view ought to be illegal. I happen to think that the reform of campaign finance laws should be our daily objective in this Congress. However, I am convinced that the fight over passing real campaign finance reform will not be won until the pressure from the American people becomes overwhelming, and I think these hearings and this investigation can make that interest overwhelming. That is the reason I think we should go the next step. 
This investigation, if done right--and I am convinced it will be--could be the vehicle to create that pressure. But it 
will not happen if this investigation somehow turns into partisan pointing and bickering back and forth, and I do not think it will happen if the inquiry drags on into next year, an election year, when changing the campaign finance laws will be virtually impossible. 
If we do not use this unique opportunity to reach real reform, the American people will have a tendency to say a pox on both our houses, and I think they will probably be right. 
So I say to Chairman Thompson and my Republican colleagues, let us not only inform but let us take that next step of enactment of campaign finance reform this year as our goal and as a major purpose of this investigation. Inform, certainly, but take the next step as well. 
Let us examine the most important and egregious set of political fundraising and spending practices--not just pointing at one spot but let us look at the practice. Let us write a report this year that tells the American people really how badly this system has been operating and how it should be fixed. And Heaven knows, we are experts on it because we deal with this system every day and every time we have to run for reelection. And then let us go out and fix it before the year is over. 
Is there misuse, for instance, of nonprofits and tax exempts? There is misuse of foreign funds; we know that. What are the major misuses of soft money? What are the misuses of Government itself? And wherever we need to go to get information that helps us correct those problems and others is where we should go. 
These, Mr. President, are my thoughts about purposes and scope and duration of this investigation. So I think we need to devote the next few weeks to an effort hopefully integrating Chairman Thompson's vision of this investigation with what I have suggested here today, that we go beyond just the informational role and try and make some suggestions to fix the system. 
Then we need to come back to the Senate--together perhaps--and present our plan for approval by the full body because the Senate will be very much involved with this whole effort. This inquiry presents us with an opportunity to accomplish something together. We have had people on both sides of the aisle this year in positions of leadership and regular membership talk about how we must work together this year. We have come off a couple of bruising years here in the Congress of the United States, so I view this inquiry as an opportunity, truly an opportunity as Democrats and Republicans that will be worthwhile and lasting for the American people. 
As I indicated earlier in my remarks, I wish to address the issue of principles in the conduct of this investigation. The Senator from Tennessee made some very constructive remarks in his presentation regarding the role of the minority and the relationship of majority to minority in the conduct of this investigation, and I thank him for that and I wish to elaborate on them just a little bit. 
First, to assure that the committee's investigation is fair, bipartisan, and legislatively productive, I think it is vital the Senate define the scope and procedures and duration of the investigation in the omnibus committee funding resolution. 
Now, a definition of scope and duration will enable the Senate in providing funds for the investigation to establish what it is authorizing, the subjects about which it wishes to learn from the committee, and when it wishes the committee to report. There should also be a specification of even-handed procedural ground rules for the investigation. 
For example, the majority and minority should have contemporaneous access to all documentary evidence received by the committee. The majority and minority should have the right to be present at and participate equally in all depositions and investigatory interviews. And the majority and minority should have equal opportunity to obtain and present relevant testimonial and documentary evidence on the subjects of the committee's inquiry. 
These are just safeguards for a fair and bipartisan inquiry which is in keeping with contemporary Senate practice. This is the way the last several Senate investigations have been done, and Senate practice from investigations of this kind dictate that it should be expressly spelled out before the actual investigating begins so we do not get into an unpleasant disagreement in the middle of the hearings. 
Also, the minority should have sufficient personnel and resources to enable it to take part fully in acquiring and analyzing evidence. That may be a problem because ordinarily the committee split on resources here in the Senate is one-third/two-thirds. I do not anticipate that is going to change in this investigation. But it means on the minority side, that to have an even prospect of having an even ability to look at areas we might want to explore, we are at a disadvantage going in. 
So it is obvious that many issues will have to be negotiated in order to reduce the risk that the Governmental Affairs investigation degenerates into a partisan finger pointing exercise. I certainly do not want to see that happen. 
All of us in the Senate, and in particular all of us on the committee, have a grave responsibility. That responsibility is to ensure that this investigation moves forward in a constructive and bipartisan manner. I look forward to mutual respect among all participants. Most of all, we need to enter into this with the interests of the American people uppermost in our minds, rather than any partisan political advantage. And that means looking in all directions, wherever we find any information that may direct us to what I see as the secondary objective of our hearings, and that is not only to inform but to recommend ways to correct these problems so we do not go on into the next election with some of the same abuses taking place all over the country that occurred in this last election. 
My distinguished chairman has said this is his aim. I certainly take him at his word. He is a man of his word. I know that. We want to work together on this. So I hope we can come quickly to an agreement on scope, on time, on process, on cost of the investigation, and place that agreement in the funding resolution for the Governmental Affairs Committee. 
This can be a most important activity we are about to embark on here. From all appearances it is going to be fairly long and arduous, and I think it is important we set these kinds of rules before we get going; not important just for us on a personal basis here, but it is important that somebody work this out for the American people. That is what this committee has the opportunity to do. 
I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I associate myself with the remarks all the people made regarding our new Secretary of Defense, now made official in that capacity this afternoon. 
I have known Bill for many years. I worked with him. I think he will be a great Secretary of Defense. He will try to fill some very big shoes over there that Bill Perry leaves, who I think turned into one of the greatest Secretaries of Defense since there has been that position in Government. 
But I have talked to Bill personally. He knows my admiration for him and my support for him in that office. So I just want to associate myself with all the other fine congratulations that are being offered here on the floor today. 
Madam President, I also rise today to introduce the Human Research Subject Protection Act of 1997.

Mr. GLENN. Madam President, if I approached any Senator here and I said, `You did not know it, but the last time they went to the doctor or went to the hospital, your wife or your husband or your daughter or your son became the subject of a medical experiment that they were not even told about. They were given medicine, they were given pills, they were given radiation, they were given something and were not even told about this, were not even informed about it, yet they are under some experimental research that might possibly do them harm--maybe some good will come out of it, but maybe it will do them harm also--but they do not know about it,' people would laugh at that and say that is ridiculous. That cannot possibly happen in this country. Yet, that very situation is what this piece of legislation is supposed to address. 
I have been in public life and have served this country for many years. Frankly, I do not think too many things that I see surprise me anymore about our laws and about Government. Three years ago, though, I began to learn about a gap in our legal system that does truly concern me. In 1993 the Governmental Affairs Committee began to investigate the cold war radiation experiments. These experiments are one of the unfortunate legacies of the cold war, when our Government sponsored experiments involving radiation on our own citizens without their consent. They did not even know the experiments were being run on them. It was without their consent. 
One of the most infamous of these experiments took place in my own State of Ohio, when scores of patients at the University of Cincinnati were subjected to large doses of radiation during experimental treatments, without their consent, without their informed consent. During the course of this investigation, I began to ask the question, what protections are in place to prevent such abuses from happening again? What law prohibits experimenting on people without their informed consent? 
What I found, when I looked into it, is there is no law on the books requiring that informed consent be obtained. More important, I believe there is a need for such a law, as there continue to be cases where this basic right--I do view it as a basic right--is abused. As I started out, I would like to put this on a personal level for everyone of my colleagues. You just think about your own family, your own son, your own daughter, or grandchildren who might be, the next time they go to a doctor, the subject of some medical experiment that they are not even told about. I do not think there can be many things more un-American than that. 
With the introduction of this bill today I hope to begin the process of correcting some serious gaps in our legal system. I want to make clear right now I am not seeking to bring medical research to a screeching halt. Please do not anybody at NIH, or anybody doing research throughout this country, think we are trying to stop that. We are not. That is not my intent and not the intent of this bill. 
This country has the very finest health care system in the world, in part because of basic research. In fact, in large part because we have put more effort, more resources, more of our treasure into health research than any other nation in this world. In fact, I believe most people are not opposed to participating themselves in scientific research, if they are told about the pros and the cons. That is the goal of this legislation, to make sure that people have the appropriate information to make an informed choice about their medical treatment. 
Everyone listening today probably has heard of the Nuremberg Code. That is the list of 10 ethical research principles which were produced as part of the judgment against Nazi physicians who engaged in truly heinous medical experiments during World War II. 
The first principle of the Nuremberg Code states that the voluntary consent of the human subject of research is absolutely essential. Unfortunately, as we look back through our history since the late 1940's, it appears that researchers in America may not have taken all that Nuremberg lesson completely to heart. 
I ask my colleagues what the following names might have in common: thalidomide, Tuskegee, and Willowbrook? 
Well, the answer is that these are all sad examples of unethical research conducted in the United States, and in the United States well after the Nuremberg Code was issued, adopted and worldwide attention had been focused on some of the abuses of that time during World War II. 
Given this history, I find it astounding that even after Nuremberg, the thalidomide babies, Willowbrook, Tuskegee and the cold war radiation experiments, and who knows how many other cases, we still don't have a law on our books requiring that informed consent--those two words, `informed consent'--be obtained prior to conducting research on human subjects. 
I have had research conducted on me because of my past activities before I came to the Senate in the space program and so on, but I knew what was being looked at, what was being tried. I knew the objectives of it, and I was willing to do that. I was happy to do it. But it was informed consent that I had personally, and I knew what I was getting into and glad to do it. 
I think most people feel the same way. If they know what they are getting into and they feel there is a good purpose to it, they are willing to do it. But to do research on people when they don't even know what the research or the medicines or 
the radiation is that is being tried on them, I think is unconscionable. 
What it comes down to is there are no criminal fines or penalties for violating the spirit or the letter of that Nuremberg Code that should be the basis of all of our informed consent in this country. 
In fact, our own Constitution says, `The right of the people to be secure in their persons . . . shall not be violated.' 
So there is no explicit statutory prohibition against improper research. I must add that just because there is no law on the books does not mean there are no protections for people from unethical medical or scientific research. 
These tragic incidents I have mentioned have resulted in changes in the way human research subjects are treated. I don't want to misrepresent this, because there is a very elaborate system of protections that have developed over the years. Unfortunately, though, this system does have some gaps and, if enacted, I believe this legislation will close those gaps. 
Let me briefly describe the system that is currently in place. 
Regulations governing the protection of human research subjects were issued by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1974 and may be found at part 46 of title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations. 
In 1991, 10 years after a recommendation of a congressionally chartered Presidential advisory board, 16 other agencies adopted a portion of this rule, a portion of the rule to apply to research that these agencies sponsored. And at that point, these regulations became known as the common rule. 
The common rule requires research institutions receiving Federal support and Federal agencies conducting research to establish committees, and these are known as--the shorthand version is IRB's--Institutional Review Boards. Their job is to review research proposals for risk of harm to human subjects and to perform other duties to protect human research subjects. 
The common rule also stipulates requirements related to informed consent, how researchers must inform potential subjects of the risks to which they, as study participants, agree to be exposed. 
It should also be noted that HHS regulations contain additional protections not included in the common rule for research involving vulnerable populations; namely, pregnant women, fetuses, subjects of in vitro fertilization research, prisoners and children. No other Federal agency has adopted these additional protections. 
Several mechanisms have been developed by HHS and research institutions over the years to extend the common-rule protections to more people. For example, many, but not all, research institutions which receive some Federal support voluntarily apply common-rule guidelines to all research conducted at their institutions. 
Additionally, in order to receive approval for a drug or device from the Food and Drug Administration, a research institution or pharmaceutical company must comply with the requirements of the common rule as administered by the FDA. 
In addition to the Federal regulations, most professional medical societies and associations have adopted ethical codes of conduct regarding research. 
The first such ethical code, called the Helsinki Code, was adopted by the World Medical Association in 1964. So it has been on the books for a long time. Since that time, other prominent organizations, like the American Medical Association, the American Society for Clinical Investigation, and the American Federation of Clinical Research have also adopted such ethical codes. 
Most recently, in October 1995, the President exhibited, I believe, strong leadership and established the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, NBAC. This had been a long time coming. It had been suggested, but no one had ever gone ahead and done this, and the President exerted the leadership and established the NBAC. 
Quite simply, the scientific and ethical issues which the NBAC are supposed to evaluate represent some of the most important, some of the most complex and controversial questions of our time. NBAC's input will be critical to informed policymaking for both the legislative and executive branches. 
The two primary goals of NBAC are to, first, evaluate the current level of compliance of Federal agencies to the common rule, and, second, evaluate the common rule and advise both the executive and legislative branches on any changes that might be needed to it. 
I very strongly support the work of the NBAC but recently have become extremely concerned to hear that more than 15 months after its establishment, the NBAC is still operating with a volunteer staff. It was my understanding that a number of Federal agencies supported the creation of the NBAC and agreed to back up their support with resources and staff. Some NBAC members have stated in public meetings that they are frustrated with the progress the Commission is making and attribute the slow pace to the lack of resources. Additionally, the resource problem may be limiting the number of meetings of the Commission. 
Further, if this problem is not resolved in the near term, the Commission may have to stop meeting altogether. I sent a letter to the President's science adviser a few days ago, Dr. John Gibbons, to express my concerns about this. Dr. Gibbons was working to resolve this funding problem, which I view as an urgent priority. 
I am very glad to announce--as a matter of fact, it was just today--that these groups in Government that are interested in this had a meeting under Dr. Gibbons' leadership, and the $1.6 million that was supposed to accrue from these different agencies to be used by the NBAC is now forthcoming. So the NBAC is now funded so they can do the job they were originally supposed to do. 
We are very glad to say that has happened just today, and I am glad it happened today, just when I am introducing this bill, because it looks as though we now truly are moving to support the NBAC that did not receive the kind of monetary support, the kind of funding that we thought it was going to have when it was first formed a year and a half ago. 
There are a number of existing mechanisms that do protect human research subjects today. In fact, in March of 1996, the GAO reported to me that the testing protection system has reduced the likelihood of serious abuses from occurring. However, the GAO also pointed out a number of weaknesses and gaps in the current system. 
There are at least four areas, four major gaps. 
First, not all agencies have adopted the common rule, including agencies that currently sponsor research involving human subjects. The Department of Labor and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are examples of agencies that sponsor such research but those agencies have not adopted the common rule, which I think they should have. 
Second, the common rule's research is voluntarily applied in many cases. Most institutions which receive Federal funds will voluntarily apply the common rule to all research conducted at their institution. However, not all research institutions adopt this policy. And in any case, if any improper research is discovered at these institutions, there are very few steps available to the Federal Government to do much about it. 
Third, a private institution or a researcher who conducts nonfederally funded research or is not seeking approval of a drug or device with the FDA does not have to apply the principles of the common rule to its research. In other words, there is a huge area of all the private medical research out there that is not under the common rule unless they just choose themselves to just voluntarily do it. 
Fourth, no Federal agency, other than HHS, has applied the additional protections described in 45 CFR 46 for vulnerable populations--pregnant women and their fetus, children, prisoners--to their own research. So the purpose of this legislation is to help close the gaps that exist within the current system for protecting research subjects. 
Well, is there really a problem out there? 
Is this just a paper loophole that I am trying to close? 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, there are ongoing problems with inappropriate, ethically suspect research on human subjects. It is difficult to know the extent of such problems because information is not collected in any formal manner on human 
research. 
The Cleveland Plain-Dealer in my home State of Ohio has recently reported in a whole series of articles, after much investigation of this issue. And I quote from them:  
What the government lacks in hard data about humans, it more than makes up for with volumes of statistics about laboratory animals. Wonder how many guinea pigs were used in U.S. research? The Agriculture Department knows: 333,379. How many hamsters in Ohio? 2,782. 
So we have all this data on animals and little on human beings. I would hasten to add that the guinea pigs the Plain-Dealer refers to are the four-legged kind too and not the guinea pigs that are humans being used for research. 
The reason we know so much about the use of animals in research is that we have laws governing the handling and treatment of them. 
For example, the Animal Welfare Act requires that certain minimum standards be maintained when using animals in research. 
Let me give you some recent examples which indicate why, notwithstanding the common rule and the other protections that are in place, I think additional protections are needed in statute. 
In 1994-95, in an effort to explore the rights and interests of people currently involved in radiation research conducted or sponsored by the Federal Government, the Presidential Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments conducted an in-depth review of 125 research projects funded by HHS, DOE, DOD, VA, and NASA. According to the ACHRE report: 
Our review suggests that there are significant deficiencies in some aspects of the current system for the protection of human subjects. 
The ACHRE found that documents provided to IRB's often did not contain enough information about topics that are central to the ethics of research involving human subjects. In some cases the committee found it was difficult to assess the scientific merit of a protocol based on the documentation provided. 
ACHRE's report states that some consent forms studied by the committee are--and I quote-- 
. . . flawed in morally significant respects, not merely because they are difficult to read but because they are uninformative or even misleading. 
The report states further: 
Our review also raises serious concerns about some research involving children and adults with questionable decision-making capacity. 
And the ACHRE concludes: 
All told, the documents of almost half the studies reviewed by the committee that involved greater than minimal risk [to the subject] raised serious or moderate concerns. 
That is a horrible indictment. 
As I mentioned earlier, from December 15 to 18, 1996, the Cleveland Plain-Dealer published a series of articles entitled `Drug Trials: Do People Know the Truth About Experiments.' 
And I want to give credit to the people that worked on that. Keith Epstein, has covered Capitol Hill here and has written much and done much investigative reporting working on this, as did Mr. Sloat, S-l-o-a-t, Bill Sloat. Those two fellows worked on this and did a great job in pointing out some of the problems that still exist. And we have talked to them about some of these things. 
The Plain-Dealer uncovered a number of disturbing cases, very disturbing cases as a matter of fact, where people were either unaware of the fact that they were involved in research or were not provided full information about potential side effects of research. The series raises very serious questions about the adequacy of our current system of protecting human research subjects. 
The Plain-Dealer found, for example, of `4,154 FDA inspections of researchers testing new drugs on people [since 1977] . . . more than half the researchers were cited by FDA inspectors for failing to clearly disclose the experimental nature of their work.' 
Another serious finding in this series is that researchers who receive the most severe penalty by the FDA, being designated `Disqualified Investigators,' have little fear of this fact being found out by their peers or patients. One of the articles discusses potentially serious problems in the way research conducted outside of the United States is incorporated into applications for drug approvals in the United States. 
The Plain-Dealer uncovered much evidence to suggest that the Federal Government continues to sponsor research where informed consent is not obtained. And this fact disturbed me greatly also. 
On November 14, 1996, the Wall Street Journal published an article that examined the practice at one pharmaceutical firm, Eli Lilly and Co. in using homeless alcoholics in their clinical trials. The article raises some disturbing questions about the quality of the phase I trials conducted by this one company. Also serious ethical questions are raised concerning the appropriateness of paying homeless alcoholics significant sums to be human guinea pigs. It is not clear from the article whether these tests were reviewed by any IRB. 
On December 27, 1996, the New York Times reported on a New York State appeals court ruling which found that the State's rules governing psychiatric experiments on children and the mentally ill were unconstitutional. The court found that the rules did not adequately protect people who, because of age or illness, cannot give informed consent to take part in drug tests or other experiments. The article mentions 10 to 15 of the 400 psychiatric experiments covered by the ruling as being `privately financed' and therefore outside the coverage of Federal rules. 
How would you like it if your father, mother, son or daughter, husband, wife was in one of those institutions and was having experiments conducted on them without your knowing about it or without them knowing about it? That is what we are up against. 
On August 15, 1994, the New York Times reported on ethical and legal questions regarding a company's efforts to promote a drug that can make some children grow taller than they otherwise would. The drug in question, Protropin, has been approved by FDA for use in children whose bodies do not make sufficient quantities of human growth hormone. However, once approved, doctors may prescribe it for other purposes at their discretion. In this case the company was apparently surveying schools for short children and then trying to funnel those children to doctors who would prescribe the drug whether or not the children lacked the human growth hormone. This unapproved research was occurring without the oversight of an IRB. And at least 15,000 children have taken this drug. 
Another illustration of the precarious coverage of the common rule occurred in 1995 when it became known that researchers from the Center for Reproductive Health at the University of California Irvine, were fertilizing humans and implanting theses in different mothers without the consent of the donor. This research was not being funded by any Federal agency; however, NIH was funding more than $20 million worth of other research at the university. Even though several internal and external investigations by the university and the district attorney were being conducted on this experiment, a clarifying moment occurred when investigators from OPRR visited UC Irvine early last year. These investigators reminded university officials of the common rule; 
the fact that the university had agreed to apply it to all research conducted there--through OPRR's assurance process; and that NIH was currently funding a good deal of research at the institution. Within a week of OPRR's visit, the university took public action to halt the research and formally investigate the researchers. 
On October 10, 1994, the New York Times reported on a New York doctor who adopted two types of drugs approved by FDA for cancer treatment and stomach ulcers for an unapproved use to perform nonsurgical abortions. The article quotes the doctor saying that in 121 of 126 cases his approach was successful. The remaining five cases required surgery to complete the procedure. Because the drugs were FDA approved and the doctor was not funded or connected to federally sponsored research, no IRB or approved informed consent procedures were required. Apparently, each patient signed a three-page consent form, but this was not approved by an IRB. According to the Times, once FDA approves a drug, physicians are generally allowed to use it for off label purposes. 
Now Mr. President, some of the issues discussed in these articles are problems with how the common rule itself is being applied. Some of these examples illustrate the gaps in the common rule coverage. My legislation will address both the coverage and the application of the common rule. 
Now how precisely would the legislation work? 
It would require all research facilities to register with HHS. Registration shall include: First, statement of principles governing the research facility in its conduct of human subject research; second, designation of the official responsible for all human subject; third, designation of membership roster of IRB(s); and fourth, attestation that the research facility is complying with the protection requirements of the common rule. 
The legislation includes a grandfather provision for all research entities which currently have negotiated project assurances with HHS. The vast majority of research facilities have such assurances. 
The legislation contains a 3-year reregistration requirement. 
The legislation includes criminal penalties for failure to comply with the act. Therefore, if enacted it would be a felony offense to experiment on someone without their informed consent. 
The intent therefore of this legislation is twofold: First, to fill in the gaps of coverage of the common rule by requiring all research involving human subjects to abide by the rule; and second, to elevate the importance of conducting research ethically, the bill provides criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with the requirements of this law, and by extension 45 CFR 46. 
Finally Mr. President, my legislation would codify a recommendation which the 
Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments made regarding the conduct of classified research involving human subjects. 
Specifically, the advisory committee recommended that informed consent of all human subjects of classified research be required, and that such requirement not be subject to waiver or exemption. Under current rule and executive order, it is possible to waive informed consent and IRB review for classified research. Title II of this legislation would prohibit the waiver of either informed consent or IRB review for classified research. 
The advisory committee also recommended that human subjects of classified research be provided with certain information regarding that research. My legislation would require that such subjects be information concerning: First, the identify of the sponsoring Federal agency; second, a statement that the research involves classified information; and third, an unclassified description of the purpose of the research. 
Mr. President I have tried today to briefly lay out the case for the need for the legislation I am introducing. I know that my colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, is also concerned about the issues I have raised today, and about those that appeared last month in the Plain Dealer. I believe that he has requested that the chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee hold hearings on this subject. I think that is entirely appropriate. And I hope that this legislation could be considered in that process. I look forward to working with the Labor Committee in this regard. 
I do not claim to have the magic bullet solution with this bill. However, I believe there are some key principles which should guide the Senate's consideration of this legislation. These principles are: 
First, informed consent and independent review of experiments involving human subjects must be required. 
Second, anyone who violates the right of research subject to have informed consent, should be held criminally responsible for that violation. 
I want to put this in personal terms once again. You can imagine your spouse, husband, wife, father, mother, children, being experimented on without your knowledge or their knowledge. That is unconscionable, and we should not permit that. This legislation will close many of the loopholes that permit that to happen now. 
As the legislative process moves ahead, it is certain that the bill will undergo scrutiny and amendments. But I think the outcome, if this legislation is enacted into law, will be improved protections for all Americans. 
Madam President, obviously, I welcome any cosponsors on this legislation. I will be sending out a `dear colleague' letter to all the offices, and I hope we get a good response to that. I think there are very few Senators who will not back this when they hear what can happen then to them, their families, and their constituents back home, if we do not pass something like this. 
I think this is many years overdue. I don't want to scare people to death with this, because I think most of the research in this country is conducted in a way that is good and is with informed consent--in most cases. But just the few examples that I have mentioned here today, as well as the articles in the Cleveland Plain Dealer and New York Times I quoted from, indicate there is still a very major problem in this area and one that we want to close the gaps on so that no American is subjected to experiments like this, unless they know exactly what is going on and have given informed consent. 
Thank you. I yield the floor.

Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I have known Madeleine Albright for many years and consider her extraordinarily well qualified for the important post of Secretary of State. She has the knowledge, experience, intelligence, candor, energy, and strength of will necessary for this difficult job. I will support her confirmation with enthusiasm. 
By now most Americans have heard the compelling story of Madeleine Albright's family flight from first fascism, and then communism. After coming to the United States, Madeleine Albright compiled an impressive academic resume, including a B.A. from Wellesley College and a masters and doctorate from Columbia University. Her subsequent career has been devoted to international affairs and government--from Capitol Hill, to the National Security Council, to the challenging post of United States U.N. Ambassador. She served as a professor at the Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service and a scholar at both the Smithsonian's Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Prior to her appointment to the U.N. post, Ambassador Albright was president of the Center for National Policy, a nonprofit research institution. 
By any measure, the job of U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations is a most demanding one and Ambassador Albright handled it with great skill, earning praise from across the political spectrum. During Ambassador Albright's tenure at the United Nations, I had the pleasure of working with her to promote the establishment of an inspector general within the U.N. system. Ambassador Albright worked long and hard--and eventually successfully--to build a consensus among the member states for this U.S. initiative. 
The cold war no longer provides the overarching architecture for U.S. foreign policy. And I doubt that any similarly comprehensive substitute will evolve in the near future. U.S. foreign policy now has several more or less equal priority objectives. Balancing these objectives one against the other and moving them all forward in today's complex international environment is a challenging task. I am confident that Ambassador Albright has not only the intellect to meet this challenge but also--and equally importantly--the ability to clearly articulate for the benefit of the American people the national interest involved in the foreign policy challenges we face and the choices we make. 
I am pleased that someone of Madeleine Albright's character and ability has been chosen, and has agreed, to serve this President and this Nation as our primary representative to the world. I congratulate her on her imminent confirmation and look forward to working with her in the future.
