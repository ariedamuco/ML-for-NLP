Mr. McConnell. I would concur with the Senator's interpretation of the effect of this provision. This provision creates an ongoing and overarching commitment. Accompanying report language should reassure the people of South Korea that our friendship for them remains strong, and that we are simply seeking to promote honest, open markets and fair competition.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Kentucky suffered a grievous loss last week when law enforcement officer Regina Nickles of Harrodsburg, Kentucky was shot and killed, in the line of duty, early Wednesday morning as Officer Nickles and her partner were responding to a call reporting a man sneaking around the parking lot of a Harrodsburg factory. She was 45 years old. 
Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Regina Woodward Nickles grew up in Boyle County in Central Kentucky. She went to high school in Danville and then attended Eastern Kentucky University. In 1983, at the age of 29, Officer Nickles became the first--and remains the only--woman to ever serve on the Harrodsburg Police force. When she was profiled in the local newspaper in 1983, she said, `I want to do the best job that I can, and I still feel like I have to prove myself because I'm a woman. I don't want to let these men down who had enough confidence in me to hire me.' 
In a town as small as Harrodsburg--population 8000--all the officers are well known. And Officer Nickles was particularly well regarded. She was known in the community as a peacemaker, an officer with a special talent for resolving disputes before they became violent. She is remembered as kind and caring, known for pulling over motorists, giving them a stern warning and sending them on their way. But she could also be tough when called for, and had the respect of the community and all of her fellow officers. 
Reflecting the the goodwill that she had built up in Harrodsburg over her career, Officer Nickles was recently nominated as the Republican candidate for sheriff in the November elections. A remarkable reflection of the rapport she had with the community is the fact that several people who had once been arrested and jailed by Officer Nickles have said that they still intended to vote for her because of the way she had treated them. 
The murder of Officer Nickles has left the Harrodsburg community in a state of shock. Much like our small Capitol Hill community was devastated by the murders of Officer J.J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson, the residents of Harrodsburg are asking how this could happen in their small town. As we are painfully aware, no community is immune from such heinous acts. 
Mr. President, Officer Regina Woodward Nickles leaves behind an extended family that must now cope with an unimaginably horrific loss. Officer Nickles will also be mourned by the tight-knit Harrodsburg community in which she was such a valued participant. 
When Officer Nickles announced her candidacy for Sheriff, she elaborated on her motivation for pursuing the position. `I want to do more than wear a badge and a gun,' she observed. `I want to touch people's lives.' Officer Nickles didn't need to be elected sheriff to do that. It is abundantly clear that she had touched many people during her too-brief life, and she will be sorely missed.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Dick Boyd, who will retire at the end of October after 32 years of service to the Westvaco Corporation. For over thirty years, Dick has helped establish Westvaco and the Fine Papers mill into fixtures of Wickliffe, Kentucky. Though not originally from Kentucky, Dick became a valued member of the Wickliffe community, raised his family there and continues to have close ties to Kentucky. 
In 1966, Dick joined Westvaco as the Assistant Public Relations Manager at the Fine Papers Division in Luke, Maryland. The next year, Westvaco announced that Wickliffe, Kentucky would be the site of a new $80 million mill. It was while assisting in the public relations details of this announcement that Dick began his long association with the community of Wickliffe. Later that year, Dick, his wife Malinda and their two daughters moved to Wickliffe. Dick became Public Relations Manager for Fine Papers in 1970. 
Dick held that job until 1988. During that time, he played an integral role as the Fine Papers mill became the bedrock of the Wickliffe community. After a brief stint during 1988 in the Kentucky State Government as Deputy Secretary of the Cabinet for Economic Development, Dick returned to Westvaco as Regional Public Affairs Manager, a position he held until 1991. At that time he moved to Washington to become Westvaco's Director of Public Affairs, a position he continues to hold today. 
Since the 1966 announcement that the plant would be built in Western Kentucky, Westvaco has spent more than half a billion dollars to create a state-of-the-art papermaking facility in Wickliffe. Today, Westvaco employs over 750 men and women in Kentucky, and makes an annual contribution of $134 million to the local economy. The growth of the mill and the company's great relationship with the community are a legacy of Dick's career at Westvaco and his 24 years in Kentucky. 
Mr. President, I have worked closely with Dick on several issues of great importance to both Westvaco and my constituents in the Wickliffe area. His hard work and dedication have allowed Westvaco to become an important part of the Wickliffe community. I have enjoyed working with him, thank him for all his efforts on behalf of Westvaco and the people of the Wickliffe community, and wish him the best wherever his future endeavors may take him.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the latest developments in Cambodia and my thoughts on how the United States should respond to these developments. 
Over the past decade the United States has contributed hundreds of millions of dollars towards peace in Cambodia. What benefit has been achieved as a result of this assistance? Is Cambodia better off now than it was 10 years ago? I would argue that recent political developments have undercut most gains this assistance may have provided--and worse, our own policies have contributed to the most recent deterioration considerably. 
On July 26 of this year, the Cambodian people turned out in overwhelming numbers to vote in parliamentary elections. The ruling government pointed to this impressive turnout and claimed it was representative of a free and fair process. In fact, the election was termed by one American observer as the `Miracle on the Mekong.' With all due respect, I question how any informed observer could make that evaluation. For one to believe this appraisal, one must completely ignore the events dating from the 1997 coup. 
In truth, the events which lead up to the July 26 balloting made the prospects for free and fair elections impossible. The opposition parties infrastructure had been completely dismantled following the July 1997 coup d'etat, orchestrated by Hun Sen and his Cambodian Peoples Party (CPP). As many as 100 opposition party members were reported killed, and those who remained in Cambodia were forced to campaign in fear if they dared speak out at all. The CPP controlled access to media and thereby prevented opposition candidates from effectively getting their message out. The National Election Commission (NEC), which had oversight of the election process, was stacked almost entirely with CPP party loyalists. Each of these factors on their own would be troubling, but when looked at collectively they are an outrageous example of a government which acts with impunity and has no regard for democratic principles. 
Despite this reality, the Clinton Administration joined many in the international community, including the so-called `Friends of Cambodia,' in pushing the parties to participate in the July 26 elections. I thought then, and I continue to believe now, that this was a mistake. To use an old phrase--with `Friends' like these, who needs enemies? How could we ask these brave men and women to risk their lives and take part in a process which was doomed to failure? To make matters worse, the U.S. Government now seems bent on ignoring the reality of the flawed election. Rather, it is pushing opposition leaders to participate in a parliament at the mercy of a brutal dictator who has no regard for the rule of law. So, in the end, the United States has invested hundreds of million of dollars and the Cambodian people have little to show for our efforts. 
Mr. President, since July 26th, the environment has actually deteriorated rather than improved. Opposition leaders filed hundreds of protests with the National Election Commission, only to see each of these complaints dismissed without consideration. Legitimate claims of fraud have been 
ignored as the CPP seeks to cement its claim to so-called `legitimate' authority. Let's examine a few of these problems: 
Prior to the July ballot, the NEC secretly and without debate changed the formula by which parliament seats would be assigned. Only after the votes were tabulated was this new formula announced. To no one's surprise, the result was an additional five seats for Hun Sen's party, thereby preventing CPP from being in the minority. Had the original formula been in place, the parties of Prince Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy could have combined their seats to form a majority of parliament. 
Only July 27, as ballots were being processed, the NEC ordered the counting stopped. According to a senior member of the NEC, this halt in the proceedings occurred because the opposition parties had taken the lead. Not surprisingly, when counting was renewed, CPP regained control and went on to be credited with 41 percent of the total vote. 
Finally, the violence continues. Immediately following the election, largely peaceful demonstrations broke out in downtown Phnom Phen. CPP armed thugs and soldiers broke up the demonstrations and dismantled the symbolic `democracy square' located near the National Assembly. Opposition leaders were subject to a travel ban and intimidation tactics. Finally, and most alarmingly, several Buddhist monks were murdered and reportedly tortured. 
Mr. President, the question must be asked, how should the United States proceed in the face of these developments? I believe there are several concrete steps we can and must take to send the signal that we will not tolerate Hun Sen's brutal disregard for his own nation and people. 
Number one, we must continue to withhold direct assistance to the Cambodian Government. This year's foreign operations appropriations bill will do just this. Only when each of the election disputes have been dealt with could aid be released. 
Number two, we must not appoint an Ambassador to succeed Ambassador Quinn. Many in the opposition have already spoken out against the current nominee and I share their concerns. However, regardless of the nominee, we should send a strong signal to Hun Sen that we will not recognize his illegitimate government. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert a letter from Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, leaders of the two most active opposition parties. In this letter, they detail not only the election disputes, but their opposition to the current nominee to be ambassador to Cambodia. 
Number three, the United States should identify Hun Sen for what he is, a criminal. Congressman Rohrabacher has introduced a resolution in the House which calls on the United States to assist in the collection of information that would lead to trying Hun Sen before an international tribunal for violation of human rights. I think Congressman Rohrabacher should be commended for his leadership, and I am hopeful similar legislation will pass in the Senate this year. 
Finally, we should oppose the current Cambodian government being allowed a seat at the United Nations. 
These steps are essential to staking out America's position as a defender of democracy and rule of law in Cambodia. Strong actions by the U.S. Government can give hope to the heroic members of the opposition as they continue to strive for democracy in the face of repression.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President I rise today to discuss the Defense Authorization bill. I support this bill and believe the Conferees have acted appropriately and supported the vital needs of our national security. However, I strenuously object to one provision that I believe is a grave mistake. 
Section 1075 of H.R. 3616 inserts language which would have the effect of changing the tax structure of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Mr. President, this is a terrible and misguided assault on the rights of Kentucky to levy income tax. I believe this decision sets a dangerous precedent and will harm citizens of my state. 
Fort Campbell is a unique military post which straddles the Kentucky-Tennessee state lines. As a result, many residents of Tennessee go to work every day across the border in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Currently, those who work on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell are subject to Kentucky's state income tax. Section 1075 takes away Kentucky's ability to legally enforce its state tax on these employees. As a result, Kentucky will lose millions of dollars a year in revenue. I am unable to come up with any justification for the Armed Services committee to impose its will on the Commonwealth of Kentucky in this manner. 
Mr. President, for the Armed Services committee to take this action astonishes me. This issue should be debated and resolved by the impacted states. By imposing this solution, the Armed Services committee has effectively foreclosed any opportunity for future negotiations. 
My colleague from Kentucky, Senator Ford, has made lengthy remarks on this issue, and I agree with much of what he said. However, I do take offense at the partisan barbs, as they are unwarranted and unproductive. Perhaps the diatribe was cathartic, but cheap shots get us no closer to the solution. 
That said Mr. President, like my colleague from Kentucky, I will vote for final passage of this bill. It contains a number of items that I encouraged the committee to adopt, and I thank them for their consideration.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, since 1988, Congress has established three programs to provide low-income elderly and disabled individuals with Medicare cost-sharing assistance under Medicaid. Despite the availability of these dual-eligible programs, gaps in beneficiary knowledge and deficiencies in program administration by federal and state agencies have created persistent barriers to enrollment by eligible Medicare recipients. 
For several years, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Social Security Administration have sought to educate seniors on the availability of Medicare cost-sharing programs through mass mailings, informational hotlines, and pamphlet distribution. While these initiatives have helped, a study by Families USA found that over three million low-income Medicare beneficiaries are not enrolled in any cost-sharing program. In Kentucky, the study estimates that the lack of information about and participation in Medicare cost-sharing programs cost more than 49,000 low-income Kentuckians about $25 million a year. In order to overcome these troubling blockades to enrollment, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,the Health Care Financing Administration and the Social Security Administration are studying options to more effectively serve our nation's financially vulnerable seniors and disabled. 
A key aspect to improving participation in cost-sharing programs is the capacity for federal and state agencies to identify those who experience critical income shifts after their initial enrollment in Medicare and Social Security. One group at particular risk of reduced income in later life is widowed spouses. 
For anyone who has lost a loved one, the experience is overwhelming both mentally and emotionally. The loss of a spouse, often after a long, intensive illness, leaves many elderly with the difficult task of restructuring their lives in order to regain personal and financial stability. At this critical time of change, widowed spouses rely on their revised Social Security benefit as the foundation for their future budget planning. Statistics furnished by the Social Security Administration show that 40 percent of nonmarried women, a category which includes widows, rely on Social Security for 90 percent of their income in comparison to only 18 percent of married couples. In addition, nearly one-fourth of nonmarried women rely on Social Security as their sole source of income. 
In an effort to focus federal and state agencies on the health and welfare needs of low-income, widowed spouses, I am introducing legislation for a research demonstration to identify potential dual eligibles during the recalculation of Social Security benefits for widowed spouses. The Social Security Administration would refer this information to the state administrators of Medicare cost-sharing programs for their followup. 
Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to thank Senator Arlen Specter for including my request to fund this research effort by the Social Security Administration in the committee report to FY 1999 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee in September. As the House and Senate work to complete the omnibus appropriations bill for FY 1999, I strongly urge my colleagues to include this research endeavor in the final measure as part of our commitment to improving the responsiveness of federal and state agencies to the health and welfare needs of our nation's at-risk seniors.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to clarify an issue regarding the security at the two uranium enrichment facilities. Section 310 of the conference report which deals with the allocation between the Department and the private corporation leasing the gaseous diffusion plants of the cost of arming and providing arrest authority to security police officers at the plants. I want to make it very clear that this section does not affect the current responsibility of the Department to pay for security for the Department's highly enriched uranium activities. 
Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank the officials with the Department of Energy and the officials from the newly privatized United States Enrichment Corporation who sat down with my office and negotiated in good faith a solution to this difficult matter. I am pleased to have an agreement once and for all.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to the foreign policy catastrophe unraveling in Kosovo. Yogi Berra immortalized the phrase `this is deja vu all over again'--and that is just what we are seeing in Kosovo--Bosnia, all over again. Today, just like yesterday and the day before, men, women, and children in Kosovo are living and dying witnesses to a rerun of the tragic experience suffered by Bosnia for three brutal years. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are, once again, the victims of our false promises and a deeply flawed policy. 
Take a minute to review the events as they have unfolded on the ground to establish exactly what I think Belgrade has learned about United States policy. What Milosevic and his mafia have figured out is--we bluster and threaten, we issue ultimatums and condemnations, but the policy is hollow, the threats are empty, the show is a charade. 
A recent Congressional Research Service chronology provides stark evidence of this sad pattern of Western threats and demands, always swiftly challenged by vicious Serbian violence and assaults against Kosovo's civilians. And, the response to these attacks? Concessions and inaction. 
The United States has not failed alone. We are joined in this collective dishonor by the G-7 nations, the OSCE, the European Union, the Contact Group, and even the United Nations which have individually and collectively reneged on commitments made to take action to stop the bloodshed, to produce a cease-fire, to prompt a withdrawal of Serb troops, and to protect the rapidly mounting numbers of refugees and displaced people. 
The CRS report tell us: 
On January 8, the six nations of the Contact Group declared Kosovo a matter of priority urging a peaceful dialogue to begin between parties. This message was reinforced by Special Envoy Gelbard in meetings with Milosevic in Belgrade. The response, within days, was attacks by the Serbian police on a small village leaving ethnic Albanians dead and more wounded. While this was a relatively small assault, the beginning of the coming trend was marked by 20,000 people turning out for the funeral in protest of that action. 
On February 23, Gelbard announced some minor concessions to the Serbs including restoring landing rights for their airlines. At the same time the Contact Group foreign ministers issued a statement expressing concern about the lack of progress in dialogue. In an attempt at balance and fairness they even condemned terrorist acts by the Kosovo Liberation Army and reiterated their lack of support for Kosovo independence. 
What did the Serbs do in response to these generous gestures? Within three days, Serbian forces launched major attacks on villages in central Kosovo. CRS reports the attacks were `spearheaded by thousands of Serbian police and Interior Ministry troops and resulted in 20 to 30 deaths mostly of ethnic Albanians.' 
On March 2, the United Stats and the European Union joined voices in condemning violence by Serb forces. On March 5, Serb police and special anti-terrorist units `began their second largest offensive in central Kosovo. KLA strongholds were attacked with armored vehicles and helicopter gun ships * * * the assault continued for 2 days and claimed the lives of 6 police officers and over 50 Kosovar Albanians.' 
On March 4, Mr. Gelbard said, `I guarantee you we simply won't brook any renewal of violence,' followed on March 7, by Secretary Albright who issued her now famous ultimatum. She said, Milosevic `will have to pay a price. The international community will not stand by and watch the Serbian authorities do in Kosovo what they can no longer get away with doing in Bosnia.' Her statement was backed up by a Contact Group declaration demanding Milosevic take specific steps within ten days including withdrawing paramilitary troops and allowing Red Cross access conflict zones. 
As the Contact Group was issuing its statement, in a gruesome public spectacle, Serb troops dumped 51 bodies at a warehouse, each one an ethnic Albanian, 25 of them were women and children. Before international forensics experts could complete autopsies, the Serbs bulldozed the bodies into a mass grave. 
This pattern of challenge and brutal response continued weekly through the spring and summer. Threats of western actions have been dismissed by Serb attacks, after attack, after attack. 
Villages are shelled, burned and looted. Crops and fields are burned. The death toll and refugee population swells. Yesterday a Kosovo journalist told me that the Serbs have now destroyed 400 of the 700 villages in Kosovo. 
And, the world watches. Deja vu all over again. 
I thought we had reached an all time low in June when 84 NATO planes carried out a six nation exercise in Albania and Macedonia intended as a show of strength and force. The Washington Post summed up the events saying, `Yugoslavia's reply to threats of NATO air strikes could be heard for miles around in the nightly bombardment of border villages.' 
Mr. President, the tragedy continues. Winter's cold curtain now falls upon the weakened shoulders of tens of thousands of families expelled from their homes, in hiding in the mountains and forests of Kosovo. Soon, we will begin to see the heart-rending, pitiful images of ailing, elderly women, clutching babies and toddlers, every possession they could salvage strapped to their backs, stagger out of hiding, hoping to cross borders into safe haven, but more likely, stumbling into harm's way. 
And, this time, Mr. President, the consequences of inertia are deadly serious. I agree with Ambassador Holbrooke's assessment that Kosovo is `the most explosive tinderbox in the region.' Unlike Bosnia, the long-standing frictions involving Kosovars, Albanian, Serbs, and Macedonians have consequences in Greece and Turkey--precarious NATO partners in the best of times. 
The conditions in Kosovo have demanded action for months. Instead we have been a state of policy stall. Now, as much in recognition of the weather, the Administration has turned a lethal pattern of appeasement into a dangerous policy of collaboration and containment. 
Let me point to two examples of the current approach which seeks a partnership with Belgrade rather than protection of innocent refugees. As conditions worsen, the Administration seems seized with a containment strategy, which balances on improving delivery of relief while controlling what they view as potentially messy regional spillover problem. 
There are two prongs to this misguided effort. First, let me describe what the Administration is considering on the relief front. Earlier this month, administration officials announced plans to work in Kosovo through twelve centers established by Serb security forces to distribute emergency food and supplies to the victims of this savage war. I am not sure what surprised me more--the fact that we would work with the very forces which carried out the atrocities creating hundreds of thousands of victims, or the fact that we decided to encourage this cooperation by actually making food available to Serb troops. The new chief of the Bureau for Humanitarian Affairs offered and has provided thousands of food rations to Serb troops fresh from bloody killing fields. He even asked NGO representatives to cooperate with this plan and work through these twelve centers. As one representative described it to me, the NGOs were the bait, intended to lure refugees into Serb centers. AID claims that this plan was agreed to by the major non-government organizations carrying out humanitarian relief in Kosovo, but I can't find one that thinks collaborating with Belgrade makes any sense. 
This effort to control and contain the problem also has a military component--but the wrong military component. Last week, the foreign Operations Subcommittee was briefed on Administration plans to provide $7.3 million in security assistance loans to Macedonia. This train an equip initiative will provide night vision goggles, surveillance radar, ammunition, body armor, howitzers and trucks to 3,000 Macedonian soldiers--troops with long-standing ties to Serbian security forces. Coincidentally, Macedonia also has an ethnic Albanian community which suffer what many describe as apartheid-like conditions. 
Arming the Macedonians is the wrong substitute for the current policy failure in Kosovo. Having failed to talk Milosevic into submission, this program strikes me as a complete retreat in which the United States is supplying an effort to establish a cordon sanitaire isolating Kosovo. Strengthening Macedonian troops may have a defense purpose but it also clearly serves an 
offensive one--to curb the flow of people and supplies into and out of Kosovo. 
I hope we all learned at least one lesson in Bosnia--we pay a huge price for imposing an unfair and imbalanced embargo against only one party in a conflict. In good conscience, I for one, cannot support an initiative designed intentionally or otherwise to surround and choke off Kosovo. I have made clear to the Secretaries of State and Defense that I will not release the funds for this reprogramming unless and until appropriate action is taken to produce results in Kosovo. 
Secretary Albright has repeatedly stated that the only kind of pressure Milosevic and his mafia understand is the kind which exacts a real price for his unacceptable conduct. His campaign to burn Kosovo to the ground was launched as the Administration pushed Kosovars to the negotiating table and continues as we speak today. it is well past the time for threats of sanctions and NATO flyovers. The Administration must move decisively, offering the necessary leadership to back up our ultimatums with the effective use of air strikes and force in order to secure our common goals: a cease fire, the withdrawal of Serb forces, and the protection of refugees, displaced people and relief efforts. 
Balkan history provides substantial evidence that Belgrade's abuse of force demands a commensurate response. Without this fundamental guarantee, diplomacy will most certainly fail and we will bear witness to yet another of Milosevic's genocidal slaughters. His victims will not only be those who suffer, lose their life possessions, and die on Kosovo's fields. He will also destroy American honor and credibility--taking along with that what shred of hope there is for us to lead this troubled world onto a peaceful path into the next century.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I note for my colleagues that the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Committee and the chairman of the Republican Senatorial Committee are on the floor at this moment, and we have a message for candidates in both our parties and for the American people. 
Having served as chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee during the Packwood investigation, and having offered the first resolution of expulsion in the history of the Senate in a case involving sexual misconduct, I am well aware of the bright line that exists between private failings and public wrongs. And, of course, that line is blurred, as it was in that case, and is again in the allegations made against President Clinton when one's public office is used to pursue private misconduct and shield it from legal inquiry. 
But if we start turning every instance of past personal misconduct into cannon fodder for our political campaigns, we risk turning our democracy into a nuclear waste dump of slander, gossip, innuendo, and cheap moralizing about other people's problems. 
Even without this threat, the multifaceted scandal that currently engulfs the White House represents a crisis of national and constitutional proportions. Our only hope of guiding this country through the next several months without a major catastrophe in our Government, or in our financial markets, or in the world, absolutely depends on our ability to resist the subtly escalating arms race of dirt digging, garbage searching, mudslinging, and poison leaking that is currently swirling around the Nation's Capital. 
Where that awful trend must be resisted first is in our political campaigns. For better or for worse, campaigns are the most direct expression of our Government that people see. 
This election, let's make it for the better, not for the worse. Everyone in this body certainly knows that I believe in robust, pointed, hard-hitting campaigns. And I believe those kinds of campaigns are good for our democracy and good for the voters, but only when political campaigns are focused on issues and not on purely private behavior. 
So to set the standard, I want to make it clear that the national Republican Senatorial Committee will not fund--will not fund--any candidate who engages in personal attacks on the private problems and past failings of his or her opponent. Digging through their record is one thing, digging through their garbage is quite another. Criticizing someone for their vote on the marriage tax is fair game. Attacking someone for a failed marriage certainly is not. 
Let us prove over the next 6 weeks at least that this Congress is capable of fairly and responsibly executing the solemn constitutional duty that may await us in the months ahead. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I note the presence of my friend and colleague from Nebraska.

Mr. McConnell. Mr. President, this debate offers each Senator an opportunity to set forth, in a very real way, his or her vision for America. from time to time, we are given a stage, a national audience, and a defining moment--a moment in which we must extol that which is good and noble and just, and reject that which is not. I believe that today provides one such moment in this effort to override President Clinton's veto of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. 
I rise today in strong support of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997. with this vote, the Senate will protect unborn children from the barbaric procedure known as `partial-birth abortion,' or it will not. The Senate will side with truth, or it will not. 
The president has vetoed this bill on two occasions now, telling the country that partial-birth abortions are necessary in `a small number of compelling cases,' to protect the mother from `serious injury to her health,' and to avoid the mother's `losing the ability to ever bear further children.' 
Mr. President, that is not the truth. The evidence is quite to the contrary. The procedure is not limited to a small number of cases, but rather is far more widespread, numbering in the thousands. As one newspaper has explained, `[i]nterviews with physicians who use the method reveal that in New Jersey alone, at least 1,500 partial-birth abortions are performed each year.' 
The procedure is never necessary to protect the mother's health or fertility. The Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, which includes former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, has flatly rejected the President's assertion on this point: 
Contrary to what abortion activists would have us believe, partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated to protect a woman's health or her fertility. In fact, the opposite is true: The procedure can pose a significant and immediate threat to both the pregnant woman's health and fertility. 
The opponents of this legislation have gone to great lengths to hide the truth from the American people. One has famously admitted to deliberate falsehoods. Others have tried to obscure the facts by using medical terms like `intact dilation and evacuation' or `intrauterine cranial decompression.' But, no matter what words the other side uses, nothing can change the fact that this procedure is a partial-birth abortion, it is heinous, and it is wrong. 
I want to close my remarks this morning, Mr. President, by thanking some very special people for their support on this critical issue. I want to thank Margie Montgomery of Kentucky Right to Life. She has worked tirelessly and faithfully on behalf of unborn children. Her years of service have been truly heroic. 
I also want to thank the Respect Life Committee, and particularly Mel Meiners and Dan Bowling. To illustrate the broad support in my state for ending this inhumane act, they have crafted an amazing Prayer Chain, containing over 3,700 signatures from dedicated people who are praying that we will override President Clinton's veto. I would say, Mr. President, that we could probably take their Prayer Chain and stretch it all the way around the Senate floor. We would then be enveloped by this symbol of commitment to protecting unborn children. This Chain is a moving display of faith and commitment--I am very grateful for having receive it. 
Let me list a few of the Catholic churches who are responsible for the Prayer Chain: Guardian Angels, Holy Family, Our Mother of sorrows, Resurrection, St. Martin of Tours, and St. Stephen Martyr. The chain is also a product of the efforts of the Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Elderly, Holy Angels Academy, and, as I've already mentioned, Kentucky Right to Life. I also want the Record to reflect that I have received over 10,000 letters and cards from concerned Kentuckians urging us to end this barbaric practice. 
I truly appreciate their support and hope that my colleagues will join me in taking a stand for what is right and just. We must send a clear and principled message to the President and to the nation.

Mr. McCONNELL. There was some discussion yesterday on the floor with regard to the issue of advocacy about a case called Furgatch. And the supporters of McCain-Feingold spent a lot of time trying to interpret the Furgatch decision as allowing the kind of suppression of issue advocacy by citizens that I think clearly is a misreading of the case. 
Those who advocate McCain-Feingold and, for that matter, the Snowe-Jeffords substitute regulatory regimes, have precious few court cases on which to base their arguments. Most prominent among these is the ninth circuit's Furgatch decision, dating back to 1987. It is mighty slim, Mr. President, the Furgatch limb upon which their issue advocacy regulation case rests. 
While Furgatch is not my favorite decision, it is certainly not the blank check for reformers who seek to shut down issue advocacy, either. 
Furgatch was an express advocacy case, nothing short. It was about a different subject. It was an express advocacy case, not an issue advocacy case. It hinged on the content of the communication at issue--words, explicit terms--just as the Supreme Court required in Buckley and reiterated in Massachusetts Citizens for Life. 
The words in Furgatch were not those contained in Buckley's footnote 52. Indeed, no one, least of all the Supreme Court, ever intended that the list--also known as `footnote 52'--was exhaustive. That would defy common sense. 
Desperate for even the thinnest constitutional gruel upon which to base their regulatory zeal to extend their reach to everyone who dares to utter a political word in this country, the FEC leapt at Furgatch and won't let go. FEC lawyers misread it, they also misrepresent it, and are rewarded with loss after loss in the courts. 
In last year's fourth circuit decision ordering the FEC to pay one of its victims, the Christian Action Network's attorneys' fees, the Furgatch-as-blank-check-for-issue-advocacy-regulation fantasy was thoroughly dissected, debunked and dispensed with. 
The court in the Christian Action Network case puts Furgatch in the proper perspective. Let me just read a couple of parts of the Christian Action Network case. 
The court says: 
. . . less than a month following the Court's decision in [Massachusetts Citizens for Life], the Ninth Circuit in FEC v. Furgatch . . . could not have been clearer that it, too, shared this understanding of the Court's decision in Buckley. Although the court declined to `strictly limit' express advocacy to the `magic words' of Buckley's footnote 52 because that footnote's list does `not exhaust the capacity of the English language to expressly advocate election or defeat of a candidate . . . 
Curiously, the Ninth Circuit never cited or discussed the Supreme Court's opinion in [Massachusetts Citizens for Life], notwithstanding that [Massachusetts Citizens for Life] was argued in the Supreme Court three months prior to the decision in Furgatch and decided by the Court almost a month prior to the Court of Appeals' decision. The Ninth Circuit does discuss the First Circuit's opinion in [Massachusetts Citizens for Life], but without noting that certiorari had been granted to review the case. . . . Thus, the Furgatch court relied upon Buckley alone, without the reaffirmation provided by the Court in [Massachusetts Citizens for Life], for its conclusion that explicit `words' or `language' of advocacy are required if the Federal Election Campaign Act is to be constitutionally enforced. 
. . . the entire premise of the court's analysis was that words of advocacy such as those recited in footnote 52 were required to support Commission jurisdiction over a given corporate expenditure. 
The point here is that in case after case after case the FEC has lost in court seeking to restrict the rights of individual citizens to engage in issue advocacy. There is no basis for this effort. And the courts have been turning them down and turning them down and turning them down. In fact, there have been three cases in the last few months: North Carolina Right to Life versus Bartlett, April 30, 1998, an issue advocacy case decided consistent with the observations the Senator from Kentucky has made; Right to Life of Duchess County versus FEC, June 1, 1998 of this year, another decision consistent with the points the Senator from Kentucky has made; and Virginia Society of Human Life versus Caldwell, June 5 of this year. 
In short, there is no constitutional way--and importantly, we are not going to do that by passing this unfortunate legislation--but there is no constitutional way that the government can shut these people up at any point, up to and including the election. There is no legal basis, no constitutional basis for the assumption that there are any restrictions that can be placed upon the ability of citizens to criticize elected officials, or anyone else for that matter, up to and including the day before the election. 
Finally, let me say, as I mentioned yesterday, the institutions in America pushing the hardest for these restrictions on groups are the newspapers who engage in issue advocacy every day, both in their news stories and on their editorial pages, up to and including the election. Their issue advocacy would be totally untouched, and I am not arguing that we should touch it. I think they are free to speak. What bothers me about the newspapers, particularly the New York Times, the Washington Post and USA Today, they want to shut everybody else up. They want to have a free ride when it comes to criticizing political figures in proximity to an election. Fortunately, the courts would not allow that. 
This measure is not going to pass so we won't have to worry about it, but it is a flawed concept, and I think it is important for our colleagues to understand that. 
How much time do I have?

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the fundamental notion underlying the McCain-Feingold bill is that politicians should be allowed to control all of the political speech in proximity to an election except for that by the press. The press would be free and unfettered in engaging in issue advocacy, in endorsing candidates, and doing anything it wanted to under the first amendment at any time, up to and including the last 60 days before an election. I do not dispute that. I think they should have that right. But I find it disingenuous at best--absurd, the more you think about it--that the press would like to quiet the voices of others. 
First, they would like to quiet the voices of the parties by eliminating so-called soft money. Mr. President, `soft money' is a pejorative term for non-Federal money. This is a Federal system. There are State elections, there are local elections; the two great national parties frequently care who gets elected Governor of Arizona or who gets elected to the city council in Phoenix. The notion that the Federal Government should federalize the two great national parties is absurd, inappropriate, and unwise. 
In addition to that, it would provide for the Federal Election Commission the power to supervise every election in America. In other words, we would federalize the entire American political system. This kind of notion of Federal power grabs and the quieting of voices also applies to what the McCain-Feingold bill seeks to do to individuals and groups. 
Under this bill, it would be very difficult if not impossible for individuals to express themselves, or groups to express themselves, within 60 days of an election. `Quiet those voices, too,' the politicians say. So we will quiet the parties by making it impossible for them to involve themselves in State and local elections, and make it impossible for them to engage in issue advocacy, constitutionally protected speech, and we will also reach over to the issue advocacy of everybody else and we will make it impossible for them to criticize any of us within 60 days of an election. 
This is a great idea for incumbents. We all would like to control our elections, and this would sure give us a way to do it. We would not have to worry any longer about those nasty interest groups that don't like our voting records going out there in the last 2 months before an election and saying bad things about us; we would shut them up. We wouldn't have our political party coming in to defend us or, for that matter, the other political party coming in to attack us; we would shut them up. 
In short, we would just sort of hermetically seal the environment for 60 days before an election, with the exception of the New York Times, the Washington Post, USA Today, and all the other folks who would still be free--as they should be free--under the first amendment to have their say at any point in the course of a year, including the last 60 days before an election. 
Mr. President, this is terrible public policy--terrible public policy--disguised as some kind of positive reform. The good news is, we are not going to pass this bill, but if we had passed it, the issue advocacy restrictions on outside groups would certainly not survive the first Federal district court in which it landed, and I guarantee you, it would land there very, very quickly. When something is so clearly and obviously unconstitutional, it seems to me that the Senate ought not to pass it. 
With regard to the political parties, why in the world, Mr. President, should we prevent the political parties from engaging in issue advocacy? Everybody else in America will be able to do it, because I guarantee you, the restrictions on independent groups in this bill would be struck down. There is not a serious constitutional lawyer in the country who doubts that. 
Everybody would be free to have their say in the last 60 days before an election: Outside groups, because the restrictions on them would certainly fall as unconstitutional; the newspapers, because no one really wants to shut them up. We don't frequently like what they have to say, but they have a right to say it. But the political parties are conceivably taken off the playing field--the one entity in American politics that, for example, is willing to support challengers, those trying to come from nowhere to get elected. It is not easy to be a challenger. The one entity out there willing to support challengers is the political parties. We ought not to be making them weaker, we ought to be encouraging them to be strengthened. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, some in the press have suggested there is a sense of momentum for this issue because it passed the House of Representatives. I would remind my colleagues that a measure similar to this passed the House in the 101st Congress, the 102d Congress, and the 103d Congress. So it is not unusual, I would say, for the House of Representatives to pass this kind of legislation. It has happened before, and I would say it does not reveal any sense of momentum behind a plan that is constitutionally flawed. Speaking of the Constitution, we were on this same issue last fall and then we were on it again in February. The outcome was the same during those debates, and in a sense what we are doing is having the same debate once again. 
There have been suggestions, particularly on the other side, that the courts might be open to changing the Buckley case or revisiting it in some way. So I think it is always appropriate, when we have these periodic campaign finance debates, to bring my colleagues up to date on what has been happening in the courts. As we all know, the so-called reformers have been out around the country seeking to get new laws on the books at various States and localities, some by referendum, some by State statute. All of those, of course, are subsequently found in the courts, in litigation. So what I would like to do here at the outset is give my colleagues an update on what is happening in the courts; all of these court cases, by the way, reaffirming Buckley in one way or another. 
I would remind everyone--I think everyone in this Chamber surely knows the Buckley case, Buckley v. Valeo, the landmark case in the area of campaign finance reform which has not been changed by any of the courts over the last almost 25 years. In fact, court decisions have deepened and broadened areas of permissible political speech over the quarter of a century since this landmark case, widely thought to have been written by Justice Brennan. So let me just run down a few cases that have been decided just since April of this year, since there is a good deal of litigation emanating from these State efforts to restrict the rights of people to be involved in political activity. 
On April 17, in Americans for Medical Rights v. Heller, the United States District Court for the District of Nevada held that the Nevada State Constitution could not be enforced so as to prevent issue advocacy groups from contributing more than $5,000 to a ballot initiative. This was a court response to an effort to try to shut up groups in criticizing politicians--very similar to the measure currently before us which seeks to make it essentially impossible for a group to criticize a politician in proximity to an election. 
On April 27, in Kruse v. Cincinnati, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that a Cincinnati ordinance placing spending caps on campaigns for city council violated the first amendment. This case is noteworthy. Here was a conscious effort on the part of the city council in Cincinnati to get a court, some court, to revisit the question of whether spending limits were permissible. This is something the Buckley case struck down forthwith, and forthrightly. That effort to get the court to reverse its decision was unsuccessful. 
On April 29, in North Carolina Right to Life v. Bartlett, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina held a State statute that attempted to regulate issue advocacy groups as unconstitutional. That is the same issue we have before us in the McCain-Feingold amendment, the effort by the Government to try to regulate constitutionally protected issue advocacy. 
On June 1, in FEC v. Akins, the Supreme Court held that voters have standing to challenge the FEC's dismissal of an administrative complaint. Although the Court remanded the case for further proceedings, the Court strongly suggested that a membership organization's communications with its own members would not meet the definition of `expenditures' subject to regulation by Congress. 
In another case, on June 1, in Right to Life of Dutchess County v. FEC, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York joined a chorus of many other Federal groups in striking down--striking down--an FEC regulation that prohibited corporate speech, even though that speech stopped short of the `express advocacy' standard adopted in the Buckley case. 
Then on June 4, in Russell v. Burris, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that contribution limits of $300 to certain State candidates violated the first amendment and that special privileges to so-called `small donor' PACs violated the equal protection clause. 
On June 11, in State of Washington v. 119 Vote No!, the Supreme Court of Washington held that a State statute which prohibits a person from sponsoring, with actual malice, a political advertisement containing a false statement of material fact to be facially unconstitutional. 
On July 21, in Virginia Society for Human Life v. Caldwell, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that a Virginia campaign finance statute could not reach the conduct of groups that engaged in issue advocacy. 
On July 23, in Shrink Missouri Government PAC v. Adams, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that a first amendment challenge of a State statute limiting campaign contributions was so likely to succeed that a preliminary injunction should issue preventing Missouri from enforcing the statute. 
On July 23, in Suster v. Marshall, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit enjoined the enforcement of a provision of the Ohio Code of Judicial Conduct which capped spending in a judicial election for the Ohio Common Pleas Court at $75,000--again, a court decision striking down spending limits. 
On August 10, in Alaska Civil Liberties Union v. the State of Alaska, the Superior Court for the State of Alaska granted summary judgment, ruling Alaska's campaign finance reform legislation unconstitutional and, therefore, null and void. 
Finally, on August 11, in Vannatta v. Keisling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that an Oregon ballot measure passed into law which prohibited State candidates from using or directing any contributions from out-of-district residents and penalizing candidates when more than 10 percent of their total funding comes from such individuals does not survive scrutiny under the first amendment. 
My reason for the recitation of these cases is these are cases just since April, and every single one of them, at least three of which are right on the point of issue advocacy, which is what we have before us today, have ruled these government restrictions unconstitutional. 
So there is virtually no chance--no chance--that the restrictions on citizens' ability to engage in issue advocacy contained in McCain-Feingold will be upheld as constitutional. There is certainly no evidence that the courts are moving in the direction of allowing governments at any level to restrain the voices of citizens at any time in proximity to an election or any other time. 
Mr. President, issue advocacy is, of course, as I said, constitutionally protected speech. The New York Times, the Washington Post, and USA Today are some of the most aggressive users of issue advocacy. These multimillion-dollar corporations express themselves without limitation at any point, both in the news sections and on the editorial pages. They are the practitioners of the first amendment. 
The problem with the New York Times, the Washington Post, and USA Today is that they think the first amendment only applies to them. It is amusing to look at the amount of space dedicated over the last 2 years by these three newspapers to their efforts to aid and abet those who would shut up citizens and make it difficult for them to exercise their constitutional rights. 
Just looking at the New York Times, they have editorialized on the subject of campaign finance reform between July 1, 1997, and September 9, 1998, 82 times. The average number of days between campaign finance editorials in the New York Times is 8. On the average, every 8 days, the New York Times is lobbying for campaign finance reform, which they have a constitutional right 
to do. What is particularly amusing is the way in which they do it, which is remarkably similar to issue advocacy that groups engage in frequently on television. 
The typical issue ad says at the end of the ad, `Call Congressman' so-and-so `and tell him to either keep on doing what he is doing' or `stop doing what he is doing.' I thought it was particularly amusing that the April 21, 1998, editorial in the New York Times was just like issue advocacy. The same opportunity they would deny to anyone else, they engaged in themselves. 
They opined here about the importance of passing their version of campaign finance reform and then listed Members of the House and their phone numbers--exactly the kind of thing they don't want anybody else to do. Exactly the kind of thing they would prohibit every other American citizen from doing in proximity to an election, they are doing right here on the editorial page. 
Of course, the newspapers are exempt from the Federal Election Campaign Act. I think they should be exempt, but I find it disingenuous in the extreme for them to engage in the very same practice. This is a huge, multi-, probably billion-dollar, American corporation, a corporation engaging in issue advocacy, putting the heat on elected officials, putting their phone numbers in there, saying call them--call them up and tell them to do this or not to do that. That is what they don't want anybody else in America to be able to do. 
Mr. President, part of what is at the root of this debate is: Who is going to have the opportunity to express themselves, who is going to be able to engage in political discourse, in this country? Just newspapers and nobody else? Boy, that would be a good deal for them. That is exactly what they have in mind, because they practice issue advocacy every day, and sometimes it is remarkably similar to the issue ads you see on television run by organized labor, or plaintiffs' lawyers, or you name it. `Call Congressman' so-and-so, `and tell him to do' this or do that, it said in the New York Times of April 21. 
The Washington Post has been not far behind, another megacorporation which exists for the purpose of influencing political discourse in this country. This big corporation, of course, like the other big corporation I just mentioned, the New York Times, is exempt from the Federal Election Campaign Act, and this big corporation, too, would like to restrict the speech of other American citizens in order to enhance its own views. 
On the subject of campaign finance reform, going back to January 1, 1997, the Washington Post has written 53 editorials. The average number of days between editorials on campaign finance reform in the Washington Post is 12. So, Mr. President, every 12 days, this great, huge American corporation is lobbying the Congress to take a particular position on campaign finance reform. 
I defend their right to do it, but I find it amusing--if not really troubling more than amusing--that this kind of corporation should have this kind of influence and everybody else in society in proximity to an election would be essentially muffled from being able to mention a candidate's name in proximity to an election. 
So some big corporations would have an advantage; others a disadvantage. That is what the Washington Post would like--more power and more advantage. USA Today, another huge American corporation--between January 1, 1997, and today, USA Today has run 25 editorials on the subject of campaign finance reform. That is an average of one every 25 days--another major American corporation seeking to influence the course of this legislation, which also supports McCain-Feingold, which would make it impossible for anybody else to do the same thing in proximity to an election. 
The USA Today editorial just yesterday was remarkably akin to an issue ad, Mr. President, remarkably akin to an issue ad, just like the New York Times editorial back in April I mentioned awhile ago. They state their case on the editorial page, and then they list all the Republican Senators, and particularly they highlight those who are up for reelection this year. And they put their phone numbers by their names. Issue advocacy, Mr. President; within 60 days of an election. 
Under the bill they support, over at USA Today, nobody else in America could do this, could mention a candidate's name within 60 days of an election. So this big corporation would have its power further enhanced by the quieting of the voices of everybody else in America who sought to express themselves within 60 days of an election by maybe saying something unkind about some Member of Congress. 
So, Mr. President, there isn't any question; there is an enormous transfer of influence and power to the part of corporate America that owns and operates newspapers. Of course they are enthusiastic about this kind of legislation. This industry, the newspaper industry, which already has an enormous amount of power, would be dramatically more powerful if the kind of legislation we have before us were passed. 
Some would argue there is a media loophole in the Federal Election Campaign Act because they are exempt from all of these restrictions that currently apply to everybody else, and certainly would be exempt of the greater restrictions that this legislation seeks to place on Americans of all kinds. 
Mr. President, there are some Americans who believe that newspapers are a bigger problem, a bigger problem than campaign contributors. There was an interesting article back on October 21, 1997--excuse me, Mr. President, it is a Rasmussen poll, an interesting finding.  
More than 80% of Americans would like to place restrictions on the way that newspapers cover political campaigns. In fact, restricting newspaper coverage is far more popular than public funding of campaigns. 
Restrictions on newspaper coverage is far more popular than public funding of campaigns. This is the American people in a poll in late 1997 discussing the influence of newspapers on the political process. 
Further, in the description of the poll finding, it says: 
One reason for the public desire to restrict newspapers is that Americans think reporters and editorial writers have a bigger impact on elections than campaign contributions.

Mr. McCONNELL. Not at the moment. 
The Rasmussen Research survey found that 68% of Americans believe newspaper editorials are more important than a $1,000 contribution. Only 17% think such contributions have a bigger impact. 
Americans may also support restrictions on reporters because more than seven-out-of-ten believe personal preferences of reporters influence their coverage of politics. In fact, Americans overwhelmingly believe (by a 61% to 19% margin) that a candidate preferred by reporters will beat a candidate who raises more money. 
Let me repeat that, Mr. President. This comprehensive poll of American citizens on the influence of newspapers, in late 1997, found that Americans, by a margin of 61 percent to 19 percent, believe that a candidate preferred by reporters will beat a candidate who raises more money. 
Mr. President, I am making these points somewhat tongue in cheek because, obviously, I am not advocating restrictions on newspapers. But what I find particularly outrageous is newspapers advocating restrictions on everyone else. Who are they to think that they are the only ones who are to have influence in the American political process? 
Richard Harwood of the Washington Post, on October 15, 1997, made some interesting points along those lines. Mr. Harwood said: 
It is fortunate for the press in the United States that the voice of the people is not the voice of God or the Supreme Court. 
That is because Americans, in the mass, believe in `free speech' and a `free press' only in theory. In practice they reject those concepts. 
That was the troubling conclusion drawn, ironically, from a major study of public opinion commissioned in 1990 by the American Society of Newspaper Editors as part of the observance of the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights. . . . . 
So this was a survey taken, I guess, by the Louis Harris organization for the Center for Media and Public Affairs. And Mr. Harwood points out the findings are, as he puts it, `depressing.' 
The first point in this survey of the American people, Harwood, in talking about the American people, said: 
If they had their way, `the people'--meaning a majority of adults--would not allow journalists to practice their trade without first obtaining, as lawyers and doctors must, a license. 
The second finding of this survey: 
[The people] would confer on judges the power to impose fines on publishers and broadcasters for `inaccurate and biased reporting'. . . . 
Third: 
They would empower government entities to monitor the work of journalists for fairness and compel us to `give equal coverage to all sides of a controversial issue.' They also favor the creation of local and national news councils to investigate complaints against the press and issue `corrections' of erroneous news reports. 
Harwood further points out, at the end of his article: 
So press freedoms remain, as in the past, dependent not on the goodwill of the masses but on the goodwill and philosophical disposition of the nine men and women of the Supreme Court of the United States. 
Mr. President, I make those points to illustrate that the principal beneficiaries of the amendment before us are the huge corporations of America that control the press. They almost uniformly support legislation that would quiet the voices, at least in 60 days' proximity to an election, of all other American citizens, thereby enhancing the ability of newspapers to control the outcome of American elections. 
The good news, Mr. President, is we are not going to pass this legislation. The further good news is the courts would not uphold this legislation if we did pass it. I just mentioned three cases that have been handed down in the last 6 months indicating that Government restrictions on issue advocacy, tried by State governments, is clearly unconstitutional. 
But what is truly disturbing in this free country, Mr. President, is that these big corporations that own these newspapers are so aggressively advocating efforts to quiet the voices of other American citizens. 
It is truly alarming that in 1998 these big corporations, which already have enormous influence in our country, want to have even more. In fact, they want to have a monopoly on influence in proximity to an election. And as we all know, they are perfectly free to do editorials, both on the front page and on the editorial page--and do--up to and including the day before the election. And I defend their right to do it. 
But what is disturbing is they do not want to let anybody else have their say. So this legislation, Mr. President, dramatically benefits the fourth estate at the expense of other citizens in our country. 
Now, finally, before going to Senator Byrd, I have heard it said that we need to pass this kind of legislation. I have heard for over a decade we need to pass this kind of legislation in order to restore the faith of the American people in the Congress. In October of 1994, in the waning days of the end of Democrat control of this Congress, only 27 percent of the American people approved of the Congress. As of this past week, the congressional approval rating was 55 percent. Now, the 55 percent approval rating Congress has today comes after two Federal elections, 1994 and 1996, with record spending, three intervening filibusters of McCain-Feingold and its ancestor, Boren-Mitchell, and even the Clinton-Gore fundraising scandal. 
Clearly, Mr. President, there is no political imperative to pass campaign finance bills that are unconstitutional. To suggest that the Congress is still unpopular--which it isn't--or that when it was unpopular it was somehow related to this issue simply cannot be supported by the facts. 
Bill Schneider, a reputable pollster who works for CNN, back in February of this year had an interesting article in the National Journal. This was when the approval rating of Congress began to turn around. He pointed out in February 14 of this year: 
For the first time in at least 25 years, a majority of Americans approve of the way Congress is doing its job. Congress--perhaps the most ridiculed institution in America --has rarely gotten above a 40 per cent job-approval rating since 1974. Now, it's at 56 per cent. 
That was then; it is 55 percent now. 
`What's going on here?' said Bill Schneider. 
A balanced budget, a booming economy and--not the least important--a smaller government. `We have the smallest government in 35 years, but a more progressive one,' the President said. Right now, trust in government is at its highest level since the Reagan era, when it was `morning in America.' 
Now, we clearly do not need to pass this unconstitutional legislation in order to deal with cynicism about the Congress, which enjoys a 55 percent approval rating. 
I might say that at the end of the Congress in 1994, I was personally involved in an all-night filibuster on September 30, 1994. I will never forget it. It is the only real filibuster we have had here in 10 years. It was an all-nighter. The cots were out. People were blurry eyed. But it was a remarkably uplifting event for those of us who were involved in it. We defeated Boren-Mitchell a mere 5 weeks before the greatest Republican congressional victory of this century. 
Suffice it to say, there is no connection between this issue and electoral success. The responses you get on polls on this issue depend on how you ask the question. This is an arcane, complicated subject, and it is the obligation and the responsibility of Members of the Senate to protect the Constitution, to protect political discourse in this country, and to do the right thing one more time. 
Mr. President, I am confident that, at the appropriate time, this amendment will be defeated.

Mr. McCONNELL. Following the astute observations of the Senator from the State of Utah, in fact that is where the correlation is, is it not? Year after year after year, we see that there is a direct correlation between spending and turnout, a fact that makes good sense. If there is a contested election, with two well-financed candidates, the turnout goes up. If very little money is spent, very little interest is generated and turnout goes down. 
So I ask my friend from Utah if the Utah experience that he related to us is not almost always the case?

In fact, is the Senator's point that regional candidates or candidates with a cause are now out of luck as a result of the last reform?

<TEXT>
Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I support the amendment by Senator Hutchison modifying the bill's language on funding for the Korean Energy Development Organization, which we refer to as KEDO. 
I would like to step back for a moment to 1995, shortly after the agreed framework was signed in October of 1994. By March of 1995, there was the first evidence that the North Koreans were cheating. In hearings before this subcommittee and in writing, I challenged the administration's assertions that the North was in full compliance and that no U.S. oil was being diverted. Eventually, it became clear that the North was cheating and diverting oil. Although new monitoring procedures were established, there was no suspension of oil or a threat to cut off the program. I am convinced that this is when the North learned that they could engage in a pattern of challenge, deception and noncompliance without any penalty at all. 
In fiscal year 1997, the Senate had an extensive debate about providing U.S. assistance to provide fuel oil to North Korea and to support administrative expenses for KEDO. The bill my subcommittee reported to the Senate capped funds at $13 million, half the administration's request, and provided the funds in three stages, requiring certification that the fuel was not--I repeat, not--being diverted for military purposes. 
At that time, many of us were uncomfortable continuing any aid to this terrorist regime, let alone doubling the amount available which the administration had requested. In its statement of policy, this is what the administration had to say at that time about any curbs, cuts or conditions:  
Among our most serious concerns are the restrictions placed on the U.S. contributions to KEDO, especially the funding cap that reduces the request by nearly half. This funding is inadequate to meet our commitment to support the North Korea framework agreement and is unacceptable to the Secretaries of State and Defense. KEDO is one of the pillars of U.S. nonproliferation policy which seeks to ensure strategic stability in the Pacific. Our very modest $25 million request for funds helps continue the reduction of North Korea's nuclear weapons capacity, while leveraging strong burdensharing contributions from South Korea, Japan and other countries. The administration strongly urges the committee to remove the cap . . . and drop the needlessly restrictive certification language. 
Again, that is what they had to say. 
Regrettably, the administration prevailed on this floor in a 73-to-27 vote allowing full funding for KEDO. So I lost that one, I say to my friend from Texas. 
Mr. President, I think it is now safe to say that on both the nonproliferation and burden-sharing front, KEDO is a bust. 
All last week, the administration was too busy with bilateral talks in New York to brief the committee on the status of negotiations over allegations disclosed in the press that the North is building a secret facility to house a nuclear reactor replacing the one sealed under the Agreed Framework. 
With those talks still underway, as the Senator from Texas pointed out, Monday--this week--for the first time in more than 5 years, North Korea carried out a flight test of a ballistic missile which the South Korean Government estimates has a range of over 1,200 miles. The first stage of the missile landed in waters between Russia and Japan, with the second stage flying over Japanese territory and falling into the Pacific. Understandably, the Japanese have withdrawn their pledge of billions of dollars for the construction of an alternative reactor--a perfectly logical response to what happened Monday. 
Mr. President, if U.S. funding for KEDO is the pillar of our nonproliferation policy and the key to burden sharing, I think it is time we start building a new foundation for our policy. Secret nuclear facilities, flight testing, ballistic missiles, and who knows what other activities are not a nonproliferation policy, they are simply a nonpolicy. 
Today, I say to the Senator from Texas, I think her amendment is excellent and is exactly the direction in which we should go. The administration will complain that these new conditions are not consistent with the Agreed Framework, that the North did not agree to suspend its nuclear weapons program in return for $30 million, they only agreed to freeze part of it. 
Mr. President, it makes no sense for the United States to continue to pay for an agreement which fails to protect our allies and our interests in the Pacific. Monday's tests, along with the past pattern of deception and diversion, should convince all of us we should not spend millions more from our limited foreign aid coffers to prop up a government determined to acquire and to sell nuclear weapons. 
As I mentioned previously, this is hardly the first time we have debated the administration's flawed policy on the peninsula. We have had years of compromise, capitulation, and concessions from the administration. The North blusters and blackmails; there is tough talk followed by no action or, worse still, concessions for more fuel and food. 
Thirty-six thousand American troops standing guard in the South deserve more than that. Once and for all, it should be absolutely clear to the North, we will not pay their way to test, deploy, or sell nuclear weapons. We will not pay for the appearance or possibility of compliance with the Agreed Framework. 
Again, I commend the Senator from Texas. I think her amendment is right on the mark and I congratulate her for it.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have an understanding with the distinguished Senator from Connecticut that at whatever point the two democratic Senators who are requesting an opportunity to be heard on the McCain amendment arrive on the Senate floor, we can go back to the McCain amendment and dispose of that. With that understanding with the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, I have no objection to temporarily laying aside the McCain amendment.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona offered his amendment yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock. We are trying to make progress on the bill. 
I understand there is one person who desires to speak on the other side. 
In fairness to everyone, with the concurrence of the Senator from Arizona, if we can't bring this to conclusion, I am going to make a motion to table the McCain amendment at 3 o'clock so that we can get an expression of opinion on the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Arizona. 
In the meantime, Mr. President, I think we have some amendments that have been cleared on both sides which I will shortly send to the desk: a Brownback amendment on Iran; DeWine amendment on alternative crop development; three Craig amendments; a Reed-Reid amendment on scholarships; and a DeWine amendment on Haiti.

<DOCNO>105-mcconnell-ky-1-19980901</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the bill before us is a $12.599 billion bill within an allocation of $12.6 billion. 
While it is below the administration's request of $14.1 billion in fiscal year 1999, we provided virtually the same level as last year's funding. If we compare last year's level with this year, including arrears, both bills are approximately the same level--$13.1 billion. 
Fortunately, we can achieve this level because Senator Domenici and the Budget Committee decided to give arrears special treatment relieving scoring pressure. 
Let me review some of the highlights which many members have expressed interest in. 
For the first time we have reduced the level of support for Israel and Egypt. This is the first reduction of a planned 10 years, evenly distributed schedule. We reduced Israel's economic aid by a total of $120 million to $1.080 billion and increased security assistance by $60 million to $1.860 billion. 
There is no increase in security assistance for Egypt so to maintain proportionality we have only reduced the economic aid program by $40 million to $775 million. Security assistance stays constant at $1.3 billion. 
We have also tried to preserve a relatively strong level of funding for the New Independent States which most of us agree need the help to finish their transition to free market democracies. In total we have provided $740 million. 
Within the NIS account we have continued to earmark levels for three countries, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia. 
Although I strongly support securing Ukraine's political and economic independence, and believe we should do all we can to help, I must confess some frustration with the pace of reforms in that country. It is clear the economic environment in Ukraine is very difficult to work in. In particular, the government has been slow to recommend--and the Rada even slower to pass--essential tax and commercial law reforms, the key to attracting and expanding private investment. 
Because of the slow pace of reforms, the bill reduces the overall level of support for Ukraine from $225 million to $210 million. The bill also authorizes the Secretary of State to withhold 50 percent of the funds for 120 days until she certifies that the Ukrainians are on the right track and have made progress in their tax and commercial structure and demonstrated a serious commitment to economic reforms. This will not be easy, but I believe President Kuchma has recognized it is in Ukraine's interest to advance and accelerate reforms. 
Ukraine is not the only weak and worrisome economy. Since working on the 1993 bill, Senator Leahy and I have both expressed concern about the inconsistent and slow pace of reforms in Russia which are very much in the news this very day. August headlines once again demonstrate our aid and that of other donors is not achieving crucial and sustainable results. 
For at least 4 years, we have all read the same headlines. Russia faces imminent financial collapse and Moscow calls for immediate international support, always with a measure of justifiable urgency. There are round the clock negotiations, in which Moscow, once again, agrees to all the right tough financial, tax and economic reforms, donor funds are disbursed, there is a deep sigh of international relief, and then absolutely nothing happens. 
I have repeatedly warned officials at Treasury that it seems unwise at the very time we are dismantling our welfare system here at home, that we create a new program of destructive dependency abroad. Russia's addiction to international loans is not healthy--for their economy or our interests. The administration must follow through and use our aid for programs which will sustain the needed tax and commercial reforms or the current crisis will only get worse, if that is possible. 
The crisis in investor confidence and the flight of capital is not a recent event. In fact this latest crisis reflects how little foreign capital has been invested in generating jobs, income and growth in manufacturing and production. The collapse we are witnessing is driven by the fact that the Russian budget and economy are fueled primarily by two sources--international loans and the artificially inflated bond market. Given the choice between the promise of a government bond return of 150 percent or 
sinking capital into an industrial plant where there are no commercial regulations protecting contract sanctity or investment, money has moved into Moscow's bond market. 
But, even that investment has been slim compared to other global economies. Before the stock market was closed, only a handful of companies were being traded, each losing enormous ground. Reports of 80 percent losses in value in such thin markets exaggerate the impression of the scale of trade and more importantly hid the real story. A few companies lost, and are losing, a lot of money. However, real, long term investment in Russia's productive capacity has never really grown. With no equity, no real investment to back it, the Russian ruble was bound to collapse calling attention to the basic problems with the commercial environment which neither the administration nor the Yeltsin government have been willing to tackle. Now, there is little chance--but no choice to carry out overdue reforms. 
Let me add one more caution. This overhaul should not be the IMF's formula response. Raising taxes in an economy where there is little income and less growth isn't painful; it's stupid. Some Russian entities, most notably Gazprom, clearly have evaded tax collection in the past, at the expense of starved government coffers. But, in general higher taxes are not going to solve Russia's long term crisis. Confidence and investment will only be restored and expanded by reforms which implement and enforce a rational, consistent commercial rule of law. 
While the NIS accounts is both large and important, I think the core of this year's bill has been defined by events in Asia. What is new this year is the serious commitment we have made to support our trading partners, allies and friends across the Pacific, as they work through the most turbulent economic conditions they have experienced since World War II. 
There are several Asian related initiatives worth noting. 
First, in title VI, we include full support for the new arrangements to borrow and the quota to replenish depleted resources for the IMF. After extensive discussion and debate, the Senator voted for a bill which provided both funding and reforms in the management of the IMF. This bill includes the Senate passed version in its entirety. 
Many share my concern that the IMF, and other international institutions, have been remote, indifferent and very closed societies dominated by foreign bureaucrats who are happy to take our money and spend it without accountability to any public authority or government. 
This legislation takes a first step toward opening the IMF's doors and shedding light on their management polices and practices. I don't want anyone to conclude that the IMF will be as accessible as your credit union on the corner, but we have started a process which I hope eventually will produce a better managed and more open, accountable institution. 
While I was less concerned in the Spring about the IMF's financial standing, I now believe the time has come for the Congress to complete our commitment. The recent repackaged $22 billion Russian loan compelled activation of Fund's reserve line of credit known as the General Arrangements to Borrow which this legislation will replenish. With the possibility of new requirements in Asia and closer to home in Latin America, I think the Fund's solid financial footing avoids further U.S. bilateral commitment of funds and is key to the recovery of our Pacific trading partners which, I expect, in turn, will help stave off a slow down of our economy. 
In addition to replenishing the IMF, we have recommended other steps to strengthen the Asian economies. We have increased the subsidy for the Export Import Bank significantly over last year, which was not easy given the overall budget pressure. However, export support is more important than ever for the U.S. economy, especially as our traditional partners suffer setbacks and devaluations making their products cheaper and more competitive on the world market. 
In addition to our commitment to U.S. financial institutions deeply engaged in Asia, this bill also specifically addresses the crisis in Indonesia, Burma and Cambodia. 
Senator Stevens and Inouye have been especially concerned by the collapse of the Indonesia economic and political situation, as all of us have. This time last year, I was convinced that the collapse in investor confidence, driving the rupiah down to devastating new lows each week, would only be reversed with a major political change. I believed then, as now, that until elections are held, and the country is provided honest, strong democratic leadership, Indonesia is destined to struggle, if not fail, 
Suharto's departure was welcome, but long overdue. He has left behind a shell of a government and the risk of more violence and instability grows. In this context, I have been deeply disappointed by AID and the administration's slow response to Indonesia's problems. Indonesia continues to be the regional economic undertow dragging down and potentially drowning each of her neighbors. The IMF, the World Bank, the Asian Bank, and AID all lack a clear, consistent strategy on how to address this crisis. 
At this point conservative estimates suggest at least 60 million people are unemployed placing pressure on virtually every family. This bill provides $100 million to launch a serious economic and political effort to help put the country back on track. It directs funds to strengthen political parties to assure quick and fair elections and it provides food, medical, job generating an related humanitarian assistance. But what is equally important is it will compel AID to carry out this support outside the cozy, long standing relationship with official ministries and their bureaucrats. The bill requires 80 percent of the aid be administered through non-government organizations which not only will ease suffering but also help build new, grass roots aid delivery mechanisms and strengthen the next generation of political and economic leaders. 
Next, the bill expands political and humanitarian support to Burma. I think we are at a point where our ASEAN partners agree the junta in Rangoon has gone too far. I commend Secretary Albright for her public statements and effort to secure the return of the legitimate government and urge her to continue her crucial work in the days ahead. 
While I have confidence in her commitment, much of her effort seems to be undermined by events in country. To assure American policy and practice are consistent both in Washington and in Rangoon, I have set aside $2 million which may be expended only after written consultation with the legitimate government elected in 1990. This is not a precedent--there has been past dialog between other donors and the legitimate government establishing guidelines for the administration of development aid. I do recognize this may be difficult to accomplish, but U.S. policy and practice must press forward and actively include the 1990 government in any dialog which involves our funds. Ultimately, these funds may simply sit in trust for a future free day in Burma, but I think our support for democracy must be in both words and financial action. 
For the past 2 years, I have held deep reservations about American embassy officials failure to support the restoration of democracy, but that is a debate for another day. What I hope to achieve today is a clear statement and representation of support for those who suffer the brutality of the regime by increasing our humanitarian aid and, to make absolutely clear support or the legitimate government which we should be working with rather than against. 
Finally, and briefly, I want to turn to Cambodia. I am deeply concerned that the environment leading up to elections was not conducive to a free and fair outcome. While the turnout was high, as we all know, elections are less about election day and more about the weeks and months beforehand. 
After Hun Sen's bloody coup in which scores of people were killed and many fled the country, his junta seemed to recognize the need to establish some margin of legitimacy or face a cut off of all international aid. Hun Sen called for elections and then for months systematically denied any opponent any real opportunity to campaign. At least 49 people were targeted and assassinated in politically motivated hits. Candidates were denied access to the press, and restricted from giving speeches, holding rallies or meeting and getting their message out to voters. 
While the opposition urged a delay in the election date, the Administration decided to support moving forward. Now there are real questions about the final outcome with opposition challenges over fraud and irregularities. Whatever the outcome, what is very clear is many of the candidates who returned to Cambodia to campaign did so at considerable risk. Sam Rainsy and his party members and FUNCIPEC candidates, all put their lives on the line to run for office, to reclaim their nation. 
I believe it is vital to stand by their commitment to democracy and assure their risk was not in vain. Thus, aid to Cambodia is conditioned upon certifications related to the fairness of the elections and the prospects for real democratic growth. Humanitarian aid and development aid provided through non-government organizations can proceed regardless, but it makes no sense to prop up a vicious, selfserving dictatorship. 
In conclusion, the market slides and crashes across Asia have convinced even the most isolationists among us that our economic and political security interests are defined and can be damaged by events as far away as Jakarta. With increased export assistance, by expanding humanitarian and economic initiatives, and building programs, to strengthen independent, democratic institutions worldwide, I believe this bill supports and secures U.S. interests in international economic growth and political stability, while living within the balanced budget agreement. 
I encourage my colleagues' support. 
I certainly urge my colleagues to support the bill. That completes my opening statement. Senator Leahy will probably want to make an opening statement.  
Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.

Senators Byrd and Hagel have been very involved in this issue and have recommended these changes so that programs can go forward, but Congress will have an opportunity to determine details on the planned activities. 
It has been very difficult to pin down just what the administration plans to do in the area of global climate change. I think these amendments strike the appropriate balance and meet the concerns raised by colleagues who want to maintain a U.S. leadership role on environmental issues, yet at the same time preserve the congressional oversight of these activities. 
So I send, Mr. President, both of these amendments to the desk.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send a package of technical amendments to the desk. It is a fairly long list, but essentially involves corrections, language inadvertently left out, changes to assure consistency and date corrections. For example, the word `appropriated' was struck in one instance and replaced with the technically correct `made available.' I send these technical amendments to the desk and ask for their immediate consideration.

Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from California has been waiting patiently to offer a couple of amendments, which I am cosponsoring. It looks to me, I say to my friend, as if we are now ready to deal with those. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be temporarily set aside.

<TEXT>
Mr. McCONNELL. I commend my friend and colleague from California for these two amendments, and I am proud to be a principal cosponsor of them. 
I think the amendments both define the core problems which afflict Indonesia, as well as offer clear support for the organizations and initiatives which will return Indonesia to a path of economic growth as Jakarta launches on a new democratic political course. 
The road ahead for Indonesia will not be easy, but I am confident of two things--first, what happens in Jakarta is of enormous strategic importance to the United States. Second, we should take note that the political changes underway are a direct result of the efforts of the Indonesian people. As they suffer an acute economic crisis causing dislocation, devastation and pain, they have managed to drive and direct political transition which I am hopeful will lead to an elected and truly democratic government. 
This course has not been without its horror stories. Let me speak to one of the two amendments which focuses on the ethnic violence which exploded in the Spring. For decades, the Indonesian Chinese community has played an important role in generating the exceptional economic growth which improved the quality of life for a majority of Indonesians. Although only six million strong, most have deep roots reaching back many generations and consider Indonesia their home. 
Tragically, for many Indonesian Chinese their place in Indonesia's rich life came to a shocking and sudden end in the violence which erupted in May. Indonesian Chinese homes, shops, and businesses were clearly targeted, burned, looted and destroyed in the riots which broke out. While it was difficult for the police to restore stability any where, it seemed to many no effort was made to protect Indonesian Chinese communities and their citizens. Most shocking of all were allegations of rape and attacks on women and young girls. Unfortunately, there are even allegations that police officers and army troops may have engaged in these atrocities. Non-government organizations have estimated that more than 160 women and girls were victims of these awful crimes, many of them Indonesian Chinese. 
While this violence has a very human face and toll, a number of news accounts have called attention to the crippling economic impact of this ethnic violence. Not only did Indonesian Chinese withdraw their capital, Southeast Asian Chinese in Hong Kong, Taiwan and elsewhere have pulled out and are reluctant to return. One expert has estimated it will be at least five years before the community is confident enough to resume investment--a fact that contributes to Indonesia's already grave economic woes. And, who could blame them? 
This amendment condemns the violence against ethnic Indonesian Chinese, encourages prompt full action by the government and provides for U.S. support for the effort to investigate and bring to justice those responsible for these outrageous acts. As Indonesia proceeds on its path to build a democratic and free nation, it is essential that the rights of minorities are respected and protected. I believe the government must take steps to fully investigate the violence suffered by the Indonesian Chinese community over the past several months and clearly support efforts to rebuild homes, businesses and lives. I was encouraged by President Habibe's decision to turn responsibility for the investigation over to the National Human Rights Commission which has pledged to conduct a prompt, complete investigation of all allegations of attacks and crimes. 
I welcomed the Commission Vice Chairman's response to suggestions that foreign media were generating false accounts of events. He said,  
These crimes are so serious they need no exaggeration and we must not lose sight of that. We want to work carefully and methodically and I can tell you that the evidence we are obtaining so far is very strong, and, yes, it is apparent there were gang rapes, and yes, some were very violent. 
The Vice Chairman has also confirmed that 20 victims of rape have since died, most by suicide and some within hours of the offenses. 
Since these preliminary positive signs, there was a report that the Commission was not able to reach any conclusions on the scale or pattern of attacks. I hope that Commission and our embassy will work hard to make sure all of the concerns raised by the Indonesian Chinese 
community are addressed before declaring their work done. 
Some observers seem to have an impression that this ethnic community is so wealthy they can and should leave Indonesia, but, that is simply not the case. As Jusef Wannadi, a prominent member of the community, noted, `The majority of Indonesia Chinese--poor laborers, farmers, fishermen and small shop owners--have no option but to try to survive in Indonesia.' 
His sentiments were echoed by a father of three: 
The worst thing is that you can't really stay but there is nowhere else to live. They tell me I am an Indonesian national, yet I am starting to feel homeless as well as stateless. Tell me, why should I have to leave my home? 
It is going to take a great deal of effort by a credible, elected government to heal these deep rifts dividing Indonesia which makes the process and prospects of political reform all the more urgent. The second amendment focuses on how the United States can expand and accelerate our support for this reconciliation and recovery. As I made clear in my opening statement, the Administration has been consistently behind the curve in supporting such an effort. 
Although AID's Administrator has pledged an expansion of food, medical and humanitarian relief very little has actually been made available, in part because the real needs are still a matter of guess work. Altough I have pressed since March, AID still hasn't conducted a nation-wide estimate of food shortages or other social safety net requirements. I am also disappointed by the slow pace of AID efforts to work and build upon Indonesia's vast Muslim community organizational networks. Two national organizations have clinics, schools, and community centers which already reach out to a majority of the population. Although they have expressed interest in working with AID, cooperation has been slow to materialize. 
AID must also expand support for political reforms. Media training and technical support, political party building and legal reforms are all urgently needed to secure the foundation for democratic institutions to constructively shape Indonesia's future. The bill, report and this amendment encourage improvements, and require a report on the conditions and status of our efforts in meeting national needs. 
The bill's commitment of $100 million along with these amendments sets a course for improving our relations and support for the important transition underway in a nation of criticial importance to the United States. Instability in Indonesia continues to be the undertow dragging down regional economic recovery. And, the Secretary of Defense has been very persuasive in making the case that a further decline into chaos in a country of more than 200 million people, a nation which staddles vital global shipping lanes, in a scenario he believes we should make every effort to prevent. 
Our support and Indonesian effort are the key to what lies ahead--to success--to building investor confidence--to recoverying capital which has fled--to protecting minorities--to restarting the engines of economic growth--to rebuilding American markets--to helping a key ally set a democratic course. 
Again, I commend the Senator from California for her interest and hard work to restore the vital partnership we share with Indonesia. 
As far as I know, Mr. President, there are no objections to these amendments on either side of the aisle, and I recommend that we proceed to passage.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, while we have a moment, I would like to recognize an organization from my home state of Kentucky which has been on the front lines responding to international disasters. 
The Presbyterian Disaster Assistance (PDA), headquartered in Louisville, has responded to international disaster issues in 37 countries and has mission relations in 80 countries. It is dedicated to responding to national and international disasters, aiding refugees and displaced persons, assisting refugee resettlement, educating the world's children, and making efforts designed to foster development abroad. Clearly, it has made a difference in the world and brought hope to the needy. 
Just recently, following the tragic bombings in Kenya and Sudan, PDA provided the staff services of its eye clinic and specialized orthopedic rehabilitation center for victims. PDA also worked closely with the Presbyterian Relief and Development Association of Sudan. 
In early summer, Presbyterian Disaster Assistance, in cooperation with other organizations, was able to provide a shipment of fishing supplies to over 25,000 households in the Upper Nile Region where the ability to fish the rivers will keep these people from slipping into the grip of famine. PDA was able to serve people across several ethnic boundaries, ensuring that this assistance benefited those most in need. 
Mr. President, I know the entire Senate joins me in saluting the courageous work of Presbyterian Disaster Assistance. It gives me a great deal of pride that this organization which offers such important and valuable service is headquartered in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. We all hope for a time when the efforts of organizations such as PDA are not necessary, but until that occurs we can take comfort that the job will be undertaken with vigor, compassion, and expertise.

Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. The Senator is quite right. Our aid program to Lebanon is structured so that all assistance is channeled through grants or contracts to American non-governmental organizations or U.S. firms. The American educational institutions there should be the first to be supported. Education is at the heart of what we are trying to accomplish with our aid program. It instills the fundamental values that will guide the next generation of leaders. It will determine whether those leaders share our commitment to democracy and free market principles, and whether they learn how to solve their own problems or remain dependent on us. An investment in American education will pay greater dividends than anything else we can do in Lebanon.

However, I too recognize Tunisia's importance in the Peace Process and have agreed with Senator Leahy to provide $7 million of Foreign Military Financing (FMF) in this bill. $5 million is available under draw down authority and $2 million will be available through a direct grant.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the amendment is really quite simple. The Federal Election Commission is like no other commission of the Federal Government. It has three Republicans and three Democrats. The general counsel, under the current system, could serve for a lifetime. All the McConnell amendment does is require that every 4 years the general counsel come up for reappointment and not be reappointed unless he can achieve at least four votes, thereby demonstrating to the full Commission, on a bipartisan basis, enough confidence to continue for another 4-year term. 
This guarantees that the general counsel will operate in a bipartisan manner, because a general counsel who, after 4 years, could not achieve votes from both parties, it seems to this Senator, clearly would fail a test of bipartisanship. 
This is not about the current occupant of the office. It is about ensuring that the Federal Election Commission continues to operate on a bipartisan basis. I hope the amendment will be approved.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I had earlier offered to enter into a much shorter time agreement, because this amendment really requires very little explanation. 
Last year, in the Treasury-Postal bill, we enacted term limits for the FEC Commissioners, and the terms of the Federal Election Commission members, Mr. President, are now one 6-year term. 
This amendment continues the necessary reform of the Federal Election Commission by providing that two critical staff members at the Federal Election Commission--the staff director and the general counsel--serve a 4-year term, but it is important to note, these important staff members could continue to serve with the vote of four of the six FEC Commissioners. It is important to remember the FEC is a 3-3 Commission, three Republicans, three Democrats. It was structured that way on purpose. It is necessary that it be structured that way. 
A very important part of the Federal Election Commission team is the staff director and the general counsel. Under the amendment that I have offered, cosponsored by Senator McCain, Senator Bennett and Senator Warner, the chairman of the Rules Committee, beginning in January, the general counsel and the staff director will be subject to a 4-year term, and in order to achieve that 4-year term, Mr. President, they would have to enjoy the confidence of both parties; that is, they would have to achieve four votes which means at least three of one party and one of another---- 
</TEXT>

Mr. McCONNELL. Or for that matter, Mr. President, the general counsel might achieve the votes of two of one party and two of another. In other words, four votes to achieve a 4-year term, after which the general counsel, if he or she wanted to continue--and many of them might not--would have to be able to reach across party lines, which is, of course, the spirit of the Federal Election Commission, in order to achieve a 4-year term. 
There is really nothing else to say about this amendment. It continues the reform process. 
Mr. President, how much of my time do I have remaining?

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the House vote was on a point of order. In fact, this particular reform has been recommended by the House authorizing committee. Let us not make this more complicated than it is. 
All this amendment does that the Senator from Kentucky has offered, in concert with the Senator from Utah, is require that on this--in this unique agency; it is different from any other agency in the Federal Government; it is three and three: three Republicans and three Democrats--to require that in this agency every 4 years the top two staff people enjoy enough confidence across party lines to be reappointed for 4 years. 
In fact, Mr. President, this amendment ensures that the agency will, in fact, be operated on a bipartisan basis because any staff director or general counsel who, after 4 years in the office, cannot get the confidence of both parties, Mr. President, clearly is not operating on a bipartisan basis and therefore should not be reappointed. 
So it is, in fact, this amendment that ensures that the Federal Election Commission achieves its original mission, which was to operate on a bipartisan basis. 
I see that my friend from Utah is on the floor. I yield to him whatever time he may need.

Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Utah, in further elaboration, after the enactment of this into law, we are not making the general counsel or the staff director subject to removal on a whim. They have a 4-year term, an opportunity to develop a record of bipartisan cooperation with both the Republicans and the Democrats on the Federal Election Commission before reaching the end of the 4-year term. At that point, if they want to continue enjoying enough confidence across party lines to achieve another 4-year appointment--it seems to me eminently reasonable. And, Mr. President, I think it guarantees that the Federal Election Commission will be the kind of agency that the Congress intended it to be when it was created in the mid 1970s. 
Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time, if I have any.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, very briefly, the FEC is clearly not underfunded. Its budget has more than doubled in the past decade. They are already getting $2 million more this year than last year under the budget of the Senator from Colorado, who has been quite generous to the Federal Election Commission--frankly, beyond what I would have done had I been in his shoes. The FEC's problems are certainly not on the financial side. 
Senator Glenn would give them an extra $2.8 million over and above the additional $2 million that the distinguished Senator from Colorado is already providing for this agency. You are talking about a 16-percent budget increase, a 16-percent budget increase for the Federal Election Commission. I think the U.S. district court, in a recent case, said it best when they reported in a Wall Street Journal editorial of July 13: 
If there is one thing all the players agree on, it is the need for better disclosure of contributions and a crackdown on violators. But a Federal court this week [the Wall Street Journal referring to a court decision] signaled that the Nation's electoral traffic cop, the Federal Election Commission, is lax in carrying out even that basic function. 
That is the point. The basic function of the Federal Election Commission is disclosure. 
The distinguished Senator from Colorado has more than adequately provided funding for this agency. To give them the additional money offered by the distinguished Senator from Ohio would provide a 16-percent increase over last year. Clearly, that is not appropriate. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Coats and Senator Jeffords for their exemplary work on the Coats Act's reauthorization of Head Start, Community Services Block Grants. Low-Income Home Energy Assistance, and the new authorization for an Individual Development Account demonstration. 
In particular, I appreciate their commitment to address a matter of serious concern to me regarding provisions that would unintentionally impact the Rural Development Loan Fund currently administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
The Coats Act includes the repeal of section 407 of the Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1986 and the Community Economic Development Act. These statutory repeals were included to achieve a reasonable clarification of the statutory authority held by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Upon further examination of these provisions after the committee mark-up, we discovered that this house-keeping action for HHS would eliminate provisions essential to the USDA's administration of the Rural Development Loan Fund, a lending program that has provided vital economic support to several communities in Kentucky. 
I understand that during conference, Senators Coats and Jeffords have agreed to recede to the House position and drop the Coats Act provisions that repeal section 407 and CEDA.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to engage the Senator from Arizona in a short colloquy. This is a complicated bill. It addresses areas where technology is rapidly evolving. Some of my questions may be fairly arcane and will be of interest only to those intimately familiar with the intricacies of the interstate simulcasting of horse racing so I ask that my fellow members be patient with us as we work our way through some of these issues. 
Senator Kyl, as you are well aware, there are a myriad of federal and state laws and regulations that impact interstate simulcasting. In every instance, I will assume that we are addressing only the application of the language of S. 474 and not the general legality of any specific example given. With that understanding, I will proceed with the first of my questions. 
Senator Kyl, am I correct that S. 474 does not apply to racetracks that may advertise or make past performances, how-to-bet, promotional, and other similar kinds of information available whether via a racetrack World Wide Web site on the Internet or other technological media.

Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Kyl, I now want to discuss the impact of S. 474 on the current practice of the horse racing industry commonly referred to as `simulcasting and commingling of parimutuel pools.' Simulcasting of horse racing across the country and around the world has grown exponentially in recent years, to the point that simulcasting now accounts for as much as 60 percent of the industry's total wagering. 
To foster growth in the simulcasting market, tracks now routinely merge or commingle the parimutuel pools from several tracks and off track parimutuel facilities into common parimutuel pools. Current odds and winning payoffs are then calculated using a totalizator system. Commingling is a practice preferred by bettors because it increases pool sizes and thus helps to minimize the fluctuation of odds and payoffs. 
Any diminution in its current ability to simulcast or commingle pools could have catastrophic effects on the parimutuel industry.

Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Kyl, I appreciate your willingness to consider the parimutuel industry. Now, if I may clarify a few more points. 
Section 2 of the bill exempts four categories from the definition of `information assisting in the placing of a bet or wager.' My next few questions relate to the applicability of these provisions. 
First, Senator Kyl, as to the first category of exempt information, found in subsection (8)(C)(i), am I correct in assuming that `common pool parimutuel pooling' and `commingling of parimutuel pools' are two names for the same process--the merging of parimutuel pools from two or more locations for purposes of calculating the odds and payoffs?

Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Kyl, according to subsection (8)(C)(i) in section 2 of the bill, information concerning parimutuel pools that is exchanged between certain racetracks or other parimutuel facilities is exempted from the prohibition on `information assisting in the placing of a bet or wager' so long as that information is `used only to conduct common pool parimutuel pooling.' Does this mean that a racetrack or other parimutuel facility may accept wagers on races run at another facility (known as the Host Track), whether the Host Track is located within the same state or in another state or foreign country, and commingle its parimutuel pools into the parimutuel pools at the Host Track?

Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Kyl, the phrase `approved by the foreign jurisdiction in which the facility is located' is used throughout subsection (8)(C). In some foreign countries, the law may simply permit simulcasting and commingling of pari-mutuel pools without requiring formal approval by a regulatory authority. I presume that in such cases, S. 474's approval requirement will be satisfied.

Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Kyl, I would like to discuss the impact of S. 474 on account wagering. It is presently legal, and operating to varying degrees, in eight states. Other states are presently considering this form of wagering on racing. The horse racing industry wants to be able to continue account wagering and other similar activities that utilize emerging technologies. A variety of federal and state statutes and regulations now govern this activity and together, they form a capable regulatory system for parimutuel wagering. Again, any restriction on the current regulatory structure might unduly hamper one of racing's most promising areas for growth.

Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Kyl, again, I appreciate your willingness to consider the parimutuel industry. Now, if I may clarify a few more points. 
Section 3 of the bill broadly prohibits both individuals and persons engaged in a gambling business from placing, receiving, or otherwise making a bet or wager through the Internet or any other interactive computer service. Then, subsection (e) of that section grants two exceptions related to racing: one is an exception for wagers placed by persons physically present at a racetrack or parimutuel facility; a second exception is provided for persons placing, making, or receiving a parimutuel wager on a `closed-loop subscriber-based service that is wholly intrastate.' 
My first question is this. Am I correct in my analysis that S.474 does not prohibit or restrict account wagering by telephone?

In section 3, Section 1085(e)(2) of the bill, you prohibit the use of an agent or proxy to place wagers unless the agent or proxy is acting on behalf of a licensed parimutuel facility `in the operation of the account wagering system owned or operated by the parimutuel facility.' What if a facility licensed to operate an account wagering system engages a separate company to provide the technical expertise necessary to implement an interactive account wagering system on its behalf. Would such an agency fall within the scope of the permitted agency provisions of the bill referenced above?

Mr. McCONNELL. Finally, Senator Kyl, section 4 of the bill spells out in great detail the civil remedies available to U.S. Attorneys and State Attorneys General to enforce the provisions of S. 474. Section 5 likewise calls for the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General of the United States and the Secretary of Commerce, to commence negotiations with foreign countries in order to conclude international agreements that would enable the United States to enforce the bill. 
Nonetheless, many are concerned that this legislation will be difficult to enforce. If the only entities that obey it are the legitimate, state-licensed parimutuel operators, which they will, while others outside the jurisdictions of the federal and state authorities do not, then you still have the potential for consumer fraud while not producing any revenues for the federal government, state governments or the racing industry itself.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (CALEA) was intended to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to conduct court-approved wiretaps on new digital networks. Implementation of this important legislation is currently two-and-one-half years behind schedule because industry and law enforcement have not been able to reach agreement on technical standards required under CALEA. In March of this year, the Department of Justice, the FBI, industry, and privacy groups all agreed that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should resolve the technical capability standards dispute as envisioned under CALEA. The latest information I have from the FCC is that the Commission does not expect to issue a final electronic surveillance capability standard until late this year. 
Does the Senator from New Hampshire agree that the FCC should make this decision?

Mr. McCONNELL. After the statutory compliance date--October 25, 1998--telecommunications carriers could be subject to fines of up to $10,000 per day for failure to deploy equipment to meet CALEA compliance standards that currently do not exist and will not exist until the FCC sets the standard. According to industry sources, telecommunications equipment manufacturers will need approximately two years after the FCC sets a final standard to develop technology to meet the new standard. 
CALEA authorized the Attorney General to reimburse the industry up to $500 million for the costs directly associated with modifying equipment that was installed or deployed before January 1, 1995 (the statutory `grandfather date'). Since January 1, 1995, a significant portion of all wireline switches, a majority of cellular switches, and virtually all personal communications services devices have been installed. 
Mr. President, I am concerned that if the FCC sets a new CALEA technical capability standard and there is no change to the January 1, 1995 statutory grandfather date, industry may be required to retrofit that equipment at their own expense at a cost that could exceed hundreds of millions of dollars. 
I do not think that the American people want to pay what could be considered an electronic surveillance tax running into the hundreds of millions of dollars. I know that the people in my state of Kentucky do not. I recognize that this is a complicated controversial issue, but I believe that Congress must act this year to adjust both the statutory compliance and grandfather dates contained in CALEA to allow the statute to work and avoid the prospect of an electronic surveillance tax on consumers. 
I would like to work with the Chairman and the distinguished Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, Mr. Hollings of South Carolina, to see if together, we can find a way to address this problem this year.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the amendment I have sent to the desk simply says that the courts should tell us once and for all whether the DBE Program in the new ISTEA law is constitutional. 
The new ISTEA law, now referred to as the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, or TEA 21 for short, contains the much debated and long discussed DBE Program. 
As every Senator knows, and as the Supreme Court has made clear, this Government-mandated program requires States and private contractors to treat persons differently based on race. The DBE Program, at a minimum, grants benefits and presumptions to some persons based on race and ethnicity but denies the same benefits and presumptions to others based on race and ethnicity. 
Now, some say that the preferences are vast and pervasive, while others say preferences are only slight and incremental. Some say that preferences are unfair. Others say that any burdens placed on persons of the wrong race are far outweighed by the benefits for the citizens of the `officially preferred' race. 
Mr. President, my views on this issue are well known and well documented in the Congressional Record. But the policy debate over TEA 21 and the DBE Program is over for now. We have moved beyond that policy debate for the moment. The only thing that the Senate can do today is to ensure the constitutionality of the DBE Program mandated in TEA 21. That is precisely what my amendment does. 
Mr. President, when the topic is racial preferences, it is rare that both parties can find any agreement. But I think today is that rare moment. I think there are several areas of agreement today that should lead to unanimous approval of my amendment. 
First, I think we all agree that the Supreme Court has acknowledged that racial preference programs subject persons to unequal treatment under the law. 
In landmark Supreme Court cases, like Adarand v. Pena, and City of Richmond v. Croson, the Court made it clear that programs doling out different presumptions, benefits, and burdens based on race, in fact, subject Americans to unequal treatment under the law. 
In the words of the Supreme Court: 
Whenever the government treats any person unequally because of his or her race, that person has suffered an injury that falls squarely within the language and the spirit of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection. 
Moreover, the Court explained: 
We deal here with a classification based upon the race of the participants, which must be viewed in light of the historical fact that the central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to eliminate racial discrimination emanating from official sources in the States. This strong policy renders racial classifications `constitutionally suspect,' and subject to the `most rigid scrutiny,' and `in most circumstances irrelevant' to any constitutionally acceptable legislative purpose. 
So, Mr. President, out of the mouth of the highest court in the land we hear our first undisputed fact: Programs like the DBE Program subject Americans to unequal treatment under the law. 
Our second undisputed fact is that the Supreme Court will only tolerate such unequal treatment if the program can survive the test of strict scrutiny. That is, is the program, first, narrowly tailored; second, to remedy past discrimination? 
Let me again quote the Supreme Court in Adarand. The Court said:  
We hold today that all racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor, must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny. 
This leads me to the third undisputed fact: Strict scrutiny is an extremely high constitutional hurdle. The administration has conceded the height and depth of the constitutional challenge following Adarand. It has spent a considerable amount of resources over the last 3 years trying to respond to Adarand. 
Let me count the ways. First, the administration was forced to launch a governmentwide review of all racial preference programs; second, the President even promised to `mend' those programs that were broken; third, the Justice Department and the Commerce Department joined forces to embark upon an unprecedented national benchmark survey to help figure out whether various racial preference programs could survive the strict scrutiny test after the Adarand case; and finally, several media reports have indicated that the President has been forced to make good on the part of his promise, and that he has attempted to end or curtail several programs. 
Mr. President, I think it is clear to all of us that strict scrutiny is an extremely high constitutional hurdle. Let me quote our colleague, Senator Byrd, on this point. My typically astute and always distinguished colleague from West Virginia explained in the Congressional Record that the Supreme Court's decision in Adarand `makes it exceedingly difficult for any affirmative action program to pass constitutional muster.' And as the Senate's unofficial historian, Senator Byrd dutifully noted that `the last time the Supreme Court upheld a statute based on a racial or national origin classification under the strict scrutiny test was in 1944.' 
Undisputed fact No. 4: Upon remand, the district court in Adarand followed the Supreme Court's lead and found that the DBE Program could not meet the test of strict scrutiny. Let me read the relevant portion of the district court's opinion and order: 
It is ordered that section 1003(b) of ISTEA, [that is, the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program] and . . . the regulations promulgated thereunder . . . are unconstitutional. 
In fact, the district court, like many of us in the Senate, expressly questioned whether any race-based statute could be upheld as constitutional. 
The Federal judge concluded, `I find it difficult to envision a race-based classification that is narrowly tailored.' 
The district court's ruling was not exactly a surprise to many of the Nation's constitutional scholars. As the Congressional Research Service has explained, the district court's decision in Adarand `largely conforms to a pattern of Federal rulings which have invalidated State and local government programs to promote minority contracting in the following places: Richmond, San Francisco, San Diego, Dade County, Florida, Atlanta, New Orleans, Columbus, [the State of] Louisiana, and [the State of] Michigan, among others. . . .' 
So let me repeat undisputed fact No. 4. The DBE Program was declared unconstitutional by the Federal court in Colorado. 
Undisputed fact No. 5: The attempt to respond to Adarand did not involve any statutory reform whatsoever. The administration's reform of the law came in the form of a maze of complex and lengthy new regulations to try to fix the ISTEA program. 
Undisputed fact No. 6: Members of both parties expressed concern about the constitutionality of the program, and many of those who voted to support it relied upon the administration's promises and proposed regulations. I am sure that my colleagues will remember that in March of this year, 1998, a divided Senate spent several hours over the course of 2 days debating whether a `mended' transportation program that continues to treat persons differently based on race would now be upheld as constitutional. Ultimately, 58 Senators took the administration at its word and reauthorized the program, but with a very watchful eye. 
I think that my good friend from New Mexico summed up the feeling of those Senators who supported the new DBE Program, but had the following admonition. Senator Domenici said: 
I say to the administration very clearly right now: You have now put the signature of the Attorney General of the United States and the Secretary of [Transportation] on the answer to . . . seven questions [about the constitutionality of this program]. And this Senator [Senator Domenici, referring to himself] and I think a number of other Senators, is going to be voting to keep the provisions in the bill based on these kinds of assurances. . . . If, in fact, it comes out in a few months that the regulations are not being interpreted in a way suggested here, then I assure you that we will change them. . . . This better come as a very, very, serious challenge to the administration as they finally implement this program. 
This candor and concern was also expressed by other Members on both sides of the aisle. Let me share an insightful colloquy pointing out the constitutional concerns. This colloquy involved the distinguished Environment and Public Works committee chairman, Senator Chafee; the ranking member, Senator Baucus; the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Senator Warner; and Senators Domenici and Durbin. 
Let me read those statements from the Congressional Record of March 5 of this year. 
Senator Durbin said: 
I believe the DBE program must be implemented in a manner that is constitutional. I believe that it is critical to the integrity of the program, and to the Senate's support of that program. Therefore, I would like to ask the chairman and ranking member--whose committee has oversight of the DBE program--is it their intention to press the Department to ensure that the new regulations pass constitutional muster? 
That was a question being asked by the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin. 
Senator Chafee, the chairman of the committee responding: 
Yes, it is. We have made it clear to the Secretary that while one can never predict with 100 percent certainty what language may pass constitutional muster, the Committee expects the Secretary and his legal staff to do their utmost to make sure that the new regulations closely follow the guidance set forth by the Court in Adarand. 
Senator Baucus, the ranking minority member of the committee says: 
I concur. It is the committee's intention that this program be carried out in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution. We expect no less. Secretary Slater is aware of, and I am assured agrees with, our views on this matter. 
Senator Warner. As chair of the subcommittee that sponsored this bill, I have a particular interest in this matter and want to assure the Senator that adherence to Adarand is our intent. 
Senator Domenici. I appreciate the Senator's confirmation on this point. Let me ask further: Will the committee continue to be in touch with Department officials as the regulations are ready for release? And will the committee scrutinize the new regulations to ensure that the Department did in fact follow the Court's guidance under Adarand? 
Senator Chafee. Yes, we will. 
Senator Baucus. I can assure the Senator, and the Senate, that we will indeed. 
Senator Warner. We certainly intend to. 
Senator Domenici. I am pleased to hear it, and I want to thank the Senators for taking the time to respond to my concerns. 
Mr. President, I could stand here on the floor and read statement after statement made by Members of both parties during the ISTEA debate in March of this year that spell out the Senate's serious constitutional concerns about the DBE Program. But I think it is abundantly clear that every Member of the Senate understands the constitutional guarantees and obstacles that stand in the way of a Federal highway program that treats Americans differently based on the immutable trait of race. 
Let me say that I wholeheartedly agree with and appreciate the constitutional concerns set forth by Senators Chafee, Baucus, Warner, Durbin, and Domenici. We must ensure that the new DBE Program is constitutional. 
My amendment is perfectly consistent with these constitutional concerns, and I hope all Senators will fully support my amendment. 
Undisputed fact No. 7: The proposed regulations were not final prior to our vote back in March on the DBE Program. In fact, the proposed regulations are still not final, even though the Congressional Record is filled with statements promising that the new DBE regs would be final in April or May of this year. 
Well, Mr. President, we are now headed into August, and it is my understanding that the States and contractors still have no guidance from DOT on how to run this multibillion-dollar DBE Program in compliance with the Constitution, with Adarand, with the Supreme Court and the law of the land. 
So as the statements that I read earlier from Senators Chafee, Baucus, and others made clear, we do not know for sure whether the regulations make the DBE Program more constitutional or less constitutional. We do not know for sure whether the proposed regulations will help or hurt, whether the regs alter the statute to allow the program to pass the stringent test of strict scrutiny, or whether the Federal courts will follow the district court in Adarand and continue to strike down the program as unconstitutional. 
Mr. President, undisputed fact No. 8: The Senate should take its oath to uphold the Constitution seriously. Mr. President, let me say that all of us, when we come into the Senate, solemnly swear that we will support and defend the Constitution of the United States. I think we can all agree that this is a constitutional oath that should be taken seriously. In fact, for a good portion of our history, the Congress mandated an expedited Supreme Court review of any and all constitutional questions. 
In more recent years, the Congress has focused the expedited review approach on those important laws that are surrounded by legitimate questions of constitutional validity. A quick search by the Congressional Research Service has documented several recent laws and bills that have included expedited Supreme Court review provisions. I think my colleagues will remember each of these. Let me name just a few: the Line-Item Veto Act; the Communications Decency Act; the census sampling in last year's Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill; the District of Columbia Schools Opportunity Scholarships Act; and the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act. All of those rather well-known measures had an expedited review provision. These are only a few of the bills that have included expedited review provisions. These were generally supported and passed in both Houses of Congress for the simple reason that there were legitimate questions of constitutionality surrounding key provisions of the bills. 
Mr. President, this leads me to undisputed fact No. 9: I think we can all agree that, at a minimum, there are legitimate questions of constitutional validity regarding the DBE Program. Both the Senate and the House acknowledged these questions when we had extended debate and a divided vote back in March on whether the program was constitutional. 
Moreover, the TEA 21 law is direct evidence that both the Senate and the House feel that there are legitimate constitutional questions surrounding the DBE Program. Specifically, TEA 21 contains a provision that prohibits the Department of Transportation from cutting off Federal transportation funds whenever a State discontinues its federally mandated DBE Program in compliance with a court order striking down the program as unconstitutional. So, Mr. President, the very law we passed makes it perfectly clear that there are valid questions of constitutionality about the DBE Program. 
The courts have also made it clear that the DBE Program raises genuine questions of constitutionality. Case law is replete with courts striking down programs that mandate different rules and different treatment for citizens of different races. The Congressional Research Service, as I noted earlier, has found that the recent Adarand decision by the district court conforms to a pattern of Federal rulings striking down racial preference programs across the country. I have here a long list of cases in the last few years where courts have declared programs like the DBE Program to be unconstitutional. This list shows court decisions by the Supreme Court, D.C. circuit, the third circuit, the fourth circuit, the fifth circuit, the sixth circuit, the seventh circuit, the ninth circuit, the eleventh circuit--all striking down race-based programs. The list also shows other unambiguous rulings of lower courts in Georgia, Connecticut, Ohio, Louisiana, Michigan, Colorado, and the city of Houston--again, all striking down race-based programs.

Mr. McCONNELL. Finally, Mr. President, undisputed fact No. 10: If we are willing to grant expedited review to ensure the constitutionality of everything from census sampling to vouchers to vetoes to balanced budget laws to Internet restrictions, then surely we would all agree that Americans deserve to know whether an important law involving race, civil rights, the 5th and 14th amendments, is constitutional. 
We all know that there are many more cases striking down racial preference programs than there are cases striking down vouchers, or line-item vetoes, or balanced budget laws, or Internet restrictions. In fact, I will bet that you could combine and add up all of the cases striking down vouchers, line-item vetoes, balanced budget laws, and Internet restrictions, and that amount still would be less than the number of court cases striking down racial preference programs. Surely, if we have given expedited review to all of those other issues, then we are going to give expedited review to the critical issue of civil rights and the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws. 
Mr. President, I have spelled out 10 undisputed facts which serve as the common ground for the amendment I have offered. I think these facts are more than reason enough to immediately pass this expedited review amendment. 
Let me simply close by pointing out that the time for debating the constitutionality of the DBE Program has passed. Now the courts must decide. My proposed amendment simply just says that the Supreme Court should tell us once and for all whether a transportation program that treats contractors and subcontractors differently based on race can survive strict scrutiny. 
We must ensure the constitutionality of the DBE Program. We owe it to the States and localities that are receiving the billions of dollars in TEA 21 funds. 
We owe it to the contractors who are threatened with the loss of jobs and contracts if they do not comply with the constitutionally suspect mandate of TEA 21. 
We owe it to the minority-owned businesses who are forced to hang in the balance and twist in the constitutional winds wondering if the current program will survive a court challenge. 
And, finally, we owe it to every American who sent us to the U.S. Senate to faithfully uphold the Constitution. 
Mr. President, that is all this amendment would do. Regardless of how Senators may have voted on this measure back in March, this would quite simply just provide expedited Supreme Court review in this field. This is something we have frequently done, as I indicated in my prepared remarks. 
I hope that this amendment will be cleared and accepted on both sides of the aisle. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is not a complicated amendment. We had the debate back in March on the DBE Program and the Senate spoke. The Senate decided that it wanted to accept on faith that the administration would issue regulations that complied with the Adarand decision and the subsequent district court decision ruling the DBE Program to be unconstitutional. All the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky does is provide for an expedited review of those regs once they are promulgated and litigated as they will certainly be litigated. 
It is not unusual on matters of extraordinary and constitutional significance for the Congress to say, `We would like to get an expedited review, an answer to the issue.' So that is all this amendment is about. It does not deal with the merits of the debate at all. The Senator from Kentucky did not support the program and did think the Senate ought to follow the Adarand case, but the Senator from Kentucky lost that debate, cheerfully, I might say, and all we are asking for here in this proposal is to get an expedited Supreme Court review of the new regs after they are promulgated. 
I, frankly, thought this amendment would be accepted and am somewhat surprised that we are having a debate about it. But that is all this amendment does. Regardless of how Senators may have voted on the DBE Program back in March, this is not about that. All this amendment does is obtain an expedited decision by the Supreme Court once some regulations are, at long last, promulgated. 
I see my friend from Alabama in the Chamber. Let me just mention a few other bills in which we did this. This is not unusual. We did it with the line-item veto, which the Supreme Court recently struck down. We had such a provision in the Communications Decency Act. We had it in the census sampling measure in last year's Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. We had a similar provision in the D.C. Schools Opportunity Scholarships Act and the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act. 
Mr. President, this is not in any way extraordinary or unusual to hope that the Supreme Court might give us some expedited guidance is a matter of great importance. 
Mr. President, I see the Senator from Alabama in the Chamber. I am happy to yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Kentucky Farm Bureau and the hundreds of farmers that I met with on my recent farm belt tour convinced me that one of the most pressing issues facing Kentucky farmers is the problem of finding legal, migrant farm workers. 
Kentucky farmers depend heavily on migrant agricultural workers that come to Kentucky under H-2A visas to help harvest tobacco and other crops. Kentucky depends on the H-2A visa program more than every other state, except North Carolina and Virginia. 
The current H-2A process is slow, tedious and complex. It subjects farmers to unreasonable costs, excessive bureaucracy, and mountains of paperwork. 
To add to the injustice, farmers are faced with frivolous lawsuits and IRS raids--often at the peak time of the harvest. 
The Agriculture Job Opportunity Benefits and Security Act would lift the unfair burdens placed on farmers by reforming the H-2A visa program and reducing: the mountains of paperwork, the excessive bureaucracy, and the unfair threats of frivolous litigation. 
In order to get migrant workers, a Kentucky farmer has to find his way through the Kentucky Department of Labor, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service--paying fees and filling out cumbersome, confusing paperwork all along the way. 
Most farmers will tell you that it's easier to wade through the tax code and file a 1040 tax form every year than it is to slog through multiple government agencies and mountains of paperwork just to hire a migrant farm worker to help bale hay. 
In fact, the Department of Labor needs a 325-page handbook to help farmers find their way to migrant farm workers. The Government Accounting Office managed to get through this handbook and found it to be outdated, incomplete and very confusing. 
You shouldn't have to hire a lawyer just to hire a migrant farmer. 
I'd like to take a couple of minutes to walk through some of the common problems faced by farmers and the common sense solutions offered by the bill we are introducing today. 
Problem: Farmers are hesitant to use the process because it is too slow and complicated. 
Solution: A simplified, streamlined H-2A visa program would encourage more farmers to go through the system to hire legal migrant farm workers. 
Problem: Farmers must pay multiple fees, go through multiple agencies, and fill-out multiple documents. 
Solution: A Department of Labor computer registry would be established to replace the current cumbersome and bureaucratic process. Farmers would submit a simple form asking for a certain number of workers at a specified time. If there is an insufficient number of domestic workers available, then the DOL would contact the INS to initiate an expedited visa approval process for migrant farm workers. (All program costs would be paid for by employer user fees.) 
Problem: Farmers must apply for workers 60 days in advance--even though they may not know exactly how many workers they will need or exactly when they will need them. 
Solution: Farmers do not have to begin process two months in advance. They may apply any time prior to actually hiring foreign workers. The total process from initial application to actual hiring should take no more than 21 days. 
Problem: DOL slows the process by failing to timely process applications. A GAO study found that DOL missed statutory deadlines in at least 40 percent of the cases. 
Solution: Farmers do not have to wait for DOL. If the DOL does not either meet the deadline or issue a specific objection, then the INS is authorized to go ahead and issue visas for migrant workers. 
Problem: Farmers have to spend hundreds of dollars advertising in the newspaper or on the radio to prove what they already know--that is, there is a shortage of domestic workers who will labor in the fields. 
Solution: Farmers will not be required to engage in costly radio and newspaper advertising, but may recruit domestic workers by simply using the existing DOL job bank for available domestic workers. DOL will match domestic workers with jobs. 
Problem: Farmers are required to pay wages that are often higher than both the minimum wage and the prevailing wage because the legal wage is calculated based on wages paid for all farming jobs, not the specific job in which the migrant worker employed. 
Solution: Farmers would not have to pay exorbitant wages to migrant farm workers. They would be required to pay wages only up to the prevailing wage for the type of occupation in which the grower is actually employed. The wage would not be based on the wages earned by all persons in all farming jobs. 
Problem: Farmers are faced with the threat of frivolous litigation for failing to meet vague and open-ended statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Solution: The threat of litigation would be reduced by removing unfair burdens on farmers and by clearly spelling out statutory requirements. 
Finally, let me respond to the critics of this compromise bill. 
Critics wrongly claim the new alternative program has no labor protections. 
The alternative program provides foreign and domestic workers with all the labor protections of federal and state labor laws. In addition, it imposes special obligations on participating employers such as payment of at least the prevailing wage. 
The pilot program is modeled after the existing H-lB program for specialty and high-tech occupations. It requires employers to recruit domestic workers, and assures that domestic workers receive first preference for jobs. 
Finally, the new program provides strict penalties for employers who fail to meet labor standards, including fines, back wages, and debarment from future program participation. 
I wanted to commend the bipartisan group of Senators, led by Gordon Smith, who have worked together to craft a comprehensive and meaningful solution for our nation's farmers. 
I was proud to be a cosponsor of Senator Smith's original bill, S. 1563, and am equally pleased to be a part of this compromise bill. 
I look forward to working with the American Farm Bureau and the Kentucky Farm Bureau to move this bill in the Senate as soon as possible.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this bill will ensure that the Department of Energy is not stuck with a massive unfunded mandate as a result of the privatization of the United States Enrichment Corporation. This bill will ensure that both the workers at Paducah, Kentucky and Portsmouth, Ohio as well as the environment are made a top priority. 
Last month the Administration, the Department of Energy and the USEC Board came to a decision on privatization of the United States Enrichment Corporation. The deal, however, put USEC first and taxpayers, workers and the environment last. 
As proposed, the USEC privatization will have a devastating effect on jobs. The Administration has stated that 600 jobs will be lost in the first two years and admits that there is a real possibility that additional job losses would occur in the following years. Something must be done to alleviate the economic impact of this legislation, and I am hopeful that a serious clean up effort will mitigate some of the job losses. 
Unless we prevent this transfer of funds from USEC to the General Treasury, taxpayers will be stuck with a massive unfunded environmental liability if this funding doesn't remain dedicated to clean up. Considering the Department of Energy's track record on cleaning up its own depleted uranium tails that have been stockpiled for the past forty years, it would be a big mistake if we allowed USEC to add an additional 9,000 canisters to the tens of thousands of canisters in the Department's inventory without the funds already earmarked and allocated to cleaning up this environmental nightmare. 
I am willing to accept the amendment by Senator Ford in order to secure the nearly $400 million. Senator Ford's amendment adds language to ensure that this clean up effort remains consistent with National environmental Policy Act and adds a brief Sense of the Senate that Congress should fully fund the President's request. 
I want to be absolutely clear, this amendment simply restates current law. This bill like any other, is subject to NEPA standards. However, it must not be an excuse for the Administration to slow down the implementation of a clean up plan. 
Mr. President, I welcome the support of Senator Ford for this legislation and I look forward to passing it in a timely fashion so the Administration does not privatize USEC until we can ensure that workers and the environment in Western Kentucky and Southeast Ohio are made a top priority.

Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, as a follow-on to my good friend from Arizona, let me say first I am a farm State Senator. I have been on the Agriculture Committee for 14 years. I am a supporter of GATT, NAFTA, fast track, and replenishment of the IMF, which we handle in our subcommittee of appropriations for foreign ops. So put me down as a free trader. Also, put me down as a principal sponsor of the amendment last week to lift the agricultural sanctions on India and Pakistan. We did sort of a partial job on that last week, and then, as the Senator from Arizona pointed out, sort of finished the job today. 
Also, put me down as a great admirer of the chairman of the Agriculture Committee and his distinguished work over the years in foreign policy, and on trade matters as well. 
The majority leader asked me to chair the task force on sanctions. The Democratic leader asked Senator Biden to do that. As the Senator from Arizona just pointed out, we have had an opportunity to only have one meeting. It was yesterday. 
I say to my good friend from Indiana, by September I might well be supporting this bill. But I am, frankly, among those in the Senate--and I expect this is almost everyone in this body--who has not been exactly consistent on the subject of sanctions over the years. Having supported MFN to China, I have also advocated certain kinds of sanctions against Burma. My guess is that there is hardly anybody in this room who has been entirely consistent on this subject. 
What the distinguished Senator from Indiana tried to do here is to enact a broad piece of legislation that may well be justified. But let me say I am just not yet comfortable in taking that step. Maybe by September I will be comforted that this is what we ought to do. But I want to echo the observations of the distinguished Senator from Arizona that I am just not sure we are ready, as a body, to wipe the slate clean. 
Reading from Senator Lugar's bill, unless I am missing something here, it says, `Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the President may not implement any new unilateral economic sanction under any provision of law with respect to a foreign country, or foreign entity, unless at least 45 days in advance of such implementation the President publishes notice in the Federal Register of his intent to implement such sanctions.' 
It is my understanding that just today the President announced sanctions and trade restrictions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act against certain Russian countries. I am concerned, for example, whether under this bill the President could have taken that step. Maybe he should not have. Maybe that is the point of the bill. 
But let me just say, Madam President, that I am queasy about taking such a broad, comprehensive step, even though it is only prospective, before we have even had a chance to work our way through it. I confess that many of us have not spent the amount of time the Senator from Indiana has already spent on it. He is undoubtedly one of the experts in the Senate on this subject. 
But, since all of us are called upon to vote, let me appeal to those in the Senate who may not yet have the level of expertise on the sanctions issue that the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture Committee has, and ask the question, Are we ready to enact on this appropriations bill a broad, sweeping sanctions policy at this time? 
Let me repeat. The Senator from Indiana may be entirely correct that this is the way to go. But I will suggest to the Senate that we give this a little more time and think it through a little further. I am not sure the work of the task force, on which many of us serve, including the Senator from Indiana and the Senator from Arizona, is going to shed a whole lot of light on this. But we are going to try. We are going to try to shed some light on it by having a hearing on July 30. We are going to try very hard to meet the majority leader's deadline of having at least a report by September 1. That may or may not enlighten a whole lot of Members of the Senate. 
But for those of us who have not spent as much time on this as the distinguished Senator from Indiana maybe, that report will be helpful to us. Maybe we will get a chance, as the Senator from Arizona pointed out, to kind of start out with what a sanction is. I am not even sure I know, frankly, at this point exactly what is and what isn't a sanction. Is a restriction in a foreign aid bill a sanction? Do we make a distinction between transfers of military significance? I think most Senators would argue that you should make that kind of distinction on things like agricultural products, food and medicine, and the like. 
So I commend the Senator from Indiana for a very important piece of legislation and just suggest that maybe this isn't the best time for most of us to be going forward on this, and I hope we can shed some light through the task force over the next few weeks on this whole subject. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a must-pass piece of legislation to ensure that the Department of Energy is not stuck with a massive unfunded mandate as a result of privatizing the United States Enrichment Corporation. I am pleased to be joined by Senator DeWine who is an original cosponsor of this legislation. 
Last month, the administration, the Department of Energy, and the USEC Board came to a decision on how they intend to privatize the USEC. This deal, which was struck in secret, is a complicated and confusing matter that I am only just beginning to understand. The facts, I have discovered, are not welcome news to the communities of Paducah, Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio, where the two USEC gaseous diffusion plants are located. These facilities employ approximately 4,000 people, making them the largest employers in those regions. 
The most discouraging aspect of this privatization proposal is the impact this deal will have on jobs. The administration has tried to put a positive spin on things by claiming that only 600 jobs would be lost over the next 2 years. Unfortunately, this may be the tip of the iceberg, because after the first 2 years, the administration has made no guarantees on the number of jobs that might be lost. In fact, after reading the fine print of this agreement, union and community leaders feel that closure of one of the two plants is a very real possibility. This could result in the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs. Without some efforts to mitigate the job losses, these communities will be economically devastated. 
The second item of concern is that the Department of Energy--and taxpayers--will be stuck with an unfunded environmental liability. As you may know, under the terms of the USEC Privatization Act of 1996, the responsibility for the treatment and disposal of the uranium waste will be transferred from USEC to the Department of Energy. To prepare for this reality, USEC has collected nearly $385 million from its customers for the specific purpose of cleaning up their 
environmental liability. Unfortunately, the administration's proposal only provides $50 million of that total to be used to address this problem, while the remaining $335 million is due to be deposited into the General Treasury. 
Mr. President, there are two problems with this scenario. First, I fail to see the logic behind the decision to use only one-eighth of the money which has been collected for the purpose of addressing the nuclear waste at the USEC plants. Second, the administration's plan calls for the $50 million to be given to USEC, Inc: the private corporation. Why should we, as legislators, allow the government to give a $50 million handout to a private corporation to clean up a Federal entity's mess when $385 million is already available for environmental clean up? What is worse, the administration's plan will add to the tens of thousands of canisters of depleted uranium hexafluoride already stored at the plants, further expanding the environmental problems of the plants and the cost to clean up this site for the Department of Energy. 
Mr. President, I am not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, but this deal is not good for Kentucky and is an abrogation of the Federal Government's responsibility to clean up this nuclear mess. We need to ensure that the taxpayers and the workers at these facilities get a better deal than what is being offered. That is why I have introduced this legislation to ensure that all the funds raised and earmarked for the clean up of USEC's environmental legacy will remain available for that purpsoe--and that purpose only. This bill mandates that the administration hold these earmarked funds until the Secretary of Energy submits a plan and legislation to implement and operate a facility to cleanup the nuclear waste at Paducah and Portsmouth. Once this plan is submitted, then the funding can flow to clean up this environmental nightmare. 
This bill will ensure that taxpayers aren't stuck with an unfunded mandate and makes a commitment to the communities that this toxic hazard will be disposed of in a timely manner. Unlike the administration's plan to simply store additional uranium waste, my bill will create many more jobs to construct and operate this facility. The new facility will convert the depleted uranium from an unstable and toxic hexaflouride form to a stable and non-threatening oxide. During this process many useful commercial by-products can also be recovered and sold.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have also cleared this bill with Chairman Murkowski of the Energy Committee and Senator Domenici, who is the chairman of the relevant subcommittee on the Appropriations Committee. Neither Senator has any objection to the immediate passage of this legislation. Finally, I have cleared this proposal with the Congressional Budget Office and they have scored this bill as having zero budget impact. 
Mr. President, we need to ensure that the people, economies and environment of Western Kentucky and Southeastern Ohio are not sacrificed to make a quick buck off the sale of the uranium enrichment facilities, especially when funding is available. I urge my colleagues to approve this legislation and protect taxpayers from paying an additional cost for clean up.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to support S. 1882, the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998. This bill comes at a time when our nation's shifting job market has greatly increased student demand for post-secondary education. However, for many families in Kentucky and across the nation, the rising cost of tuition creates a real barrier to attending college. A majority of college students today rely upon some form of financial assistance in order to meet these escalating costs. For the first time in decades, loans constitute the largest part of student financial-aid packages. As the loan burden increases, students and their families are seeking greater choice in financial resources for higher education. 
Making a college education more affordable has always been a priority of mine, and for the past several years I have introduced legislation to provide tax incentives to families who save for college. In fact, my legislation, which allows tax-free education savings in state-sponsored savings plans for education purposes, was included in the Parent and Student Savings Account Plus Act, which Congress approved earlier this year by a strong margin. The House and Senate approved this essential legislation in response to growing public interest in federal policies that facilitate personal planning and investment in education, and to provide students with greater choices in both academic programming and financial aid resources. However, this measure and similar initiatives have been heavily criticized by the Clinton Administration. 
For example, throughout the HEA reauthorization process, President Clinton has repeatedly tried to limit students' financial options by creating a single-lender system run by the U.S. Department of Education. Banks, credit unions, and other qualified lenders currently use their financial expertise and experience in loan management to provide college loans for students and parents through the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), while the U.S. Department of Education operates the Direct Lending program through participating colleges and universities. The Clinton Administration heralded the consumer benefits that would result from the competition between FFELP and the Direct Lending program during its original authorization in the 1993 Budget. Now, President Clinton has turned away from his original advocacy for greater choice in favor of making the U.S. Department of Education the sole lender for student loans. 
Since its creation, the Direct Lending program's reputation has become synonymous with slow, inefficient service. The Department simply does not have the personnel or experience necessary to efficiently process the high volume of loans demanded by students. For example, in 1996, the processing of 900,000 student aid applications submitted to the Department were delayed by severe management problems. Just last year Congress was forced to pass the Emergency Student Loan Consolidation Act in response to the Department's stoppage in processing applications for direct loan consolidations. If students had been limited to one lending option, the Department's backlog and organizational problems would have denied many students access to the student loans necessary for their enrollment in school. 
Based on the Department's struggle to meet its responsibility to our nation's students, concerned members of the House and Senate have worked diligently to prevent another crisis in student access to college loans. Not all colleges and universities participate in the Direct Lending program, and the interest rate index adjustments supported by the 1993 Budget threaten to eliminate private lenders from the student loan market. Without the aid of private lenders, many students will be left without necessary financial assistance. S. 1882 rejects Clinton's repeated attempts to strangle consumer choice by revising the interest rate index on student loans, and improves the service and accountability standards of guaranty agencies who participate in the FFELP program. 
The guaranty agency model included in this bill directs agencies to utilize the advantages of the Internet and other technological advances in order to increase the speed and efficiency of the student loan process. S. 1882 also increases the financial responsibility guaranty agencies must bear when a student loan goes into default. All lending organizations--public and private--should be held up to high standards of performance and fiscal integrity. By increasing agency accountability, this bill makes sure that students across the country have access to qualified, responsible lending agencies. By streamlining the loan process and weeding out irresponsible lenders, S. 1182 strengthens the ability of reliable agencies to offer low-interest student loans.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Agriculture Export Relief Act. First, I thank the members of the sanctions task force for their critical contributions to this bill. The staff has met several times, and I think the concerns which were raised in each meeting have been incorporated in this legislation. 
Before I describe the bill, I would like to mention a few Members for their unique role in bringing this bill to the floor and energizing all of the interest that has developed around this particular issue. 
Senator Roberts of Kansas deserves special recognition for his leadership in resolving this pressing issue. It was two bills first introduced by Senator Roberts--one dealing with the specific issue of lost markets for U.S. farmers and another more important bill dealing with the broader issue of ensuring that the executive branch has the flexibility it needs to conduct foreign policy in south Asia--that provided the initial impetus for today's action on this important legislation. 
Senator Roberts quickly recognized the need to provide additional flexibility in dealing with the troublesome relationship between India and Pakistan. His legislation to provide that flexibility prompted the majority leader to create the sanctions task force 2 weeks ago. And today, in the task force's action, the U.S. Senate is preparing to act on the legislation originally sponsored by Senator Roberts. 
I am very pleased to associate myself with the work of the Senator from Kansas. While his efforts to protect and defend America's farmers and ranchers are widely appreciated, I am particularly pleased to recognize his strong leadership in the area of U.S. foreign policy and in protecting the national security interests of the American people. 
I also want to take a moment to recognize the work of Senator Conrad Burns, Senator Chuck Hagel, and Senator Lugar. Each have been vocal, effective advocates for their agriculture communities' interests, which I am convinced is why the Senate is acting so quickly today. And, in addition to that, Senator Grams of Minnesota and Senator Allard of Colorado have been particularly active and involved in this issue. 
Let me outline briefly what I think this bill accomplishes, since we operated on a tight deadline and there may be some Members who have not had a chance to review the details. Frankly, it is short and it is simple. 
As many Members know, current law imposes sanctions on nations which transfer nuclear technology or detonate a nuclear weapon. The law exempts from these sanctions intelligence activities and humanitarian assistance. This legislation adds one additional category. We have permanently exempted financing and credits extended by the Department of Agriculture to support the sales of agricultural commodities. We have also clarified that current law exemptions on commercial financing extend not only to agricultural commodities but also to fertilizer. 
The reasoning behind this exemption is simple: Sanctions are supposed to squeeze the targeted country, not the American farmer or producer. Cutting off our sales will not alter or reverse the decision to detonate. Cutting off American export financing will not change any government's judgment or, for that matter, change its behavior about its nuclear program. There is no leverage in curtailing or cutting off our sales; there is only loss of income for our farmers, our ranchers, our 
producers. 
As we discuss this bill, the U.S. agriculture community faces the possibility of not being able to bid on a tender of 350,000 tons of wheat recently proffered by the Pakistani Government. At a time when Asian markets and sales are depressed, this tender is unusually important. Whether the Pakistanis buy U.S. wheat, Canadian wheat, or some other country's wheat isn't going to make a difference on a dinner table in Islamabad--but it sure will in Topeka. We should not sacrifice the American farmer in our effort to put the nuclear genie back in the bottle. 
This bill is a good first step. But I would like to let my colleagues know it is not as far as most of the members of the task force wanted us to go. I think many shared the view that we should exempt from the sanctions law all official export promotion support to all American businesses, especially in view of the enormous pressure many are under because of the Asian meltdown. In the search for substitute markets, it would have made a real difference to allow the Export-Import Bank and OPIC support for a wide range of businesses from aircraft to home computers. However, given Senator Feinstein's and Senator Glenn's objections, we were not able to proceed with export support. 
We also could not proceed with language which would give the President a margin of flexibility to facilitate a reduction of tensions in the region. We did not plan to offer a permanent waiver or suspension of sanctions. We were simply going to give the President authority to waive any restrictions until March 1 if doing so would produce some progress. 
I think many of us are concerned about the possibility of additional tests, the prospect of deployment of nuclear weapons, and the transfer of fissile material to third parties. I am convinced that there was some merit in providing the President a short period of time to waive a restriction on economic assistance if he could produce meaningful results in enhancing our security interests. 
Again, objections on the other side of the aisle have prevented us from offering that option today. We may not have reached as far as most of the members of the task force wanted, but we have taken a first, constructive step in defining when sanctions are and when sanctions are not in American interests and changing the law to better reflect those interests. This bill will advance and protect American economic security interests. 
I have been pleased by the cooperative spirit which has characterized this first round in the task force's efforts and the fact that we had a very tough deadline set by the leadership which we were able to meet a week early. We would not have been able to move so quickly without Senator Biden's active and thoughtful effort. I thank him for that. We have had a lot of explaining to do, and my colleague has taken on that challenge with expertise and enthusiasm. 
Mr. President, I do not see Senator Biden here yet. There are a variety of Senators on this side of the aisle who have been heavily involved in this, many of whom I see on the floor today. Senator Craig has been very, very active and concerned about this issue, and I believe he was first on the floor. I would be happy to yield to Senator Craig 5 minutes. 
Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before we close for the vote on this India-Pakistan bill, let me re-examine our mandate from the leadership. 
Senator Biden and I and the task force have been asked to focus on the following issues: What constitutes a sanction? Is it a sanction when we withhold or condition U.S. foreign assistance? Is it a sanction when we ban investment? Obviously, it is a sanction to ban commercial activity or investment, but there are other issues of aid conditions that are clearly foggy. What sanctions are in place? What flexibility has been offered? And how are these current sanctions being implemented? Implementation, even after we enact a sanction, has been somewhat haphazard. 
Mr. President, as the task force moves forward, let me suggest that we are very likely to have a hearing before the August recess to give people out in the country who are affected by what we decide an opportunity to have their say. We know the business community, for example, seems to be comfortable with the 301 process, because they know what to expect and when to expect it. We look forward to hearing from them. There are others out in our country who feel the United States is, after all, the beacon of freedom in the world and we should express ourselves about policies in other countries with which we disagree, and we want to hear from them, Mr. President, as well. 
It is the intention of Senator Biden and myself to meet the September 1 deadline that the leadership has given us. I want to say that we welcome the thoughts and comments of our colleagues both on and off the task force. 
Mr. President, I understand that time has expired.

Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the leader. 
I suppose there is not a single Member of this body, I would say to the majority leader, who has been very consistent on this subject. Sometimes Members have felt that sanctions were inappropriate except in their particular area of interest where they thought sanctions might make sense. I confess to being entirely inconsistent, too, myself, I say to my friend from Mississippi, having supported sanctions in South Africa and opposed them in China and other places. So none of us have a consistent pattern here. 
I think it is very important to try to pull together the best thinking available from Senators on both sides of the aisle to see whether there is some kind of coherent way to go forward in this field. 
So I thank the majority leader for his understanding of the importance to try to pull us together in this complicated area. And I assure him I will do my best to try to give everybody an opportunity to have their say. And we will certainly meet the deadlines. I say to the distinguished majority leader, the deadlines will be met, with or without consensus, I cannot say at this point. But I look forward to working on this assignment. I thank the majority leader for the opportunity.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from Kentucky in support of an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization Bill. I would like to thank the Senator for his support and assistance on this important initiative. In addition, I would like to thank the distinguished managers of the bill for their assistance. 
In 1996, I offered and the Senate accepted an amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations bill which created the Alternative Technology Program. The mission of the program is to study alternative to incineration for destruction of our chemical weapons stockpiles. 
The amendment Senator Ford and I offer today continues this program, and ensures that it will remain independent and fully capable of carrying out its intended mission. 
Typically, when Senators offer amendments they rise to inform the body what their intentions are--what will their proposals do. I would like to take the opposite tack today, and tell the Senate what our amendment will not do. 
The Ford-McConnell amendment is not designed to delay or prevent the destruction of chemical weapons. The Senate ratified, and I supported, the chemical weapons convention which established a deadline by which all weapons must be destroyed. This amendment would not alter that agreement. In fact, the amendment says that alternative technologies must be able to complete the destruction in the same timeframe as incineration. 
The Ford-McConnell amendment is not designed to scuttle the incineration program. Consistent with the legislation Congress passed in 1996, this measure continues the study and implementation of alternative technologies. At sites where incinerators are under construction or operating, that work will continue. 
What, then, does this amendment accomplish? 
First, it ensures that the Program Manager for the Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment (ACWA) continues to operate independently of the incineration program, reporting directly to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology. This is important in order to maintain the integrity of the program and protect the Program Manager's ability to make decisions in an efficient manner. To date, all involved have reported to both Senator Ford and me that ACWA has been successfully run. There has been a tremendous amount of citizen involvement. The result has been consensus not only on the direction the program is headed, but the methods it has employed. 
Equally important, the amendment makes it clear that the Program Manager for ACWA can move toward implementation of technology which meets several clearly defined criteria. These criteria include that the technology selected is at least as safe and cost-effective as incineration. We have included a reporting requirement for both the Under Secretary for Technology and Acquisition as well as the Cost Analysis Improvement Group of the Department of Defense, to report to Congress on the cost and schedule of potential implementation. 
As for the timing of the amendment, it clearly states that no alternative technology may be implemented unless it can be determined that it will lead to the destruction of stockpiles no later than the date by which incineration could do so. This is an important point, Mr. President. Senator Ford and I have no desire to prolong the schedule for destruction of our stockpiles, we merely ask that any alternatives to incineration be held to the same standards as are currently in place. 
Mr. President, why have Senator Ford and I taken the Senate's time with this amendment? Quite simply, I remain disappointed with the Army's incineration program. It is grossly over budget and behind schedule. If it is possible to develop an alternative to incineration which is safe, and can accomplish the goals of our current program, then I believe Congress should support that endeavor. 
Finally, and most importantly, Senator Ford and I rise on behalf of our constituents in central Kentucky. They live every day with the knowledge that thousands of rockets containing lethal nerve agents are stored just minutes from their homes. We owe it to these Kentuckians to exhaust every option in order to eliminate these weapons in the safest manner possible.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to engage my distinguished colleague, the Chairman of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Domenici, in a colloquy on an issue which could have a tremendous impact on the economies of Paducah, Kentucky and Portsmouth, Ohio. 
Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the magnitude of the job cuts that may occur as a result of the imminent privatization of the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC). It is my understanding that upwards of 1,700 jobs might be lost once the Corporation is privatized. Further, I am told that 600 jobs could be lost even if USEC is not privatized and continues to operate as a federal corporation. In an effort to mitigate the loss of jobs at the Paducah and Portsmouth facilities, I have drafted an amendment to ensure that dollars currently earmarked for the cleanup of USEC generated uranium tails, which is an extremely toxic material, remain dedicated to cleaning up the Paducah and Portsmouth plants. 
Mr. President, today USEC has accrued approximately $400 million on its books for the purpose of cleaning up the uranium waste generated by the uranium enrichment process. It is my understanding, however, that this money only remains available until USEC is privatized. At that point, the funds will be transferred to the General Fund of the Treasury. I believe it would be a huge mistake if we allowed these funds to be dumped into the General Fund, while we have a tremendous need for this cleanup, and funds specifically dedicated for this cleanup. Ensuring that these funds will be spent to dispose of USEC's uranium waste at both of the Gaseous Diffusion plants, will also help to mitigate job losses which occur as a result of privatization. 
Although I will not offer my amendment today, I would like to discuss it with Senator Domenici. 
Mr. Chairman, isn't it true that since its inception in 1993, the USEC has created over 9,300 canisters of depleted uranium hexaflouride, with over 6,000 located at Paducah? Also, hasn't USEC carried over $400 million on its balance sheet for the clean up of this waste stream?

Mr. McCONNELL. I would ask the Chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee what will happen to both the cleanup liability and the funds, upon the privatization of USEC. Won't the Department of Energy (DOE) accept full responsibility for the cleanup for this environmental liability, as provided under the 1996 USEC Privatization Act? Also, it is my understanding that the funds would be transferred to the General Fund, and no longer specifically dedicated to funding USEC's environmental cleanup? Is this accurate?

Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, there has been a lot of discussion over the last 4 weeks about teenagers and smoking. I would like to begin my comments at this moment by asking who might have more influence over teenagers and smoking--Joe Camel or Leonardo DiCaprio? If we continue on this bill--and it is my fervent hope that we will not, as I believe it is not in the best interest of the country--or if it should come back, as those on the other side of the aisle are promising that it will, we will not have another tobacco debate that doesn't deal with the real culprit, which is the influence of Hollywood on our children and their encouragement, after watching fashionable movies, to take up this habit in which none of us believe teenagers should engage. 
An overwhelming number of children under the age of 18 regularly view motion pictures and television productions. A lot more of them do that than look at any cigarette advertising. Depiction of the use of tobacco products and illegal narcotics is widespread in motion pictures and in television productions. Such depictions have increased in recent years, as indicated by recent studies that have found, first, that 77 percent of all major motion pictures in 1996 portrayed the use of tobacco. Let me repeat that. Seventy-seven percent of all major motion pictures in 1996 portrayed the use of tobacco. Fifty percent of the top grossing films released between 1990 and 1996 depicted scenes in which the major characters smoked cigarettes; 78 percent of movies, over the last 5 years, include tobacco use, with an average of 11 smoking incidents per hour--11 smoking incidents per hour; 75 percent of movies that included tobacco use showed leading and/or supporting actors smoking. 
As Hillary Clinton has explained, every single movie nominated for a 1996 Academy Award in the categories of Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Actress featured tobacco use by a leading character. The Academy Award nominees for Best Picture in 1996 that featured this activity were: `The English Patient,' which was the winner; `Fargo'; `Jerry Maguire'; `Secrets and Lies,' and `Shine.' All of them featured tobacco use by the leading characters. 
These depictions often deceptively portrayed the use of tobacco and illegal drugs as healthy, desirable, and socially acceptable. As one would expect after hearing these facts and figures, teenage use of tobacco products and illegal narcotics is on the rise. 
Mr. President, I am raising the issue of whether teenagers are more influenced by Joe Camel or by Leonardo DiCaprio. I am not going to ask for a show of hands from the pages that are up here in the front of the Chamber. But I think I know the answer. I suspect anybody in America would know the answer. Clearly, the influence on teenage smoking as a result of depiction of smoking and glamorizing of smoking in movies is a very, very serious problem and considerably more significant than advertising. 
The depictions in the movies often deceptively portray the use of tobacco and illegal drugs as healthy, desirable and socially acceptable. 
As one would expect after hearing these facts and figures, teenage use of tobacco products and illegal narcotics is on the rise. 
Let's think for just a minute about some of the classic moments in cinema history where smoking is glamorized. 
Humphrey Bogart in `Casablanca,' James Dean in `Rebel Without a Cause.' 
We have here a blowup of `Rebel Without a Cause.' Here you see James Dean featured with a cigarette in his hands. That was sort of my generation back in the 1950s. 
More recently, Julia Roberts in `My Best Friend's Wedding,' Jane Fonda in `Agnes of God,' or `9 to 5,' Rebecca DeMornay in `Risky Business,' Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta in `Grease,' which we have blown up again. 
Here is Olivia Newton-John featured smoking in `Grease.' 
And who can forget the recent smash hit `Titanic,' which I referred to on the floor earlier in this debate. Leonardo DiCaprio who is currently, I am told, the teen idol of America--I see a few smiles on a few pages' faces down here. I think I probably got that right. 
Leonardo DiCaprio is `Smokin' Teen Idol', and appeared, of course, in `Titanic,' the most watched movie of all time, `Romeo and Juliet,' `Marvin's Room,' `Basketball Diaries,' and `This Boy's Life.' 
We know `Titanic' is the highest grossing movie of all time at $554 million. If we assume that ticket prices, including matinees, average $6, then we can fairly estimate that over 90 million people have seen this blatant glamorization of smoking. And, unfortunately, a disproportionate share of those 90 million people are our children. 
Let's face it. Who is more adored by the girls and idolized by the boys, as I asked earlier--Leonardo DiCaprio or Joe Camel? And in a study sponsored by the American Lung Association, youth watched 50 top box office movies to evaluate smoking. The youth concluded that a significant percentage of the scenes involved tobacco use that was `sexy, exciting, powerful, sports-related, sophisticated and a means of celebration.' 
Mr. President, I think it is time that Hollywood took responsibility. We need to send a message to Hollywood. `Don't hook our kids on tobacco and illegal drugs.' 
Under the first amendment, we cannot and would not seek to deny the right of free speech to anyone. However, as the Senate, we can and should encourage Hollywood to take responsible steps to protect our children. We can make sure that at least the Federal Government does not costar with Hollywood in any movies that glorify or glamorize tobacco. 
Let me repeat, we can at least make sure that the Federal Government itself does not costar with Hollywood in any movies that glorify and glamorize tobacco. 
Now, Mr. President, had this bill continued, or if it continues--I hope that it will not, but if it does--I will be offering an amendment that would do this. The Federal Government currently grants permits to Hollywood for the production of movies and TV shows, and we have seen in recent years more and more movies, at least in part, depicted on Federal property. The Government has granted Federal film privileges to motion pictures such as `Top Gun,' `Biloxi Blues,' `The Hunt for Red October,' `In The Line of Fire,' `Clear and Present Danger,' `True Lies,' `Apollo 11,' `Apollo 13,' `Contact,' `Air Force One,' `Crimson Tide,' and `A Time to Kill.' 
The Government currently makes these decisions based on the nature and the message of the proposed production. In other words, the Federal Government itself makes a decision whether or not to allow the use of Federal property, and it made that decision in each of those films. The Department of Defense decides whether to grant Federal filming privileges based on whether a production `appears to condone or endorse activities . . . that are contrary to U.S. Government policy.' 
Let me repeat. The current Department of Defense standard is as follows. They will grant the filming privilege based on whether a production `appears to condone or endorse activities . . . that are contrary to U.S. Government policy.' 
In other words, `Top Gun' is OK but `GI Jane' is not. So Government agencies are already reviewing scripts and deciding who gets Federal film privileges and who does not. So we ought to make sure our young people and tobacco are not left out of this review process. And the amendment I was going to offer, or would offer if we stay on this subject or come back to it, would simply say that no agency or department of the Federal Government may grant permission for the filming of a movie on Federal property where such movie depicts the use of tobacco or illegal drugs as healthy, desirable, or socially acceptable. 
In other words, what I would do by this amendment, if and when I offer it, is require the Federal Government to make a decision about whether it is appropriate for movies filmed on Federal property to depict smoking. And the language should be that no agency or department may grant permission--in other words, we can't do it--for the filming of a movie on Federal property where such movie depicts the use of tobacco or illegal drugs as healthy, desirable, or socially acceptable. 
Furthermore, the President has, as we all know, a lot of friends in Hollywood. That is fine. He is free to associate with whoever he chooses. He was just out there this week, I am told. So I would call on the President today to issue an Executive order--all of this could be done by Executive order--mandating that agencies comply with the provisions of the amendment I would have offered. In other words, the President can today or tomorrow issue an Executive order stating that no agency or department may grant permission for the filming of a movie on Federal property where such movie depicts the use of tobacco or illegal drugs as healthy, desirable, or socially acceptable. 
Now, finally, Mr. President, had I offered the amendment--and I may well offer it; if we either stay on this bill or come back to it later, I certainly will--the second part of the amendment would be a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. No one is more sensitive to the first amendment than the Senator from Kentucky, so this could only be done as a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. And this sense-of-the-Senate would go something like 
this, Mr. President: A parent should have adequate information about the nature and content of motion pictures and television productions. 
Part 2 of the sense of the Senate would be: The television and motion picture industries have developed rating systems that help provide such information. Point 3: These rating systems currently provide that motion pictures and television productions restricted to mature audiences should receive the designation of `R' and `TV-MA'--that is, TV-mature audience--respectively. 
Such rating systems, Mr. President, however, provide insufficient information about the use of tobacco and illegal narcotics in motion pictures and in television productions. 
The sense-of-the-Senate would be this, were I to offer it:  
It is the sense of the Senate that the television and motion picture industries should designate motion pictures and television productions with the rating of `R' and `TV-MA,' respectively, if such pictures or productions depict the use of tobacco or illegal narcotics as healthy, desirable, or socially acceptable. 
Mr. President, in conclusion, this is not an amendment I am planning to offer at this time but will offer later if we get back to this issue or stay on it. It would do essentially two things: 
No. 1--and this is something the President could do today --is to prevent motion pictures which use Federal property from featuring smoking--and the President could issue an Executive order to do that today--and, secondly, to call on the television and motion picture industry to rate any production that features smoking with an `R' or `TV-MA;' that is, TV-mature audience. 
Mr. President, I thank you for the time and I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have been on the tobacco bill now for four weeks. What is abundantly clear to this Senator is that the best favor we can do for the American people and, in particular, for Kentuckians who are tobacco producers is to defeat this bill. President Clinton and the majority of the Democrats have been pushing this bill for some time, going back to the 1996 campaign. A typical American family today already pays 38.2 percent of its total income in taxes at all levels of government. This tobacco tax bill before us will increase taxes by more than $600 billion, some argue even up to $800 billion over the life of the bill, and 60 percent of that tax will fall on working people who make less than $30,000 a year. 
Let me repeat: 60 percent of the taxes that we are raising will fall on Americans making $30,000 per year. Mr. President, more than anything else, what the tobacco bill is about is tax and spend. 
The original cause is a noble cause around which I guess virtually all of the Senate is unified, and that is the question of confronting the problem of teenagers and smoking. We know, of course, that only 2 percent of smokers are teenagers. We wish they would not engage in this habit, and we ought to do everything we can to deter that behavior. But this bill, this $600 billion or $700 billion or $800 billion bill, this tax increase targeted at people in America making $30,000 or less is about big government and big spending and big taxes. 
A good starting place would be to defeat this bill, which is not in the best interest of the American people and certainly not in the best interest of the people of Kentucky for whom this is a particularly sensitive issue. The biggest beneficiaries of the bill before us, in addition to the Government and literally legions of new agencies, are a number of lawyers who are going to make a substantial amount of money even with the Gorton amendment yesterday. 
So a good starting place in discussing this issue is what ought to be done with the overall bill, and it has been the view of this Senator from Kentucky that the appropriate fate for this bill is defeat, the sooner the better. 
Should the bill not be defeated, it creates a catastrophe for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. We have over 60,000 farm families who derive some or all of their income from the annual growing of a legal crop. 
They are engaged in an honorable activity. They are raising their families, educating their children, obeying the law. And here comes the Federal Government with an effort to destroy this legal industry. And make no mistake about it, this bill is designed to bring the tobacco industry to its knees. And that goal and design is pretty clear, with the amendments that have been passed so far, including providing no immunity from lawsuits whatsoever for the tobacco companies, which, as we all know, was part of the original settlement agreed to last summer--no immunity is going to be provided in this bill for any kind of lawsuit of any sort. 
We doubled the so-called look-back provision--clearly, in this Senator's view, an unconstitutional attempt to make the company responsible for anyone who chooses to use its product. I do not know any reputable lawyer, Mr. President, either in or out of the Senate, who thinks that provision is constitutional. And, of course, there are advertising restrictions in this bill. Nobody that I know thinks those can be imposed by the Government either. 
The industry pulled out of this a long time ago--several months ago--when they saw what form it was taking. So make no mistake about it, Mr. President, this bill before the Senate, in its current form, is designed to destroy the tobacco industry. 
Now, the victims of that are the 60,000 farm families in Kentucky who raise this legal crop every year. And in the wake of this effort to destroy this industry, it has produced a significant debate in our State about what to do. 
Now, if El NinAE6o hits, the Federal Government steps in and helps the victims. In this particular instance, the Federal Government itself is causing the disaster. And it seemed to this Senator appropriate, if the Government were going to create this disaster, then the government ought to provide a lifeline or assistance or help to those victims of this Government-made disaster. 
And after a good deal of thought over many months, Mr. President, I concluded that if the Government were going to try to destroy this industry, the appropriate response was for the Government to provide assistance to the farm families who grow this legal commodity, and to do it as generously as possible over the shortest period of time. 
So it was my conclusion, Mr. President, that the Senator from Indiana--certainly no friend of tobacco, as he himself would readily admit--was prepared to engage in what I thought was a generous act in the context of this impending disaster. 
Where I differ with the Senator from Indiana is, I think the tobacco program has served us well. It has served us very well in Kentucky. It has allowed us to hold on to smaller farms a lot longer than we would otherwise have been able to hold on to them, even though, Mr. President, I must confess, in all candor, there has been consolidation even with the program. 
When I came to the Senate in January of 1985, the average tobacco grower in Kentucky had about an acre--roughly 2,500 pounds, which is about an acre. Today, the average tobacco grower in Kentucky has 4.5 acres. So you can see that even with the program, consolidation is occurring. Without the program, unquestionably, consolidation would occur very rapidly. And the tragedy of the loss of the program is that the income, which has been divided up among an awful lot of medium- and low-income people, would in all likelihood consolidate into large farms. And I do not applaud that. I would rather keep the tobacco program. And we can keep the tobacco program if we can beat this bill. 
So, Mr. President, let me say, the first order for this Senator is to defeat this bill. I have done nothing to promote this bill at any point along the way. I opposed it in 1997, 1998, 2 months ago, last month, a week ago, yesterday, and today. This is a terrible bill for America and a particularly bad bill for Kentucky. 
But if it is to become law, the question you have to ask is, What is the best approach for the victims of this law, the tobacco growers of Kentucky? It is my view, in that context, that the Senator from Indiana has it right, that if the Government is trying to destroy this industry, the best thing the Government can do is to provide a generous transition payment to these growers on the way to the free market--not my first choice, but my choice in the context of the bill that President Clinton and the vast majority of Democrats in this body want to see become law. 
Mr. President, there are two competing proposals. One proposal, sponsored by my colleague from Kentucky, seeks to hold on to the tobacco program for the next 25 years. If it were not for this bill, we would have a chance of holding on to the tobacco program without any legislation, because this bill is what creates the problem, not that instantly tobacco becomes less controversial. But any time this kind of bill is seriously contemplated in Congress, it seems to me the only solution to that is to provide as generous a compensation as possible for our growers over the shortest period of time, because the program is going to end in the context of this kind of Government pile-on designed to destroy the industry.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as you can imagine, this is a much discussed issue in Kentucky. Some people think the LEAF Act is the way to go; some people think the Lugar proposal is the way to go. Interestingly enough, a number of newspapers, having surveyed the landscape and having looked at the issue, have concluded that the Senator from Indiana--not, again, thought of as any friend of tobacco--and the Senator from Kentucky, who has spent most of his career fighting, along with the senior Senator from Kentucky, for tobacco, have it right, that in the context of this kind of bill, the only rational response is to try to provide as much compensation as possible. 
In fact, the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer, the daily paper in Owensboro--one of our major cities and one of our major papers--had an editorial on May 24, the headline of which was, `McConnell may have right idea, Lugar's plan could ultimately benefit tobacco farmers more than Ford's.' 
Now, reasonable people can differ about what is the appropriate thing to do in the face of impending disaster. You can go down with the ship or you can go for the lifeboats. And what the Senator from Indiana is doing here is offering a lifeboat; and, interestingly enough, after you get in the lifeboat, you are still free to row. 
In other words, under the Lugar proposal, when you go on to the free market, it is indeed free; people are still entitled to grow tobacco, a legal product, if they want to. Under the competing proposal, the LEAF proposal, there is a so-called voluntary buyout, but, candidly, it is not very attractive. If you take the voluntary buyout, it takes you 10 years to get your money. In the first year, the $8 presumably would still be worth $8; in the tenth year, the ag economist on the Senate Agriculture Committee, of which I am a member, says it is worth about $5.13. So your money erodes over a 10-year period. 
In addition to that, if you accept the voluntary buyout, you cannot grow tobacco. Even though you are in a free market, the Government tells you, you cannot grow tobacco. And, even more mysterious, under the same LEAF proposal, there is a mandatory buyout for flue-cured tobacco--that kind of tobacco grown in the Carolinas and Virginia--a mandatory buyout. But after it is over, you are free to grow tobacco. 
So I think, clearly, the purpose of the LEAF Act was to discourage any exit from the tobacco business. The buyout is not attractive, and it is designed to sort of hitch you up to a declining market created by a Government pile-on.

Mr. McCONNELL. The Louisville Courier-Journal is conflicted on this issue. David Hawpe, the editor, a twice-a-week columnist, agrees with my senior colleague that the LEAF Act is the way to go, but the editorial page in the same paper, looking at the same issue, comes to the opposite conclusion. 
Just reading in part from the Louisville Courier-journal of May 20: 
[T]he LEAF Act would be in trouble in any event. This, after all, is a Congress that passed the Freedom to Farm Act, which ended price support programs for such noncontroversial crops as wheat, corn and soybeans. Why would lawmakers, especially now, make an exception for tobacco, which is blamed for 400,000 deaths a year? 
Of course, some anti-smoking groups have formed an alliance with tobacco farm organizations who support the Tobacco Program on the grounds that cheaper tobacco would lead to more smoking. But the cost of tobacco is a tiny fraction of a pack of cigarettes, and it will get smaller as Congress piles on new taxes. 
The grim fact is, the tobacco growers have a stake in people continuing to smoke, while the government, with broad public support, is determined to discourage smoking. 
Sooner or later, a way of life in Kentucky [according to the Courier] is going to end, and it is going to be painful. Senator McConnell would get it over quickly. Senator Ford will stretch it out. Neither can save a rural economy based on burley. 
That is from the Louisville Courier-Journal on May 20 of this year. 
There have been numerous letters to the editors of various papers. I will not read them all, but I think one is interesting in particular. It appeared June 11, 1998, in the Courier-Journal, from H.H. Barlow III, Cave City, KY. 
I am a 47-year-old lifelong tobacco farmer in Barren County, the largest tobacco-producing county in tobacco. The media, Senator Wendell Ford and Representative Scotty Baesler [according to this grower] are not telling the whole truth on tobacco. 
That is he--the writer of the letter--not I, I say to my senior colleague from Kentucky. 
Senator Mitch McConnell has taken a bold step to protect the tobacco farmers of Kentucky by proposing an $8-per-pound buyout that would allow farmers to continue to grow tobacco in the free market. For me and my neighbors who are older and have spent our life raising tobacco, McConnell's proposal gives us a retirement plan and compensation for the loss of income. Most important is that under the McConnell plan, tobacco farmers would receive payments over a 3-year period as opposed to 10 years as Ford has proposed. Payments over 3 years would be significant enough to enable farmers to reduce debt and to invest in retirement or to develop other agricultural enterprises on the farm. 
There are seven tobacco states fighting 43 non-tobacco states, and tobacco votes in Congress get closer every year. Ford proposes to establish another government-run program that can be voted out by tobacco opponents at any time, leaving tobacco farmers to bleed a slow death with nothing to show for our quotas. McConnell has risked a lot to be honest about the true future of the tobacco program. You be the judge, but for me and my neighbors, having the buyout money for our quota is like having a bird in hand instead of two in the bush, as Ford and Baesler want. 
Another letter appeared in that same edition of The Courier-Journal. This letter was by Ms. Megan Cobb of Henderson, Kentucky. Here are some of the thoughts offered by Ms. Cobb: 
As a young, non-smoking Kentuckian, I have been reading the information and misinformation surrounding the tobacco price support issues. Being apolitical, I have no interest in the politics of the issue, but I am concerned that our political candidates . . . are using the issue for their own benefit and really have no concern for the issue itself or the people who are affected. 
I will say it takes great courage for our Senator Mitch McConnell to stand up and tell the cold truth. That is, the price support system for most farm products is over for all intents and purposes. And that tobacco, and its production, is going through radical changes not caused by the political process but, rather, by the social process that causes societies to change dramatically. 
It is unfortunate that some of our farmers are looking for a scapegoat rather than solutions. It is unfortunate that our Senate candidates are pandering to the issues rather than boldly charting new courses like McConnell. And to say McConnell's position is anti-farm is not only distortion but irresponsible. 
So these are just a few of the thoughtful Kentuckians in the heart of tobacco country who have surveyed the landscape and agree with me on this difficult issue.

Mr. McCONNELL. Now, Mr. President, let me just, in conclusion, sum up what the point is here. 
What is proposed before the Senate is a bill designed to destroy the tobacco industry. As a matter of fact, one CEO of one of the companies said this bill in this form would put them into bankruptcy. There is no immunity provided for the companies. There is a Draconian look-back provision of certain unconstitutionality, various and assorted advertising restrictions also of dubious constitutionality, and a $1.10 cigarette tax increase over 3 years designed to net for the government some $500 to $800 billion in revenue, depending on whose estimates you listen to. The net effect of all that is a government designed to destroy this industry. 
It is in that context that I believe the appropriate thing for the government to do is to throw a lifeline to the 60,000 hard-working Kentucky tobacco growers who make their living off of this legal crop. 
Now, Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes and frame this issue from a larger perspective and walk through how our farmers found themselves in the current predicament. 
One of President Clinton's signature political maneuvers occurred early in his administration when he and Vice President Gore declared war on tobacco--portraying Kentucky's leading agricultural commodity as a modern-day plague. The anti-tobacco zealots and an army of greedy plaintiffs' lawyers eager to prey on the tobacco industry created the most serious threat ever arrayed against tobacco farmers. Disaster has loomed for Kentucky's tobacco farmers since Clinton took office and is now manifested in the form of this half-trillion dollar McCain bill which sailed out of the Senate Commerce Committee 19-1, with Senator Wendell Ford's support. Thus was the death knell sounded for tobacco. 
With our tobacco farmers now caught in the crossfire of this war, we are being asked to make a monumental decision. That decision is simply this: despite all we know about tobacco's desperately weakened state--

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak, yet again, on the issue of limiting tobacco trial lawyer fees to a reasonable level. 
Unfortunately, the Senate has repeatedly refused to limit the fees to a reasonable wage. And, now we are forced to consider an amendment to allow tobacco trial lawyers to earn as much as $4,000 an hour! 
But--Mr. President--$4000 an hour is better than the alternative and it's about all we have left. We've tried to cap the fees at a reasonable level, and that's been rejected. A cap of $4000 an hour is our last alternative. If we fail to pass the Gorton amendment, then we will be allowing attorneys to make as much as $88,000 an hour! 
Let me remind my colleagues of how we got to $4000 an hour. First, we tried to limit the fees to $250 an hour--nearly 50 times the minimum wage. This attempt was soundly rejected by the Senate. $250 an hour was simply not enough for the trial lawyers. 
So, Senator Faircloth, Senator Sessions and I got together to regroup and try again. We discussed how much is enough for the trial lawyers? $500/hour? $750/hour? 
We debated these amounts--and frankly--it turned our stomachs to think about the federal government approving a bill to give tobacco trial lawyers $500 an hour or $750 an hour. Especially when you consider that the average lawyer in America only earns about $48 an hour and the average doctor only earns about $100 an hour. 
But, we knew that it would be difficult to get the friends of the trial bar to agree to any limit at all. So, we held our noses and introduced a new amendment to cap the lawyer fees at $1000 an hour! Surely, $1000 an hour would be considered a fair wage for the trial bar. 
Mr. President, was $1,000 an hour enough for the friends of the trial bar? No, absolutely not. They needed much more. They wanted to maintain the status quo. They wanted the Senate to keep the National Trial Lawyer Enrichment Bill intact. 
The friends of the trial bar wanted us to continue to allow: lawyers in Minnesota to earn $4,500 an hour; lawyers in Florida to earn $7,000 an hour--assuming of course that these Florida lawyers worked 24 hours a day for three-and-a-half years; lawyers in Mississippi to earn $10,000 an hour; and lawyers in Texas to earn $88,000 an hour. 
So, we tried to cap the fees at $1000 an hour and we lost 50-45. We got closer, but still not enough. 
So Senator Gorton has put together a comprehensive outer-limits amendment that says--$4,000 an hour is better than $88,000 an hour. Surely, we can get 51 Senators to agree to that notion. 
Now, let me take a minute to address two or three issues raised by the proponents of unlimited billionaire fees for trial lawyers. 
Billionaire Lawyer Argument No. 1: `We're just businesspeople, like anybody else': 
First, Senator Daschle argued a few days ago that the Senate should not limit plaintiff's lawyer fees because `[a] lawyer is a legal businessperson.' So, Senator Daschle is effectively arguing that we should no longer see lawyers as lawyers, but rather we should see them as businessmen and venture capitalists--a few good men looking to make a buck. 
With all due respect, I could not disagree more. Lawyers are not supposed to be businessmen and businesswoman out to make up a buck. It is this type of make-a-buck-at-any-cost mentality that drives so much wasteful and frivolous litigation in our society. Too often, litigation is about enriching the lawyer, not compensating the client. 
Mr. President, every first-year law student is taught that he or she is not some businessperson out to make a buck. I remember my days in law school where our professors taught us that we were supposed to be fiduciaries--representing the interests of our client, not our own selfish, profit-making interests. 
In fact, legal ethics prohibit attorneys from charging fees that are not `reasonable.' As Professor Lester Brickman explained in today's Wall Street Journal: `If the standard of reasonableness has any meaning, it is surely violated by fees of tens of thousands of dollars an hour?' 
Moreover, Professor Brickman concluded: 
The public has a compelling interest in preserving legal ethics, including th[e] rule that fees must be reasonable. The higher the fees tort lawyers get, the greater the share they take of injured clients' recoveries. Moreover, the higher the fees, the more tort litigation and the more costs that are imposed on society. The civil justice system, which generates the fees that Mr. Daschle does not want curbed, exists to serve citizens. Lawyers are not businesspeople; they are professionals entrusted with the people's businesses. 
So, Mr. President, every lawyer in America knows that he or she has no constitutional right to charge excessive and unreasonable fees. We must pass the Gorton amendment as our last best hope of ensuring that the fees get somewhere near reasonable and rational. 
Billionaire Lawyer Argument No. 2: `Private Contracts Can Never Be Altered': 
Second, the proponents of unlimited lawyer fees argue that the federal government cannot interfere with private contracts in any way, shape or form. 
This argument is absolutely nonsensical. The tobacco bill is full of provisions that may force tobacco companies to abrogate contracts with retailers and advertisers--among 
others. The Supreme Court has made clear that `Congress may set minimum wages, control prices, or create causes of action that did not previously exist.' 
Furthermore, the Court has made clear that private parties may not preempt governmental action by simply entering a contract. Can you imagine if every time that we passed a new minimum wage law, we exempted all employers who have a previous contract with their employees to pay at a level lower than the new minimum wage? Can you imagine the outcry in the Senate if we exempted private parties from a new minimum wage law whenever those parties had a contract `preempting' Congressional action? 
I also find it curious that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue on the one hand that the right of contract is inviolate and above Congressional action--yet on the other hand, argue that the right of contract may be violated by some unknown arbitration panel. 
So, the friends of plaintiffs bar argue that an unknown arbitration panel may modify contracts, but the United States Senate--the elected representatives of the people--may not modify fee contracts. 
Which one is it? Can we adjust these contracts or can we not adjust contracts? Mr. President, we can't have it both ways. We can't say out of one side of our mouths that the fees and contracts can be adjusted by an arbitration panel, and then say out of the other side of our mouth that the fees and contracts are a done deal and may not be adjusted by Congressional action. 
The bill as currently written says that all types of contracts can be adjusted by this sweeping federal regulatory bill. In particular, the bill says that lawyer fee contracts can be adjusted by an arbitration panel. 
So, frankly, I am tired of hearing that contracts cannot be adjusted and that fees cannot be made reasonable. If we are giving the arbitration panel the ability to adjust contracts and fees, then it is perfectly consistent to establish a fee ceiling and a frame of reference for adjusting these contracts and fees. 
Billionaire Lawyer Argument No. 3: `$4,000 Is Too Generous': 
I was amazed this morning to hear those who carry the water for the trial bar arguing that $4,000/hour is too much money for their friends to earn. Yes, Mr. President, you heard me right. Some of the friends of the trial bar are now arguing that $4,000 an hour is too much money for the trial bar. 
So, let me get this straight. $250 an hour is not enough money for the lawyers. But, $4,000 an hour is too much money for the lawyers. 
What about something in between $250 and $4,000? Oh, say, $1,000 an hour. What about $1,000 an hour as a midpoint? Oh wait a minute, the Senate rejected that amount to. 
So $250 an hour is not enough. $4,000 an hour is too much. And, $1,000, I suppose, just doesn't feel right. 
If $4,000 an hour is too high, then what is $88,000 an hour? 
I'll tell you what $88,000 an hour is--it's how much money we are going to allow the attorney general to pay the lawyers in Texas if we don't pass the Gorton amendment. 
We must pass the Gorton amendment. It deals with every possible permutation and takes into account any variation in degrees of risk assumed by the plaintiffs' lawyers. 
It provides a cap of $4,000 an hour for all the attorneys who suited up and led the fight to kill tobacco in the earliest stages of the war. 
It provides a cap of $2,000 an hour for those who signed up when the war was coming to a close in the national settlement last spring and summer. 
It then provides a cap of $1,000 an hour for any lawyer who ran onto the battlefield after the settlement was signed, and a cap of $500 an hour for all lawyers who will rush straight to the courthouse as soon as we pass this fee cap. 
Senator Gorton has covered the waterfront here. I hope that we can pass this amendment as the last best hope for a fee cap.

Mr. McCONNELL. Before the Senator from Texas leaves the floor--if that is the direction in which he is headed--I want to thank him for his important contribution to this. This bill is, more than anything else, I say to my friend from Texas, about lawyers, about raising taxes on working-class Americans and about unjustly enriching a bunch of soon-to-be billionaire lawyers. 
I think we ought to call them the `sultans of smoke,' because they are going to be as rich as sultans if we do not pass the amendment offered by Senator Faircloth, and spoken so eloquently on behalf of by the Senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions, and Senator Gramm. 
Mr. President, we have had a lot of debate over the past few weeks about what provisions of this bill are most outrageous. And there is a lot about this bill that is outrageous. I ask my colleagues--which provision is the most outrageous? Some say it is the terribly regressive tax on low- to middle-income Americans that is the most outrageous. And that certainly is outrageous. Others say it is the unconstitutional backdoor tax known as the look-back penalties. Still others say it is the unconstitutional advertising restrictions. 
Here we spend 3 weeks on the floor of the Senate raising taxes on working-class Americans and taking away the constitutional rights of legal companies. 
I thought long and hard about which provisions of the bill truly deserve the trophy for the biggest outrage, in a bill replete with outrages. The hands down, slam-dunk, home run winner has to be the lawyers' fees--the lawyers' fees. The national tobacco settlement has now turned into the national trial lawyer enrichment deal. Other speakers have referred to Robert Samuelson's article in the Washington Post of June 3. Senator Gramm referred to it extensively, and I think this article sums up much of what is wrong with the lawyer fees authorized by this bill. 
More than anything else, what has become the hallmark of this bill--full of outrages--is the enrichment of the plaintiffs' lawyers of America. We are going to give a self-interested bunch of plaintiffs' lawyers $4 billion a year for the next 25 years--$4 billion a year for the next quarter century! This is an outrage. No bill ought to leave the Senate--not now, not tomorrow, not ever--that does not address this issue. 
Senator Gramm called it piracy. Maybe that is even too kind of a word. 
Four billion dollars a year. The only person in the world I can think of that has that kind of annual take, Mr. President, may be the Sultan of Brunei, the wealthiest monarch in the world. 
So what we are doing here is using the power of the State and the Federal Government to transfer private wealth and public dollars to create a bunch of little trial lawyer sultans, the `Sultans of Smoke.' We are going to create the sultan of Mississippi, the sultan of Texas, the sultan of Florida, just to name a few. 
Let's take a little trip around our currently upside-down world and preview our future `Sultans of Smoke.' First, let's go to Minnesota where a few lawyers are reportedly seeking to rake in approximately $450 million. The lawyers in Minnesota actually took the case to trial, so it is reasonable to assume they employed more attorneys and put in more hours than lawyers in other States. 
So let's assume that 50 lawyers worked a total of 100,000 hours. These 50 lawyers would each take home $9 million for his or her labors--$9 million. What is the hourly fee for the future sultans of Minnesota? That works out to about $4,500 an hour--not bad when you consider the minimum wage in America is $5.15. So the plaintiff's lawyers in Minnesota will make $4,500 an hour. 
Now, let's stop off in Mississippi. The latest reports out of Mississippi are that the lawyers are seeking $250 million. The reports indicate that the $250 million will go to a handful of future `Sultans of Smoke.' Assuming that 25 lawyers worked on these cases for 25,000 hours, the Congress would be authorizing each lawyer to receive $10 million apiece as a result of congressional action. 
So let's break that down on an hourly basis. If each of these lawyers worked 1,000 hours exclusively on the tobacco litigation, that would enable the future `Sultans of Smoke' in Mississippi to earn $10,000 an hour. Now, that is a good day's wage, especially when you consider that the average lawyer in America only makes $48 an hour. 
Now, let's stop off in Florida where a little band of trial lawyers are trying to take us for the ride of our lives. These soon-to-be `Sultans of Smoke' are looking to receive as much as $2.8 billion. One of the more eager Florida sultans has already sued for his $750 million share of the pot. 
We don't even have to make assumptions in Florida because a judge has already done the math for us. The judge looked at the greedy grab by the lawyers and concluded that the demands for attorney fees, as the judge put it, `Simply shock[ed] the conscience of the court.' The judge concluded that, even if the lawyers worked 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including holidays, for over 3 years, they would earn over $7,000 an hour. 
In fact, we know the actual hourly wage of the Florida lawyers is immensely higher because no one can seriously contend that any lawyer, much less every lawyer, worked 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on tobacco litigation for 3 1/2 years. 
But it gets better, Mr. President. The final stop on our sultan preview tour is Texas. Senator Gramm referred to Texas. A handful of lawyers in Texas are going after $2.2 billion. Let's see what kind of hourly fee the lawyers want in Texas. In the Texas case they did not go to trial, so it is reasonable to assume that Texas put in far less time than Minnesota. 
Again, assuming that 25 lawyers worked a total of 25,000 hours, then each of these lawyers would earn $88 million--$88 million. What kind of hourly fee is that for the `Sultans of Smoke' in Texas? It is $88,000 an hour, Mr. President, $88,000 an hour. Not bad when you consider that even the average doctor in America only earns $96 an hour. 
If the Texas grab is not outrageous enough, this excessive, grotesque sum for attorneys in Texas will have to be paid out of Medicare money. The New York Times recently reported that the Texas attorney general said publicly that part of the attorney fees will be paid by the Federal Government. And guess where it comes from? That is right, the Medicare money we are sending to the 
States in this bill. 
So I ask you: Who do we pay--the sick and the elderly, or the greedy and the lawyerly? 
Now the friends of the trial bar are arguing that the future `Sultans of Smoke' are expecting this money. We have heard that they are expecting this money and, therefore, it wouldn't be fair not to give it to them. 
I don't mean to sound cold and hard-hearted, but I have absolutely no sympathy for any lawyer who thinks he deserves $88,000 an hour. Moreover, there is no reasonable expectation that any Congress, in any State, or any nation, would allow this band of trial lawyers to pull off such a scam. I repeat, these lawyers have no reasonable expectation that public officials, elected to represent the best interest of the people, are going to stand by and codify a right to receive an excessive, gargantuan, and grotesque payment of attorney fees. Worst yet, these outrageous payments will continue for at least the next quarter century. 
Every lawyer in this deal, and, in fact, every lawyer in this country, knows that the rules of professional conduct preclude them from charging fees that are unreasonable and clearly excessive. In fact, no attorney will dispute the fact that a judge could step in today and strike down any and all of these excessive fee grabs. It is absolutely ludicrous to argue that the very Federal Government that is approving, codifying, and regulating these deals is somehow unable to touch these outrageous fees. 
In fact, let me tell you a little bit about the nature of contingency fees, as explained by George Will in a column earlier this year. George Will wrote:  
Among the things that make Congress, among others, irritable about the settlement are the stupendous jackpots, totaling perhaps $45 billion to $55 billion, that may come to lawyers hired by State governments on contingency-fee contracts.

<TEXT>
Mr. McCONNELL. I am sorry, I won't. 
The states' tobacco lawyers demand, with more brass than plausibility, that their fees be treated as an island immune from Congress' general jurisdiction over the settlement. 
Now, the Faircloth amendment agrees with Mr. Will's analysis and simply says that no trial lawyer's sweetheart deal is an island. I firmly believe that we cannot settle these State deals and create a sweeping Federal regulatory scheme for tobacco without also regulating the fees. 
Let me repeat something that others have forcefully said. No bill should leave the Senate of the United States that does not deal with the unjust enrichment of lawyers contained in this bill. 
Let me read another piece that makes similar points. The article appeared in a home State newspaper, the Lexington Herald-Leader:  
Question: If on election day you were asked to chose between a political candidate who promised to work for a reasonable salary, and another candidate who wanted to be paid 25 percent of the government's proceeds, an amount which could reach billions of dollars, which candidate would you vote for? 
Many voters thought they were voting for the former, but are getting the latter. That's because several dozen states have chosen to farm out legal work to lawyers who will be paid not for the number of hours they work but a percentage of the proceeds from lawsuits. 
Advocates for trial lawyers give several reasons why lawyers should be paid large contingency fees instead of for work performed, like other state employees. 
First, they say contingency fees are the only way states can afford to hire top-notch lawyers. Nonsense. Tobacco litigation pits 40 states with extensive revenues (the Texas state government alone collected $ 40.4 billion in 1996, which is about $ 4 billion more than the domestic and international tobacco revenues of the largest tobacco company, Philip Morris, for the same year) against tobacco companies who pay their lawyers by salary or by the hour. If tobacco companies can do it, so can the states. Some have: Maine has capped the fees for its lawyers at $ 150 per hour, and Vermont's lawyers, in the case of a national deal, will be paid no more than $ 200,000. * * * * * 
Private lawyers will likely reap tens of billions from tobacco settlements. After they do, won't they try to keep this cash cow going? If lawyers can make billions saying that states are due dollars for the adverse health effects of tobacco, won't they want to say the same about junk food? Or liquor? Or fast cars? 
The answer is: Yes. And that's why private profit-making has no place in government decision-making. Government policies should be based on their merits, not on opportunities to give private lawyers billion-dollar profits. 
Mr. President, I am proud to say that every state did not go out and cut a sweetheart deal with their trial lawyer contributors. Some states took the high road in this deal and refused to allow the conflict-of-interest contingency fee arrangement to taint the deal. 
Let me read to you a piece from the Seattle Times that explains the rationale of these states that took the road less traveled: 
Using the state's own attorneys has permitted California Attorney General Dan Lungren to claim high ground and dismiss suggestions that the lawsuits were motivated by the plaintiff's bar. 
The fact that we are not using outside counsel lends a lot more credibility to the legitimacy of these claims,' said Tracy Buck Walsh, special assistant attorney general, who is managing California's case. 
Colorado Attorney General Gale Norton, who also had the political backing of the governor, had another motive: She said she is philosophically opposed to her state using contingency-fee attorneys because these outside counsel are motivated by more than the pursuit of justice. 
`We tend to be more objective than private counsel who are employed on a contingency basis and who maintain their own personal financial interest in the outcome of the litigation,' said Norton, a Republican. `It gives them different motives.' 
The state of West Virginia's one-page contingency-fee contract agreeing to pay one-third of the recovery, by far the largest contemplated by any state, was thrown out of court as unconstitutional. 
In arguing against the contract, tobacco-industry attorneys suggested that it was unethical because it compromised the independence and impartiality of the quasi-judicial role vested in state prosecutors. 
`The litigation team is wielding the coercive, regulatory and punitive powers of the state,' tobacco attorney Robert King argued. Such a contract `permits the power of the state to be exercised by attorneys with a direct financial stake in the exercise of that power.' 
The bottom line here is that the National Lawyer Enrichment Deal smells like an under-the-table arrangement cut in smoke-filled rooms. 
The states have made deals with their lawyer friends to engage in what has been aptly referred to as `prosecution for profit'--and we can not simply bury our heads in the sand and pretend that we have no duty to regulate these deals. 
In the words of the Weekly Standard: 
Bribing judges was long ago made a crime. Bounty hunters were banished and state prosecutors put on salary for a reason--to remove any financial stake in their prosecution. Contingency-fee lawyers have a stake in litigation that reaches grotesque proportions. And now these lawyers are being deputized by attorneys general to prosecute under the cloak of state authority. 
When these lawyers are making large political contributions to the attorneys general who hire them to sue, in lawsuits that have contingency fees running literally hundreds of millions of dollars, prosecution for profit takes on a whole new dimension. Such conflicts of interest once were considered a threat to justice. Indeed they were. Indeed they are. 
So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support Senator Faircloth's reasonable and fairminded amendment. Frankly, I had hoped the previous amendment offered by Senator Faircloth at $250 an hour would be approved. But certainly, $1,000 an hour, when the average American entering the work force at minimum wage is making $5.15 an hour and when the average lawyer in America is making $48 an hour, is not unreasonable. 
The amendment says it is perfectly OK to make a great living in America--as a trial lawyer or in any other legal occupation--but it is not OK to cut sweetheart deals, `prosecute for profit,' and use the massive, coercive, and punitive power of the State to transfer private and public dollars to make a few friends into instant billionaires. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCONNELL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I thank my friend from North Carolina. 
The Faircloth cap is an attempt to insert a bit of sanity into a world of attorney-fee madness. The national tobacco settlement has turned into the `national lawyer enrichment deal.' Let me tell you a little about the current `national lawyer enrichment deal.' 
Under the current bill, conservative estimates say that we are about to hand over approximately $4 billion a year to lawyers --$4 billion a year--every year--for at least the next 25 years. This, Mr. President, is absolutely outrageous. 
I am sure the friends of the trial bar will stand up and say I am exaggerating. They will say we are stretching this one. Lawyers aren't really asking for that much money, it will be said. They aren't that greedy, some will claim. They just want to be paid a fair wage for a good day's work. Well, let's see if I am exaggerating. Let's see if the trial lawyers just want a fair wage for a good day's work. Let's take a little tour of the `national lawyer enrichment deal.' 
In Minnesota, where a few lawyers are reportedly seeking to rake in approximately $450 million, the lawyers in Minnesota actually took the case to trial, so it is reasonable to assume that they employed more attorneys and put in more hours than some lawyers in other States. So let's assume that 50 lawyers worked a total of 100,000 hours. These 50 lawyers would each take home $9 million for his or her labor--$9 million. And what is the hourly fee for the hard-working plaintiffs' lawyers in Minnesota? It is $4,500 an hour, Mr. President, $4,500 an hour for the plaintiffs' lawyers in Minnesota. 
Well, let's take a look at Mississippi. We will stop off in Mississippi on our national tour. The latest reports out of Mississippi are that the lawyers are seeking $250 million. Assuming that 25 lawyers worked on these cases for 25,000 hours, the Congress would be authorizing each lawyer to receive $10 million a piece. 
Let's break that down on an hourly basis. If each of these lawyers worked 1,000 hours exclusively on the tobacco litigation, that would enable them to earn $10,000 an hour. Pretty good day's pay, I would say--$10,000 an hour. 
Now let's stop off in Florida, and this is better than Disney World. A handful of trial lawyers in Florida are trying to take us for a ride, the ride of our lives. These fellows are looking to receive as much as $2.8 billion. One lawyer has already sued for his $750 million share of the pot. And we don't even have to make assumptions in Florida because the judge has already done the math for us. The judge looked at the greedy grab by the lawyers and concluded that the demands for attorneys' fees--and this is quoting the judge--`Simply shock[ed] the conscience of the court.' The judge concluded that even if the lawyers worked 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including holidays, for over 3 years, they would earn over $7,000 an hour--$7,000 an hour. In fact, we know the actual hourly rate for the Florida attorneys is immensely higher because no one can seriously contend that any lawyer, much less every lawyer, worked 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on tobacco litigation for 3 1/2 years. 
But it gets better. The final stop on our lawyer enrichment tour is Texas. There a handful of lawyers are going after $2.2 billion. Well, let's see what kind of hourly fee the lawyers want in Texas. Texas did not go to trial so it is reasonable to assume Texas put in far less time than Minnesota. 
Again, assuming that 25 lawyers worked a total of 25,000 hours, then each of these lawyers could earn $88 million. And what kind of hourly fee is that for our Texas trial lawyers? That is $88,000 an hour--$88,000 an hour for the plaintiffs' lawyers in Texas. And if that is not outrageous enough, the $2.2 billion for attorneys in Texas have to be paid out of the Medicare money. So who do we pay, the sick and the elderly or the greedy and the lawyerly? 
Let's compare the tobacco trial lawyers to the rest of the world. Let's see how $88,000 an hour compares to the average wage of others in our booming national economy. 
First, we know that minimum wage mandates that workers be paid $5.15 an hour. We certainly know that the tobacco trial lawyers are making a heck of a lot more than the minimum wage earner. Senator Kennedy will have to pass an awful lot of minimum wage hikes this year to keep up with the plaintiffs' lawyers. In fact, we are going to authorize the trial lawyers to earn nearly 50 times the minimum wage under the Faircloth amendment. 
Simply put, the tobacco trial lawyer is also making a heck of a lot more money than every other wage earner in our country--everybody. As Senator Faircloth has pointed out, the baker earns $7.65 an hour; the barber, $8.37 an hour; the auto mechanic, $12.35 an hour; the carpenter, $13.03 an hour; the police officer, $16.65 an hour; the pharmacist, $25.98 an hour; all the rest of the lawyers, $48.07 an hour; and the doctors, $96.15 an hour. That is what everybody else is making. The Faircloth cap would bring the trail lawyers' stake back to the edge of reason. The cap would 
allow lawyers to recover their costs as well as a reasonable hourly rate as high as $250 an hour. 
I might say even the $250-an-hour rate sort of makes me cringe. I suspect if the Senator from North Carolina had his way about it, it would be lower than that. But that is what the amendment states. 
I know that amount is not exactly $88,000 an hour. I would not argue that $250 an hour is as good as $88,000 an hour. But it is not exactly chicken feed, and it is way the heck more than anybody else in America is making on an hourly basis. I would say there are a lot of us in the Senate who would like to have that kind of take-home pay. I know there are a lot of folks in America who would be more than happy for $250 an hour. 
This cap is extremely generous and eminently reasonable. In fact, the Federal Government has established numerous attorney fee caps over the years that prove the point. Under the Equal Access to Justice Act, the fee cap is $125 an hour; under the Criminal Justice Act, $75 an hour; under the Internal Revenue Code, $110 an hour. 
We ought to pass the Faircloth cap. It is fair and it is constitutional. A sweeping Federal regulatory bill cannot leave out the matter of lawyers' fees, especially when omitting the issue would allow for such abuse. 
Let me spell this out. 
The tobacco bill is an all-encompassing Federal regulatory scheme. The scheme will expand the Federal jurisdiction over tobacco products, regulate the manufacture, advertising, and sale of tobacco products, fundamentally affect and alter past, present, and future litigation over tobacco products, and facilitate the implementation of the settlement reached between 40-some-odd States and the cigarette manufacturers. 
It would defy all logic and reason to pass this type of sweeping Federal regulation without including some type of minimal regulation for the payment of attorneys' fees for civil actions affected by the bill. Basic fairness requires that we not neglect this critical issue. 
Throughout the debate over the tobacco settlement, we have constantly heard assertions that the tobacco companies have gone after women, children, and the elderly. If we don't pass this sensible fee cap, then we will not only be creating an exclusive club of trial lawyer billionaires--that is with a `b,' Mr. President, billionaires--but we will be unleashing a legion of lawyers to prey upon these very same persons in future tobacco cases affected by this bill. Surely, nobody in the Senate would want such a result. 
No one is trying to deny any lawyer a fair wage. Surely, $250 an hour, which is in the Faircloth amendment, is more than a fair wage by the standard of anybody else living in our country. 
A vote for the Faircloth amendment is a vote for reason and sanity. Let's stop the National Lawyer Enrichment Tour before it starts. 
Mr. President, just a couple of other observations that I would like to make before relinquishing the floor. 
Neither the Contracts Clause nor the Due Process clause prohibit regulation of attorney fees as part of a broad, comprehensive regulatory bill. 
The Court has pointed out that a `party complaining of unconstitutionality . . . must overcome a presumption of constitutionality and `establish that the legislature acted in an arbitrary and irrational way.' 
It is neither arbitrary nor irrational to regulate attorney fees as part of a comprehensive federal effort to expand federal jurisdiction over tobacco products, regulate the manufacture, advertising and sale of tobacco products, fundamentally affect and alter past, present, and future litigation over tobacco products, and facilitate the implementation of the settlement reached between forty-some-odd states and cigarette manufacturers. In fact, it would defy all logic and reason to pass this type of sweeping federal regulation without including some type of minimal regulation for the payment of attorney fees for civil actions affected by this bill. 
Even CRS--when looking at a stand-alone fee cap last October--determined that `it seems very likely that the proposal in question would not violate due process.' 
Federal courts have routinely upheld laws that abrogate past contracts, so long as those laws have a rational basis. It is certainly a rational basis to regulate fees as part of a broad regulatory package. Moreover, it is rational to ensure that an equitable amount of finite resources will be available to protect the national public health and welfare and to compensate those who suffer from tobacco-related diseases. 
In fact, the Supreme Court has declared that `Congress may set minimum wages, control prices, or create causes of action that did not previously exist.' 
In one classic Supreme Court case, the Court held that Congress could retroactively cancel a `free rail pass for life' given as part of a settlement of litigation. Moreover, to accept the trial lawyers' takings argument, one would also have to consider it a constitutional violation for Congress to require States to abrogate contracts with state employees in order to increase the minimum wage. 
Professor Brickman has explained that `[i]f individual parties could insulate themselves from congressional legislation by entering into private contracts before such legislation were enacted, then: 
 the result would be that individuals and corporations could, by contracts between themselves, in anticipation of legislation, render of no avail the exercise by Congress, to the full extent authorized by the Constitution, of its power to regulate commerce. No power of Congress can be thus restricted. The mischiefs that would result from a different interpretation of the Constitution will be readily perceived. 
Finally, the `constitutionality of the amendment under a Taking Clause analysis is further buttressed by the fact that attorneys affected by the regulation are receiving substantial financial benefits from [the Tobacco Bill].' (Brickman Letter at 2.) These substantial benefits for attorneys, financial and otherwise, include the fact that the federal government is: (1) ratifying the national tobacco settlement, (2) establishing a national trust fund to provide States with Medicaid reimbursements and attorneys with a basis for recovery, (3) removing limits on tort liability in future cases, (4) making it easier for plaintiffs to recover by changing the burden of proof and establishing a presumption that certain diseases are caused by use of tobacco products, and (5) creating a national public database with incriminating documents to use against tobacco companies in present and future litigation. 
No court would view these substantial benefits for plaintiffs' attorneys and conclude that they have suffered an unconstitutional taking. Even the CRS document referenced by the opponents of this amendment clearly spells out that `indeed, the Supreme Court has never found a taking based on federal legislative alteration of existing private contracts.' 
Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from North Carolina for an outstanding and important amendment. There should be no tobacco bill at all--at all--unless this unjust enrichment of this select group of lawyers is curbed. The Faircloth amendment would do that. I commend the distinguished Senator from North Carolina for his good work, and I am happy to be a cosponsor of his amendment, and I yield the floor. 
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the William E. Bivin Forensic Society--the debate team at Western Kentucky University, located in Bowling Green, Kentucky--for their recent victories at the national collegiate debate championships. 
In mid-March, Western won the Delta Sigma Rho--Tau Kappa Alpha Lincoln-Douglas Debate Championships at Miami University in Ohio. Two members of the team, Mike McDonner and Aaron Whaley--were co-national champions in the individual competition. 
Then, in April, Western also won at the National Forensics Association tournament at Western Illinois University, defeating Ohio State University by a 5-0 decision. Mike McDonner again captured the individual title, and teammate Kerri Richardson was a semifinalist. In addition, Kristin Pamperin and Doug Morey were quarterfinalists. Other varsity members of the victorious Western Kentucky team were Amanda Gibson and Aaron Whaley. Novice debaters Mitchell Bailey, Jennifer Cloyd and Brian Sisk also contributed to the team title. 
These two debates comprise the national championships in college debating circles, and it is extremely rare that one team wins both events. Amazingly, this is second time in three years that Western Kentucky has claimed both debates. The winning tradition being built in Bowling Green is a testament to the strong leadership of the team's coach, Judy Woodring. 
Mr. President, Western Kentucky University's debate team is building quite a tradition. I offer my congratulations to Coach Woodring and to all the members of the Bivin Forensics Society for another great year. With two national championships in three years, I expect that we may be seeing the beginning of a dynasty in Bowling Green.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to remember the life of Dr. Alvin C. Poweleit. For nearly 50 years, the people of Covington were blessed to have Dr. Poweleit as a member of their community, and few families were not touched by the kind gentleman known as `Pepa.' 
Pepa Poweleit grew up in Northern Kentucky in the town of Newport. After earning his medical degree, Dr. Poweleit returned to Newport in the late 1930s as general practitioner. Like most young men of his generation, he left his hometown behind when he signed up to serve in World War II. He soon found himself in the Philippines, where he was the first U.S. medical officer to be decorated in the war, when he saved personnel in a submerged Brenn Gun Carrier. 
Dr. Poweleit spent over three years in Japanese POW camps in the Philippines, and was a survivor of the Bataan Death March. After the war, Dr. Poweleit returned to Northern Kentucky, where he opened up his own practice in Covington as an eye, ear, nose and throat specialist. 
For the last 50 years, the Poweleit family has maintained the office at the corner of Eighth and Scott in Covington. It was a rare day that Dr. Poweleit didn't work 14 hours. If there were sick patients to be seen, Pepa Poweleit would see every single one. At a time when most people lived within walking distance of their family doctor, it wasn't rare to see Dr. Poweleit still in the office after midnight. 
Pepa Poweleit retired from practice in 1981, leaving the family practice to his son Alvin D, an eye specialist known in the community as Dr. Alvin. Carrying on the tradition of family practice, Dr. Alvin remains a fixture today in the Covington community. 
Mr. President, last June, Pepa Poweleit was tragically killed when the car in which he was a passenger was run into by a truck. He was 89. Pepa Poweleit was a beloved figure in the communities of Northern Kentucky. Though nearly two decades have gone by since he retired, and almost a year has passed since his death, Pepa Poweleit is still sorely missed.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the recent anniversary of the Floyd County Emergency and Rescue Squad. Forty years ago, this squad of volunteers was formed to help the people of Eastern Kentucky in times of emergency and disaster, and have been doing so ever since. 
The Floyd County Emergency and Rescue Squad was founded on April 27, 1958, as a result of a tragic accident in Prestonsburg, Kentucky, in which a school bus plunged into the Big Sandy River, killing 26 students and the driver. As a result of this tragedy, dozens of community members came together to form the Squad and the late Graham Burchett became the first Captain, a position he held for twenty years. 
Since that time, over 300 community members have served on the Squad--doctors and lawyers, coal miners and factory workers--people from all walks of life have worked side-by-side in volunteer service to their community. The Squad operates without any public support. The members are all volunteers and all their equipment is paid for through private donations and grants. 
The Squad currently maintains a roster of thirty active members and dozens of reserve members. The Squad is called on for auto extrication, water rescue and drowning recovery, lost or missing persons, and assistance to coal mine rescue teams. In the last month alone, they have assisted in the evacuation of flood victims, recovered a drowning victim and have assisted on four auto accidents. 
Despite the fact that the Squad must labor mightily for every dollar they get, they have managed to secure ultra-modern equipment, and are called frequently to assist in recovery activities outside the county and even outside the state. 
Mr. President, I hope all my colleagues will join me in offering our congratulations to Captain Harry Adams, Co-Captain Richie Schoolcraft, Treasurer and Secretary Brian Sexton, First Lieutenant Derek Calhoun and Second Lieutenant Lee Schoolcraft and all the volunteers of the Floyd County Rescue Squad. They carry on the Squad's rich tradition of volunteering their time and risking their lives to help the people of their community, and they are all worthy of our admiration and thanks.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the tremendous accomplishments of Dr. Vince Davis, who is retiring this spring after 27 years at the Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. 
Since I was first elected to the United States Senate in 1984, Vince and I have had occasion to discuss important issues of the day in foreign affairs, as well as the underlying trends and currents that shape and guide world events looming just over the horizon. I have never failed to find his views both penetrating and insightful, and have always appreciated his counsel over the years. 
But now, Vince has decided to pursue new interests after nearly three decades of toiling in the academic vineyard, and so it's appropriate that we bid him adieu with fondness and with gratitude. 
Thinking back over the span of his career, I believe Vince Davis's mark on Kentucky and the world has been and always will be the enormous store of labor and love he poured into the Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce. It's clear to me that Vince's tireless and inspired stewardship of the program has fashioned the Patterson School into the glimmering jewel of excellence for which it is now justly famous. Vince has given his all to the School, and two generations of bright young students have been immeasurably enriched by his exertions. 
Mr. President, there is an old Irish proverb that says, `The work praises the man.' In that spirit, each time I think of the Patterson School, I will remember Vince Davis, for the Patterson School is his work, and we all should praise that which he leaves as his legacy.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last week, more than 1200 students from across the nation came to Washington, D.C. to compete in the national finals of the `We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution' program. I am proud to announce that the competing class for Kentucky represented Louisville Male High School. These young scholars worked diligently to reach the national finals by winning local competitions in the Commonwealth. 
The distinguished members of the class who represented Kentucky were: Angela Adams, Perry Bacon, Katherine Breeding, Will Carle, Eric Coatley, Courtney Coffee, Brian Davis, Mary Fleming, Matt Gilbert, Amanda Holloway, Holly Jessie, Heath Lambert, Gwen Malone, Kristy Martin, Brian Palmer, Lauren Reynolds, Shane Skoner, LaVonda Willis, Bryan Wilson, Darreshia Wilson, Beth Wilson, Janelle Winfree, Treva Winlock, Jodie Zeller. 
I would also like to recognize their teacher, Sandy Hoover, who deserves much of the credit for the success of the class. The state coordinators, Deborah Williamson and Jennifer Van Hoose, and the district coordinator, Dianne Meredith, also contributed a significant amount of time and effort to help the class reach the national finals. 
The `We the People . . . the Citizen and the Constitution' program is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The three-day national competition simulates a congressional hearing whereby students are given the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary constitutional issues. The simulated congressional hearing consists of oral presentations by the students before panels of adult judges. 
Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the `We the People . . .' program has provided curricular materials at upper elementary, middle, and high school levels for more than 75,000 teachers and 24 million students nationwide. Members of Congress and their staff enhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues with students and teachers. 
The `We the People . . .' program is designed to help students achieve a reasoned commitment to the fundamental values and principles that bind Americans together as a people. The program also fosters civic dispositions or traits of public and private character conducive to effective and responsible participation in politics and government. 
I want to commend these constitutional experts on their academic achievements as participants in the `We the People . . .' program and commend them for their great achievement in reaching the national finals.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the remarkable season recently completed by the Lady Tigers of Campbellsville University, located in the town of Campbellsville, Kentucky. While many are more familiar with the Kentucky basketball dynasties built in places like Louisville and Lexington, Campbellsville has a pretty impressive run of its own going. 
Nationally ranked all year, the Lady Tigers completed their regular season with a record of 21-7. Winning both the Mid-South Conference Regular Season and Tournament titles earned Campbellsville an automatic bid to the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) championship tournament in Jackson, Tennessee. This is the ninth consecutive season that Campbellsville has qualified for the national tournament. 
The Lady Tigers opened the NAIA national tournament by defeating Big State Conference Tournament Champion LeTourneau University 95-56 in the first round and then defeated Oklahoma City University in the Second Round by a score of 69-51. The Lady Tigers were finally stopped in the quarterfinals by four-time defending National Champion, Southern Nazarene University of Oklahoma, in a heartbreaker, 72-67. 
Throughout the season, the Lady Tigers were led by Mid South Conference Player of the Year Shannon Wathen, and All-Conference teammates Julie Jeffries and Farrah Sullivan. Together, this senior triumvirate combined to average over thirty nine-points and fifteen rebounds per game. Post-season honors were also bestowed on Coach Donna Wise, who has led Campbellsville to nine consecutive national tournament births and ranks second in wins among active NAIA coaches with 475. 
Mr. President, Coach Wise has built a national powerhouse women's basketball program in Campbellsville, a small town in Central Kentucky. I hope my colleagues will join me in offering congratulations to Coach Wise, her players, and everyone associated with the Campbellsville Lady Tigers on another great season.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, when I gave thought to what I wanted to say today, the words and deeds of two great Americans came to my mind--the words belong to Abraham Lincoln--the deeds were my father's. 
In many respects, this debate was launched a half century ago in Europe. There, on the battlefields in Germany and France, Italy and Belgium, American soldiers fought and died to secure our future--our freedom. My father was one of those men. Standing shoulder to shoulder with friends, with fellow countrymen, he saw many fall in combat--never to rise again--never to return to their families--never to worship in their churches--to play an afternoon game of baseball with their sons and daughters. 
My dad was proud to serve his country as a platoon guide--he was proud of the soldiers who became life-long friends, bound together over time by their common mission. 
Decades before Staff Sergeant McConnell shipped out to the Rhineland, American heroism was memorialized in Lincoln's Address at Gettysburg. President Lincoln's words echoed across Europe's plains of courage and glory. 
We cannot dedicate--we cannot consecrate--we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us . . . a new birth of freedom. 
Freedom. 
That is the purpose President Lincoln defined for our nation--the noble calling my father served--the mission we must finish here today. 
The debate this week centers on the wisdom of America, once again, expanding her horizons--adding to her security family--advancing freedom. 
To reach this point, the Senate and Administration have struggled, often in open conflict, to redefine the terms of our relationship with Europe, and more particularly, Russia. These deliberations are as much about American responsibilities and interests, as they are about Russia's role and ambitions. 
The commitment of my father and his fellow soldiers laid the moral foundation of this debate. The politics of Europe's future followed later and, to me, seemed joined in 1993. The Wall had fallen yet more thousands of Russian troops occupied the Baltic nations. Ever sensitive to Russian concerns, the Administration was reluctant to press Moscow to withdraw. Understandably, the Baltic nations were deeply concerned that they would never be free from Russia's imperial grasp. Against strong Administration opposition, the Senate voted 89-8 to condition aid to Russia on achieving an agreement for a withdrawal timetable. Remarkably, within weeks, negotiators produced a concrete plan for action. 
This was my first direct experience with Russia's approach to the region. I think it is fair to say I learned a lesson Henry Kissinger sums up well--`It is, in fact, ambiguity about dividing lines not their existence, and ambivalence about Western reactions, not their certainty that tempt nationalists and militarists.' 
Sadly, fuzzy thinking, grey-beige lines and Moscow myopia continued to dog the Administration's European policy throughout 1993, 1994, and into 1995. No where was this mistaken course more apparent that the Administration's firm and abiding opposition to establishing a road map or criteria for admission to NATO. Senior officials engaged in a simple shell game arguing Eastern and Central European nations were not qualified to meet the standards to join NATO's ranks, yet they refused to define those standards. I recall a particularly frustrating session when Secretary Christopher appeared before the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, and I questioned him on this point. I asked him what exactly an applicant must do to join NATO? He claimed it was all spelled out in the NATO charter. `Where?' I pressed. `Right there,' he demurred. 
Of course, there were no specific terms for admission nor had any been imposed on other recent entrants. This game, which 
bent to Russian demands not to expand NATO, continued, eventually taking on new shape with the introduction of the Partnership for Peace. Dismissed by leaders in Poland as `treachery' and a `second Yalta,' the Partnership drew no admissions distinction between the historical victims of Russian aggression and the aggressor--everyone was welcome to join! 
The President's team explained that this approach avoided establishing new blocs in Europe and would erase all dividing lines. What it erased was any sense of comfort in Central Europe about U.S. resolve, responsibility or commitment to stand up an ever ambitious Kremlin as it widened control over what Moscow deemed its `sphere of influence'. 
Administration briefers and papers systematically dodged the serious security issues related to expanding NATO. In preparing for a 1994 Treaty summit, Administration talking points declared, `We do not believe the summit should set a specific timetable or criteria for membership (in NATO) or identify preferred candidates . . . The (Partnership for Peace) will not give the Poles, Czechs or Hungarians all they want, but we think they will recognize it is an important step forward on NATO's part. At the same time it should not create problems in Russia.' 
The explanation was dismissed by a characteristically blunt Lech Walesa as `a tragedy'. 
July of 1994 was the real low point in the drive to expand NATO. It is marked in my mind by two events: the Senate defeated 53-44 an amendment I offered on admissions standards and the President traveled to Europe. 
The amendment hardly seemed controversial--it was a reporting requirement asking the President to define specific military, political and economic standards for admission to NATO and then provide an assessment of what it would take to guarantee that Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Baltic nations were capable of fulfilling military interoperability and other NATO responsibilities. 
The Administration's overwhelming opposition was given a voice by the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Pell, who warned that this reporting requirement singled out certain countries and `draws dangerous new lines in Europe.' 
Just about this time, President Clinton left for Poland. Ever eloquent, he tried to reassure the Polish Assembly that the U.S. `would not allow the Iron Curtain to be replaced by the veil of indifference.' His comments prompted the Chairman of their Foreign Affairs Committee to observe his speech was `beautiful, but did little to satisfy our security expectations.' Walesa publicly lamented the fact that the Administration did not seem to understand Poland's `history and geography cautioned not to take this moment for granted.' 
What turned this debate around? When exactly did the Administration stop taking Central European security for granted? 
I can pinpoint the moment--the month--when I saw and heard the change. 
On February 9, 1995, Deputy Secretary Talbott appeared before the Foreign Operations Subcommittee and spoke in vague generalities about American `hopes and expectations' for European security. I asked point blank, `Is it correct that there is no timetable and no criteria' for admission to NATO? His response was simple, `That is correct.' 
In March, with the arrival of Richard Holbrooke as the new Assistant Secretary for European Affairs, the policy changed. In a little noticed appearance before the Subcommittee, Holbrooke announced a major departure in American policy. He said, `Expanding NATO eastward is our highest priority . . . if NATO is a 16 car train, with a car for each member, the U.S. is clearly the engine.' 
This was the clearest definition of American purpose and leadership I had heard since President Clinton's election, and then Secretary Holbrooke went further. During the hearing, I asked and he answered six questions bearing on the standards for NATO eligibility including the relevance of democratic institutions, civilian control of the military, the size and NATO 
compatability of the armed forces, and a nation's financial and infrastructure requirements. Getting straightforward answers was ground breaking! 
From that moment forward, I found cooperation and support for funding and program initiatives which strengthened the military capabilities of potential entrants. In 1996, 1997, and 1998 the Subcommittee was able to set aside funds for Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and then Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia to improve military training, equipment and capabilities with a view to accelerating their timetable for admission. 
Mr. President, I could argue that Mr. Holbrooke's assignment to the European Bureau marked a key transition point in the NATO debate. However, there were many other factors which contributed to turning the tide. A shift in control of the Senate, our disastrous policy in Bosnia, Russia's role in destabilizing Georgia and abominable conduct in Chechnya--among many factors focused attention on the urgent need to revitalize U.S. leadership in a stronger Atlantic security alliance. 
1995 marked the point when the Administration seemed to grasp a very basic concept articulated by Henry Kissinger--`an alliance depends on drawing lines around a specified territory that members undertake to defend. Basing European and Atlantic security on a no-man's land between Germany and Russia runs counter to historical experience, especially that of the interwar period.' 
This Treaty reflects the fact that we have finally reached a point, with bipartisan agreement, where we draw new, bright lines in Europe. The vote this week affirms our commitment to protect our partners and our principles with an iron clad military guarantee. 
Now is not the time for ambiguity. Today, is not the occasion to equivocate, qualify or confuse the message we send to friends, allies and potential foe. Expanding our horizons and enlarging NATO safeguards our interests as it strengthens the sense of security in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and the next class of entrants. 
Shortly before the Madrid summit, leaders across Europe were asked about the importance and implications of expansion. Their answers offer a commanding vision of American interests in NATO's future. 
Czech President Vaclav Havel offered a compelling view:  
Membership is the best tool for a collective European defense, and for the defense of democratic values of states under the rule of law . . . Members will now work together to face a spectrum of threats, including local and regional conflicts. 
The Chairman of Lithuania's Parliament strengthens the case for expansion: 
NATO's declared open door policy . . . and firm stand on the principle that the Baltic countries have an unrestricted sovereign right to their own choice will only aid the emerging new Russia in living up to its obligations of normal European behavior. 
Romania's President's goes further: 
The process for preparing for NATO enlargement has led in less than four years to a broad and profound stability and solidarity in Central Europe. 
Both he and Mr. Havel acknowledge that the enlargement process stimulated resolution of age-old border and ethnic policy disputes. 
Poland's President's made a final point: 
Enjoying traditionally close ties with the United States and being at the same time a profoundly Europe oriented society, Poland will contribute to the alliance's cohesion. As for the military dimension, the alliance will gain reliable and modernizing armed forces. We shall continue our active policy aimed at ensuring Central Europe remains a zone of stable and harmonious relations. 
Central Europe's leaders have summed up with clarity and conviction the strategic political, economic, and security justification both for NATO and its expansion. They make clear that the importance of our decision this week will only increase over time. 
While I am convinced of the arguments in favor of expansion, there is one concern raised by some of my colleagues which I wish to address--that is the doubt about providing security guarantees to new members. 
I know there are Senators who would prefer to narrowly define the terms of participation of new members or limit our contribution or commitment to their defense. Unfortunately, such determinations would create a caste system--dismissing new or future members to second class citizen status. This would be a terrible mistake and undermine an alliance forged and strengthened by its tradition of common purpose, common defense, in short, a commitment to equality. 
NATO's strength and credibility would be compromised by any decision to qualify new members with ambiguous standing. There should be no side-deals, doubts or questions raised about the deployment of weapons or troops on a new member's soil. This Treaty must be implemented with the firm understanding that new members are full partners entitled to full protection and expected to bear full responsibility. We cannot create damaging divisions within the alliance by imposing restrictions on the nature of participation. 
Only instability and uncertainty would result from creating such a double standard for defense. Only Democracy's opponents would gain ground. Only those who have long maligned closing the gap between East and West--who yearn for the days of despots and communists kings--would win. 
We should not cast votes which serve to encourage Zhirinovsky's storm troopers. Our call is to stand by the champions of free market principles--to stand up for the voices which appeal for democracy's day. 
I'm sure there may still be a senator or two unconvinced that American lives should be laid down to defend Budapest or Prague. Let me remind those colleagues of remarks made by Margaret Thatcher when she called Great Britain to the defense of the Falklands. She said, `To those--not many--who speak lightly of a few islanders beyond the seas and who ask the question, `Are they worth fighting for?' Let me say this: right and wrong are not measured by a head count of those to whom that wrong has been done. That would not be principle but expediency. The Falklanders are not strangers. They are our own people.' 
With more than 23 million Americans of Central and East European descent, Prime Minister Thatcher's insight and the analogy reach across our nation into every community. 
NATO exists to defend principle not expediency. 
I know some of my colleagues feel we are rushing to judgment. For those friends and colleagues, I call attention to the fact that I believe this debate has gone on at least five years--it has taken a long time and much effort to bring the Administration to this important decision. 
The cause is important--the reasoning sound. Our vote to expand NATO's European frontier strengthens the pillars of democracy and free market principles, stimulates dispute resolution, balances and restrains Russian ambitions, reduces military tensions, and adds new security capabilities. 
In short, we take one step closer to finishing the mission President Lincoln called upon our nation to faithfully serve. 
Freedom. 
I know my father and his friends would have been proud to defend our choice, our invitation to Poland, to Hungary and the Czech Republic to join NATO.

Mr. McCONNELL. 
Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor today to introduce a bill that is long overdue. Known as the TVA Customer Protection Act, this legislation will implement a number of consumer reforms to make TVA accountable to ratepayers and better prepare TVA to compete in a restructured electricity market. 
The bill I am introducing provides Tennessee Valley ratepayers a number of consumer protections against unchecked and unjustified increases in their power rates. This bill will put an end to TVA's ability to compete unfairly with its regional distributors. This bill will prohibit TVA from sticking ratepayers with the bill for TVA's international forays that have no relevance to TVA's responsibility to provide low cost power to the Tennessee Valley. Finally, this bill also codifies an agreement between TVA and several industry associations to limit TVA's authority as a government entity to compete with small businesses in non-electric services. 
Mr. President, TVA is a federal corporation that was first formed in 1933, to tame the Tennessee River, our nation's fifth largest river, and to bring economic development to this once poverty stricken region. Over the years as the Valley has developed, TVA has evolved in their role as a river steward to become the largest power producer in the nation. Today, TVA provides power to all of Tennessee and to parts of six other states covering over 80,000 square miles and serving eight million consumers. The bulk of TVA's power sales are made through municipal and cooperative distributors, which in turn are responsible for delivering that power to every home, office and farm in the Valley. TVA has exclusive power contracts with its distributors and the three member TVA board sets the retail rates offered by distributors. TVA also has the authority to compete directly with distributors to make retail sales to large industrial customers. 
Mr. President, over the past 65 years, TVA has accumulated an enormous debt of nearly $28 billion, despite being a monopoly power provider. TVA is also carrying $6.3 billion in deferred assets that will eventually force electricity rates higher in the future. By deferring these charges, TVA's financing costs will continue to mount. I have real concerns about how this debt load will affect rates as well as the overall economic health of the region. 
In 1997, GAO found that TVA paid over 35 percent of its power revenue to servicing its debt. In other words, TVA pays an astronomical 35 cents of every $1 earned to interest. Compare that to a public utility which paid a mere 7 percent in finance costs. In a 1994 study, GAO found that 69 percent of TVA's total debt is tied to the nuclear facilities, yet they generated only 14 percent of TVA's total power production in 1994. This study concluded that TVA's financial condition `threatens its long-term viability and places the federal government at risk.' 
Only through years of unaccountability and fiscal irresponsibility could a power company have ever reached this level of debt despite the fact that TVA is a monopoly provider of electricity. Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that TVA needs to be made more accountable for their actions. Not more accountable to Congress or the President, but the people they were charged to serve--the TVA customers. 
Mr. President, it is my desire to provide TVA customers with a clear picture of TVA's financial situation including TVA's rates, charges and costs. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is authorized under the Federal Power Act with regulating electric utilities. 
FERC provides regulatory oversight to over 200 utilities for wholesale and transmission power rates to ensure that their electric rates and charges are `just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.' At present, TVA is entirely exempt from these necessary regulations allowing it to operate as a self-regulating monopoly, with no such mandate for openness fairness or oversight. 
Requiring TVA to comply with FERC regulations will serve two purposes. First, it will allow customers to accurately evaluate TVA's wholesale and transmission pricing and terms to ensure the rates charged are `just and reasonable' and to provide customers with a forum for challenging future rate increases just as every other regulated utility does. 
Second, this information will provide FERC with a better understanding of the stranded costs TVA has accumulated. Understanding the full scope of these costs will be critical in an open transmission and wholesale market. It will also have a significant impact in determining how competitive TVA will be in the future. 
Last year, former FERC Chair Elizabeth Moler testified before the Senate Energy Committee regarding nationwide open access in the transmission and wholesale markets. She stated that, `like Swiss cheese, nationwide open access has some holes. Federal legislation is necessary to fill in these holes.' It was her belief that TVA's large transmission system must be included within FERC's open access program. 
Recently, I read an article written by Carlos Smith, the General Counsel to TVPPA, an association which represents TVA distributors. Mr. Smith made the case that investor-owned utilities should be regulated, `because only in this way can the 
captive ratepayers learn the underlying basis for the retail utility rates and require justification for the charges made for services.' 
Mr. President, I wholeheartedly concur with Mr. Smith's conclusion that ratepayers, including the distributors Mr. Smith represents, should know what their rates are based on and have a justification for such rates. Further, ratepayers should be able to challenge, through FERC, any rate increase they find unreasonable. 
Mr. President, let me point out one very important provision in this legislation. I have included a provision that makes it explicitly clear that nothing in this bill would change the law applying to TVA distributors. Unlike TVA, distributors are directly accountable to the customers they serve. Cooperatives, for example, are operated by a board elected by the customers to represent their own member interests. I don't believe we need to change this policy, except to make TVA more accountable to the people they serve. 
Mr. President, I expect TVA to complain that this legislation somehow treats them unfairly. They will attempt to blame me for unfairly burdening them with new accountability standards and claim that a rate increase will be a direct result. 
Mr. President, I don't believe Valley residents will be fooled by TVA's rhetoric when they recall TVA's track record. It's hard to argue that the TVA Board has kept ratepayers' interests foremost in mind as they ran up $28 billion in debt, while serving a captive customer base. It's hard to argue it was in the ratepayers' interest to try to hide million dollar bonuses to a select cadre of high level staff. It is hard to argue that it was in the ratepayers' interest to zero out all federal appropriations, which could add millions to TVA's annual operating costs. 
Mr. President, I have carefully compared the rates of regulated utilities in Kentucky against TVA's rates to determine if applying these regulations would drive rates higher. Much to my surprise, I have found that not only are regulated utilities rates very competitive, but lower than rates offered by TVA. This confirms my assumption that the underlying financial health of TVA--and its $28 billion debt--has a far greater impact on its electric rates than any other factor.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the recognition of Trace Die Cast of Bowling Green, Kentucky as the 1997 Industry of the Year by the Bowling Green Area Chamber of Commerce. 
When Trace Die Cast started operations in 1987, it employed 24 Kentuckians. In the 12 years since, the company has undertaken two major plant expansions and now employs 170 individuals, with an annual payroll of $4.6 million. They continue to be well-positioned for future growth in Warren County. 
In the last decade, Trace Die Cast has become a major supplier of parts for some of America's favorite automobiles, including the Ford Explorer. 
Trace Die Cast's role as a community leader is also well-known, especially their enterprising approach to employee education. They have important partnerships with local vocational schools to train their employees. They also provide scholarships for their employees who want to continue their education. Throughout their existence in Bowling Green, Trace Die Cast has contributed both time and money unselfishly and generously to local charities and civic organizations. 
Mr. President, local leaders in Bowling Green have described Trace Die Cast as a community's dream company. I could not agree more. They are a tribute to the American spirit, and I am proud to have such a company in my state. I congratulate them on this honor and ask all my colleagues to join me in celebrating their accomplishments.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President I have come to the floor today to introduce a bill known as the Land Between the Lakes Protection Act. Land Between the Lakes is a national treasure that must be protected. It is visited by more than 2 million tourists a year who enjoy its natural beauty, whether by camping, fishing, hunting, or just taking a long hike with the family. 
That's why, after studying this issue for over a year, we have drafted a bill to ensure that the LBL, which so many Kentuckians enjoy today, will be there for them--unchanged--tomorrow. 
As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, my top priority has been to provide LBL the money it needs to operate--including $6.9 million last year. I remain committed to providing that funding to ensure that LBL remains a national treasure just like Mammoth Cave or Daniel Boone National Forest. 
But because of TVA Chairman Craven Crowell's harmful and ill-considered request last year to zero-out LBL's funding, it may be that Congress will deny funding to TVA's non-power budget this year. Because of this reality, LBL needs a safety net. That's what this bill is--a safety net. 
If Congress decides to fund TVA then TVA will remain LBL's steward. If TVA is denied funding, my bill will safely and seamlessly transition LBL to a less controversial steward without interrupting the myriad of recreational activities that millions of visitors have come to enjoy every year. 
There may be some who want to gamble everything on TVA receiving its appropriation. But I believe LBL is far too precious for such an all or nothing gambit. That's why our bill provides for both contingencies. 
Mr. President, let me take a moment to explain some of the provisions I have included in this legislation based on the input I have received from area residents, and those who enjoy LBL. The goal of this bill is to ensure that the day to day operations of LBL remain the same for its visitors. Therefore, this bill codifies LBL's 1972 mission statement and ensures that the Forest Service continues to manage LBL for multiple use with a focus on recreation, conservation and environmental education. 
This legislation also gives the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service the authority to assist the Forest Service in managing the wildlife populations and educating visitors on the unique species at LBL, with an emphasis on endangered species, like the American bald eagle. LBL is home to over 100 eagles. 
One of the most important aspects of this bill is the creation of a 17-member citizen advisory board that will assist the Forest Service in establishing a management plan at LBL. I believe this will ensure that LBL managers are more responsive to the local concerns about development at LBL. This will ensure that proposals like the `Five Concepts' proposed by TVA in 1995 will never be considered again. 
We have given the authority to Federal, State and local officials to appoint the members to the board. While the board will represent a variety of interests, I am confident that each will have the best intentions for LBL foremost in mind. 
The Secretary will appoint 4 individuals, two from each state. The Governors from Kentucky and Tennessee will each nominate two individuals from their state. The Kentucky and Tennessee Fish and Wildlife Commissioners will each nominate 1 person. The Land Between the Lakes Association, which is a non-profit organization that operates the gift shops, planetarium and welcome stations at LBL, will nominate one individual. The County Judge Executives from each of the three counties, which make up LBL will each nominate two individuals. 
This bill also protects existing TVA payments to counties, and increases federal payments in lieu of taxes. This will ensure that county schools and county services are not negatively impacted. 
This bill creates a $5 million trust fund to be used for internships, education grants, and regional economic and tourism promotion. 
Finally, the bill also seeks to minimize any disruption to the employees working at LBL. We have sought to ensure that all eligible benefits provided to an employee will not be diminished or lost as a result of transferring this facility. This bill also provides a generous severance package based on a previous downsizing package offered by TVA. 
Mr. President, we are rapidly nearing the end of the fiscal year and we need to ensure that this safety net is available if TVA doesn't receive sufficient funding. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate, Republican and Democrat alike, putting aside politics and doing right by all those who treasure LBL. 
Finally, I want to thank the hundreds of Kentuckians who have worked so closely with us in drafting this bill. I believe the plan we have arrived at together will help secure LBL's future for a long, long time.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary career of Mr. Anthony Higdon, who retired last month after 41 years of service to his country and the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky as a member of the U.S. Air Force and as an employee of the Social Security Administration . 
After four years in the Air Force, Mr. Higdon spent the last 37 years working for the Social Security Administration, serving the needs of Kentucky's senior citizens. His career included 20 years as manager of the 3 Social Security offices in Louisville. Before that, he served in other capacities in the Louisville offices, as well as at the Social Security branches in Elizabethtown, Hazard and Hopkinsville, Kentucky. 
One of Mr. Higdon's most important legacy will be his tireless work with national and community leaders in Kentucky to impress upon them an understanding of the dramatic importance of Social Security programs to all people throughout their lives. 
Mr. President, Anthony Higdon will be sorely missed by all his friends and colleagues at the Social Security Administration offices across the Commonwealth of Kentucky. As he retires to the community which he has spent most of his life serving, we wish him best of luck and thank him for his service.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 50 years ago this month, the University of Kentucky accomplished a feat still unmatched in college basketball history. As every backyard all-star in the Commonwealth can tell you, that was the year of the original Fabulous Five. 
You see in Kentucky, we have a habit of naming our most special Wildcat teams, and 1948 may have been the most special of the bunch. That group, led by Alex Groza, Ralph Beard and Wah Wah Jones not only earned Kentucky's first NCAA men's college basketball championship trophy but went on to bring home a gold medal from the 1948 Olympics. 
Flash forward Fifty years into the future, to see another edition of the Wildcats, and equally high expectations. Led by seniors Jeff Sheppard, Allen Edwards, and Cameron Mills, the 1998 Cats came into the season facing an uncertain future. While expectations are always high at Kentucky, this year's squad exceeded even the most optimistic fan's hopes. 
Under the expert leadership of first-year head coach, Tubby Smith, these Wildcats will be raising the school's 7th NCAA championship banner to the rafters of Rupp Arena. But Mr. President, there is so much more to this story than wins and losses. 
While the '48 team was appropriately known as the Fab Five, this year's national champions will go down in Wildcat history as maybe the most perfect embodiment of the word `team' in Kentucky's legacy of excellence. Time after time when the odds seemed insurmountable this team willed itself to victory. 
A quick review of the final three games of this year's tournament reveals the heart of a lion. Down 17 points with less than 10 minutes to play against a Duke squad that had been ranked #1 for most of the year, the Comeback Cats put together a frenzied charge, outscoring the Blue Devils 17 - 1 during a crucial stretch. What made the feat all the more impressive was that every player contributed. 
In the Final Four, the Cats squared off against the Stanford Cardinal, the West Coast power that spent the majority of the season undefeated. Down by 5 at half, the Cats did what was natural for them, they put together a rally, eventually winning the contest in overtime. This victory was fueled by one of the most gritty performances in Final Four history, as senior Jeff Sheppard poured in 27 of the Cats 74 points. 
What could top this effort in the finals? How about the greatest come-from-behind victory in the history of the NCAA championship. Down 10 at the half, and 12 early in the second half, this selfless group of young men redoubled their efforts and chipped away at the Utah lead. Steadily the tide began to shift behind three point baskets from Heshimu Evans, and Kentucky natives Cameron Mills and Scott Padgett. Refusing to wilt under the pressure of facing the hottest team in the nation, Kentucky hammered away defensively and converted on the offensive end. In the end, Utah's game effort was not enough and the Cats posted a 78 - 69 victory in seizing their second national title in three years. 
In what has become habit for the Comeback Cats, the team drew on its strengths and refused to panic. Under the masterful eye of Coach Smith and the intelligent play of a host of stars, the team accomplished its dream of bringing home the title. 
So, Mr. President, while we look back fondly on the Fabulous Five of 1948, I am content to take senior Jeff Sheppard's advice to `appreciate the precious present,' and embrace these Comeback Cats as the greatest `team' to ever put on the Kentucky uniform. It is impossible to appreciate the intensity and effort these young men put forth as they met and exceeded every challenge in their path during the 1997-98 season. 
Mr. President, I ask each of my colleagues to join me in honoring the University of Kentucky, history-making coach Tubby Smith, athletic director C. M. Newton, and most importantly each and every talented player on the 1998 Championship Wildcat team.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President: I rise today to recognize basketball excellence. As you may know, basketball is a way of life in Kentucky. While people are most familiar with Kentucky's two Divison IA schools, our state also has its share of small schools that do not always receive the recognition they are due. It is one of those schools that I want to recognize today: the 1998 National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics Basketball Champions: the Tigers of Georgetown College, located in the town of Georgetown, Kentucky. 
On March 23, led by NAIA first team All-America sophomore center Will Carlton, Georgetown defeated Southern Nazarene College 83-69 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. After a roller coaster first half that included a thirteen point deficit, Georgetown took a one point lead into the locker room at halftime. Midway through the second half, the Tigers exploded for 17-2 run fueled by Carlton and teammate Barry Bowman, who combined for 15 of those 17 points. During the penultimate run, the offense of Carlton and Bowman was supported by solid defense that held Southern Nazarene to only two free throws in the six and a half minutes. 
This national title is the first in Georgetown College basketball history. Having lost in the finals on two previous occasions--1961 and 1996--these Tigers, led by coach Happy Osborne finished their dream season with a record of 36-3. They steadily improved their play throughout the tournament, symbolized by their cutting their turnovers from 30 in the first round to only nine in the final. 
While this National Championship was the result of a total team effort, it is worth noting that Carlton, a sophomore, and Bowman, a junior, were joined by senior David Shee on the all- tournament team. After averaging nearly 22 points and 12 rebounds in the tournament, Carlton received the Chuck Taylor Most Valuable Player Award for the tournament. 
Mr. President, I congratulate Coach Osborne and his team on a marvelous season culminating in this NAIA National Championship, their version of March Madness. And with most of these Tigers expected to return next year, I look forward to Georgetown successfully defending their crown next year.

Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Idaho and thank him as well for his considerable involvement in this discussion, which led to the final amendment that we have before us. 
In addition, Senator Bennett and Senator Faircloth were also involved in these discussions, and, of course, the usual and valuable contribution of the ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Leahy. 
I believe we have produced a tough but fair bill. This bill would change the way IMF does business. 
Let me offer some brief highlights of the reforms which we have agreed upon. This bill appropriates funds for the IMF's emergency facility, the new arrangements to borrow without any restrictions, just as the Senate did, I might add, in the last year, in fiscal year 1998. However, for the new subscription to the IMF, the U.S. funding of the $14.5 billion quota cannot be released--I repeat, cannot be released--unless the Secretary certifies that the group of seven nations have publicly committed and are working toward changing the IMF's lending policies. 
The conditions which we expect to see included in future loans tackled the systemic problems which caused the Asian crisis. The bill sets out the two conditions for future IMF agreements. 
First, borrowers will have to comply with their international trade obligations and liberalize trade restrictions. Monopolies, protected tariffs for family or friendly enterprises, and off-budget accounts each have contributed to financial weaknesses and collapse in Asia. This legislation will ensure that the IMF meets those problems head on before sinking funds into a troubled economy. 
Just as important, the bill attacks phony capitalism. Economies in trouble are often economies which have experienced chronic government manipulation and intervention where ministries subsidize favored individuals or enterprises. As a matter of routine, this bill expects market-distorting subsidies and government-directed lending to good friends rather than good business partners to come to an end. 
In addition to setting new conditions for IMF lending, we have improved accountability and transparency in fund operations. Senator Helms was deeply concerned about the General Accounting Office having access to the IMF decisionmaking process. I believe we have not only addressed this issue, but have also taken a step in the right direction in terms of expanding public access and involvement. 
Public access is a problem that Senator Leahy has drawn attention to for some years, so I especially appreciate his help in moving this bill in the right direction on that issue. As I pointed out in markup back in committee, Treasury only produces reforms and results when Congress requires action in law. While Treasury and the administration would have preferred a blank check, that would have been both unwise as well as unachievable. It was not possible to fund the NAB and Quota now and hope for reforms down the road. Not one of my colleagues was willing to support $18 billion with no strings attached at all. 
While the crisis in the Pacific has created a sense of alarm and generated an urgency to passing this bill, I hope everyone understands that not one dime--not one dime of this money is planned for Asia. These funds are being appropriated to take care of some unknown country at some unknown time for unknown purposes. After today, however, what we will know is that IMF lending practices will, in fact, improve. We will know that U.S. resources will not be wasted on corrupt governments. We will know we are not going to subsidize unfair trading practices. In sum, we will know we have permanently and substantially changed the way IMF does business. 
Mr. President, that completes my statement. I am going to yield the floor here momentarily. I see my good friend from Nebraska, Senator Hagel, here. No one has spent more time on this complex question than the distinguished Senator from Nebraska. He has brought to this his usual intellect and energy and has been a very important part of working all this out in a way that I believe is going to improve the way IMF does business in the future. 
So with that I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr.President, I come to the floor today to support legislation that addresses an important issue facing American families today--the education of their children. An area of particular interest to me has always been making a college education more affordable. For the past several years, I have introduced legislation to provide tax incentives to families who save for college. 
I have not been alone in my efforts to give parents more flexibility to choose the school which is best for their child and make those decisions more affordable. Under the leadership of the 105th Congress, there has been a strong focus on education. My colleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, has championed the cause by introducing legislation which would increase the amount families can save for elementary and secondary education in an education IRA. I also want to commend Senator Roth, the Chairman of the Finance Committee, who has worked tirelessly to help all Americans save more for their retirement. I want to thank the Chairman for his support of these education savings initiatives, especially his support of the state-sponsored savings and pre-paid programs. 
Mr. President, anyone with a child in college knows first-hand the expense of higher education. The GAO has also confirmed the astronomical increase in college costs. According to GAO, tuition at a four-year university rose 234 percent between 1980-1994, while median household income rose only 84 percent and the consumer price index rose a mere 74 percent. A similar study conducted by the College Board found that tuition and fees for a four-year public university rose 100.3 percent from 1987-1997, while median household income rose only 34.5 percent. Throughout the 1990's, education costs have continually outstripped the gains in income. Tuition rates have now become the greatest obstacle students face in attending college. 
Due to the high cost of education, more and more families have come to rely on financial aid to meet tuition costs. In fact, a majority of all college students utilize some amount of financial assistance. In 1995, $50 billion in financial aid was available to students from federal, state, and institutional sources. This was $3 billion higher than the previous year. A majority of this increase was in the form of loans, which now make up the largest portion of the total federal-aid package at 57 percent. Grants, which a decade ago made up 49 percent of assistance, have been reduced to 42 percent. This shift toward loans further burdens students and families with additional interest costs. 
This legislation is a serious effort to support long-term saving. It is important that we not forget that compound interest cuts both ways. By saving, participants can keep pace with tuition increases while putting a little away at a time. By borrowing, students must bear added interest costs that add thousands to the total cost of tuition. Savings will have a positive impact, by reducing the need for students to borrow tens of thousands of dollars in student loans. This will help make need-based grants, which target low-income families, go much further. 
This legislation also recognizes the leadership that states have provided in helping families save for college. In the mid-1980s, states identified the difficulty families had in keeping pace with the rising cost of education. States like Kentucky, Florida, Ohio, and Michigan were the first to start programs in order to help families save for college. Nationwide more than 30 states have established savings programs, and over a dozen states are preparing to implement plans in the near future. Today, there are nearly one million savers who have contributed over $3 billion in education savings. The provision which I authored, which allows tax-free education savings in state-sponsored savings plans for education purposes, provides a $1.5 billion tax break for middle-class savers nationwide. In Kentucky, over 2,700 families have established accounts, which amount to about $6.4 million in savings 
Mr. President, many Kentuckians are drawn to this program because it offers a low-cost, disciplined approach to savings. In fact, the average monthly contribution in Kentucky is just $52. It is also important to note that 58 percent of the participants earn under $60,000 per year. By exempting all interest earnings from state taxes, this proposal rewards parents who are serious about their children's future and who are committed over the long-term to the education of their children. Clearly, this benefits middle-class families. 
In 1994, I introduced the first bill to make education savings exempt from taxation. Since then I have won a couple of battles, but I still haven't won the war. To win the war Congress needs to make education savings tax free--from start to finish. The bill we are considering today will do that. In 1996, Congress took the first step in providing tax relief to families investing in these programs. In the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, I was able to include a provision that clarified the tax treatment of state-sponsored savings plans and the participants' investment. This measure put an end to the tax uncertainty that has hampered the effectiveness of these state-sponsored programs and helped families who are trying to save for their children's' education. 
In 1997, the Job Protection Act expanded the definition of `qualified education costs' to include room and board, thus doubling the amount families could save tax-free. In Kentucky, room and board at a public institution make up half of all college costs. 
Already, we can see the result of the tax reforms in the 105th Congress. In 1996, Virginia started its plan and was overwhelmed by the positive response. In its first year, the plan sold 16,111 contracts raising $260 million. This success exceeded all goals for this program. While we made important gains, we need to finish what we have already started and fully exempt the investment income from taxation. 
Last month, the Finance Committee approved legislation, sponsored by Senator Coverdell and Senator Torricelli, which would allow parents to place as much as $2,000 per year, per child, in an education savings account for kindergarten through high school education. I am proud to join several of my distinguished colleagues to support the A+ Education Savings Accounts Act. I believe this measure will continue the Republican effort to move the money and decision-making authority out of Washington and back where it belongs, at home with parents and their locally-elected school boards. 
As revised by the Finance Committee, these after-tax, non-government dollars would earn tax-free interest and could be used for expenses and tuition associated with any school from kindergarten through high schools. Under this plan, parents, grandparents, and scholarship sponsors may contribute up to $2,000 a year per child. The buildup of interest within the account is tax free if used for the student's education. For students who attend private or religious schools, money can be withdrawn from an A+ Account to pay for tuition. For those who attend public school, this money can be used for after-school tutoring, any transportation expenses, or to purchase a home computer. Moreover, parents of special needs children could use this money for lifelong education expenses, including tutoring, occupational therapy, vocational training, and skill development for independent living. As you can see, this program is targeted to provide for the educational needs of all Americans. 
The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that more than 10 million families with children in public schools will take advantage of these accounts. Moreover, it has said that 70 percent of the tax benefit will go to the families with annual incomes of $75,000 and less. 
Last year, the Coverdell-Torricelli initiative passed the House and received 56 votes in this Senate. It is in our best interest as a nation to maintain a quality and affordable education system for everyone. We need to decide on how we will redirect families' resources in order to enable them to use their education dollars most effectively. We can help families make their money count in a meaningful way for their children's education by ensuring that they have choices. At a modest cost, we can help families help themselves by rewarding savings. This will reduce the cost of education and will not necessarily burden future generations with thousands of dollars in loans. 
I urge my colleagues to support this valuable legislation this year to reward those who save in order to provide a college education for their children.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today marks another milestone in the extraordinarily successful tenure of my friend and colleague from Kentucky, Wendell Ford. He becomes the longest serving Senator in Kentucky history. I remember well when Senator Ford got his start; I was in law school at the University of Kentucky. I remember reading a story about a State Senate primary in Owensboro, KY, in which the Senate majority leader of the Kentucky State Senate was upset in the primary by an impressive young man named Wendell Ford, who had been involved in politics some time and had been in fact national president of the Jaycees. 
Then in my senior year in law school, I remember this young State senator, who obviously didn't want to stay in the State senate too long, running for Lieutenant Governor and defeating the attorney general of Kentucky in that primary. 
Then that November, an unusual thing happened in Kentucky--they elected a Republican Governor. It has not happened since. It is a fairly rare occurrence in our State. But State Senator Wendell Ford was elected Lieutenant Governor, so he beat one of those rare Republican tides in our State. 
Then, as if that were not enough, 4 years later everybody in Kentucky thought that former Gov. Bert Combs, who subsequently had a distinguished career as a U.S. court of appeals judge, was a lead pipe cinch to be the next Governor of Kentucky and at the very least to win the Democratic primary. But Lt. Gov. Wendell Ford defeated, against everybody's expectations, former Governor Combs in the primary, and the rest is, as they say, history. 
He came to the Senate, beating a Republican incumbent in 1974, and is into the final days of his fourth term. He has served Kentucky long and well, having had an extraordinarily successful public career. I join with all of my colleagues in congratulating him for his not only lengthy service but his excellent service on behalf of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the people of the United States. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to say to my good friend from Utah--I think Members of the Senate already know this--no one, no one in the Senate, has more articulately and persuasively defended the right of American citizens to participate in the political process, which is a constitutional right in this country; no one has more articulately been involved and persuasively been involved in an effort to stop misguided efforts to put the Government in charge of the political speech of individuals and groups, candidates, and parties than has the Senator from Utah. 
But what he has done today is provide for the Senate and for the public a clear summary of the illegal activities of the current administration. The Senator from Utah has reminded everyone that it is against the law now for foreigners to contribute to American elections, for money laundering to be engaged in, and for money to be raised on Federal property. 
So the Senator from Utah has done far and away the best summary of the activities of this administration going back to 1992 which either crossed the line or skirted the edge and has been lost in the sort of numbers of different occurrences. 
So what the Senator from Utah has done is cut through all of this, summarize it, and give the Senate and the American public a clear indication of the sleaze factor that has ranked so high in this administration from the beginning to the end. 
So I thank the Senator from Utah. I think it is the most important speech that I have heard in the Senate in many, many years. He has made an important contribution in this area, and I appreciate the opportunity to be here on the Senate floor and to have an opportunity to hear this important speech. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say briefly that this amendment is simple, fair and noncontroversial, as evidenced by the fact that my colleagues have signed off on it. 
It says two things: 
First, no State or local transit authority will lose its ISTEA funding simply because it suspends the DBE Program in response to a court order declaring the program unconstitutional. 
Second, my amendment asks GAO to study the program and lets Congress know how the program is working to ensure it genuinely helps disadvantaged women and minorities. 
Even though ISTEA and the DBE program were declared unconstitutional last summer by the federal court in Colorado, this legislative body chose to reauthorize the program because the Secretary of Transportation and the Attorney General promised us that any possible problems with the program had been cleaned up under the new proposed regulations. 
The Senate accepted the Secretary and the Attorney General at their word. As my good friend and respected colleague from New Mexico stated on the floor last Thursday night: 
I say to the administration very clearly right now: You have now put the signature of the Attorney General of the United States and the Secretary of [Transportation] on the answer to . . . seven questions [about the constitutionality of this program]. And this Senator, and I think a number of other Senators, is going to be voting to keep the provisions in the bill based on these kinds of assurances. . . . If, in fact, it comes out in a few months that the regulations are not being interpreted in the way suggested here, then I assure you that we will change them. . . . This better become a very, very, serious challenge to the administration as they finally implemented this program. 
I appreciate the candor of my friend, Mr. Domenici. Consistent with that candor and with that challenge, my amendment simply says that the Senate is taking the administration at its word. 
And, if for any reason, the program is not fixed, and more courts strike down the program, then my amendment ensures that we will not punish the States for complying with federal court orders.

What it did do was lay out a standard which this provision of the bill couldn't possibly meet and sent it back to the district court in Colorado, which found that this section of ISTEA was unconstitutional. 
We could argue this round and round and round, and we have argued it round and round and round. But I don't think there are serious constitutional scholars who believe that the Adarand case didn't set up a standard that this section of the bill could not possibly meet.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of my amendment to bring the federal highway bill into compliance with the equal protection clause of the Constitution and with various federal court rulings, including two landmark Supreme Court cases. 
The question for the Senate this morning is this: Is it fair, prudent and constitutional for the Federal Government to set-aside a fixed percentage of public highway contracts for a preferred group of citizens--until the year 2004, mind you--based on the immutable traits of race and gender? 
Or let me phrase it another way: Should U.S. Senators, all of whom have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution, reauthorize a law that has been reviewed by the United States Supreme Court and subsequently struck down by a Federal court in Colorado? 
Mr. President, I say the answer to this question must be a firm and resounding `no.' 
We must stand up for the Constitution. We must guarantee the equal protection of the laws to every citizen of our country, without regard to race and gender. 
We must follow the clear decisions of the Supreme Court, including Adarand and Croson, and the decisions of the court of appeals for the third circuit, the fourth circuit, the fifth circuit, the sixth circuit, the seventh circuit, the ninth circuit, the eleventh circuit and the DC circuit. All of them have struck down race-based programs in the past few years--all of them. 
We must take heed of unambiguous rulings of lower courts in Georgia, Connecticut, Ohio, Louisiana, Michigan, and, most importantly, in Colorado. 
Let me remind my colleagues that less than 9 months ago the Federal district court in Colorado followed the Supreme Court's lead in Adarand and Croson and ruled--and I quote: 
Section 1003(b) of ISTEA and the regulations promulgated thereunder are unconstitutional. 
I do not know when this body will ever have a clearer decision than this one. The administration and the Department of Transportation have tried to obscure this clarity with three or four predictable diversionary tactics. 
Diversionary tactic No. 1: Ignore the court decisions. The first diversionary tactic is simply to ignore all the cases I have just cited, claim that Adarand never happened or simply claim that Adarand was wrongly decided or that it is just one decision by one court. 
Well, I have quoted Adarand directly and pointed out, with great detail, that Adarand is not an aberration--not an aberration, Mr. President. Again, I quote the Congressional Research Service. The Adarand decision--this is from CRS--`largely conforms to a pattern of federal rulings which have invalidated state and local governmental programs to promote minority contracting--in: Richmond, San Francisco, San Diego, Dade County, Fla., Atlanta, New Orleans, Columbus, Ohio, [the State of] Louisiana, and Michigan, among others--and new challenges continue to be filed [probably as we speak].' 
For those who say that Adarand is just not enough for us to go on, let me cite yet another Supreme Court case, Richmond v. Croson from 1989. In that case, the Government decided that minorities were underrepresented in the public construction arena. So the Government enacted a law like ISTEA that said: not less than 30 percent of construction dollars must be allocated to officially preferred--this is officially preferred--minority groups. 
And you know what the Supreme Court said about the so-called `30 percent goal'? The Supreme Court said that this `goal' was `an unyielding racial quota.' It was a quota, even though the Government plan had a waiver process to supposedly let you out of the quota in certain circumstances. 
Let me quote the United States Supreme Court when it applied 
the `strict scrutiny' test to a set-aside that is virtually identical to the DBE that we have been talking about the last 2 days, the DBE set-aside in ISTEA. The Court said: 
We, therefore, hold that the city has failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in apportioning public contracting opportunities on the basis of race. To accept the city's claim that past societal discrimination alone can serve as the basis for rigid racial preferences would be to open the door to competing claims for `remedial relief' for every disadvantaged group. The dream of a Nation of equal citizens in a society where race is irrelevant to personal opportunity and achievement would be lost in a mosaic of shifting preferences based on inherently unmeasurable claims of past wrongs. . . . We think such a result would be contrary to both the letter and spirit of a constitutional provision whose central command is equality. 
Diversionary tactic No. 2: `We've changed the law,' they say, `by tinkering with the regulations.' 
When ignoring the Court fails, then someone suggests and the administration claims that they have simply changed an unconstitutional statute by simply tinkering with the regulations. But let me point out that the DOT has no new regulations. All we have from DOT is a promise to do better. And the Senate is apparently going to turn a blind eye to the equal protection clause of the Constitution and authorize a $17 billion quota on the mere promise--the mere promise--of cleaning up the program. 
Does that fact not strike any other Member of this Senate as being a bit odd? I hope it does. 
These new regulations are only in the `proposal' stage. We do not know what they will end up looking like. We do not know if they will make the program better or worse, constitutional or unconstitutional. Even DOT does not know what the new regs will look like. 
For example, my colleagues argued yesterday that the proposed regulations would narrowly tailor the program because they would include an economic cap on DBEs. My colleague from Montana argued yesterday that our problems are solved because the new regulations will exclude the Sultan of Brunei--the wealthiest monarch in the world--from the Disadvantaged Business Program. The sultan will not be anywhere near the DBE program, my good friends argue. 
Well, last night I took a close look at the proposed regulations to see what the economic cap would be. And you know what I found? Let me read to you word for word the exact language of the so-called narrowly tailoring economic cap. 
You may require the individual whose disadvantage is being questioned to provide information about his or her personal net worth. 
But the proposed rule goes on to say: 
You may require only such information as is necessary to establish whether the individual's personal worth exceeds [blank]. 
They have not decided yet how poor you have to be. 
So what is the economic cap? We have no idea. Will there be an economic cap at all? We are told there will be, but it has not been provided yet. DOT apparently does not know. So let me say, I do not know whether the Sultan of Brunei will be excluded or not. The proposed regs do not tell where this narrowly tailored economic cutoff is. 
But, Mr. President, even if the cap excludes the sultan--and this is what I hope everybody will remember--even if the cap excludes the sultan, it still will not solve the narrowly tailored problem. You know why? Because even if you solve the `economic' problem, you have still not solved the `race' problem. The Supreme Court and the district court did not focus on the `economic,' but rather the `race' issue. 
Changing the economic guidelines does not change the fact that the DOT will still presume that all members of certain races are `socially disadvantaged' and need preferences. In other words, the proposed regulations do nothing to solve the most serious problem, which is that ISTEA will continue to make presumptions and 
decisions based on race, without any particular findings of discrimination against particular individuals or even particular groups in the highway contracting area. 
So even if the new regs exclude the sultan economically, everyone will be relieved to know that other persons from Brunei will still be `presumed' to be socially disadvantaged and get preferences, even though no State DOT agency has ever engaged in a pervasive pattern of discrimination against persons from Brunei or from Tonga or Micronesia or the Maldive Islands. Never heard of such a case, but these people are all, by Government fiat, put into the class for preferential treatment. 
In the words of the district court in Adarand:  
It [is] difficult to envisage a race-based classification that is narrowly tailored. By its very nature, such a program is both underinclusive and overinclusive. This seemingly contradictory result suggests that the criteria are lacking in substance as well as in reason. 
Or as the Supreme Court held in Croson, a program is unconstitutional where `a successful black, Hispanic, or Oriental entrepreneur from anywhere in the country enjoys an absolute preference over other citizens based solely on their race. We think it obvious that such a program is not narrowly tailored to remedy the effects of prior discrimination.' 
Mr. President, let me conclude this particular point by reminding every Senator that Adarand and Croson are landmark Supreme Court decisions that are now the law of the land. The administration's attempt to comply with the law of the land has been to merely do a little DOT song-and-dance by playing with transportation regulations, not changing any regulations, mind you, but simply proposing them--proposing them. 
Mr. President, complying with a landmark Supreme Court case requires much more than a mere `tinkering' with the regs.

Mr. McCONNELL. Diversionary tactic No. 3, Mr. President: It is said that `10 percent is a goal, not a quota.' 
When all else fails, the final diversionary tactic is to argue that the DBE program is a program with goals, not quotas. In fact, some of my colleagues have gone to great lengths to point out that the 10 percent set-aside is merely a goal with no sanctions whatsoever. 
Well, let us look at the DBE manual--right out of the manual. This manual is the DBE law of the land for States that receive ISTEA money. The DBE manual explains that failure to comply with the requirements will result in sanctions. Let me quote: 
If the [Federal Highway] Administrator determines that a State has violated or failed to comply with the Federal laws or the regulations . . . with respect to a project, he may withhold payment to the State of Federal funds on account of such project, withhold approval of further projects in the State, and take such other action that he deems appropriate under the circumstances, until compliance or remedial action has been accomplished by the State to the satisfaction of the Administrator. 
In other words, there are sanctions. These same threats appear in the actual ISTEA contracts and in the Federal transportation regulations. 
Now that I have spelled out that the threat of DBE sanctions are serious and real, I am sure my colleagues will respond by saying, `OK, sure we list sanctions, but we never use them. So 10 percent is still just a goal. It's not a quota.' The reasoning here is that the Government must punish someone before the `goal' becomes a `quota' or a `requirement.' 
Well, first, let me say that the threat of losing millions of Federal highway dollars is plenty of incentive for the States to enforce the quota requirement. When the Federal Government is wielding that kind of weapon from on high, it does not have to punish them. A 10 percent quota is still a quota, even if States always comply and no one is formally punished. 
Second, if you think the quota is never enforced, just ask two cities in New Mexico. The Senator from New Mexico and I were having a discussion about this issue on the floor just yesterday. Both the city of Rio Rancho and the City of Albuquerque were sued in Federal court over the use of ISTEA's racial quotas. What did the Federal Department of Transportation do? Did it simply call Rio Rancho and Albuquerque and say, `Hey, don't worry about the whole 10 percent thing. It's just a goal'? 
That is not what happened, Mr. President. Both Rio Rancho and Albuquerque had to sue the Department of Transportation and Secretary Slater in Federal court to stop the quota enforcement. In the complaint that the cities filed they said: 
The [Department of Transportation] is placing facially unconstitutional conditions upon the receipt of discretionary federal funds to which the City would otherwise be entitled to, and has caused or is likely to cause irreparable injury for which the City has no adequate remedy at law. 
So both Rio Rancho and Albuquerque sought a court judgment that would require the Department of Transportation to justify or eliminate the quotas and pay any and all damages and attorney fees to the cities. 
And the Federal judge was perfectly clear in declaring that the race-based programs were unconstitutional. In the words of the judge: 
It doesn't really take a first-year law student to say, City of Rio Rancho, don't do this again. I mean, you're going to get sued again. 
This is from the court case. 
Unfortunately, the city of Rio Rancho, like every other city that receives any ISTEA funds, has little choice in the matter. ISTEA requires racial preferences. And if you are going to get out of the quota requirement, you had better be prepared to go through hell, high water, and the Federal courts. 
Surely, my colleagues would agree that a true `goal' would not require State and local governments to sue the Federal Department of Transportation in Federal court just to get the `goal' fixed. 
Let's turn to Houston. If Albuquerque and Rio Rancho don't prove that 10 percent is more than just a goal, then let's go from New Mexico over to Houston, TX. Let me share with you some comments included in the ISTEA committee report on the 6-month authorization bill in the House. These comments were part of a very detailed and astute statement made by several Republican House Members. 
In April 1996, a Federal court in Texas temporarily enjoined Houston's METRO transit authority from utilizing race or gender-based preferences in the selection or award of construction contracts--making it impossible for Houston to comply with the federally-approved DBE program. 
So, in response to the court's ruling, Houston designed a race-neutral program to provide assistance to economically disadvantaged small businesses. 
Very similar to what the McConnell amendment would provide, an opportunity for emerging business enterprises. 
The US Department of Transportation refused to recognize this alternative [race-neutral] program and withheld federal funding from METRO for nearly seventeen months. 
Seventeen months without Federal funds, all because Houston was complying with a court order, Mr. President--Houston was complying with a court order prohibiting preferences. I don't know about you, Mr. President, but that sounds like a sanction to me. It sounds like a lot more than mere goals. It sounds like quota enforcement to any rational person listening to what happened. 
The point here, Mr. President, is simple arithmetic: Goals plus requirements equal quotas--goals plus requirements equal quotas. The goals in ISTEA are not merely aspirational. The goals have requirements and the real threat of sanctions. 
Let me spell out a few human examples about how goals in theory are actually quotas in practice. The first example was mentioned by Senator Gorton yesterday here on the floor, the insightful story about a man named Frank Gurney from Spokane, WA. 
We have talked a lot about victims over the course of the last 2 days. Let's talk about some of the victims of this program. Just a couple of months ago, the head of Frank Gurney, Inc. mailed me a copy of yet another letter explaining how he lost yet another job because of the 10 percent quota. The rejection letter stated: 
I regret to inform you that although yours was the lowest guardrail quote that I received for the . . . project . . . I found it necessary to use the third lowest guardrail quote [the third lowest guardrail quote] in order to meet the DOT requirement of 10 percent DBE. 
Sorry, you are out of luck, even though you had the lowest bid. 
The rejection letter was dated October 27, 1997. So this is still going on. The letters started in 1981, about the time we first authorized the DBE Program, and are still continuing up to and including last year. We know these letters will continue being sent until at least 2004 under this bill, unless my amendment passes, which will be the next time we will have a chance to revisit this law, Mr. President. 
I will say a word about Michael Cornelius. If you think the ISTEA quota is only a goal, just ask Michael Cornelius. Mr. Cornelius' firm was denied a Government contract under ISTEA even though his bid was $3 million lower than the nearest competitor. Mr. Cornelius' bid was rejected because the Government felt the bid did not use enough minority- or women-owned contractors. In fact, the Cornelius bid proposed to subcontract 26.5 percent of the work to firms owned by minorities and women. Yet 26.5 percent was not enough in the world of goals. 
I listened yesterday to Senator Kennedy's example of women and minorities who, like Frank Gurney and Michael Cornelius, have been the victims of discrimination. I was moved by Senator Kennedy's stories, and with each of the two or three stories of discrimination that Senator Kennedy told, my instinct and my gut response was, `That's discrimination, and it is wrong.' 
But, Mr. President, do you know the difference between my stories and Senator Kennedy's stories? There is a critical difference. In Senator Kennedy's examples, the discrimination was wrong and the discrimination is prohibited by title VII and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
So the examples of discrimination that were being cited are against the law--now, a law not being contested by anyone, a law supported by virtually everyone I know back in the mid-1960s. 
In my examples, the discrimination was wrong but the discrimination is required. In my examples, the discrimination is wrong but the discrimination is required, Mr. President--required by Federal law, not just any Federal law, but the very Federal law that we are about to reauthorize right here in the U.S. Senate. 
How can anyone hear these examples and not conclude that what we are doing in ISTEA is dead wrong? It is wrong for the Cornelius family, it is wrong for the Gurney family, it is wrong for the preferred businesses who get the contracts, and, most importantly, it is wrong for our country. 
I don't care how many times you tinker with the regulations or how many times you say 10 percent is only a goal, you can't change the fact, Mr. President, that the Federal Government is requiring States and prime contractors to pick and choose subcontractors based on the immutable traits of race and of gender. There is no lawyer in the Senate and no lawyer anywhere in the United States that will ever convince me that this racial program is fair, prudent, or--most importantly--constitutional. 
In closing, let me say, regardless of the outcome of this morning's vote, I firmly believe that the principle underlying the 5th and 14th amendments will ultimately carry the day. It obviously will take a while. The principle is the simple yet powerful idea that every American should be seen as equal in the eyes of the law. I firmly believe, as Justice Scalia explained in Adarand, `Individuals who have been wronged by unlawful racial discrimination should be made whole; but under our Constitution there can be no such thing as either a creditor or debtor race. . . . In the eyes of the government, we are just one race here. It is American.' 
The courts and the American people understand this principle. Unfortunately, the Congress may be a bit behind. 
Mr. President, I'm greatly appreciative of my colleagues participating in this important debate on both sides. They are well meaning Senators who look at the same set of facts and reach a different conclusion, but the debate has come and gone, the sky has not fallen, the Capitol dome has not caved in. In fact, it is the opposite. I think this debate has been very positive and constructive. 
I end this debate as I began by asking one simple question: Should we place the Senate's seal of approval on a law that the Supreme Court has declared presumptively unconstitutional and the lower court has specifically struck down, without the Senate or House holding even one hearing after Adarand to determine if the law is narrowly tailored to remedy specific and persuasive discrimination? 
As a Member of this body, my duty and obligation to the Constitution, the courts, and individual citizens compels me to declare no, we should not reauthorize this law. We have had no hearings since Adarand to determine that this program or any of the 160 Federal programs of racial preference that have been identified by CRS have met the strict scrutiny standard. The tactic of the Clinton administration has been to delay, deny, divert, and obfuscate. The American people deserve better. 
Mr. President, I close with the words of the Weekly Standard:  
It won't do for a democratic country to lurch its way to colorblindness courtroom by courtroom, without the clear and resounding public debate an issue of such moment and principle demands. It won't do . . . to delay the prize of colorblindness, even for a moment, by silently ignoring the battle while it's waged. And, most basically, it won't do . . . to pretend that we don't understand what the Constitution says. 
Mr. President, How much time remains?

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce my amendment to bring the federal highway program into compliance with the Constitution and with the recent landmark case of Adarand versus Pena. 
According to the Congressional Research Service, the federal government currently runs approximately 160 preference programs that hand out jobs and contracts based on race and gender. Congress now has an historic opportunity to take a small step toward equal protection for all citizens by ending one of these 160 preference programs. 
As the Senate seeks to put a new transportation bill into play, we must allow the costly and divisive ISTEA quota to go into retirement. 
ISTEA mandates that `not less than 10 percent' of federal highway and transit funds be allocated to `disadvantaged business enterprises' (`DBEs'). Firms owned by officially designated minority groups are presumed to be `disadvantaged.' The government has placed the stamp of `disadvantage' on groups with origins ranging from Tonga to Micronesia to the Maldive Islands. 
And, Mr. President, what is the reward for these government-preferred firms? The reward is a $17.3 billion quota. In other words, if the government decides that you are the preferred race and gender, then you are able to compete for $17.3 billion of taxpayer-funded highway contracts. But, if you are the wrong race and gender, then--too bad--you can't compete for that $17 billion pot. 
Frankly, I am astonished that any Member of this Senate would ever think such a provision is fair, prudent, or constitutional. In fact, the courts have clearly decided that this $17 billion quota is neither fair nor constitutional.

Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Montana and look forward to debating him on this important issue over the next 8 hours and 45 minutes. 
First of all, Mr. President, the Constitution requires that we end this race-based quota. 
ISTEA's race presumption was specifically addressed in the case I just referred to where the Supreme Court found that the presumptions subjected individuals to unequal treatment under the law. The Court ruled that the presumption was unconstitutional unless the Government, as I said, could establish that the race-based program was narrowly tailored to meet a compelling Government interest. That is the test. 
This past summer, the district court in Colorado, as I just indicated to my good friend from Montana, followed the Supreme Court's lead and found that the Government, in fact, could not meet the Supreme Court's test. 
Specifically, the district court ruled, as in the chart that I referred to--and if I said the Supreme Court, I stand corrected--the district court ruled, as I just referred to the chart, section 1003(b) of ISTEA and the regulations promulgated thereunder are unconstitutional. 
The court went on to declare that the Government was precluded from the use of percentage goals found in and promulgated pursuant to ISTEA. 
It could not be more clear that the Supreme Court set up the standard, sent it back down to the district court, they applied the standard, and found this provision unconstitutional. 
It is now incumbent upon the legislative branch to bring ISTEA into compliance with Adarand and the Constitution. That is precisely what my amendment does, plain and simple. It prohibits the highway program from engaging in discrimination or preferential treatment based on skin color and gender. 
In fact, as I indicated earlier, we all remember how we began our careers here by swearing to uphold the Constitution. 
Here is a clear example of a legislative provision that has been litigated, been found unconstitutional, and, surprisingly enough, is still being proposed to continue as part of the law of the land. 
So we have, on the one hand, the courts telling us loud and clear that ISTEA's racial preferences are unconstitutional and, on the other hand, our own public oath to uphold, support, and defend the Constitution. We have little choice but to comply with the unambiguous, unequivocal mandate of the courts and end this unconstitutional race-based program. 
Every time the Government hands out a highway contract to one person based on race or gender, it discriminates against another person based on race or gender. Michael Cornelius recently spoke poignantly to this point before the Constitution Subcommittee over in the House of Representatives. He explained that his firm was denied a Government contract under ISTEA, even though his bid was $3 million lower than the nearest competitor--$3 million lower. Mr. Cornelius' bid was rejected because the Government felt that the bid did not use enough minority- or women-owned subcontractors. 
If you think that ISTEA's quota is only a goal, just ask Michael Cornelius. The Cornelius bid proposed to commit 26.5 percent of the work to firms owned by minorities and women. Yet 26.5 percent was not enough, in the world of so-called `goals and timetables.' These goals and timetables are more appropriately called quotas and set-asides. You see, the combined Federal, State, and local goal under ISTEA was 29 percent, and Mr. Cornelius' 26.5 percent did not perfectly match the Government's so-called goal, and thus the Government awarded the contract to the highest bidder--the highest bidder, Mr. President. 
Do you know how much the winning bidder proposed to contract to minority firms? I'll bet you can guess. I'll tell you how much work the winning bid promised to funnel to preferred firms--29 percent. Surely that is a coincidence, that the winning firm met the so-called goal exactly, right on the point. But, you know, the average person would hear this story and conclude that 29 percent is not merely a goal. The average person would conclude that this so-called goal is really a quota, and that is, in fact, precisely what it is. It is a race-based quota and it is unfair, unconstitutional and, frankly, just plain un-American. 
So here we have the Government committing racial and gender discrimination and paying $3 million extra just to do it. Let me repeat. We have the Government committing racial and gender discrimination and paying $3 million extra just to do it. The message to Mr. Cornelius, his wife, his children and his employees, over 80 percent of whom are women and minorities, is: Sorry about the discrimination against all of you, but the Federal Government requires it. The Federal Government requires the discrimination. Mr. Cornelius has publicly challenged Congress to give contracts to the lowest bidder and spend the excess millions of dollars in ways that will actually help low-income minorities, and that is exactly what my amendment proposes. 
This story of unfairness and discrimination is only one of the many, many stories that result from the unconstitutional ISTEA quota mandate. It is important to remember, as we debate this amendment, that discrimination by any other name is still discrimination and it strikes at the very core of the person being discriminated against. 
Next, respect for our States and our cities compels Congress to end the ISTEA quota. More and more States are being forced to choose between court decisions, on the one hand, that order the termination of preference programs, and, on the other hand, Federal Department of Transportation officials who order them to promote preference programs as a condition for receiving Federal aid. So here we have it, a situation in which a State or a city is caught between a court decision saying you cannot do this anymore and a Federal Department of Transportation saying you must do it or you cannot have any money. The administration would have the American people believe that Adarand is only one decision by one court. It is much more than that. It is a landmark Supreme Court decision and is now the law of the land. Moreover, it is part of a widespread series of recent court orders striking down preferences. 
According to the Congressional Research Service, the Adarand decision `largely conforms to a pattern of Federal rulings which have invalidated State and local government programs to promote minority contracting in Richmond, San Francisco, San Diego, Dade County, FL, Atlanta, New Orleans, Columbus, OH, Louisiana, and Michigan, among others.' And new challenges continue to be filed. Congress must act now to allow cities and States to get out of this constitutional crossfire that they are caught between: On the one hand, courts saying you cannot operate that way anymore and, on the other hand, the Federal Department of Transportation saying you must operate that way. 
I pointed out in some detail the very real human and societal costs of ISTEA's racial preferences. Let me also point 
out that ISTEA has serious financial costs for our country. Every time the Government ignores the lowest bidder and pays more for a highway contract based on race, it costs the taxpayers real and substantial dollars. As I pointed out in Mr. Cornelius' case, the cost was $3 million. But there is a global cost as well. Based on a 1994 study by the General Accounting Office, ISTEA's racial preferences over the next 6 years will cost the Nation $1.1 billion in unnecessary construction costs. And that doesn't even include the administrative costs of running the program, certifying firms as officially preferred every single year, and then running an elaborate enforcement scheme to ensure that everybody meets the racial quotas on every transportation contract. 
Also, that $1 billion does not include litigation costs. As I pointed out, racial contracting programs are being struck down all across the country and more cases continue to be filed. State governments and the Federal Government are being forced to spend countless dollars defending plainly unconstitutional race-based quotas. So, let me reiterate. We are authorizing a bill that not only requires discrimination, it wastes over $1 billion of taxpayer money by ignoring low bidders and funneling contracts to persons who are of the officially approved race and gender. 
The Federal Government ought to take the lead in ensuring that all citizens are given opportunities without regard to race, color, national origin, or gender. In that spirit of equality and entrepreneurship, my amendment displaces the race-based Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program with a race-neutral Emerging Business Enterprise Program. So let me make sure everybody understands. My amendment replaces the race-based Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program with a race-neutral Emerging Business Enterprise Program. 
My amendment requires every State that receives Federal highway dollars to take concrete and specific action to enable emerging businesses to compete for highway contracts and subcontracts. For example, States will be required to maintain a directory of emerging business enterprises and specifically provide outreach and recruiting for highway contracts. The bill also requires targeted outreach and recruiting of emerging businesses owned by women and minorities. Finally, States will be required to provide technical services and assistance on critical issues such as bonding, lending, and general business management, including estimating and bidding practices. 
This amendment requires a major outreach effort to make sure that people understand how to compete for business. The emerging business enterprise amendment offers genuine opportunity for substantive business development of all emerging businesses, regardless of race or gender. The emerging business enterprise program will allow small businesses to learn how to compete instead of simply developing a destructive dependence on bid preferences. 
One example of the destructive tendency of preferences comes from a very thoughtful book entitled, `The Affirmative Action Fraud.' In that book, Clint Bolick explains that the Rocky Mountain News recently tracked 100 companies that received contracts in 1985 under the city of Denver's racial preference program. Denver's minority contracting program required that a certain percentage of all contracts had to be funneled to minority-owned firms. Ten years later--that was in 1985--10 years later, 42 minority firms had gone out of business, 34 were still dependent on this supposedly temporary program, and only 24 were still in business and actually independent from the program. 
In point of fact, the current DBE program has a dismal graduation rate. According to a GAO study, between 1988 and 1992, fewer than 1 percent of the DBE firms graduated from the DBE program. The General Accounting Office reviewed six States to see how the States were preparing DBEs to compete. In 1992, those 6 States had 4,717 certified disadvantaged business enterprises. Out of those, 4,717 DBEs, only 17 graduated--17 out of 4,717. And most of the DBEs had been in the program at least 3 years and apparently had learned very little. 
The EBE program is a much needed replacement of the failed and unconstitutional DBE program. Even the Department of Transportation has conceded that the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program does not prepare minority businesses to compete in the real world. On May 30 of last year, DOT acknowledged the low graduation rates of its firms and conceded in the fine print of the Federal Register that, `The DBE program does not provide for an encompassing business development program.' 
In short, all Federal contracting programs should meet a four-pronged test. They must be constitutional, colorblind, merit-based, and inclusive--constitutional, colorblind, merit-based, and inclusive. My race-neutral amendment will ensure that the Federal highway program passes this test. 
It is time to end the divisive discriminatory practice of awarding highway and transit construction contracts based on race, gender and ethnicity of a company's ownership. Respect for our Constitution, our courts, our States, and our individual citizens demands no less. 
It is time to move beyond racial quotas and set-asides and focus our national effort on improving the ability of small businesses, especially those who are women and minorities, to compete through genuine outreach and business development--genuine outreach and business development, and that, Mr. President, is what this amendment would do. It would take out the clearly unconstitutional Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program, which is not only unconstitutional, but a conspicuous failure, and replace it with a race-neutral emerging business enterprise program that complies with the Constitution and can succeed. 
Mr. President, I will stop at this point and inquire as to how much time I have remaining.

I wonder how long it is going to take, I ask my friend from New Hampshire, at this rate with every single aggrieved party having to sue, I wonder if my friend from New Hampshire has any sense of how long it may take to get these preferences off the books and bring American practice, Government practice into line with the Constitution.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there are many lawyers in the Senate, some out in the land believe too many. But it is my judgment that the finest lawyer in the Senate is the Senator from Washington. I thank him for his clear explanation of what the law demands in this situation. 
No effort by the other side to obscure the obvious, it seems to me, should fool anyone. The Senator from Washington has laid it out with extraordinary clarity. This provision in the bill before us is unconstitutional. I thank the Senator from Washington for his support of the Constitution. 
Mr. President, a number of the opponents of the amendment have said they know discrimination exists in this kind of economic activity because the numbers of minority participants have dropped in Michigan and in Louisiana. Colleagues have lamented the loss of the DBE programs in those two States, Louisiana and Michigan, but what they fail to point out was that those DBE programs were terminated based on court decisions that held that the preferences were unconstitutional, and that is, of course, precisely what we are discussing here today, the constitutionality of these kinds of race-based set-asides. 
Even the Department of Transportation has quietly conceded that disparity figures do not prove discrimination. Let me share this quiet concession buried in the jungle of Federal regulations. The administration notes that: 
Minority firms may receive less work because of the following reasons: Lack of interest in the work, other commitments, limitations of the amount of work they can handle or lack of qualifications, especially where a State spends a large portion of its funds on a single large project requiring special contractors. 
There has been some suggestion by those opposing the amendment that the Adarand case not only wasn't determinative of the race-based set-aside in this bill, but it somehow is an isolated case. The Congressional Research Service has found no--I repeat no--court ruling after a trial where a race-based contracting program has met the Supreme Court test of strict scrutiny. Let me say that one more time. There has been an effort to portray the Adarand case as kind of an aberration, or actually not determinative, not really on point. The fact of the matter is it is just one more in a whole series of cases indicating that these kinds of race-based programs are unconstitutional. In fact, CRS has explained that Adarand conforms to a pattern of Federal rulings across the country, striking down race-based contracting programs as unconstitutional. Let me just mention some of them: Associated General Contractors of California v. San Francisco. That was in the ninth circuit. Michigan Road Builders Assoc. v. Milliken, which was in the sixth circuit; Groves & Sons Co. v. Fulton County, which was in the seventh circuit; Associated General Contractors of Connecticut v. New Haven; O'Donnell Construction Company v. the District of Columbia, in the D.C. circuit; Arrow Office Supply v. Detroit, a Michigan case; Louisiana Associated General Contractors v. Louisiana, Associated General Contractors of America v. Columbus; Engineering Contractors Ass'n of South Florida v. Metropolitan Dade County in the 11th circuit; Contractors Ass'n of Eastern Pennsylvania v. Philadelphia, in the third circuit; Monterey Mechanical v. Wilson in the ninth circuit, just last September; Houston Contractors Association v. 
Metropolitan Transit, which is in the Southern District of Texas, November 13 of last year, 1997. 
Quoting from the Houston Contractors case, right out of the case, the District Court for the Southern District of Texas, the court said: 
Because race is inescapably arbitrary, basing governmental action on race offends the American Constitution. 
The court went on to say: 
Assigning governmental benefits to people by their skin color does not quit being arbitrary because the advocates claim that a program has a progressive purpose; a principle wrong for Eugene Talmadge is wrong for Jesse Jackson. 
The court went on to say: 
Nothing about transportation depends upon the race of the person--not employees, officers, taxpayers, riders, suppliers, or contractors. 
It has been suggested that these are all sorts of lower court decisions and somehow they are off on their own or something, not following the mandate of the Supreme Court. 
In the Croson case, way back in 1989, the Court said that: 
. . . a generalized assertion that there has been past discrimination in an entire industry provides no guidance for a legislative body to determine the precise scope of the injury it seeks to remedy. It `has no logical stopping point.' 
The Court went on to say: 
`Relief' for such an ill-defined wrong could extend until the percentage of public contracts awarded to MBE's in Richmond mirrored the percentage of minorities in the population as a whole. 
Appellant argues that it is attempting to remedy various forms of past discrimination that are alleged to be responsible for the small number of minority businesses in the local contracting industry. Among these the city cites the exclusion of blacks from skilled construction trade unions and training programs. This past discrimination [the Court said] has prevented them `from following the traditional path from laborer to entrepreneur.' [That is the city talking.] The city also lists a host of nonracial factors which would seem to face a member of any racial group attempting to establish a new business enterprise, such as deficiencies in working capital, inability to meet bonding requirements, unfamiliarity with bidding procedures, and disability cased by an inadequate track record. 
While there is no doubt that the sorry history of both private and public discrimination in this country has contributed to a lack of opportunities for black entrepreneurs, this observation, standing alone, [standing alone] cannot justify a rigid racial quota in the awarding of public contracts in Richmond, Virginia. . . . [A]n amorphous claim that there has been past discrimination in a particular industry cannot justify the use of an unyielding racial quota. 
It is sheer speculation how many minority firms there would be in Richmond absent past societal discrimination, just as it was sheer speculation how many minority medical students would have been admitted to the medical school at Davis absent past discrimination in educational opportunities. Defining these sorts of injuries as `identified discrimination' would give local governments license to create a patchwork of racial preferences based on statistical generalizations about any particular field of endeavor. 
So the Court concluded: 
The 30% quota cannot in any realistic sense be tied to any injury suffered by anyone. 
So the Court said: 
We, therefore, hold that the city has failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in apportioning public contracting opportunities on the basis of race. To accept Richmond's claim that past societal discrimination alone can serve as the basis for rigid racial preferences would be to open the door to competing claims for `remedial relief' for every disadvantaged group. The dream of a Nation of equal citizens in a society where race is irrelevant to personal opportunity and achievement would be lost in a mosaic of shifting preferences based on inherently unmeasurable claims of past wrongs. `Courts would be asked to evaluate the extent of the prejudice and consequent harm suffered by various minority groups. Those whose societal injury is thought to exceed some arbitrary level of tolerability then would be entitled to preferential classifications. . . .' We think such a result would be contrary to both the letter and spirit of a constitutional provision whose central command is equality. 
The Court went on: 
There is absolutely no evidence of past discrimination against Spanish-speaking, Oriental, Indian, Eskimo or Aleut [Indian] persons in any aspect of the Richmond construction industry. . . . It may well be that Richmond has never had an Aleut or Eskimo citizen [the Court said]. The random inclusion of racial groups that, as a practical matter, may never have suffered from discrimination in the construction industry in Richmond suggests that perhaps the city's purpose was not in fact to remedy past discrimination. 
If a 30% set-aside was `narrowly tailored' to compensate black contractors for past discrimination, one may legitimately ask why they are forced to share this `remedial relief' with an Aleut citizen who moves to Richmond tomorrow? The gross overinclusiveness of Richmond's racial preference strongly impugns the city's claim of remedial motivation. 
Mr. President, even if by way of some disparity study mirror this administration could show a finding of specific, pervasive discrimination in the highway contracting arena, the administration would still be unable to show that the ISTEA quota is narrowly tailored to remedy that alleged past discrimination. ISTEA and the DBE Program funnels not less than 10 percent of Federal highway funds to disadvantaged business enterprises. The Government presumes that an individual is disadvantaged if that individual can trace his or her roots to one of over 100 different countries. These countries range from Argentina to Spain and Portugal to Sri Lanka and Madagascar to Japan and to the Fiji Islands. 
Just look at the map I have to my right. If you are from one of the countries with a `P' on it--it is probably hard for people to see--you are in the preferred group. Look at the worldwide web of preferences that we have created, and who can figure out this web? If you happen to be from these countries, you get a preference. If you happen to have emigrated from some other country, you do not. 
If you are so unfortunate as to be from Poland, you are out of luck; you actually have to compete and win on the merits. But if you are from Pakistan, you are in the preferred group. 
If you are from Nigeria, you are disadvantaged, but if you are from Algeria, you are not disadvantaged. 
If you are from Spain or Portugal, you are disadvantaged, but if you are from Bosnia, you are not disadvantaged. 
If you are from Israel, you are not disadvantaged, but if you are from Pakistan, you are disadvantaged. 
If you are from China or Japan, then you get a preference, but if you are from Russia, sorry, you don't get a preference. 
If you are from the Fiji Islands, it is your lucky day; you win the preference prize. But if you are from New Zealand or are an Australian Aborigine, you lose; you are not disadvantaged. 
In the Adarand case, the plaintiff explained this overbreadth problem to the Supreme Court. Specifically, the plaintiff's lawyers stated in oral argument:  
We have a situation here where a Hong Kong banker, a Japanese electrical engineer, or the son of landed gentry from Spain could come to Colorado Springs and . . . [run] a [Disadvantaged Business Enterprise]. 
And, in fact, the district court in Adarand agreed the DBE program is so overly broad that it violates not only common sense, but it violates the Constitution. Indeed, under these standards, as Senator Ashcroft and others have mentioned, the Sultan of Brunei would qualify as disadvantaged. 
By the way, let me tell you a little about our friend, the disadvantaged sultan. This is a man who has an estimated $40 billion fortune, making him the wealthiest monarch in the world. He lives in a sprawling palace, which you can see reflected in this picture, the palace of the Sultan of Brunei. This palace has 22-karat gold-plated mosque domes and 37 types of marble. He has 150 Rolls Royces. And if that is not enough, the sultan keeps his prize thoroughbred horses in hundreds of air-conditioned stables. 
So, the sultan could leave his estate in Brunei, forsake his Rolls Royces, abandon his horses in their air-conditioned stables, and then move to my home State of Kentucky and get a bid preference as a DBE over a contractor from the hills of Appalachia. Mr. President, something is wrong with this picture. 
In 1980, Justice Stewart poignantly explained what was wrong with this picture. To quote Justice Stewart directly, Congress has `necessarily paint[ed] with too broad a brush.' 
He said: 
In today's society, it constitutes far too gross an oversimplification to assume that-- 
And this was in 1980-- every single Negro, Spanish-speaking citizen, Oriental, Indian, Eskimo and Aleut potentially interested in construction contracting currently suffers from the effects of past or present racial discrimination. Since the . . . set-aside must be viewed as resting upon such an assumption, it necessarily paints with too broad a brush. Except to make whole the identified victims of racial discrimination, the guarantee of equal protection prohibits the government from taking detrimental action against innocent people on the basis of the sins of others of their own race. 
Congress has a substantial burden of `inquir[ing] into whether or not the particular [entity] seeking a racial preference has suffered from the effects of past discrimination.' 
This is what they were talking about in the Croson case, a Supreme Court case. 
Again, let me quote the Supreme Court: 
The random inclusion of racial groups, that as a practical matter, may have never suffered from discrimination in the construction industry . . . suggests that perhaps the . . . purpose was not in fact to remedy past discrimination . . . The gross overinclusiveness of [a government's] racial preferences strongly impugns the . . . claim of remedial motivation. 
If there is no duty to attempt either to measure the recovery by the wrong or to distribute that recovery within the injured class in an evenhanded way, our history will adequately support a legislative preference for almost any ethnic, religious or racial group with the political strength to negotiate `a piece of the action' for its members. 
Again quoting Croson. 
Or, as the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently explained in striking down racial preferences: 
A broad program that sweeps in all minorities with a remedy that is in no way related to past harms cannot survive constitutional scrutiny. 
Hopwood v. the State of Texas. 
As I have explain today, the Government has placed the stamp of disadvantaged on a stupefying array of groups--groups and individuals that are not similarly situated. 
As Professor LaNoue has explained: 
Some of the groups on the presumptively eligible list have been in this country since its beginning; some are very recent arrivals. Some are relatively poor; some are relatively affluent. Some have very high rates of business formation; some are very low. Some have well-documented histories of discrimination; some are virtually invisible. 
Again quoting Justice Stevens: 
The statutory definition of the preferred class includes `citizens of the United States who are [black], Spanish-speaking, Orientals, Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts.' . . . There is not one word in the remainder of the Act or in the legislative history that explains why any Congressman or Senator favored this particular definition over any other or that identifies the common characteristics that every member of the preferred class was believed to share. Nor does the Act or its history explain why 10 percent of the total appropriation was the proper amount to set aside for investors in each of the six racial subclasses. 
In summary, as numerous speakers have said, the DBE program is not narrowly tailored. As the district court concluded in Adarand just this last summer, directly from the court: 
I find it difficult to envisage a race-based classification that is narrowly tailored. By its very nature, such a program is both underinclusive and overinclusive. This seemingly contradictory result suggests that the criteria are lacking in substance as well as in reason. 
Or as the Supreme Court held in Croson, a program is unconstitutional where `a successful black, Hispanic or Oriental entrepreneur from anywhere in the country enjoys an absolute preference over other citizens based solely on their race. We think it obvious that such a program is not narrowly tailored to remedy the effects of prior discrimination. 
I cannot imagine how the courts would spell this one out any clearer for us. This program is not designed to remedy past discrimination, it is not narrowly tailored by any stretch of the imagination, and it is plainly and clearly, as the distinguished Senator from Washington so eloquently put it a few moments ago, not constitutional. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. I can say to my good friend from New Mexico, for whom I have the greatest respect, I would like to just mention what the Supreme Court said in the Adarand case. Basically what the Supreme Court did was to lay out the standard, and they said that any racial presumption must be narrowly tailored to meet a compelling governmental interest. ISTEA uses that racial presumption. Then what the Court did was they sent the case back to the district court to determine what statutes and regulations were in play in Adarand and whether the statutes and regulations met the strict-scrutiny standard. 
In the district court case--I apologize to my good friend from New Mexico if I said the Adarand case declared the regs unconstitutional. I don't think I said that on the floor here today. I may have said that in some conversation we had yesterday. But what the Adarand case did was lay out the standard, sent the case back to the district court, and the district court said, and this is a direct quote, `Section 1003(b) of ISTEA and the regulations promulgated thereunder are unconstitutional.' So the district court, applying the standard of Adarand, said the case was unconstitutional. 
The Department of Transportation, in trying to appeal the district court decision--they don't like that decision. They are going to appeal it to the 10th circuit. The Department of Transportation in their brief, in describing the lower court decision, says, `This order declares unconstitutional the program operated by DOT, but also the Federal aid DBE program operated by the State of Colorado under ISTEA.' 
So, I think we are in the same place here. Technically, the Supreme Court only laid down the standard in this case. But that was a landmark standard. It was sent back down to the district court, which applied the standard and found this unconstitutional. And the Court in another case, a very similar case to this--the Court meaning the Supreme Court--has addressed this issue. So it is not like the Supreme Court has never spoken, I would say to my friend from New Mexico, on this subject. In the Croson case the Court said, `In sum, none of the evidence presented by the city'--this was referring to the city of Richmond, a similar factual situation: 
None of the evidence presented by the city point to any identified discrimination in the Richmond construction industry. We therefore hold that the city has failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in apportioning public contracting opportunities on the basis of race. 
To accept Richmond's claim that past societal discrimination alone can serve as the basis for rigid racial preferences would be to open the door to competing claims for remedial relief for nearly every disadvantaged group. The dream of a nation of equal citizens in a society where race is irrelevant to personal opportunity and achievement would be lost in a mosaic of shifting preferences based on inherently unmeasurable claims of past wrongs. Courts would be asked to evaluate the extent of the prejudice and consequent harm suffered by various minority groups. Those whose societal injury is thought to exceed some arbitrary level of tolerability then would be entitled to preferential classifications. We think such a result would be contrary to both the letter and spirit of a constitutional provision whose central command is equality. 
Finally, let me say the Supreme Court has addressed a similar issue in the Croson case. The Supreme Court laid down the standard in Adarand, sent it to the district court, which applied the standard which found the very provision we are talking about unconstitutional. That is on appeal to the 10th circuit. And the sufficiency of the new regs that my good friend from New Mexico and other speakers on the other side of this issue have referred to I suppose is the issue before us today. In other words, has the Department of Transportation, bearing in mind the Adarand decision and the subsequent district court decision, adjusted the regulations in such a way as to come into compliance with the law? 
I cite on that point a letter from George LaNoue, who is an expert in this particular field who has testified before a number of congressional committees on this subject. Professor LaNoue addresses the adequacy of the new regs. He says: 
It is being asserted that various alterations and proposed regulations for ISTEA solve the constitutional problems created by the use of race, ethnic and gender preferences in awarding of contracts under that program. That assertion is incorrect for two reasons. First, the regulatory alternatives go only to the issue of narrow tailoring-- 
Narrow tailoring-- not to the constitutional requirement that a compelling basis of remedying identified discrimination be established before any, for the use of preferences, be considered. None of the fundamental evidentiary requirements necessary to support the preferences in this legislation have been established by the administration or by Congress.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with regard to the likelihood of the district court decision in Adarand being overturned--I see my friend from New Mexico is leaving--just to close the discussion on what is likely to be the outcome in the case, I asked the Congressional Research Service about the cases in this particular area of the law. 
Let me, Mr. President, for our colleagues in the Senate, point out that the Congressional Research Service has found no--no, not a one--no court ruling after a trial where a race-based contracting program has met the Supreme Court's test of strict scrutiny. 
I say to my friend from New Mexico, there hasn't been a single case that the Congressional Research Service could find where a race-based contracting program has met the Supreme Court's test of strict scrutiny. In fact, CRS has explained that Adarand conforms--this is not sort of an aberration out there --it conforms to a pattern of Federal rulings across the country striking down race-based contracting programs as unconstitutional: 
Associated General Contractors of California v. San Francisco, a ninth circuit case; Michigan Road Builders v. Milliken, a sixth circuit case; Groves v. Fulton County in the Northern District of Georgia; Milwaukee County Pavers Association v. Fiedler in the seventh circuit; Associated General Contractors of Connecticut v. New Haven, district court in Connecticut; O'Donnell Construction Co. v. District of Columbia in DC Circuit; Arrow Office Supply v. Detroit, Eastern District of Michigan; Louisiana Associated General Contractors v. Louisiana in Louisiana; Associated General Contractors of America v. Columbus, Southern District of Ohio; Engineering Contractors Association of South Florida v. Metropolitan Dade County in the 11th circuit; and finally, Contractors Association of Eastern Pennsylvania v. Philadelphia in the third circuit; and more recently, Monterey Mechanical v. Wilson in the ninth circuit, decided last September; Houston Contractors Association v. Metropolitan Transit, decided last November. 
Mr. President, CRS was unable to find a single court ruling where after a trial a race-based contracting program has met the Supreme Court's test of strict scrutiny. 
I think it is extremely unlikely, in conclusion, I say to my friend from New Mexico, that we are going to have a court decision overturning the district court finding after Adarand laid down the standard. I thank him for his important contribution. 
This is a very, very important issue about what kind of a country we are going to have, what kind of America we are going to have. Are we going to realize Martin Luther King's dream of a colorblind society, or are we going to continue down what the Senator from Kentucky believes is a mistaken path of putting people into boxes, into groups, and to doling out benefits and rights based upon what ethnicity they may be, whether they are male or female? Are we going to continue to go down that path or really work to achieve a colorblind society? I think the courts are telling us that quotas and preferences based on race, ethnicity, and sex are not going to be upheld. The pattern is clear, and it seems to me we ought to follow what is, it seems to me, the law of the land in this particular instance. I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. We come to the end of the most recent round of debate on whether to put the Government in charge of political speech of individuals, candidates, and parties. I think it is important to talk a little bit about the philosophy that divides us on this issue. 
My good friends on the other side of the aisle look at America as a seething caldron of people who are trying to make us do bad things. We, on the other hand, take the approach to this that James Madison did. James Madison, the author of the first amendment, Mr. President, understood that America would, in fact, be a cauldron, a cauldron of special interests, but special interests in Madison's views, or factions, as he put it, would be people who would be guaranteed a right to have some influence; that it was totally American--expected, anticipated and necessary--in a democracy to allow people to have influence. 
After all, who are we trying to wall ourselves off from, Mr. President? People who want to contribute to our campaigns, limit and disclose amounts of their hard-earned money because they believe in what we are doing? What could conceivably be wrong with that? In fact, it is as American as apple pie. Not only is it the right thing for our people, it is the constitutionally protected thing for our country. 
The Supreme Court has made it abundantly clear, abundantly clear that unless you have the ability to amplify your voice in a country of 260 to 270 million people, you don't have much speech. Dan Rather has a lot of speech, Tom Brokaw has a lot of speech, the editorial page of the Washington Post has a lot of speech, but your average American citizen, unless that person can amplify his voice, doesn't have much speech. So the Court said spending is speech and the first amendment applies to individuals, groups, candidates and parties, as well as applying to the press. A stunning thing for the press to observe, that we have free speech rights as well. They don't like it. They would like to have more power, not less. They would like to control our campaigns, control the discourse in the course of the campaign that goes on, and control the outcome with their editorial endorsement. But the first amendment doesn't allow them to control the political process. It also doesn't allow the Government, through some statute we passed here, to be put in charge of regulating either the quality or the quantity of political speech. 
The great conservative Thurgood Marshall summed it up in the Buckley case: `The one thing we all agree on is that spending is speech.' 
The Court made the point that if you say somebody is free to speak but then say they can only speak so much, they are not very free to speak. They said it would be about like saying you are free to travel, but you can only spend $100. How free are you? 
I wonder how our friends at the Washington Post and New York Times would feel if we said: You are free to say anything you want, but your circulation is now limited to 2,500 or 10,000. They would say: You are interfering with our speech because we can't amplify our speech. 
Of course, they would be correct. I say that somewhat tongue in cheek, but the principle is the same whether it's the press or an individual candidate or a group or a party. 
Mr. President, I don't feel that people participating in our campaigns is in any way inappropriate. It should not be condemned; it ought to be applauded. We don't have a problem in this country because we are speaking too much in political campaigns. Our good friends on the other side of the aisle say, well, we are spending too much. Compared to what? It's about what the public spent on bubble gum last cycle. 
There was an increase in spending because the stakes were big. A lot of people cared about what happened in the 1996 election. There was a struggle for the White House and a struggle for the Congress and a struggle over the future of America. A lot of people cared about that and they got involved. They wrote their checks out and gave it to their favorite party or candidate. Some groups came out and said how they felt about it, which they have a constitutional right to do, as well, under the first amendment. Many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle were appalled; all this speech was polluting the process, they said. 
Mr. President, I think all that speech was invigorating the process. When there is not much speech in a campaign, not much spending in a campaign, it is a sleepy campaign with no competition. Typically, statistically, it is a lower turnout election when there is no interest. So there is nothing offensive, nothing improper, and nothing to be condemned when you look at a heavily contested election in which large quantities of money are spent on behalf of the candidates because people think the stakes are big. 
Now, why would people care, Mr. President? We have a huge Government that affects every American. It is naive in the extreme to expect that people don't want to have some impact on a political process which takes 30 to 40 percent of their money every year--paying taxes is not exactly a voluntary act--and spends it on what it wants to. 
What kind of country would we have if all of these people in our land were unable to influence the political process? We would have an unresponsive democracy, a Government run by elitists who want to shut everybody up. Fortunately, Mr. President, the courts are never going to allow that to happen. This Senate is never going to allow it to happen, because we are not going to go down the road of regulating people out of the political process because we don't like either the quantity or the quality of their speech. I have heard it said off and on over the last few days about these polluting issue ad campaigns, these sham campaigns. Who is to decide, Mr. President, whose speech is worthy and whose speech is not? The Supreme Court made it clear that the Government is not going to allow us here to decide whose speech is worthy and whose speech is not. The first amendment doesn't allow us the latitude to categorize certain kinds of speech as offensive and other kinds of speech as laudable. So that is at the core of this debate. 
I want to say to my colleagues in the Senate and to those who may be following this debate, the supporters of McCain-Feingold-type proposals--which was called, when the Democrats were in the majority, Boren-Mitchell--say they are always going to come back. 
Let me make sure that everybody understands that we will always be back, too. We will fight efforts to undermine political discourse in this country wherever they may arise. There are some 
multimillionaires who are funding campaigns around the country. George Soros, a multibillionaire who funds a variety of things, including referenda to legalize marijuana, has taken an interest in this subject. Jerome Kohlberg, a former financier from Wall Street, has taken an interest in this subject. These are people who think everybody else's money in politics is bad except theirs. They have been trying to fund an effort to pass so-called campaign finance referenda. 
Let me assure our colleagues, the Members of the Senate, that there will always be somebody there. For example, there is the James Madison Center, a new group that has been established to fight for first amendment political speech, a group of public interest lawyers who will be involved in these cases, striking them all down one after another. Their record in court has been excellent. The California referendum was struck down last month; the Maine referendum was struck down last year--all of these efforts, even though they may be well-intentioned, to push people out of the political process and put the Government in charge of how much we may speak, when we may speak, whether or not we have to disclose our membership lists as a precondition as to whether or not we can mention a candidate or not mention a candidate. 
Who are we kidding? What reformers want to do is shut everybody up. They want to shut down the discussion. It isn't going to happen, Mr. President. There will be somebody there to fight in every court in America, State, local or Federal, to preserve the rights of all Americans to speak without Government interference in the political process. 
This is a very important debate. This is not a little issue. There isn't anything more fundamental to our democracy--nothing--than the ability to discuss issues, to support candidates, either as individuals or in banding together as groups, and to express yourself without Government interference or limitation in this great country. This is the core of our democracy. 
Now, Mr. President, I might mention that in Europe, England in particular, they have had restrictions against issue advocacy, which is something we have talked about a good deal here in the last 3 or 4 days. Issue advocacy is not complicated. It is a group banding together to express themselves about us or an issue or anything else they choose to at any time they choose to, without Government interference. Over in Europe, the British in particular, basically didn't allow citizens to band together and express themselves. Last week--it is kind of interesting--a group in England took a case to the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled that laws banning ordinary citizens from spending money to promote or denigrate candidates in election campaigns was a breach of human rights. The court was right. For the Government to say you can't go out as a citizen or as a group of citizens and criticize candidates any time you want, that is a breach of human rights. They struck down that British prohibition. The independent newspaper in London says that ruling opens up the way for American-style election battles. 
Well, it is about time they had some American-style election battles in which citizens have an opportunity to band together and express themselves without government interference in Europe. So I commend that court for its ruling. It looks to me as if the Europeans are heading in the direction of having a real democracy. In a real democracy, Mr. President, the candidates don't get to control all the discussion in the election. We would love to. We would really like that because then we could have our campaigns and the other guys could have theirs. The press always has a campaign, and, of course, that would go on. But we would not have any of these groups out there messing up our campaigns. 
Mr. President, we don't own these campaigns; we don't control them. It is not our right to shut these citizens up, no matter how much it may irritate us. The good thing about what is going to happen in a few minutes is that those people's ability to participate is going to be preserved. We are not going to take that away. We are going to kill a bill that richly deserves to be 
killed. We are going to do it proudly and unapologetically. 
There is also another vote we are going to have, an opportunity to introduce an American principle as old as the founding of the country into the labor movement in this country. No one ought to be required to support political causes with which they disagree. The Supreme Court has, in fact, already ruled that way in the Beck case. But, as a practical matter, the Beck decision is not being enforced. There is a bill called the paycheck protection bill, of which Senator Nickles was the original author and which Senator Lott has offered, which would guarantee that there has to be written permission by a union before it takes money from its members for political purposes. 
Everybody else in the American political process operates on that principle. Everybody else. It's high time that our good friends in organized labor raise their money voluntarily, from willing donors, like everyone else. I don't want to shut up the unions. I defend their right to engage in issue advocacy. It has always been directed against members of my party. I would not, for a minute, support anything that would take them off the playing field. But they ought to raise their resources from voluntary donors like everybody else. 
This issue is going to be out in the States, Mr. President--a referendum in California in June, in Nevada, in Colorado, and in other States. It has already been passed in the State of Washington a few years ago. This is the real campaign finance reform that I urge our colleagues to vote for. If you want to vote for a real change in the American election system that would move us in the right direction, then let's introduce democracy into the workplace by making certain that no one's dues are taken against their will and spent on causes with which they disagree. 
So, Mr. President, I urge a vote for cloture on the paycheck protection bill and a vote against cloture on McCain-Feingold, which would wreak great harm upon the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, there has been a lot of discussion about what some have called sham issue advocacy. Among the most appalling spectacles we have witnessed on the Senate floor in recent years is that of Senators standing around casting judgment on whether particular ads by citizens groups transgress some notions of what is appropriate. 
Sham issue advocacy is the reformer's favorite pejorative term of art for first amendment protected speech which those pushing the regulatory scheme in McCain-Feingold and the Snowe substitute do not regard as legitimate. They say it is sham speech because--brace yourself--it might actually affect an election. Well, by all means. 
We are admonished that any communication by a private citizen or group that might have any impact on a Federal election should be regulated by the Federal Government, should be reported to the Federal Election Commission. The citizens who gather together to pay for it to exercise their constitutional right of association ought to be disclosed to the Federal Government, so the argument goes, so that they may be judged. 
Many in the media beat the drums for Government regulation of this so-called sham issue advocacy. Roll Call last month actually had the audacity to besiege the Congress to get this speech--now listen to this--to get this speech under control. Of course, if you really want to have influence, if you really want to affect the course of an election to favor certain candidates over others, repeal certain legislation or certain issues and you are wealthy, you can always buy a newspaper or become a newspaper editor, write editorials, headlines, stories. 
A lot of people would like to get those sham editorials under control. I thought about that from time to time over the years, but the first amendment would not allow it, and I don't know of anyone advocating it, certainly not Roll Call. 
Fortunately for the media, they benefit from a provision in the Federal Elections Campaign Act, I might call it a loophole, that exempts their issue advocacy, their express advocacy, and only theirs, from the definition of expenditure. 
The presumption underlying the notion that issue advocacy needs to be gotten under control is a remarkably arrogant one, or perhaps, in some instances, an ignorant one. The premise is that the politicians, all of us, own these elections and, therefore, politicians must control them, and politicians must not be drowned out by all this other independent speech issue advocacy by private citizens and groups. 
Good heavens, the politicians may wish to keep the race on a particular issue or two or perhaps they rather not talk about legislative issues at all. Perhaps they prefer to keep the emphasis on personality, 
resume or some other nonissue qualities. 
And there could be some citizen group with all their `sham" issue advocacy spoiling the election, messing the election up, fussing the election up with issues, for goodness sake--with issues. A group of citizens may feel strongly that character is an issue, one that should be injected into a particular race, and so they broadcast, through paid ads, some misdeed of a candidate because it is relevant to character. Reformers write such communications off as `negative' and somehow unbecoming in a democracy. 
They do this without the candidate's permission. The temerity of these folks presuming they have a constitutional right to participate in elections, to weigh in on issues, to influence public opinion. Private citizens and groups interjecting themselves into American elections? How dare they do that. What do they think this is? A democracy? 
A so-called compromise is being shopped around--actually it is the one we are considering--it is a compromise insofar as it seeks to pick up some additional Republicans, enough to invoke cloture at some point down the road. Its proponents claim it addresses the constitutional shortcomings of McCain-Feingold. Its authors have created a new label, a sort of new category of speech that exists nowhere save for the talking points here on the floor. They rephrase `sham' issue advocacy, calling it instead `electioneering.' 
Electioneering. What sinister overtones this term must evidently hold to reformers. This is positively subversive stuff, this `electioneering.' It warrants, in the reformer view, Federal regulation. Those who contribute to it should, we are told, be disclosed to the Federal Government. 
We are advised by proponents of McCain-Feingold and the Snowe-Jeffords substitute or addition, that this `sham' issue advocacy, this `electioneering' is a new phenomenon, a new scourge which must be routed out, regulated, and disclosed to a Federal agency, the FEC. 
Here is a news flash: Issue advocacy--`sham' or otherwise--is neither novel nor ripe for Federal regulation. The legal minds at the Brennan Center who are building the case for McCain-Feingold and the Snowe-Jeffords proposal do not like the Buckley case. They do not respect the Buckley case. And their mission is to overturn the Buckley case. 
Their theory--really a desperate hope, actually--is that the Court will look at 20 years of election activities since the Buckley decision and decide things differently, even obliterate the `bright-line' standard, the `express advocacy' tripwire. 
More likely is that the Court will go the other way toward my view and that of those who think the first amendment that passed back before 1800 is America's premier political reform--not the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974. 
The Court is not going to look at the proliferation of issue advocacy and say, `Whoa, we need to get that under control.' No. I think the Court is going to say, `We told you so.' 
The Court, in Buckley two decades ago, anticipated that which the reformers now identify as a horrible `loophole,' which has recently opened up somehow and must be closed. 
In Buckley, the Court anticipated exactly what we are discussing this afternoon. It said in that case: 
It would naively underestimate the integrity and resourcefulness of persons and groups desiring to buy influence to believe that they would have much difficulty devising expenditures that skirted the restriction on express advocacy of election or defeat but nevertheless benefited the candidate's campaign. 
The Court was emphatic in Buckley that issue advocacy--`sham' or otherwise--was at the core, the very core, of the first amendment. To regulate it in any way is unconstitutional, even a `reform' so seemingly innocuous as `disclosure' of donors. 
In NAACP v. Button, in 1963, which was quoted in Buckley, the Court said:  
Because First Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive, government may regulate in the area only with narrow specificity. 
The Court went on to say in Buckley: 
. . . the distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application. 
So the Court anticipated exactly what has happened. 
Candidates, especially incumbents, are intimately tied to public issues involving legislative proposals and governmental actions. 
The Court said in Buckley: 
Not only do candidates campaign on the basis of their positions on various public issues, but campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest. 
The Court went on the say: 
[W]hether words intended and designed to fall short of invitation would miss that mark is a question both of intent and effect. No speaker, in such circumstances, safely could assume that anything he might say upon the general subject would not be understood by some as an invitation. In short, the supposedly clear-cut distinction between discussion, laudation, general advocacy, and solicitation puts the speaker in these circumstances wholly at the mercy of the varied understanding of his hearers and consequently of whatever inference may be drawn as to his intent and meaning. 
Such a distinction offers no security for free discussion. In these conditions it blankets with uncertainty whatever may be said. It compels the speaker to hedge and trim. 
The Court went on: 
The constitutional deficiencies described in Thomas v. Collins can be avoided only by reading [the 1974 independent expenditure provision regarding advocacy of election or defeat] as limited [very limited] to communications that include explicit words of advocacy of election or defeat of a candidate. . . 
. . . in order to preserve the provision against invalidation or vagueness grounds, [it] must be construed to apply only to expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office. 
So, Madam President, the Court understood that an issue advocacy was very much to be, to some viewers or listeners, indistinguishable from express advocacy that they said the first amendment requires its protection. 
So long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, [the Court said] they are free [I repeat, free] to spend as much as they want to promote the candidate and his views. The exacting interpretation of the statutory language necessary to avoid unconstitutional vagueness thus undermines the limitations's effectiveness as a loophole-closing provision . . . 
. . . yet no societal interest would be served by a loophole-closing provision . . . 
So summing up Buckley's observations about issue advocacy, they anticipated this. They wanted people to have wide latitude to discuss the issues or the pros and cons of candidates for office, up to and including proximity to an election. And they wanted them to be able to do that without having to file with the Federal Election Commission or to conduct their speech with hard-money dollars. 
The Supreme Court reiterated the explicit words requirement for a determination of express advocacy in the 1986 Massachusetts Citizens for Life case--citing, again, footnote 52 as a guide. And here is what they said: 
Buckley adopted the `express advocacy' requirement to distinguish discussion of issues and candidates from more pointed exhortations to vote for particular persons. We therefore concluded in that case that a finding of `express advocacy' depended upon the use of language such as `vote for,' `elect,' `support,' etc. 
Now, those who advocate McCain-Feingold and the Snowe-Jeffords proposal, which involve regulatory regimes, have precious few court cases upon which to base their arguments. Most prominent among these is the ninth circuit's Furgatch decision, dating back to 1987, which my colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, made reference to a few moments ago. Frankly, it is a mighty slim reference. The Furgatch limb upon which their issue advocacy regulation case rests is a pretty weak limb. 
While Furgatch is not my favorite decision, it is certainly not the blank check for reformers who seek to shut down issue advocacy either. Furgatch was an express advocacy case. It hinged on the content of the communication at issue--words, explicit terms--just as the Supreme Court required in Buckley and reiterated in Massachusetts Citizens for Life. 
The words in Furgatch were not those contained in Buckley's footnote 52. Indeed, no one--least of all the Supreme Court--ever intended that the list, typically referred to as `footnote 52' was exhaustive. That would defy common sense. 
Desperate for even the thinnest constitutional gruel upon which to base their regulatory zeal to extend their reach to everyone who dares to utter a political word in this country, the FEC leapt at Furgatch and will not let it go. FEC lawyers misread it, misrepresent it, and are rewarded with loss after loss after loss in the courts. 
In last year's fourth circuit decision, which Senator Enzi referred to, ordering the FEC to pay one of its victims, the Christian Action Network's attorney's fees, the `Furgatch-as-a-blank-check-for-issue-advocacy-regulation' fantasy, was thoroughly dissected, debunked and dispensed with. 
The court in the Christian Action Network case puts Furgatch in the proper perspective. 
And let me read some portions of the Christian Action Network case. 
On the authority of Buckley v. Valeo and FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, the district court dismissed the FEC's action against the Network for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, holding that, as `issue advocacy intended to inform the public about political issues germane to the 1992 presidential election,' the advertisements were `fully protected as `political speech' under the First Amendment.' 
Further on in the case, Madam President, the Court said: 
Because the position taken by the FEC in this litigation was foreclosed by clear, well-established Supreme Court caselaw, and it is apparent from the Commission's selective quotation from and citation to those authorities that the agency was so aware, we conclude that the Commission's position, if not assumed in bad faith, was at least not `substantially justified'. . . 
Seven years later, and less than a month following the Court's decision in MCFL, the Ninth Circuit in FEC v. Furgatch, could not have been clearer that it, too, shared this understanding of the Court's decision in Buckley. Although the court declined to `strictly limit' express advocacy to the `magic words' of Buckley's footnote 52 because that footnote's list does `not exhaust the capacity of the English language to expressly advocate election or defeat of a candidate,' curiously, the Ninth Circuit never cited or discussed the Supreme Court's opinion in MCFL, notwithstanding that MCFL was argued in the Supreme Court three months prior to the decision in Furgatch and decided by the Court almost a month prior to the Court of Appeals decision. The Ninth Circuit does discuss the First Circuit's opinion in MCFL, but without noting that certiorari had been granted to review the case. Thus, the Furgatch court relied upon Buckley alone, without the reaffirmation provided by the Court in MCFL, for its conclusion that explicit `words' or `language' of advocacy are required if the Federal Election Campaign Act is to be constitutionally enforced. 
The entire premise of the court's analysis was that words of advocacy such as those recited in footnote 52 were required to support Commission jurisdiction over a given corporate expenditure. * * * * * 
The Court explained that individual words or sentences of the message cannot be considered in isolation, but, rather, must be considered together with the other words and sentences that appear in the communication, in determining whether the message is one of election advocacy: * * * * * 
Then, although noting how `[w]ords derive their meaning from what the speaker intends and what the reader understands,' the court declined to place too much importance on intent because `to fathom [the speaker's] mental state would distract [the court] unnecessarily from the speech itself.' And, finally, although the Court refused to foreclose resort to contextual considerations external to the words themselves, it explained that external context must necessarily be an `ancillary' consideration because it is `peripheral to the words themselves,' and it pointedly noted that such `context cannot supply a meaning that is incompatible with, or simply unrelated to, the clear import of the words.' 
Having established that the emphasis must always be on the literal words of the communication, with little if any weight accorded external contextual factors, the court proceeded to outline what it considered to be `a more comprehensive approach to the delimitation of `express advocacy.' In so doing, the court repeatedly emphasized that the message of candidacy advocacy must appear in the speech, in the words, of the communication if the expenditure of corporate funds for that communication is to be prohibited: 
The court's almost exclusive focus on `speech,' and specifically `speech' defined as the literal words or text of the communication, could not have been clearer. . . . 
This standard can be broken into three main components. First, even if it is not presented in the clearest, most explicit language, speech is `express' for present purposes if its message is unmistakable and unambiguous, suggestive of only one plausible meaning. Second, speech may only be termed `advocacy' if it presents a clear plea for action, and thus speech that is merely informative is not covered by the Act. Finally, it must be clear what action is advocated. Speech cannot be `express advocacy of the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate' when reasonable minds could differ as to whether it encourages a vote for or against a candidate or encourages the reader to take some other [kind of] action. 
We emphasize that if any reasonable alternative reading of speech can be suggested, it cannot be express advocacy subject to the Act's disclosure requirements. 
It is plain that the FEC has simply selected certain words and phrases from Furgatch that give the FEC the broadest possible authority to regulate political speech and ignored those portions of Furgatch quoted above, focusing on the words and text of the message. The ninth circuit did not use other soft language when describing the framework within which the express advocacy determination is to be made. Madam President, let me just say the case is replete with refutation of the Furgatch decision. Clearly, the Furgatch decision is not controlling when it comes to reaching a decision about the appropriateness of the language in the Snowe-Jeffords proposal.

Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Kansas that the example he cited, a cable owner expressing himself without limit about the relevant merits of former Congressman Glickman, would be entirely exempt from anything we are considering here today and entirely current law. 
Let me read a short provision. This is from the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974. 
The term `expenditure' does not include a news story, commentary, or editorial--which is what was happening on that cable station--or editorial distributed for the facilities of any broadcasting station, newspaper, magazine, or other periodical, or publication unless such facilities are owned or controlled by political party, or political committee, or candidate. 
So, I say to my friend from Kansas, to the extent that proposals like Snowe-Jeffords put groups in a position where they would have to disclose significant numbers of their membership and/or donors as a precondition for criticizing or expressing themselves in proximity to an election, the perfect outlet would be to go into the newspaper business. 
I am not suggesting that we put restrictions on newspapers. I don't want to put restrictions on citizens, which is what this debate is all about today. But the first amendment applies to everybody, not just to the press. We get the impression reading the editorials on this issue across the country that the first amendment is the sole province of the press. In fact, the courts have been quite clear about this; it applies to all of us. 
So I would say my friend has put his finger right here on a good way around this growing regulatory environment that is being proposed. Just go into the newspaper business and you are free of it all. You can go out and trash whomever you want. You are not going to have to be regulated by the FEC or anyone else. Have at it. 
And my guess is there would be a proliferation of so-called newspapers under this.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Snowe-Jeffords amendment, while I am sure it is well-intentioned, isn't consistent with the first amendment. The American Civil Liberties Union, America's experts on the first amendment, say that it falls short of the free speech requirements of the U.S. Supreme Court in the first amendment. 
The proponents of this proposal seem to me to be dismayed at all of this speech out there polluting our democracy and our campaigns. The presumption underlying that, of course, is that we as candidates somehow ought to be able to control elections, as if only our voices should be heard. 
The proponents say what we need to do is get all of this speech under control. And the way you do that, of course, is you make the speech accountable to the Government through the Federal Election Commission. They say, `Well, it is just disclosure. All we are asking is just disclosure.' The U.S. Supreme Court in the case of NAACP v. Alabama made it abundantly clear that you could not require of the group its membership list or its donations to be handed over to the Government as a condition for engaging in public discourse. 
So clearly, Mr. President, this measure would not pass muster. 
With regard to nonprofits, the amendment puts all manner of new controls on them if they are so audacious as to mention any of our names near an election. 
Finally, Mr. President, it punishes private citizens who have a constitutional right to support causes popular and controversial without being subject to Federal regulation. 
So, let me just sum it up. 
There isn't any question--and I am sure proponents of this amendment wouldn't deny it--they wouldn't be offering the amendment at all if it were not designed to make it more difficult for groups to criticize all of us in proximity to an election. 
Mr. President, I confess I don't like it. I wish it didn't happen. Even some of those groups that come in in support of us we frequently think make things worse and botch the job. But the Court has been rather clear--crystal clear--that the candidates don't control all of the discourse. We certainly don't control what the newspapers are writing about us in the last few days of an election. And we certainly can't control what groups may say about us to our displeasure in proximity to an election. 
Democracy is sort of a messy thing. It is sort of a messy thing. The speech police don't get to control how everybody participates in our elections. It may frustrate us. But that is the price for a healthy democracy. 
So, Mr. President, at the end of the discussion I will make a motion to table the Snowe-Jeffords amendment, and I hope the motion to table will be approved.

Mr. McCONNELL. Let me take a moment and thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his contribution to this debate. He has very skillfully presented the analogy. The wallet story, I think, is a very, very important addition to the debate and really says a lot about what this is all about. In fact, as the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out, if you are going to have much of an impact on the political dialog in a country of 270 million people, you have to be able to amplify your voice, you have to be able to project your voice to large numbers of citizens or your voice isn't very much. 
Of course, as the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out, Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw and the rest certainly have more speech than we do. Nobody is suggesting that we rein them in. But there are many of us who think their speech is not very helpful, occasionally, to the political process. So I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for a very important speech.

Mr. McCONNELL. I am happy to accommodate the Senator from Arizona. 
Mr. President, I think we have had a very important and useful debate. In many ways it has gone on for the last 10 years in various forms. Prior to 1995, it was the Mitchell-Boren bill. There have been several changes over the years, but fundamentally the issue is this: Do we think we have too much political discourse in this country? 
I would argue, Mr. President, that we do not have any problems in this country related to too much political discussion. The Supreme Court has made it quite clear that in order to effectively discuss issues in this country, one must have access to money, and, frankly, that should not be a shocking concept to anyone going all the way back to the beginning of our country when anonymous pamphlets were passed out supporting the American Revolution. Somebody paid for those. 
Virtually any undertaking, whether it is raising money for Common Cause so that they can get their message out or raising money for a campaign so that it can get its message out or raising money for a political party so it can get its message out or by some group that wants to be critical of any of us up to and including the time just prior to an election, the Supreme Court has appropriately recognized that in order to have effective speech you have to be able to amplify your voice. That is not a new concept. 
It has been around since the beginning of the country. 
So the fundamental issue, Mr. President, is this: Do we have too much political discourse in this country? I would argue that we clearly do not. The political discussion has increased in recent years for several reasons. No. 1, the effective means of communication costs more--nobody has capped inflation in the broadcast industry--and, No. 2, the stakes have been large. 
The Congress was for many years sort of a wholly owned subsidiary of the folks on the other side of the aisle. But since 1994 it has been a good deal more competitive, so the voices have been louder. We had a robust election in 1996 about the future of the country, and a good deal of discussion occurred. But even then, Mr. President, that discussion, converted to money and compared to other forms of consumer consumption, if you will, in this country, was minuscule. One percent of all the commercials in America in 1996 were about politics. So it seems to me, Mr. President, by any standard, we are not discussing these issues too much. 
The other side of the issue that must be addressed is, assuming it were desirable to restrict this discussion, is that a good idea? In order to do that, Mr. President, you have to have a Federal agency essentially trying to control not only the quantity but the quality of discourse in our country. 
The Supreme Court has already made it quite clear that it is impermissible for the Government to control either the quantity or the quality of our political discussion in this country. 
So this kind of regulatory approach to speech is clearly something the courts are not going to uphold. Nor should the Senate uphold that approach. Fundamentally that is the difference between the two sides on this issue. 
Do we think there is too much speech? Or do we think there is too little? Do we think it is appropriate for the Government to regulate this speech? Or do we think it is constitutionally impermissible? That is the core debate here, Mr. President. 
McCain-Feingold, in its most recent form, upon which we will be voting on a motion to table here shortly, in my view, clearly goes in the regulatory direction. It is based on the notion that there is too much political discussion in this country by parties and by groups. 
Mr. President, the political parties do not exist for any other reason than to engage in political discussion. They financed issue advocacy ads with non-Federal money. The pejorative term for that is `soft money,' but it should not be a pejorative thing. The national political parties get involved in State elections, local elections. They need to be there to protect their candidates if they are attacked by the issue ads of someone else. 
All of this is constitutionally protected speech. Obviously, we do not like it when they are saying something against us. We applaud it when somebody is trying to help us. But the problem is not too much discussion, Mr. President. America is not going to get in trouble because of too much discussion. 
In fact, we have killed this kind of proposal now for 10 years. It is unrelated to the popularity of Congress. Congress is currently sitting on a 55 to 60 percent approval rating, the highest approval rating in the last 25 years. It achieved that approval rating in spite of the fact that this issue was not approved last year, nor the year before, and, Mr. President, I am confident will not be approved this afternoon. 
So when a motion to table is made, I hope that the majority of the Senate will support a motion to table McCain-Feingold. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may, I listened with great interest to the comments of the Democratic leader and others on that side of the aisle. Point No. 1 should be crystal clear to everyone who has followed this debate. Forty-eight Senators are not in favor of this measure. 
In the Senate, as we know in recent years, every issue of any controversy requires 60 votes. So it is not at all unusual when an issue cannot achieve 60 votes for it not to go forward. That is the norm around here. 
Point 2. It does not make any difference in what context the issue comes up. There are 48 people in the Senate who are not willing to vote for this measure either on cloture or on a motion to table. So it isn't going to pass. It is not going to pass today, not tomorrow, not 3 months from now, not 5 months from now. We can decide whether we want to waste the Senate's time on an issue that is not going to pass. But it is clearly a waste of time. 
With regard to how unusual it is to fill up the tree, let me just mention that when Senator Mitchell was majority leader in the 103d Congress, he filled up the tree on February 4, 1993; February 24, 1993; January 31, 1994; May 10, 1994; May 18, 1994; June 9, 1994; June 14, 1994; June 14, 1994; and August 18, 1994. Those are nine occasions, Mr. President, when Senator Mitchell, during the 103d Congress, nine occasions in which Senator Mitchell filled up the tree. This is not exactly uncommon. It is not a routine everyday activity, but it certainly is not uncommon. 
In 1977, Jimmy Carter's energy deregulation bill, Senator Byrd was the leader and he filled up the amendment tree. 
In 1984, in the Grove City case, Senator Byrd was in the minority, and he filled up the tree. 
In 1985, the budget resolution, Senator Dole was the majority leader, and he filled up the tree. 
In 1988, campaign finance--it has been around for a while--Senator Byrd filled up the tree, and there were eight cloture votes. 
In 1993, there was an emergency supplemental appropriations bill, the so-called stimulus bill. Senator Byrd filled up the tree. 
Let me say that it is not an everyday action but it is not uncommon for majority leaders to fill up the tree. What is fairly unusual is for the minorities to file cloture motions. Not common, typically done by the majority. And the only cloture motions we have at the desk at the moment are by the minority. 
But the fundamental point is this, Mr. President. There are not enough votes in the Senate to pass this kind of measure. Consequently, it isn't going to happen. That is the way the process works around here. And we can waste a whole lot of time having repetitive votes. The 48 votes that were cast in favor of the motion to table were the same 48 votes that were cast against cloture in October. And it will be the same 48 votes that will be cast whether it is a motion to table or a motion to invoke cloture no matter how many times it is offered. So who is wasting the people's time here? It is certainly not the majority. 
The majority leader sets the agenda. He is anxious to move on to issues that people care about that will make a difference to this country. And clearly, any way you interpret what had happened last October and here in February, there are not enough votes to pass this kind of campaign finance reform. 
So, Mr. President, I just wanted to set the record straight with regard to how unusual it is for a majority leader to fill up the tree and to make the point that the 48 votes that were cast in favor of the motion to table today were the same 48 votes cast against the cloture motion back in October. This is a high water mark in the 10 years I have handled this debate. And 48 votes is the best we have ever done. This measure simply isn't going to pass. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCONNELL. The distinguished Senator from Maine asks rhetorically who would be opposed to disclosure of group contributions? I would say to my friend from Maine, the Supreme Court would be opposed to it. In the 1958 case of NAACP v. Alabama, the Court ruled definitively on the issue of whether a group could be required to disclose its membership or donor list as a precondition for criticism or discussion of public issues. So the Supreme Court very much is opposed to requiring groups, as a condition of engaging in issue advocacy, constitutionally-protected speech, that they have to disclose their list. 
Interestingly enough, two groups that certainly have not been aligned with this Senator on this issue over the years had something to say about that. Public Citizen and the Sierra Club, on the question of disclosure of issue advocacy: 
Top officials in Public Citizen and the Sierra Club Foundation, a separate tax-exempt offshoot of the environmental organization, argued that divulging their donor lists would either give an unfair advantage to competitors or unfairly expose identities of their members. 
`As I am sure you are aware, citizens have a First Amendment right to form organizations to advance their common goals without fear of investigation or harassment.' 
That was Joan Claybrook, with whom I have dueled on this issue for a decade, in response to questions about whether or not Public Citizen would be willing to disclose their donor list. Claybrook goes on: 
We respect our members' right to freely and privately associate with others who share their beliefs, and we do not reveal their identities. We will not violate their trust simply to satisfy the curiosity of Congress or the press. 
Bruce Hamilton, national conservation director for the Sierra Club Foundation, said [of] donors to the separate Sierra Club's political action committee . . . 
Of course they are required to disclose, because they engage in express advocacy. That is part of hard money, part of the Federal campaign system. What Senator Snowe's amendment is about is issue advocacy, which is an entirely different subject under Supreme Court interpretations; an entirely different subject. 
Now, the Sierra Club said with regard to compelling them to disclose their membership as a precondition for engaging in issue advocacy--Hamilton said: 
That is basically saying, `Turn around and give us your membership . . .. We want public disclosure of the 650,000 members of the Sierra Club, which is a valuable resource, coveted by others, because they can turn around and make their own list.' 
The last thing he had to say I find particularly interesting, and knowing the occupant of the Chair is from out West, he might appreciate this. He said: 
It can also be turned around and used against them. We have members in small towns in Wyoming and Alaska (who could by hurt) if word got out that they belong to the Sierra Club. 
So I say to my friend from Maine, this is not in a gray area. The Supreme Court has opined on the question of the Government requiring a donor list of groups as a precondition for expressing themselves at any time--close to an election or any other time. 
My good friend from Maine also cited a 1990 case, commonly referred to as the Austin case, in support of the notion that, somehow, the Court would sanction this new category of electioneering. The Austin case, I am sure my good friend from Maine knows, had to do with express advocacy, not issue advocacy. In the Austin case, they banned express advocacy by corporate treasurers. That of course has been the law since 1907. That is not anything new. You can't use corporate treasury money to engage in express advocacy of a candidate. 
But the definitive case on the issue the Senator from Maine is really talking about, because her amendment deals with issue advocacy, is First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti in 1978, where the Court held that corporations could fund out of their treasuries--out of their treasuries, issue advocacy. 
So, with all due respect to my good friend from Maine, the courts have already ruled on the kind of issues that she is discussing here. No. 1, you can't compel the production of membership lists as a condition to criticize all of us. And, No. 2, issue advocacy cannot be redefined by Congress. The courts have defined what issue advocacy is. 
Now, with regard to the opinion of various scholars, let me just say America's expert on the first amendment is the American Civil Liberties Union, and they wrote me just yesterday, giving their view on the Snowe-Jeffords amendment. Let me read a pertinent part.  
We are writing today, however, to set forth our views on an amendment to that bill dealing with controls on issue advocacy which is being sponsored by Senators Snowe and Jeffords. Although that proposal has been characterized as a compromise measure which would replace certain of the more egregious features of the comparable provisions of McCain-Feingold, the Snowe-Jeffords amendment still embodies the kind of unprecedented restraint on issue advocacy that violates bedrock First Amendment principles. 
Those time-honored principles were set forth with great clarity in Buckley v. Valeo. 
Which we frequently refer to. The ACLU goes on: 
First, `issue advocacy' is at the core of democracy. In rejecting the claim that issue-oriented speech about incumbent politicians had to be regulated because it might influence public opinion and affect the outcome of elections, the Supreme Court reminded us of the critical relationship between unfettered issue advocacy and healthy democracy. `Discussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of the system of government established by our Constitution.' 
Further, the ACLU said: 
. . . in an election season, citizens and groups cannot effectively discuss issues if they are barred from discussing candidates who take stands on those issues. `For the distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application. Candidates, especially incumbents, are intimately tied to public issues involving legislative proposals and governmental actions. Not only do candidates campaign on the basis of their positions on various public issues, but campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest.' 424 U.S. at 43. If any reference to a candidate in the context of advocacy on an issue rendered the speaker or the speech subject to campaign finance controls, the consequences for First Amendment rights would be intolerable. 
Third [the ACLU says] to guard against that, the Court fashioned the critical express advocacy doctrine. 
The Court fashioned it. They didn't say, Congress, you can make up something called electioneering. This is not our prerogative. The Court fashioned the critical express advocacy doctrine, which holds that: 
Only express advocacy of electoral outcomes may be subject to any form of restraint. Thus, only `communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate' can be subject to any campaign finance controls. 
Express advocacy: Within the Federal Election Campaign Act. Issue advocacy: Outside the Federal Election Campaign Act. That just didn't happen last year. This has been the law since Buckley. Issue advocacy has been around since the beginning of the country. 
Finally, and most importantly, all speech which does not in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate is totally immune from any regulation; 
The ACLU continued: 
The Court fashioned the express advocacy doctrine to safeguard issue advocacy from campaign finance controls, even though such advocacy might influence the outcome of an election. The doctrine provides a bright-line, objective test that protects political speech and association by focusing solely on the content of the speaker's words, not the motive in the speaker's mind or the impact on the speaker's audience, or the proximity to an election. 
Nor does it matter whether the issue advocacy is communicated on radio or television, in newspapers or magazines, through direct mail or printed pamphlets. What counts for constitutional purposes is not the medium, but the message. 
My understanding of the Snowe-Jeffords amendment is that these restrictions only apply to television and radio. But there is no constitutional basis for sort of segmenting out television and radio and saying those kinds of expenditures require the triggering of disclosure, but it's OK to go on and engage in direct mail or presumably telephones or anything other than the broadcast medium. That is in a somehow different category. 
By the same token, it is constitutionally irrelevant whether the message costs $100 or $1,000 or $100,000. It is content, not amount, that marks the constitutional boundary for allowable regulation and frees issue advocacy from any impermissible restraint. The control of issue advocacy is simply beyond the pale of legislative authority. 
So the Snowe-Jeffords amendment violates these cardinal principles. First, the amendment's new category, which we have not heard before, of electioneering communication is simply old wine in old bottles with a new label. The provision would reach, regulate and control any person, group or organization which spent more than $10,000 in an entire calendar year for any electioneering communications. 
The ACLU says that critical term is defined solely as any broadcast communication which refers to any Federal candidate at any time within 60 days before a general or 30 days before a primary election and is primarily intended to be broadcast to the electorate for that election, whatever that means. 
The unprecedented provision is an impermissible effort to regulate issue speech which contains not a whisper of express advocacy simply because it refers to a Federal candidate who is more often than not a congressional incumbent during an election season. 
The ACLU says the first amendment disables Congress from enacting such a measure regardless of whether the provision includes a monetary threshold, covers only broadcast media, applies only to speech during an election season and employs prohibition or disclosure as its primary regulatory device. It would still cast a pall over grassroots lobbying and advocacy communication by nonpartisan, issue-oriented groups like the ACLU, for example. 
It would do so by imposing burdensome, destructive and unprecedented disclosure and organizational requirements and barring use of any organizational funding for such communications if any corporations or unions made any donations to the organization.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we will discuss this issue further tomorrow. Let me sum it up by saying the courts are clear. The definition of express advocacy has been written into the laws of this country through court decisions. It is clear what issue advocacy is. It is clear that under previous Supreme Court decisions that you cannot compel a group to disclose its donors or membership lists as a condition for expressing themselves on issues in proximity to an election or any other time for that matter. 
Mr. President, I will be happy to discuss these issues further tomorrow. With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am sorry the Democratic leader has left the floor. I did want to make a couple of observations. 
First, with regard to the Buckley case, it was 9 to 0 on the issue of spending is speech. Quoting that great conservative Thurgood Marshall: 
One of the points on which all Members on the Court agree is that money is essential for effective communication in a political campaign. 
This was an extraordinarily important Supreme Court decision. It wasn't 5 to 4 on any of the critical issues, and, as a matter of fact, Mr. President, the Court has had an opportunity over the last 22 years to revisit the Buckley case in various subcomponent parts and has consistently expanded the areas of permissible political speech. 
I heard the Democratic leader saying all of this spending is getting out of control. Bear in mind that what he is saying is that all of this speaking is getting out of control. What he is suggesting, and our dear colleagues on the other side are suggesting, is we need to get somebody in charge of all this speech and, of course, it is the Government that they want to be in charge of all this speech. The courts are not going to allow that. They didn't allow it in the mid-seventies, they haven't allowed it any time they have revisited that issue since, they are not going to allow it now, and they are not going to allow it ever, because it is not the Government's business to tell citizens how much they get to speak in the American political process. 
The suggestion was made that all this spending is out of control. I always say, how much is too much? I asked my colleague from Wisconsin during the debate last October, how much is too much? I could never get an answer. Maybe today we can get that answer. How much is too much? 
In the 1996 campaign, the discussion was intense. Spending did go up, the stakes were big--big indeed. It was the future of the country--a Presidential election, control of Congress. But we only spent about what the public spent on bubble gum. 
Looking at it another way, Mr. President, of all the commercials that were run in 1996, 1 percent of them were about politics. Speaking too much? By any objective standard, of course not. Of course not. 
It is naive in the extreme to assume everybody in this country has an equal opportunity to speak. Dan Rather gets to speak more than I do and more than the Senator from New Hampshire does, as do Tom Brokaw and Larry King and the editorial page of the Washington Post. Maybe we ought to equalize their speech. I am saying this, of course, tongue in cheek. But you can make the argument, it is the same first amendment, the same right applies to all of us. 
I wonder how they would feel if we said, `OK, you are free to say what you want on the editorial page, but, henceforth, your circulation is limited to 5,000. We haven't told you what to say, but we think you are saying it to too many people, and so the Government has concluded that this is pollution.' 
I heard the Democratic leader talking about all this polluting speech--I am not sure that is the exact word he used --all this negativity, all this hostility. Most of the negativity and hostility I see is on the editorial page of the American newspapers. Maybe we ought to suggest they can't do that in the last 60 days of the election. 
There isn't a court in America that is going to uphold this bill. But the good news is they are not going to get it and have the chance to uphold it. 
The Democratic leader said we wanted to quietly kill it. We are not quietly killing it, we are proudly killing it. We are not apologizing for killing this unconstitutional bill. We are grateful for the opportunity to defend the first amendment. No apologies will be made, not now, not tomorrow, not ever. The Government should not be put in charge of how much American 
citizens as individuals or as members of groups or as political candidates or as political parties may speak to the people of this country. 
I heard the Democratic leader complain that candidates can't control the campaigns. Well, it is not theirs to control. Of course we don't like issue advocacy. Of course we don't like independent expenditures. But the Supreme Court has given no indication that the political candidates are entitled to control all of the discourse in the course of a campaign. I wish I could control the two major newspapers in my State that are always against what I am doing. It irritates me in the extreme, Mr. President. But I am not trying to introduce a bill around here to shut them up the last 60 days of an election. 
The good news is there has been a whole line of court cases on this question of trying to control what is called `issue advocacy'; that is, groups talking about issues at any time they want to, up to and including proximity to an election. 
The FEC has been on a mission for the last few years to try to shut these folks up. They have lost virtually every single case in court. As a matter of fact, in the fourth circuit in a case about a year and a half ago, not only did the FEC lose again, but the court required that they pay the lawyer's fees for the group they were harassing. It was pretty clear, Mr. President, there is no authority to do this. 
That is really where we are in this debate. The American people are not expecting us to take away their right to speak in the political process, and the Supreme Court has made it very, very clear. Let me say it again. They have said, unless you have the ability to amplify your voice, your speech is not worth very much. You could go door-to-door for the rest of your life in California and have no impact on the process. So the Court wisely recognized that citizens under the first amendment had to have their right either as individuals or to band together as a part of a group to amplify their voice. 
Spending has been critical in the political process going back to the founding of the country. Somebody paid for those pamphlets that were distributed around the time of the American Revolution. Somebody paid for those. 
It is suggested under the most recent incarnation of McCain-Feingold, `Oh, we are not going to shut them up, we are just going to make them report their donors.' Put another way, the price for discussing political issues at the end of a campaign is to disclose your donor list. The courts have already dealt with that issue in 1958 in an NAACP case in Alabama, that a group cannot be compelled to disclose its donor list as a condition for criticizing all of us. 
This kind of effort to quash speech, to shut up the critics of candidates is not only going nowhere in the Senate, it is going nowhere in the courts. There has been an effort around the country, financed by some very wealthy people. George Soros, when he is not financing a referenda to legalize marijuana, is also financing this effort. And Jerome Goldberg, one of the wealthy financiers on Wall Street, has been providing money to go out and try and get these kinds of referenda on the ballot and approved around the country. 
The good news is they are all getting struck down. Even if they are passed, they are getting struck down. It happened in California a couple weeks ago. It happened in Wisconsin. The courts understand the law, and the law is clear, and no effort to circumvent the first amendment, either in Washington in the Congress or community by community or State by State around the country is going to succeed, because the law is clear. 
We are not apologetic in defeating this bill. It richly deserves to be defeated. For the moment--I see that there are some colleagues here who wish to speak--let me just recount some of the points from the Buckley case as a way of beginning today's discussion. 
As I said earlier, the great conservative Thurgood Marshall 
said:  
One of the points on which all Members of the Court agree is that money is essential for effective communication in a political campaign. 
That is not Mitch McConnell or Bob Smith, that is Thurgood Marshall. Further excerpts from the Buckley case that we ought to be aware of, the Court said: 
The first amendment denies Government the power to determine that spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, excessive or unwise. 
The Government doesn't have the power to do that to individual citizens and groups. 
The Court went on: 
In the free society ordained by our Constitution, it is not the Government but the people--individually as citizens and candidates and collectively as associations and political committees--who must retain control over the quantity-- 
How much we speak-- and range-- 
What we say-- of debate on public issues in a political campaign. 
In other words, this is beyond the province of Government to regulate in our democracy. 
The Court went on: 
A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the expenditure of money. 
It is a statement of the obvious. It is a statement of the obvious. If it did not require money to communicate, why would Common Cause be doing direct mail finance solicitations all the time? They have to have money to operate. And I do not decry them that opportunity. 
The Court observed that even `distribution of the humblest handbill' costs money. Further, the Court stated that the electorate's increasing dependence on television and radio for news and information makes `these expensive modes of communication indispensable'--Mr. President, this is the Supreme Court--`indispensable instruments of [free speech].' 
In other words, it is a statement of the obvious. In a country of 270 million people, unless you have the ability to amplify your speech, to amplify your voice so you might have a chance of competing with Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw, and the editorial pages of your newspapers, at least during the last 30 days of your election, you do not have a chance. So we shut down all of these people, Mr. President. It is a power transfer to the broadcast industry and to the print industry in this country, which some of us think have a good deal of power as it stands now. 
With regard to the appearance of corruption issue, it is frequently said that all of this money is corrupting the process. The Court held there is `nothing invidious, improper or unhealthy' in campaign spending money to communicate-- nothing. 
With regard to the growth in campaign spending, I heard the Democratic leader projecting some astronomical figure that candidates were going to have to spend in the future. Let me say, there is nobody in the Senate spending all their time raising money. That is said all the time. That is not true. Eighty percent of the money raised in Senate races is raised in the last 2 years, it is raised in the last 2 years by candidates who think they may have a contest. 
What is wrong with that? We do not own these seats. If we are in trouble, we are probably going to want to express ourselves in the campaign. And if you are going to express yourself in the campaign, you are not going to write the check for it out of your own bank account. You better get busy to get the resources to communicate your message or you are history. 
The Court said, with regard to the growth in campaign spending, `. . .the mere growth in the cost of federal election campaigns in and of itself provides no basis'--no basis--`for governmental restrictions on the quantity of campaign spending. . .'--no basis. 
It is often said that we need to level the playing field. How many times have we heard that? The Court addressed that issue in Buckley as well. The Court said, with regard to leveling the playing field, `. . .the concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.' `Wholly foreign to the First Amendment'-- brilliant and thoughtful words from the Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo. 
And the Court has never retreated from the major principles in this case, Mr. President. In fact, they are moving in the opposite direction, in the direction of more and more permissible political speech. 
In fact, one of the few things in the Buckley case that the reformers liked has created one of the biggest problems in the last 20 years. The reformers liked the fact that the Court did uphold 
a limit on how much one could contribute to another, the contribution limit. Well, the Congress has never indexed the contribution limit. Even President Clinton said last month that the hard money contribution should be indexed to inflation. And he was absolutely right. That $1,000 set back in the mid-1970s, at a time when a Mustang cost $2,700, is now worth $320. In a medium- or small-sized State, it does not produce a huge distortion, but it is an absolute disgrace for a candidate seeking to run for office in a big State where you have a huge audience, like California or New York or Texas, to be stuck with a $320 per person contribution limit. 
So ironically, Mr. President, the only part of the Buckley case that the reformers applauded has produced the biggest distortion in the process and the biggest problem for candidates running in large States. 
So, Mr. President, let me just conclude this part of my remarks, as I see others here. We make no apologies for beating this terrible piece of legislation. It does not deserve to pass. It will not pass. The first amendment will be protected. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Washington is entirely correct. Just last Thursday, February 19, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that laws banning ordinary citizens from spending money to promote or denigrate candidates in an election campaign was a breach of human rights. That was in response to a group in England that brought the suit with the argument that their voices were essentially quieted, eliminated, by British law that prohibited them from speaking, in effect, in proximity to the election. So the Europeans are heading in the direction of issue advocacy, which is something, I say to my friend from Washington--and I see my friend and colleague from Utah on his feet as well--that the Supreme Court anticipated in the Buckley case.

Mr. McCONNELL. Absolutely. The Senator is correct. Our friends on the other side of the aisle act as if issue advocacy is a recent invention that has been sort of conjured up and not previously thought of. The Court said in the Buckley case, in laying out the terms for express advocacy, which is the category directly in support of a candidate, which is in the category of FEC money, so-called hard money--they were defining express advocacy, and by definition pointing out that `it would naively underestimate the ingenuity and the resourcefulness of persons and groups to believe that they would have much difficulty devising expenditures that skirted the restrictions on express advocacy of election or defeat, but nevertheless benefited the candidate's campaign.' 
Just one other quote from that same Buckley case: `The distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application.' That was the Supreme Court 22 years ago. `Candidates, especially incumbents, are intimately tied to public issues involving legislative proposals and governmental actions. Not only do candidates campaign on the basis of their positions on various public issues, but campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest.' 
What is the Court saying? They are saying, in effect, that there is this whole category of discussion in this country that, under the first amendment, citizens are entitled to engage in, whether candidates like it or not. I mean, the whole assumption of 
the argument on the other side is that somehow the candidates have a right to control the election, control the discourse, in this selected period right before the election. Well, the Court anticipated that. They have already dealt with it. You clearly can't do it. We don't own these elections. Besides, as my friend from Washington pointed out, nobody is suggesting that the newspapers shut up during that period of time. Obviously, this would enhance their power dramatically. 
Now, I will stipulate and concede that all of us candidates don't like all of this discourse that we don't control. Sometimes there are people coming in trying to help us and we think they are botching the job. Sometimes people are trying to hurt us, and that is particularly offensive. But it is absolutely clear that we cannot, by statute, shut all these people up, cleanse the process of all of this discussion, and control the campaign.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may, I want to follow up on some observations by my friend from Utah. The underlying bill seeks to abolish what is pejoratively referred to as `soft money.' In fact, as the Senator from Utah and I know, soft money should not be a pejorative term. It is, in fact, everything that isn't hard money. Our two great political parties, of course, are interested in who gets to be Governor in Utah; occasionally, they are interested in who gets to be mayor of Salt Lake City. They are, in fact, Federal parties. 
So, in the aftermath of McCain-Feingold, you would have a complete federalization of the American political process, I guess putting the FEC in charge of the city council races in Salt Lake City.

<TEXT>
Mr. McCONNELL. A good point, I say to my friend from Utah. 
It has been suggested by some around here that party soft money could simply be abolished, and that is what this underlying bill seeks to do. I doubt that, Mr. President. 
A law professor at Capital University in Columbus, OH, who is an expert in this field, in a recent article in a Notre Dame Law School Journal of Legislation was pointing out with regard to the prospects of eliminating non-Federal money for the parties by Federal legislative action and said, in referring to the Colorado case in 1996: 
The precedent makes clear that political parties have the rights to engage in issue advocacy-- 
Which is funded by the so-called `soft money'-- as other entities. In Colorado Republican Party v. FEC, the Republican Party ran a series of advertisements critical of the Democratic nominee for a U.S. Senate seat from Colorado. At the time the ads ran, the Republican nominee had not been determined, and the three candidates were actively seeking that nomination. 
That was the fact situation in that case. 
The Court rejected the FEC's position that a political party could not make expenditures independently of a candidate's campaign. 
Independent expenditures are hard money; issue advocacy is soft money. So let's get them divided. 
The Court held that the facts quite clearly showed that the defendant Republican Party expenditures in the race were independent of any candidate's campaign and so could not be limited as contributions to the candidate's campaign directly. If a political party can conduct express advocacy--that is independent and hard money--if a political party can conduct express advocacy campaigns independently of its candidates, surely it can conduct an issue ad campaign independently of its candidates. The Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee held that political parties' rights under the first amendment are equal to--equal to--those of other groups and entities: `The independent expression of a political party's views is `core' First Amendment activity no less than is the independent expression of individuals, candidates or other political committees.' In reaching this conclusion, the Court was not breaking new ground, but again merely following established law granting parties the right to speak on political issues. 
I cite that, Mr. President, just to make a point in discussion with my friend from Utah that there is virtually no chance the courts would say that the Congress, by legislation, can prevent the parties from engaging in issue advocacy. We already know they can engage in independent expenditures which are financed by so-called `hard money,' Federal money. Everybody else in America can engage in issue advocacy. The Senator from Utah can do it by himself. He can do it as part of a group. There is no change. The courts are going to say parties can engage in issue advocacy. 
I commend my friend from Utah for his statement. He is absolutely correct, there is no chance that this bill, were it to be passed, which it will not be passed, but if it were to be passed, would be held constitutional. In fact, the courts are going in the opposite direction, in the direction of more and more political speech, more and more discourse, more and more discussion. 
We do not have a problem in this country because we have too little political discussion. That is not a problem. Even though, as the Senator from Utah wisely pointed out, we frequently do not like the content, the tone of the campaign, it is not ours to control. Nobody said we had ownership rights over the campaign. Lots of people are entitled to have their say. 
I thank my friend from Utah for his fine statement. I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. Maybe a good place to wrap up the morning discussion, which I think has been a good one, is to call to the attention of Members of the Senate an NPR morning edition commentary by a woman named Wendy Kaminer who is a professor at Radcliffe College--not exactly a bastion of conservatism. This was NPR's morning edition, December 3, 1997, on the subject we are debating here today. 
Professor Kaminer said in her commentary that morning: 
Protecting the act of spending money as we protect the act of speaking means standing up for the rights of the rich, something not many self-identified progressives are eager to do. 
But the realization that money controls the exercise of rights is hardly new. Money translates into abortion rights, for example, as well as speech. Indeed, liberals demand Medicaid funding for abortions precisely because they recognize that money insures reproductive choice. Money also insures the right to run for office. Liberal support for reforms that provide minimum public subsidies to candidates is based on an implicit recognition that exercising political speech requires spending money. 
So proposed public financing schemes are based on the fact that reformers like to deny--the fact that sometimes money effectively equals speech. Reformers who support public financing argue persuasively that candidates with no money have virtually no chance to be heard in the political marketplace. They want to provide more candidates with a financial floor, in order to insure more political speech. It is simply illogical for them to deny that a financial celing--caps on contributions and expenditures--is a ceiling on political speech. 
It is absurd to deny that that is a cap on political speech. Professor Kaminer went on: 
We need campaign finance reform that respects speech and the democratic process; it would subsidize needy candidates and impose no spending or contribution limits on anyone. 
She says: 
I'm not denying that money sometimes corrupts. It corrupts everything, from politics to religion. But if some clergymen spend the hard-earned money of their followers on fast women and fancy cars, there are others who raise money in order to spend it on the poor. While some politicians seek office for personal gain, others seek to implement ideas, however flawed. Money only corrupts people who are already corruptible. It is terribly naive and misleading for reformers to label their proposals `clean election laws.' Dirty politicians who sell access and lie to voters in campaign ads will not suddenly become clean politicians when confronted with limits on contributions and spending. 
Reformers are guilty of false advertising when they market campaign finance reform as a substitute for integrity. Politicians are corrupted by money when they are unprincipled. Limiting the flow of money to them will not increase their supply of principles. And, in the end, money may be less corrupting than a desire for power, which can engender a willingness to pander rather than lead. 
Finally, she says: 
If I wanted to influence Bill Clinton, I would not write him a check, I'd show him a poll. 
So, Mr. President, it is the denial of the obvious to conclude that the limitation on the financing of campaigns or restrictions on the ability of individuals or groups to amplify their message is anything other than a degrading, a quantification, a limitation of their ability to express themselves in our democracy. And the bill that we have before us essentially seeks to weaken the parties and make it impossible for outside groups to criticize us in proximity to an election. 
There is no chance the courts would uphold this, but fortunately we are not going to give them a chance to rule on this because we are not going to pass this ill-advised legislation. 
Mr. President, how much time is left?

Mr. McCONNELL. The measure before us today is the Paycheck Protection Act, authored by the distinguished majority leader and the assistant majority leader. The Paycheck Protection Act is predicated on a fundamental tenet of any truly free society--that no person should be forced to support a cause or a candidate. 
It is really quite that simple. Thomas Jefferson, perhaps, best enunciated this principle with a characteristic eloquence that we will likely hear often during the course of this debate, and it certainly merits repetition. 
Mr. Jefferson observed:  
To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical. 
Sinful and tyrannical as it is, union bosses do it every day. Millions of Americans are on the receiving end of this tyranny as a portion of their paychecks are confiscated and used to advance a political agenda with which many of them disagree. That fact, Mr. President, should not be in dispute. 
Ten years have passed since the Supreme Court's Beck decision in which the Court ruled that workers who are forced to pay union dues as a condition of employment cannot be forced to pay dues beyond those necessary for collective bargaining. Yet, most union workers still have no relief. Their unions provide them with little or no information of their rights. 
A national survey last year revealed that most union workers are not even aware of their rights under the Beck decision. Even more deplorable, many union workers' efforts to exercise their constitutional rights under Beck have been met with intimidation and with stonewalling. In a telling illustration, a union worker testified before Congress in 1997, just last year, that `almost immediately the lies started: anti-union, scab, freeloader, and religious fanatic were labels ascribed to me,' said a union member. That poor fellow had to resort to a lawsuit to get his union dues reduced in accordance with Beck. 
The onus, Mr. President, should not be on the workers. It should not be the workers' burden to pursue an after-the-fact refund or to wait until the end of the year and have to jump through hoops to get returned to him or her money that should not have been taken in the first place. 
Our friends on the other side of the aisle are understandably alarmed at the prospect of their most powerful, aggressive and well-funded ally losing a significant portion of the political war chest after workers are freed from the compulsory dues tyranny. 
Mr. President, we know what happens. Washington State voters, back in 1992, by an overwhelming margin--70 percent, by the way, supported this--approved a referendum to make it illegal for unions to extract dues for political purposes without obtaining prior written approval from union workers. After this emancipation, only 82 of Washington State's public employee union members gave the union permission to take their money for political purposes. Prior to the voters' action, 40,000 Washington State employees had been forced to stand by helplessly as a chunk of their paychecks were confiscated and used without their consent to advance the political causes of the union bosses. 
The number of Washington State teachers union members contributing even a modest dollar amount to the union bosses' political fund dropped from 48,000 down to 8,000. Now, all politicians who benefited from the union largess, a largess born of forced contributions, intimidation, and a conspiracy of silence, will understandably tremble at the prospect of losing it. 
For them, the sounds of paycheck protection roaring down the legislative tracks must be terrifying indeed. Nationwide, over 80 percent of the American people support a Federal Paycheck Protection Act. 
But I am certainly not so naive as to think union workers will see this freedom coming out of Washington, DC, because President Clinton would surely veto it. The union bosses have been so generous to the Clinton-Gore campaigns over the years that the Lincoln Bedroom probably feels like home. 
Fortunately for America's union workers, they may well see relief in those States with the referendum process or political leaders less beholden to union bosses than is the President of the United States. 
So, Mr. President, there is a lot of action out in the States. Proponents of paycheck protection are heartened by the reception they are getting out in the States. It will be on the ballot in California this June. Californians will have an opportunity to strike a blow for freedom for union workers. Freedom's prospects are quite bright there. 
But the union bosses will resist this freedom for the rank and file. The union bosses will fight it with everything at their disposal, including the hundreds of millions of dollars they have amassed for political use from the workers' dues. It is expected that union bosses will spend $20 million or more in California in their quest to defeat this freedom quest for the rank and file. 
I am confident that Californians will not be duped by the union bosses and their millions. Paycheck protection rings true to regular folks and not even the most sophisticated, well-funded smear campaign will drown it out. 
There is going to be paycheck protection referenda in other States as well, Mr. President. I think there are four or five that are going to be on the ballot this year. There are movements all across America in State legislatures to press forward with bills giving union members these basic, fundamental rights. So to have this kind of measure described as a `poison pill' is amusing indeed. 
It is fundamental, Mr. President, that no one in this country ought to be forced to contribute to causes with which they might disagree. So we will press forward with this issue and hope for the best. But it will go forward on a State-by-State basis regardless of what happens here in Washington. 
Now, Mr. President, let me just make a few more observations. 
I see that my friend from Tennessee is here, and I won't delay him too long. I do want to make some observations about the larger question of McCain-Feingold. The whole motive behind this reform agenda for the last 22 years has been a disappointment, Mr. President, in the Supreme Court decision of Buckley v. Valeo, which was, of course, a great victory for the American people. The Court said in the Buckley case that spending is speech. When you first hear that, you sort of scratch your head and say, `Gee, could that be true?' But when you think about it and when you read the decision, it is obviously the case that in a country of 270 million people, unless you can amplify your voice, you don't have much speech. Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings have a lot of speech--way more than any of us--because their speech is amplified every night to millions of Americans. But the Court said to put Americans in a straitjacket of spending limits is to say that they are left only with inadequate speech--in other words, a kind of continuing effort to go door-to-door, I guess, to carry your message to more and more Americans. 
In fact, the Court said a spending limit would be about like saying you are free to travel, but you can only have $100. How free are you? You are not very free if you can't amplify your voice. The Court said you are going to have a constitutional first amendment right to amplify your voice, either with your own resources or that of others gathered together in a common purpose to advance a particular cause. The cause could be speaking for a candidate, or against a candidate, or advocating an issue, or opposing an issue. 
In fact, the whole Court case was crafted in the direction of a wide amount of permissible political discourse in this country. Well, the reformers hated that decision, and they have been coming back and coming back and coming back over the years, and it has had different names in different Congresses. A few years ago it was Boren-Mitchell. Now it is McCain-Feingold. But, fundamentally, the philosophy is the same: What is wrong with the system is that we just don't have enough regulation. We just don't have enough restraint on the voices of all of these Americans who are running around expressing themselves, and we don't like it. 
So McCain-Feingold has been constantly changing, and the version we currently have before us is a little bit different from earlier versions. The original version sought to put the Government in charge of the political speech of individuals, groups, candidates, and parties. The current version, which is the same version that was defeated in October, seeks to put the Government in charge of the political speech of parties and groups, leaving aside individuals and leaving aside candidates. 
So let me focus just a minute, Mr. President, on the kind of speech that parties and groups engage in. It is said that, because of the scandals of 1996, we should take away from the political parties their ability to function in State and local races. It's called getting rid of soft money. What happened in 1996, Mr. President? As the distinguished majority leader pointed out, and as Senator Thompson's hearings have confirmed, we had arguable violations of existing laws; that is, contributions from foreigners, money laundering, and raising money on Federal property. All of that is against the law now. What that cries out for is enforcement of the law. 
This bill--McCain-Feingold--doesn't have anything to do with the scandals of 1996. It is a totally different subject. This bill is seeking to restrain, to inhibit, to diminish the voices of American citizens in their effort to participate in the political process through their political parties, or through groups they may belong to. 
Now, the courts have had a good deal to say about that, Mr. President. Let me start with the groups. The courts have said that a group or, for that matter, an individual can go out and engage in what's called issue advocacy, without having to ask permission from the Federal Government, without having to register with the Federal Election Commission, or subject itself to the rules that apply to candidates and to parties in Federal elections. The Court has said that as long as you don't say `vote for' or `vote against,' you are permitted wide latitude to applaud, condemn, say whatever you want to in the American political process. 
There has been a whole line of cases on the question of issue advocacy. The Federal Election Commission doesn't like the law on issue advocacy. It has been pursuing groups over the years and it has lost every single case. In fact, the last case the FEC lost was in the Fourth Circuit, and they not only lost the case, but were required to pay the lawyer's fees of the other side because the FEC just didn't get it. They couldn't read the law. 
It is very clear. We don't have the authority here in the Congress to keep people from criticizing us. We don't like it. We love to be able to control the entire election. But we don't own the election. The election is not the property of the candidates, and if people want to criticize us early or late, the courts are not going to allow us to interfere with that. 
One of the mutations of this that is developing that we have heard about and read about may be offered by the senior Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe. 
I gather, in addition to trying to change the rules on issue advocacy, that it would also, in proximity to the election, require the group to disclose. 
Mr. President, the courts have already spoken on that issue. They spoke on it as early as 1958 on the question of whether you could require a group to disclose their sources of funds or their membership lists as a condition for criticism. In the case of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP v. Alabama in 1958, the court made it very, very clear that it is a real threat to citizens' groups and to their right to band together and express themselves to require them as a condition for expressing themselves that they disclose their membership. 
The court said in that case, `Compelled disclosure of membership in an organization engaged in advocacy of particular beliefs' . . . is inappropriate. `Inviolability of privacy in group association may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.' 
The court went on to say:  
We think it apparent that compelled disclosure of petitioner's Alabama membership is likely to affect adversely the ability of petitioner and [*463] its members to pursue their collective effort to foster beliefs which they admittedly have the right to advocate, in that it may induce members to withdraw from the Association and dissuade others from joining it because of fear of exposure of their beliefs shown through their associations and of the consequences of this exposure. 
In other words, Mr. President, there will probably be another effort here to shut down issue advocacy. Members may argue that we are not really telling them they can't speak; we are just saying they have to disclose if they speak. The courts have already said you can't do that; you can't require people to disclose their membership as a precondition for expressing their beliefs. 
So it gets back to the fundamental point: We don't own these elections. Most of us do not like it when some group comes in. Even if they are trying to help us, we usually think they are botching it. We hate all of these voices that are outside of our campaigns and outside of our control. But that is the price you pay for free speech in a democracy--that is the price you pay for free speech in a democracy. 
So all of these efforts to try to shut these groups up by forcing them to come under the Federal Election Commission, by forcing them into the hard money camp, by trying to make it difficult for them to express themselves in proximity to an election, there is no court in America that would uphold that. It is so clearly and blatantly unconstitutional that we ought not to do it. 
The other entity that the most recent version of McCain-Feingold seeks to shut up are our great political parties. Soft money has become a pejorative term. Let me define it: Soft money is everything that isn't hard money. Hard money, by definition, is money raised and spent in support of Federal candidates. But, as we know, Mr. President, this is a Federal system. The two great national parties--the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee--care who gets elected Governor of Tennessee and who controls the legislature in Tennessee. They may even care who gets to be mayor of Knoxville. They have at times even cared who the county commissioner was going to be in whatever county Knoxville is in. These are national parties. The only way you could eliminate non-Federal money by definition is to federalize everything. So that the Federal Election Commission would then be in charge of the city council races in Nashville. 
That is a great step in the right direction--just what we need. The FEC would be the size of the Pentagon with reams of files in every race in America. 
The second problem with eliminating non-Federal money is a practical problem. As I have already indicated, you will not be able to constitutionally eliminate issue advocacy from the American political scene. It cannot be done. If we tried to do that, it would be struck down. Maybe. We don't know. Some court could uphold an effort to eliminate so-called soft money for the national parties. I don't know. I doubt it. 
But let's assume they would uphold it. Then, Mr. President, the situation would be this: The two great political parties, which exist only for the purpose of electing candidates, would be the only entities in America that could not engage in issue advocacy. Everybody else can--from the AFL-CIO to the Sierra Club to the Chamber of Commerce. Only political parties wouldn't be able to engage in issue advocacy. 
So the candidates of those parties would be defenseless when groups hostile or individuals hostile to candidates of their parties came in and engaged in issue advocacy, particularly in proximity to an election. So the parties which exist for no other purpose other than to elect candidates would be restricted in engaging in issue advocacy presumably in defense of the candidates who wore their party label--a perfectly absurd result, Mr. President; a perfectly absurd and undesirable result of a quest to end non-Federal money. 
Mr. President, fortunately, the Senate is not going to take that step. There is not a consensus for any of these so-called reforms. Fortunately, there is strong support for the first amendment. 
I am glad that our friends in the press believe in the first amendment. They are the practitioners of the first amendment. They have from time to time believed that it only applied to them, which I have always found somewhat amusing. 
I started last year asking reporters with whom I discuss this issue whether they have read Buckley. At the beginning of 1997 almost no one had. I am pleased to report that it got better. More and more reporters sat down and struggled their way through the Buckley case, and, all of a sudden, eyes popped open and they began to realize that the first amendment was not the sole prerogative--or property, shall I say--of the fourth estate. It exists for all of us. 
I have been perplexed, frankly, at the editorial support around the country for McCain-Feingold. The ACLU has been perplexed, too. I will just read a few observations from a letter of December 29 that they sent out to editorial boards around the country. 
The ACLU said:  
We're perplexed. As Washington prepares for another round of campaign finance debate, we are deeply puzzled about why so many--particularly in the media--continue to support campaign finance legislation like the McCain-Feingold bill that is patently unconstitutional, unlikely to pass and doomed to failure in the courts. 
Frankly, we're also worried. Polls are beginning to suggest that the media's cavalier disregard for the free speech implications of current campaign finance proposals is encouraging an attitude among the public that could lead to serious damage to freedom of the press. A recent Rasmussen Research survey, for example, found that Americans believe that one of the best ways to clean up campaigns is to restrict newspaper coverage of elections. 
Mr. President, I am not advocating that. But imagine the Washington Post calling for spending limits. It makes about as much sense as the Congress saying to the media, `You are free to say whatever you want to but, by the way, your circulation is limited.' And I wonder how the Washington Post would feel if the Congress decided it could only have a 5,000 circulation--not saying that Congress can have any impact on what the Washington Post can say--but that we just think the Post is speaking to too broad an audience, and it is spending too much. Obviously, I am being facetious. But it is the same principle. It is the very same principle. 
Advocates of spending limits say we are not telling you what to do; we just think you are saying it too much or too many, but your audience is too widespread. We may all snicker about this issue. But, frankly, the public has a lot of skepticism about the press. 
I am looking at an article by Richard Harwood in the Washington Post from last October referring to a study of public opinion commissioned in 1990 by the American Society of Newspaper Editors. It is part of the observance of the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights. Dick Harwood points out that a Lou Harris survey for that group more recently had some, as he put it, `depressing findings.' This is Harwood's observation about the Lou Harris poll of the American people. He said: 
If they had their way, `the people'--meaning a majority of adults--would not allow journalists to practice their trade without first obtaining, as lawyers and doctors must license. Whether the preferred licensing authority would be the government or some other credentialing agency is not clear. 
That was the majority view of the American public with regard to the licensing of the media. 
Number two, referring to the survey: 
They would confer on judges the power to impose fines on publishers and broadcasters for `inaccurate and biased reporting' and would liberalize libel laws to make it easier for plaintiffs to win judgments against the press. 
This is the majority view of the American people now. Third: 
They would empower government entities to monitor the work of journalists for fairness and compel us to `give equal coverage to all sides of a controversial issue.' They also favor the creation of local and national news councils to investigate complaints against the press and issue corrections' of erroneous news reports. 
That is the view of the American public, Mr. President. 
Also, from this Rasmussen Research study, that I referred to earlier, there is a release from this institute of October 2, 1997, which has an interesting finding. It says: 
Most Americans think that friendly reporters are more important to a successful political campaign than money, according to a Rasmussen Research survey of 1,000 adults. By a 3-to-1 margin (61% to 19%) Americans believe that if reporters like one candidate more than another, that candidate is likely to win--even if the other candidate raised more money in the campaign. 
Further: 
Americans are also generally suspicious of reporters. More than seven-out-of-ten registered voters believe that the personal biases of reporters affect their coverage of stories, issues, and campaigns. 
I cite this somewhat tongue and cheek to make the point that the first amendment applies to all of us. Just because the American public is skeptical of the press and its motivations doesn't mean that we want to restrict the press. By the same token, Mr. President, it is astonishing to find so many editorial boards around the country that do not understand that the first amendment doesn't just apply to the press. It applies to all of us. 
So, Mr. President, when all is said and done and this debate is ended, the Constitution will still be intact and the ability of individuals, groups, candidates, and parties who participate in the American political process without regulation or interference by the Government will be preserved.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Stan Cave, who represents the 45th district (Lexington) in the Kentucky House of Representatives. Representative Cave has been recognized by the National Republican Legislators Association as one of their ten Legislators of the Year. 
I am proud to have joined several of his General Assembly colleagues in nominating Stan for this award. I have worked closely with Stan since his election to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1993, on a variety of issues of importance to our constituents. 
Since his election, Stan has risen quickly in the Republican leadership in the Kentucky House. He currently serves as Chairman of the House Republican Caucus. For the past two years, Stan has played a major role in overhauling Kentucky's Workers' Compensation laws, as well as other important issues ranging from Higher Education Reform to the state budget. 
Outside of the General Assembly, Stan has been very generous with his time to both Republican causes and candidates for office. As Recruitment Chairman for the Fayette County Republican Party, Stan has worked tirelessly to find quality candidates for Congress, the state legislature, Mayor and Council in his home community of Lexington, Kentucky. 
Mr. President, in just a few short years, Stan Cave has become a respected contributor to Kentucky government and politics. His meteoric rise has now been recognized and rewarded by the National Republican Legislators Association as a 1997 Legislator of the Year, a great and well deserved honor.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the recent recognition of the redesigned Chevrolet Corvette as Motor Trend magazine's 1998 Car of the Year. By recognizing the 1998 Corvette with one of the automobile industry's most prestigious awards, the editors of Motor Trend bestow a great honor, not only on the car, but more importantly on those men and women who design and build the Corvette in Bowling Green, Kentucky. 
Motor Trend--in celebrating the radically-redesigned 1998 Corvette--points to the new, cleaner 5.7 liter/345 horsepower V-8 engine, a lighter, more refined chassis, and an impressive 24.9 cubic feet of cargo space, noting that `the new Corvette will be remembered as one of the greatest cars in American automotive history.' 
The selection of the Corvette further signals the resurgence of great American cars. I am proud that the Corvette has been at the forefront of this revival. 
This award is a testament to the tireless efforts of those in Bowling Green who have designed and assembled the Corvette since 1981, when the shiny new plant was born from an old Chrysler Air Temps facility. Since Corvette production moved from St. Louis 18 years ago, the people of Bowling Green have been proud to carry on the tradition of America's original roadster. 
Mr. President, by honoring the Corvette, the editors of Motor Trend honor all the hard-working men and women in my home state of Kentucky who have played a role in all stages of the production of the new, 5th generation Corvette. I offer my congratulations to all those who work for Chevrolet in Bowling Green, whose innovative thinking and diligence has resulted in the Corvette winning this prestigious award.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the employees at the Erlanger, Kentucky, headquarters of Toyota's North American manufacturing operations as well as those at the Georgetown Toyota assembly plant whose dedication and hard work have resulted in the Toyota Camry becoming the number one selling car in the United States for 1997. 
By recording its best-ever sales month in December, the Camry edged past traditional favorites--the Honda Accord and the Ford Taurus--to become the best selling car in the United States--the first time a Toyota automobile has been so recognized. 
Because dealers had a hard time keeping both the Accord and the Camry in stock this year, the primary factor in determining which model sold best was which company could get the most out of its assembly line. I am proud to report that, because of the industriousness of those men and women who work in the Georgetown plant, there were enough Camrys on dealer's lots to outsell both the Accord and the Taurus. And by the way, 80% of all Camrys sold in the U.S. have been assembled in Georgetown. 
This past year, the Camry plant in Georgetown increased production by 12% over the previous year, mostly by improving efficiency on the assembly line and pressing suppliers to keep up with their demand for raw materials. 
Despite the tremendous growth this year, officials at the Georgetown plant say that they intend to build even more Camrys next year, as they improve the speed of the assembly line and further improve the plant's efficiency. 
Mr. President, again, I would like to congratulate all those men and women associated with Toyota Motor Sales, USA, particularly those in Erlanger and Georgetown, whose dedication and hard work made the Camry 1997's top selling car.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to a serious and deeply troubling crisis in our country. This is a crisis of confidence, of credibility, and of integrity. Our Nation is indeed at a crossroads. Will we pursue the search for truth, or will we dodge, weave, and evade the truth? 
I am, of course, referring to the investigation into serious allegations of illegal conduct by the President of the United States--that the President has engaged in a persistent pattern and practice of obstruction of justice. The allegations are grave, the investigation is legitimate, and ascertaining the truth--the whole truth, and nothing but the unqualified, unevasive truth--is absolutely critical. The search for truth is being led by a highly capable former Solicitor General of the United States and a former judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, Kenneth Starr. 
Mr. President, I am deeply troubled today because Judge Starr's pursuit of the truth is being undermined every step of the way, every single day, in the press by those whose sole mission is to attack and impugn the court-appointed independent prosecutor and the congressionally created process. These attackers are not the journalists or the broadcasters. 
Mr. President, what troubles me the most here is that these reckless attacks and ruthless onslaughts are being carried out by the closest advisers to the President of the United States. 
Just this past Sunday on Meet the Press, Paul Begala, Assistant to the President, accused Judge Starr of leaks and lies and called him `corrupt.' That is not a paraphrase, that is a direct quote. He actually used the word `corrupt.' The smear campaign is being orchestrated by the White House. 
Obviously, I can't vouch for the truth or falsity of the obstruction-of-justice charges against the President. But what I can tell you is that the assaults on Judge Starr, the character assassination against the court-appointed independent prosecutor, is authorized and approved by the President of the United States. And it should stop. 
The White House and the First Lady have announced that the President's problems are nothing more than a `vast right-wing conspiracy.' As many commentators have pointed out, this so-called conspiracy is so vast and so broad that it encompasses both the media and a White House intern. 
But I would like to point out today that the vast and broad conspiracy just got bigger. Apparently, this vast right-wing conspiracy is so sweeping and so pernicious that, in 1993, it compelled a Democrat-chaired Ethics Committee in a Democratic-controlled Congress to appoint Judge Kenneth Starr to help investigate whether Republican Senator Bob Packwood should be expelled from the U.S. Senate. 
Mr. President, let me refresh the recollection of the Senate regarding the 3-year Packwood investigation, which began in late 1992 and ended with Senator Packwood's resignation in 1995. 
I was the vice chairman, and later the chairman, of the Ethics Committee during that investigation. As everyone will recall, that investigation was a very sensitive, personal and serious matter. It involved the allegation that Senator Packwood had `engaged in sexual misconduct' and `attempted to intimidate and discredit the alleged victims, and misuse[d] official staff in attempts to intimidate and to discredit.' 
During this lengthy investigation, Senator Packwood objected to the Ethics Committee's review of his personal diary entries in the fall of 1993. The committee proposed a process where the diaries would be reviewed by an independent hearing examiner who would serve two functions: First, the examiner would review the diaries to ensure that the committee would see all relevant and probative information. Second, the examiner was asked to protect 
the privacy interests of Senator Packwood, his family and friends. 
The Ethics Committee had to choose a person who was fair, impartial, prudent, and trustworthy. Someone who wouldn't be on a vendetta against Democrats or Republicans; someone who had earned the clear respect of both parties; someone with the highest integrity; someone with a clean track record; a man with sound credentials, who was above reproach. And the Ethics Committee chose such a man. 
They chose a man who was the son of a Baptist minister, a graduate of Duke University Law School, a former clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger. The Ethics Committee--chaired at the time by a Democrat in a Democrat-controlled Congress--chose a man who was the former Solicitor General of the United States, a former judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals. 
That man was Kenneth Starr. 
Let me tell you who was on the committee at that time. The committee was chaired by my colleague from Nevada, Dick Bryan. The Republicans on the committee included myself, Senator Craig and Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire. The other Democrats were my dear colleagues, Senator Mikulski of Maryland and the current minority leader, Senator Tom Daschle. 
The matter was not quiet and secretive. The entire U.S. Senate knew who would be called upon to exercise impartiality, discretion, and judgment in a highly important and highly sensitive matter. We actually discussed this matter on the floor of the Senate because there was a needed Senate action to enforce the subpoenas. Senator Alan Simpson referred to Judge Starr as `a splendid man,' and `a man of judgment, honesty, integrity, and common sense.' 
Senator Arlen Specter stated, `Many people have spoken about [Judge Starr's] integrity, and the committee has already endorsed his standing. . . . If Judge Starr makes a judgment, that is the judgment. That is it.' 
My colleagues on the other side didn't object or dispute that notion. For example, Senator John Kerry, of Massachusetts, voiced the consensus opinion when he declared on the Senate floor that `Judge Starr is certainly a neutral party.' 
And, it didn't stop with the Democratic-chaired Ethics Committee and the Democrat-controlled Congress. In 1994, the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia had to choose someone to serve as a special master to help enforce the Ethics Committee's subpoena for the Packwood diaries. 
The court had to choose a man who was fair, impartial, prudent, and trustworthy; again, someone who wouldn't be on a vendetta against Democrats or Republicans; again, someone who had earned the clear respect of both parties, and someone with the highest integrity, who was above reproach. 
The court chose such a man, Mr. President. It chose the former Solicitor General of the United States and a former judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals, Kenneth Starr. 
So, today, we examine the White House's ludicrous, self-serving claim of a `vast right-wing conspiracy' and find that the conspiracy has ensnared even more than we would have ever imagined. The `vast right-wing conspiracy' can now count as members the Democrat-chaired Ethics Committee in 1993 and the then Democrat-controlled Senate. And, lest we forget, the conspiracy can also count the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia as one of its members. 
My point here, Mr. President, is simple: The attacks on Kenneth Starr are unfounded and unproductive. The attacks are, in fact, unconscionable. 
Let me point out, as far as this crazy conspiracy theory is concerned, most people would agree that the Senator from Kentucky has fairly solid conservative Republican credentials. If somebody were engineering a `vast right-wing conspiracy,' I think I might have gotten wind of it. Furthermore, let me point out that I don't know Ken Starr. I do not recall ever meeting him in my 14 years in Washington. If he were a fire-breathing Republican ideologue, one would think that, as active in Republican politics as I have been over the last 15 years, I might have run into him someplace along the line. 
The crisis in the White House is a crisis for our entire country. The crisis will only be resolved by a fair and sober search for the truth. It is clear from the record that Judge Starr is the right man for this job. I think that it is important for the President and his people to stop this smear campaign. Let Ken Starr do his court-appointed job and let the American people learn the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act of 1998 being introduced today by the Chairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, Senator Lugar; Ranking Member Harkin; and Ranking Member Leahy, of the Research, Nutrition, and General Legislation and myself as Chairman of that Subcommittee. 
In the past, nutrition programs under the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee have been fashioned in a bipartisan manner. Today's introduction of legislation to reauthorize those child nutrition programs expiring in 1998, is a starting point. 
Our Child Nutrition Programs have played an essential role in promoting the long-term health of our children. These programs provide a vital link between diet and health, ensuring that our children have access to nutritious food. 
Mr. President, Chairman Lugar has described the programs that must be reauthorized and the critical importance these programs serve in providing a safety net for children. While, I agree that these programs must be reauthorized, we must not overlook the opportunity to review the existing structure of these programs, review priorities, and determine if improvements and streamlining can enhance their effectiveness. 
One area of particular interest to me is a provision expiring under the National School Lunch Act which required a two state pilot project for for-profit day care centers in the Child and Adult Care Food Program. The two states were Kentucky and Iowa. In Kentucky, 242 for-profit child care centers participate in the demonstration project, providing meals to over 10,500 children each day. 
Many of these child centers are in rural areas or in lower income municipalities. Without the demonstration project, fees would increase placing a greater financial burden on parents and some smaller centers may be forced to close. This demonstration project provides needed nutritional assistance to financially disadvantaged children. I believe that continued operation and possible expansion of this type of demonstration project is essential as we consider policies to help working families with children. 
I am sure Members will have many ideas and changes to improve these programs. 
Mr. President, everyone agrees how critical good nutrition is to our children's ability to learn. This reauthorization represents our opportunity to work together to craft a thoughtful bill that will be the building block to our children's successful learning so they can have a healthy and productive future.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a world statesman and one of the most heroic figures of this century on the occasion of his 75th birthday. Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze, the President of Georgia, celebrated his birthday this past weekend and I know each of my colleagues join me in wishing him health, happiness and many years of success. 
Mr. President, as I advance in years I become increasingly aware that each additional birthday is a milestone of sorts. However, when one looks at the dramatic changes in both the world and the man over the past 75 years of Eduard Shevardnadze's life, it is more than a mere birthday that is celebrated. I would suggest we should recognize his as a life of dignity, service and commitment to fighting for principle. His has been a life `in the arena'--one richly deserving of honor. 
President Shevardnadze has enjoyed a wide range of experiences in public life. Most Americans became aware of his remarkable abilities when he held the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union from 1985 until 1991. 
With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, he left the Communist Party, resigning in protest against the anticipated military dictatorship. It was at this time, as a private citizen, that President Shevardnadze returned to his homeland of Georgia. Here he found a nation in complete disarray, struggling to shake off the years of Soviet domination. Faced with this challenge what was he to do? He did what comes naturally to him, Mr. President--he chose to lead. 
Beginning in March 1992, he led the State Council. In October 1992, he was elected Chairman of the Parliament of Georgia from which he was elected head of State. Finally, in November 1995, he was elected President of Georgia with over 70% of the vote. This completed a historic personal and governmental transition. 
Mr. President, since his election, I have had the distinct honor of working with President Shevardnadze on a variety of issues. I can say without fear of embellishment that I find him to be one of the true heroes of the 20th century. His vision for a free, prosperous and democratic Georgia is one I support and believe him to be uniquely qualified to deliver. Further, he is one of the principal architects of the Post Cold War world, and for that we should all give thanks. 
While many leaders in this part of the world are consumed by their own position and power, President Shevardnadze has demonstrated his commitment to his nation in a unique way--he has consistently appointed, selected and surrounded himself with exceptionally talented men and women half his age. President Shevardnadze's legacy is the determined leadership he not only has shown, but the team of leaders he has cultivated and supported--leaders who will secure Georgia's bright and independent future.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, under the previous order, I submit a report of the committee of conference on the bill (H.R. 2159) making appropriations for foreign operations, export financing, and related programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is taking up this afternoon H.R. 2159, the foreign operations, export financing and related programs for fiscal year 1998. As is the case every year, it was not easy getting to this point partly because this bill is very different than the bills we passed in the last several years. 
First and foremost, we have increased our commitment to America's global leadership by nearly $1 billion. We have provided $12.8 billion for the 1998 foreign assistance programs and an additional $359 million in arrears we have owed to multilateral institutions, bringing the grand total to $13.1 billion, a shade under the administration's request. 
Let me review the important contributions this bill will make to stability and security around the world. 
First, Mr. President, we have substantially increased our commitment to the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union over last year's levels; $770 million for the region has been provided, including earmarks of $225 million for Ukraine, $92.5 million for Georgia, and $87.5 million for Armenia. Funds for Georgia and Armenia, along with resources to assist the victims of the Nagorno-Karabakh and Abkhaz conflicts are included within a new $250 million regional Caucasus fund. Congressman Callahan, my counterpart in the House, deserves credit for the idea to create this fund, believing it would provide incentive to achieve a peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
In an effort to assure balance to our regional approach and promote American energy security interests, we have ended the confusion over the impact of section 907 and clearly authorized OPIC, Ex-Im, TDA, and the Foreign Commercial Service support for American businesses operating in Azerbaijan and the Caspian. 
I believe we have served our clear interest in securing stability and economic growth in the New Independent States with these earmarks and the overall level of funding for that area. I also think we have served both our principles and security interests with two Senate provisions which were included in the conference report. 
The first addresses the issue of Russian cooperation with Iran on its nuclear and ballistic missile program. I have repeatedly expressed my disappointment with the administration's reluctance to leverage U.S. assistance to secure an end to this lethal cooperation. Let me remind my colleagues that we have provided more than $4 billion in aid to Russia--more than any we have provided to any combination of other countries. 
For the past several years, the Senate has carried a provision suspending aid unless the Russians stopped their training, technology transfer and support for the Iranian nuclear program. Each year a waiver has been added in conference because of a threat of veto and the President has in fact exercised the waiver. Each time he has done so the Iranians have moved closer to acquiring and testing a ballistic missile. This year, instead of a blanket waiver, the President will have to prove the Russians have taken specific steps to curtail the nuclear cooperation. While it is not as tough as I would have liked, it is a vast improvement over the broad waiver we have given him in the past. 
I also want to draw attention to the efforts of Senator Bennett and Senator Gordon Smith who worked hard to assure inclusion of a provision conditioning assistance on Russia's protection of religious freedom. There is no freedom more fundamental than the right to worship in a church of one's choice. The legislation President Yeltsin signed into law appears to have a chilling effect on religious freedom, a problem we have addressed by requiring the President to certify that the government has not enforced or implemented laws which would discriminate against religious groups or religious communities. 
Now, Mr. President, beyond the NIS, I think the bill clearly serves our national security interests in the Middle East by sustaining our past earmarks for Israel and Egypt and expanding and earmarking support to Jordan. At a time when the foreign aid request increased by nearly $1 billion, I was disappointed the administration only asked for $70 million for Jordan. 
An increase was a very high priority for me, and I am pleased to report the conference agreement provides $225 million in economic and security assistance as recognition for King Hussein's contribution and determination to achieve a durable peace and regional stability. 
Let me once again note my concern about Egypt's role in the peace process. For more than a decade, the bill has consistently stated that resources are provided as a measure of the recipient's commitment and support for peace. For the past 18 months, there is no question that Cairo has not faithfully served that key interest. Just this week, Mr. President, Egyptian officials announced they would not send representatives to an economic summit designed to restore relations and rebuild confidence. This is not an isolated example of problems in our relations with Egypt. In particular, Cairo's international campaign to remove sanctions against Libya is inexcusable. I expect that the bill's provision to withhold 5 percent of the aid to any country failing to enforce the sanctions may affect Egypt's assistance, notwithstanding the earmark. Let me put everyone on notice that if this persists, once again, next year as I did this year, I will not be including an earmark for Egypt in the chairman's mark as we begin the process of developing the appropriations bill for foreign operations for next year. 
Turning to other areas, the bill also reflects the Senate's commitment to strengthen our economic interests by increasing over the President's request our support for the Export-Import Bank. The Bank provides crucial support to U.S. exporters, creating jobs and income. I did not think the President's request was adequate to meet America's commercial interests. Consistent with the Senate's decision, we provide $51 million more than the request for a total of $683 million. 
This support comes with a word of caution for the board. I share my colleagues' concerns about the substantial funding that has been made available to Gazprom by the Bank, given Gazprom's announced plans to develop Iranian gas fields. The Bank must suspend support for Gazprom until the problem can be resolved. Complementing support for the Bank, we have provided the full request and authorization language for OPIC and $41.5 million for the Trade Development Agency. Both are consistent with Senate positions. 
Mr. President, in Asia, important priorities were sustained in the conference report. The Senate's position increasing aid to 
supporters of democracy in Burma, restricting assistance to the Hun Sen Government in Cambodia, and funding for the Korean Energy Development Organization was included. With regard to KEDO--that is the Korean Energy Development Organization--the conference agreed to our effort to reduce the costs of purchasing oil on the spot market by fully funding the 1998 costs and providing $10 million in back debt if other donors contribute sufficient funds to clear the balance. 
After much negotiation and some modifications, we also preserved the Senate's interests in conditioning aid to governments in the Balkans which refuse to cooperate in the extradition of war criminals. It is absolutely clear that inclusion of tough provisions in the original chairman's mark produced immediate results in U.S. efforts to secure cooperation. I intend to closely watch the situation to assure the administration continues to press for the transfer and prosecution of war criminals. There will be no long-term peace or stability in Bosnia or, for that matter, in the region if we fail in this effort to bring about a moral reconciliation. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me mention the multilateral financial institutions. We have fully funded the International Development Association and met our commitments at the other regional banks and made a substantial downpayment on clearing all outstanding arrears. Senator Domenici deserves recognition for establishing the guidelines allowing us to solve this vexing problem without compromising current programs. 
Unfortunately, in trying to resolve the matter of funding for family planning, the administration chose to pay a very high price and agreed to abandon efforts to fund the IMF's New Arrangements for Borrowing. Events in the Asian markets make clear the need for the NAB, a facility which would assure a multilateral effort to ease currency in economic crises. I support this burdensharing institution and will continue to work with the administration to find a vehicle to provide this vital line of credit. 
I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Leahy, for his good advice and exceptional cooperation in achieving passage of this bill. He played a key role in assuring full funding for the multilateral institutions and the development assistance programs. In particular, he deserves recognition for looking ahead to a major threat facing this country and successfully fighting to expand U.S. efforts to combat infectious diseases. Senator Leahy is ably assisted in this effort by Tim Reiser, who has been a patient and persistent staff director for the minority. 
I also wish to thank Chairman Stevens and his staff director, Steve Cortese, for their active engagement and support at key points as we worked to secure passage. Senator Stevens is the model of a good chairman. He is always there with good ideas when you need him. Let me also thank Jay Kimmitt for his invaluable assistance in putting together the bill and the report. 
I ask unanimous consent that Members be permitted to submit statements prior to passage and that staff be able to make technical corrections.

Mr. McCONNELL. Further, Mr. President, let me thank my long-time foreign policy adviser, Robin Cleveland, who sits here to my right, for her invaluable assistance in developing this package and for her tenacity in sticking with it all the way to the end, which has been a tortuous path and difficult to predict from moment to moment over the last month. Robin's done that with intelligence and good humor when that was required and toughness when that was required. It is always a pleasure to work with her. I have immensely enjoyed doing that over the last 13 years. And to her right, Billy Piper, who also makes an important contribution to this debate every year. Billy has been a pleasure to work with over the course of this legislation . And also Robin's assistant on the committee, Will Smith. I appreciate the important contribution that he has made. 
Mr. President, with that, I see my friend and colleague is here, and I will yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to make a couple final observations. Seeing the occupant of the chair, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, I thought I would mention his imprint on this bill. Senator Enzi had an important provision requiring a report from the administration on funding by all Federal agencies on the climate change program. He required its submission by October 31, which is obviously past. The conference included the provision requiring a report by November 15. I would say, for cold State Members, this is very important so we can begin to understand how extensive these programs are and what they are costing the taxpayers. 
My thanks to the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, the occupant of the Chair, Senator Enzi, for his support and contribution to this bill as well. 
Finally, let me say I understand Christian, the son of our staff director, Robin Cleveland, may be watching because he is sick today. Christian, I hope you get to feeling better. We are all sorry that you were inconvenienced by your mother's long hours during the course of the last few weeks. 
Mr. President, I believe we are at a point now where this bill should move forward.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I stand today to recognize the achievements and progress of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, KY. On October 20, 1997, Industry Week Magazine named the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant one of America's top 10 plants. This would be a greater honor for any manufacturer, but I feel that it is particularly remarkable for the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. When producing a potentially dangerous material like enriched uranium, extensive safety precautions have to be their first priority. The uranium they produce is shipped not only throughout the United States, but worldwide as well, to be used in the nuclear fuel cycle. 
The 275 plants nominated for this honor were judged in 14 areas including productivity, quality of product, employee involvement, cost reduction, and customer focus. The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant is impressive in all of these areas, and their performance has improved immensely over the past 5 years. In 1993, analysts predicted that the plant would have to close in the early 21st century, but continuous improvements have put an end to this speculation. There has been a 65-percent reduction in injuries over the past 5 years, a reduction in environmental concerns, and an impressive 100-percent on-time production delivery rate. 
The 1,800 workers of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, most of which are Kentuckians, are truly to be commended. These workers and their management team have visited other quality plants for innovative ideas about how to improve their own production. They have formed over 30 problem-solving teams, solicited and acted on advice from employees, and engaged in extensive and continual annual training. The positive labor-management relationship has successfully turned the 750-acre facility into thriving, cost-controlled, internationally competitive business. They have worked remarkably well on a daily basis with inspectors from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as well as with officials from the U.S. Enrichment Corp. The U.S. Enrichment Corp., which manages both the Paducah and the Pikeville, OH, plants, supplies 80 percent of the nuclear fuel for nuclear plants in the United States, and maintains 44 percent of the world enrichment market. 
I would like to extend my sincere congratulations and thanks to the employees of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. The plant's appropriate slogan is `Survive and Thrive,' and they have done just that. The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant not only provides jobs and benefits to western Kentuckians, but it helps the United States remain self-reliant for our nuclear fuel production.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Governmental Affairs hearings investigating the 1996 Presidential election affirmed what knowledgeable observers have contended for years--that the Presidential campaign finance system of spending limits and taxpayer funding is a fraud. 
Not soon forgotten will be the seamy videos of the White House coffee fundraisers in which the President was caught on tape extolling the virtues of circumventing the Presidential system's contribution and spending limits, via soft money contributions to the DNC--that once proud institution hijacked by the Clinton-Gore campaign bent on reelection in 1996. The 1996 Clinton-Gore reelection campaign took campaign finance chicanery to new heights, or lows, depending on your perspective. 
Mr. President, I am no fan of spending limits so am not without sympathy for those who must campaign under them. The Presidential system, while technically voluntary, presents a Hobson's choice to those contemplating a campaign. Candidates can choose between compliance with arbitrary and severe spending limits, burdensome regulatory requirements, and the prospect of years of FEC audits or trying to mount a credible campaign under the severe constraints of outdated contribution limits. 
It's difficult enough to mount a statewide Senate campaign with individual contributions limited to $1,000 a pop. Conducting a nationwide effort under the same contribution limits must be a nightmare. It requires, at the least, a Herculean effort, unless a candidate has the good fortune to have a fortune sufficient to bankroll their own campaign out of their own pocket. So I might be inclined to cut the President and Vice President some slack for this particular malfeasance--they have so many fundraising misdeeds to account for this one got lost in the shuffle until recently. I might cut them some slack if they were not such shameless hypocrites, portraying themselves as victims of the system and America's biggest fans of reform, when they aren't pleading incompetence. 
`William J. Clinton' signed a letter, addressed to the Chairman of the Federal Election Commission, on October 13, 1995, in which the President agreed to comply with the Presidential system's limits in exchange for which the Clinton-Gore campaign would receive taxpayer dollars. All told, the Clinton-Gore campaign received $75 million for the primary and general elections in 1996. The Democratic National Committee received over $12 million for its convention extravaganza in Chicago. It was a lie. 
The Clinton-Gore campaign took the money--$75 million from the U.S. Treasury--and never had any intention of confining their campaign to the spending limits. The Presidential system, from its inception, has been a bad joke on the American taxpayers, limiting neither spending, nor so-called `special interests,' as its creators--self-styled reformers--said it would. 
Unwilling to concede that their utopian reform vision has become a taxpayer-funded debacle worthy only of dismantling, the inside-the-beltway reform industry agitates instead for even more restrictions--on the party committees and independent groups. It would be like putting band-aids on the Titanic, and unconstitutional, to boot. 
The reform dream is the taxpayers' nightmare. Over $1 billion has been squandered on the Presidential system. It is an entitlement program for politicians. And a boondoggle for the likes of fringe candidates such as Lenora Fulani and Lyndon LaRouche who have flocked to the Presidential campaign entitlement program, like moths to a flame. 
Even Ross Perot's Reform Party has gotten into the act--as the Texas billionaire received $30 million from the U.S. Treasury last year for his campaign. An irony is that the Perot Reform Party's partaking of taxpayer funds from the Presidential system coffers will be the straw that breaks the camel's back in 2000. The Reform Party is going to bleed the reform dream dry if it takes what it will be entitled to in primary matching, convention, and general election funding. This is the gist of a recent FEC staff report on the fund's prospects for the 2000 campaign. 
At the outset of the 2000 Presidential primaries, the Presidential fund will be so near bankruptcy that candidates will be able to receive only a tiny fraction of what they are entitled to. FEC staff predict this dearth of funding will prompt some candidates to opt out of the Presidential spending limit system altogether. Where would such an exodus leave the competitive field? The candidates would still be stuck with the quarter-century old contribution limits, bestowing a tremendous advantage on those select few who have a huge donor base from which to draw or the wherewithal to fund a campaign out of their own pocket. 
This is a very real campaign finance crisis--a Presidential system on the edge of oblivion and a wide-open contest looming in the year 2000. So I rise today to introduce a bill to reform the Presidential system--the object of so much scandal and scorn. This reform legislation would repeal the Presidential system's spending limits and taxpayer funding. It would save the American taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars every election. To compensate for the loss of taxpayer funding and make the system more realistic, the contribution limit for Presidential candidates would be adjusted to $10,000, up from the current $1,000. The PAC limit would also be adjusted up to $10,000. 
It would also strengthen the political parties by updating the hard money contribution limits regulating donations to them. These limits are a quarter-century old and long overdue for adjustments. Candidates and political parties should not be shackled in the year 2000 with circa-1970's contribution limits. The bill would also do what the Supreme Court talked about doing in the 1996 Colorado decision and is likely to do in the near future: abolish the coordinated spending limit. This arbitrary restriction on what parties can do in coordination with their nominees is absurd. The parties prefer to operate in hard money over soft money. These reforms would facilitate that activity. 
Mr. President, these are commonsense reforms that would enhance competition and increase accountability in Presidential elections. In the interest of heading off a complete breakdown of the Presidential system in 2000, I urge Senators to step away from the traditional reform paradigm and join me in this effort.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep dissatisfaction with the misguided views of President Clinton's nominee for Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. 
As many of my colleagues have made clear, Mr. Lee is a fine man, with accomplished legal credentials. His story of hard work and success is truly inspiring. But, Mr. President, the position of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights should not be filled based on an inspiring story, but rather, on a nominee's commitment to the bedrock principle that every American should be seen as equal in the eyes of the law. 
The nomination of Bill Lann Lee is in serious peril, and for good reason. Mr. Lee has a long, well-documented, and disturbing allegiance to the policy of government-mandated racial preferences. In spite of the Constitution and recent court decisions, Mr. Lee continues to assert that government jobs and contracts should be handed out based on the immutable traits of race and gender. 
Mr. Lee's views, however, go one giant leap beyond simply allowing racial preferences. Mr. lee has argued that the Constitution, in fact, requires racial preferences. Let me restate that. Bill Lann Lee has filed papers in Federal court asserting that the very Constitution which prohibits discrimination based on race and gender, in fact, requires the government to engage in discrimination based on race and gender. 
As absurd as this theory sounds that is what Bill Lann Lee argued in court briefs this year as he fought the will of the California voters in proposition 209. Thankfully, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously rejected the Lee theory. In simple, straightforward language, the court explained, `the 14th Amendment, lest we lose sight of the forest for the trees, does not require what it barely permits.' 
And, as expected, the Supreme Court this week refused to validate the Lee theory and allowed the ninth circuit ruling to stand.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman of the full committee, Senator Stevens, and the ranking member, Senator Byrd, for their strong leadership on this important issue. 
Additionally, Senator Burns and Senator Murray, the chairman and ranking member of the Military Construction Subcommittee, have done an outstanding job all year of putting together an appropriations bill which addresses the vital needs of our military installations. 
Mr. President, we are here debating the merits of President Clinton's decision to strike funding for over 30 military construction projects. Let me state clearly that I strongly object to the President's reckless use of this new authority. 
While I support the line-item authority, in this instance the President not only misused it, he endangered soldiers lives. 
Let's look at the President's argument. Among his statements, the President claimed that he was canceling only projects `that would not have been built in fiscal year 1998 in any event; projects where the Department of Defense has not yet even done design work.' 
Wrong. The President's statement is absolutely inaccurate. 
In fact, of the projects contained in this measure, each of them could begin construction in fiscal year 1998, a direct contradiction to the President's claim. 
As for the two projects in Kentucky which were deemed wasteful by the President, one had 10 percent of the design work completed, and the other had completed 90 percent of the design work. Ninety percent, Mr. President, that is hardly insignificant. 
President Clinton also claimed his effort was `another step on the long journey to bring fiscal discipline to Washington.' In fact, he went on to claim he was ensuring `that our tax dollars are well spent,' and was standing `up for the national interests over narrow interests.' 
Wrong again. 
The projects eliminated by the President totaled $287 million. Our Federal budget is over $1.6 trillion. Therefore, the President's efforts have saved the nation a whopping seventeen thousandths of 1 percent of the Federal budget. So the simple truth is no real money will be saved as a result of President Clinton's veto. 
The fact is every single project contained in this measure is in the President's own future year plan for military construction. Therefore, these facilities will be built, if not this year some time in the next 5 years. And, Mr. President, I don't have to explain to you the reality that delaying the inevitable construction will only increase the cost of these projects. 
Mr. President, anyone who believes that the projects will be built for only $287 million, their cost in fiscal year 1998, is sadly mistaken. Each of these projects will increase in cost, and the American taxpayers will be left holding the bag once again. 
Finally, Mr. President, allow me to discuss one of the Kentucky projects which was vetoed in order to provide an example of how the process was mishandled by the Clinton administration. And, let me begin by reminding the Senate that the administration did not even use accurate information in evaluating this and other projects. 
Fort Campbell, KY, is home to the 101st Airborne, Air Assault, the `Screaming Eagles.' This unit is one of the most important assets in the U.S. Army, and is often the first to deploy in a crisis situation. 
As a result, the soldiers at Fort Campbell must maintain the highest level of readiness in order to deploy at a moment's notice. Yet, because President Clinton decided this was a pork-barrel project, over 200 soldiers a day are forced to work in facilities that are more than 50 years old, but were meant to last no more than 15 years when they were constructed. 
Let me say that another way. Over 200 of America's finest soldiers are working, everyday, in facilities that should have been replaced or torn down over 40 years ago. These structures are literally falling down on top of the men and women working in these facilities. 
Instead, Mr. President, the soldiers of the 101st are working in dilapidated, dysfunctional structures with little or no heat, faulty electrical wiring, no fire control systems and are riddled with asbestos. 
An OSHA inspection of these facilities would do what no army in the world could--shut down one of our premier combat units and prevent it from meeting its mission requirments. 
Conditions are so poor that work is often performed outside on gravel parking areas and not at all when temperatures reach severe levels. 
The $9.9 million appropriated for this project would have provided much needed facilities to the 86th Combat Support Hospital--a rapid deployable unit equipped with the Army's most modern medical systems, and whose mission it is to support soldiers on the front lines of combat. 
To meet its mission requirement, Mr. President, the 86th must maintain more than 1,200 pieces of equipment in top, deployable condition around the clock. And, as you can imagine, much of this medical equipment requires conditions which cannot be met by these inadequate facilities. 
Mr. President, the examples are numerous, but the most telling example is truly shocking. In 1991, one of the structures slated to be replaced burned to the ground in a matter of minutes. Fortunately, no one was hurt in this incident, this time. 
If this is not a readiness and quality of life issue, I do not know what is. 
Clearly, the condition of these facilities is incompatible with maintaining a premier fighting force and with retaining the quality men and women who work there. 
Let me conclude, Mr. President, by saying the line-item veto was intended to be an instrument of precision and not the weapon of blunt force trauma. It was meant to deter wasteful spending--not endanger the lives of American service men and women. 
But, the President's action was not, as he claimed, `another step on the long journey to bring fiscal discipline to Washington' rather it was a reckless abuse of authority that must be rejected. It is time we stop paying lip service and truly commit ourselves to meeting the needs and quality of life issues of these dedicated soldiers. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting to restore the funding President Clinton eliminated.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my special thanks to Senator McCain and Senator Feingold, and Senator Daschle for allowing this debate to go forward in an orderly fashion. 
As we all know here in the Senate, any Senator at any moment can kick off a debate on any subject. That, of course, gives each Senator a good deal of power in determining what we debate. But what we have essentially agreed to here today is an orderly process by which the Senate can go on and engage in other business and have another debate on another day on this very important issue which we have debated almost yearly for the last decade. Let me say that I think this is a very sensible way to do it. 
Finally, I want to commend the distinguished majority leader. He has stood fast on principle over a difficult several-week period. The principle was that the majority leader should set the agenda for the Senate. I want to just say to my friend, the majority leader, that I have never seen a better example of leadership than he has exhibited over the last few weeks. 
Senator McCain said the majority leader saw a lot of Senator McCain. He saw an equal amount of Senator McConnell over this period. And I think he is probably ready to see less of both of us for a few weeks. 
But in any event, in his position as leader, Senator Lott obviously would like to see things go forward. On the other hand, there are from time to time matters of great principle where it is important to stand up and take a position. I say to my friend, Senator Lott, that I can't think of a better example in the 13 years I have been here of standing steadfast for principle when it counted than the performance of the distinguished majority leader over the last 3 weeks. 
I thank him on behalf of all the members of our conference, the vast majority of whom agree with the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Mississippi. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the career of Bob Carter, an outstanding newsman, who is retiring after more than four decades in the news business. Bob served for the last 28 years as president and general manager of the Kentucky New Era in Hopkinsville, KY. Bob is a great Kentuckian who has worked hard for the people of his community. He is a great friend, and he truly will be missed. 
Bob was 19 years old when he started working for the Kentucky New Era. He took the job so he could save enough money to go to college to study architecture. But along the way, he met his future wife Ann and decided to call Hopkinsville his home. His first job at the paper was selling ads, but after 5 years, he was named manager of the advertising department. In 1969, Bob became president and general manager of the paper. At that time, the newspaper had about 30 employees and a daily circulation of 7,000 readers. Today the newspaper has 82 employees, a circulation of 15,500, and several holdings, including the local television station. 
At the beginning of his career, Bob was primarily interested in the business aspect of the newspaper. He fought to get the newspaper headquartered in its current home, and to invest heavily in new equipment. It's an investment that paid off. In the early 1970's, Hopkinsville's economy began to grow and so did the Kentucky New Era. And what better way to sum it up than to quote Bob from his own newspaper, `We grabbed onto that whirlwind and rode with it.' He went on to add, `We became a cheerleader for the community. We were a supporter and a critic. We challenged some people to do things that weren't being done.' 
Retirement in Bob's case doesn't mean that he will slow down. He will continue to serve as chairman of the Kentucky New Era Board of Directors, and will work in an advisory capacity to assist his replacements through the end of the year. Bob will remain active in his community, as a member of the Association of the U.S. Army, the Chamber of Commerce's Military Affairs Committee, and as the newspaper's `ambassador' at Fort Campbell. He will also be able to spend more time with his wife, Ann, and his two daughters, Beth and Jini. 
Mr. President, I commend Bob Carter for his outstanding service to the people of Hopkinsville, KY. I ask that you and my fellow colleagues join me in recognizing the career of this outstanding Kentuckian, and wishing him well in all his future pursuits.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank Senator Ford for his important work and his leadership on this issue. It is so vital to the State we jointly represent. 
I am pleased to be on the floor of the Senate today to talk about an industry that has played an integral role in our country's history and continues to shape the cultural and economic landscape of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The industry, of course, is tobacco. And for the next few minutes I want to discuss tobacco and the shifting political terrain that will affect the 136,000 farmers who produce this agricultural commodity. 
This summer a group of States attorneys general, representatives of the major tobacco companies, and public health officials negotiated an agreement that would limit the companies' legal liability in exchange for their promise to help reduce smoking and compensate States for past damages caused by use of their product. This agreement obviously must be passed by the Congress and signed by the President to have the force of law, and that process is now what best could be described as in its initial stages. 
To my deep disappointment, tobacco farmers were not included in these negotiations. They had no seat at the table. Not surprisingly, there is not a single penny in this $368 billion pool of money for tobacco farmers, even though they will be the ones most directly impacted by the agreement. On the other hand, the agreement allows for the compensation of well-heeled sporting enterprises such as auto racing and rodeos in the event they lose sponsorship dollars but not a penny goes to the hard-working tobacco farmers who may well be driven off their family farms because of an agreement to which they were not a party. 
Today, along with Senator Ford, the principal craftsman of this bill, Senator Helms and Senator Faircloth, I propose to right that wrong by supporting a package that will provide for these farmers' well-being. Today, my colleagues and I are introducing the Long-term Economic Assistance for Farmers Act, what we call the LEAF Act, which creates an umbrella `Tobacco Community Revitalization Fund.' The fund, to be paid for from moneys within the existing $368-billion settlement, will stabilize the incomes of tobacco farmers by providing payments for lost tobacco quota to tobacco quota holders, tenants and those who lease quota. Quota holders who produce their own tobacco will be paid $4 a pound in any given year for every pound their quota falls behind their average 1994-1966 quota level. In the case of leased tobacco and tenant farmers, payments will be $2 a pound. 
A portion of the fund will also be used for Tobacco Community Economic Development Grants which will help transition tobacco dependent communities to a more diversified economic base. The economic development grants will be used for costs incidental to the tobacco program, economic development grants to States, farmer opportunity grants for education and training, and assistance for displaced tobacco industry workers. 
Mr. President, most agree that tobacco farmers and their communities should not bear the brunt of the agreement's dislocating effects. For instance, Minority Leader Daschle has said that `We need to address some of the concerns that were not addressed in the agreement * * * especially those dealing with small farmers.' The President himself has said, `Any tobacco legislation must protect tobacco farmers and their communities.' Even tobacco's most committed foes such as former FDA Commissioner David Kessler recognize that, as he put it, `farmers should not be left out' of the agreement. The LEAF Act does provide for farmers. It provides compensation for reduced quota to owners and those who produce the tobacco. It provides opportunities for tobacco farmers to diversify their crops. It provides economic stability for small tobacco farmers and their tobacco communities. It provides education and training opportunities for tobacco farmers and their dependents. It keeps farmers like mine in Kentucky in the business of producing this legal agricultural commodity. 
So, Mr. President, I rise in support of the LEAF Act. I thank Senator Ford for his leadership and tireless efforts to protect our tobacco growers and their communities. I believe Senator Ford's bill provides the best alternative for our growers. 
Having said that, I realize we face an uphill battle. Today's political environment for tobacco interests is darkened mightily. In today's Senate, outrageously unfair amendments that deny basic crop insurance to tobacco farmers are only narrowly defeated. The ceaseless assault on tobacco has left the tobacco grower imperiled. In this context it may be difficult to sustain the political support necessary to enact all of the bill's provisions. I personally will fight for the Ford package, but I also will be cognizant of political reality. It is my fervent hope that we can incorporate the LEAF Act into any settlement legislation. 
If that is not achievable, I will not be discouraged from pursuing alternative ways to best provide tobacco farmers' needs. 
Finally, Mr. President, as Congress discusses the proposed tobacco settlement, I urge my colleagues to remember that our decisions will not affect some nameless, faceless machine. 
Rather, our actions here will bear directly on thousands of hard-working tobacco farmers, men and women who pay their taxes, go to church, raise their families, and do their best to provide for future generations. We owe it to them to ensure that today's changes in the tobacco culture leave them with a stable future as well. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. Let me say, I agree with Senator McCain. I think the issue at this point is really whether we are going to finish the highway bill and some other important legislation pending in the Senate. We had 7 to 9 days of debate on campaign finance reform. The majority leader is absolutely correct, there is no way he can or any of us can prevent further debate on this issue. As a matter of fact, we have been debating it for 10 years. It comes back almost every year. 
I don't object to that. As someone who has not been in sympathy with McCain-Feingold, I certainly don't object to the debate. I enjoy it. We had 27 speakers on my side of the issue when we debated it a few weeks ago, and I don't mind debating it again.

Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Arizona, I am open to discussion about having lots of amendments on both sides and lots of debates, lots of votes. But it seems to me the issue here, 3 weeks before we get out, is whether we are going to finish other important legislation the majority leader would like to advance and I am sure the minority leader would, too. 
We will have that debate next year. I am more than happy to discuss the context of the debate, the timing of the debate. I am confident that an issue this controversial will always be determined in a 60-vote context, as much as the Senator from North Dakota will assure that is what will happen on fast track. I am open to that discussion. 
What I would like to see us to do is go on and pass some of the much-needed legislation the majority leader would like to push forward in the remaining weeks of the session.

Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his important contribution to this debate. We have 25 speakers in opposition to McCain-Feingold, and a growing number of our Members want to speak out in opposition to this piece of legislation. 
I think a very encouraging thing happened this morning that I would like to report to my colleagues right before the vote. 
I had an opportunity to attend an announcement of a new organization called the James Madison Center for Free Speech. What the James Madison Center for Free Speech is going to do is handle litigation all across the country in cases involving political speech. We have heard it announced that the forces of reform who want to shut Americans out of the political process and being frustrated in Washington are taking their cases out around America. There have been various State laws and referenda that have passed--all of them, so far, struck down in the Federal courts. But the James Madison Center is going to be there to represent litigants all across America who stand up for first amendment free speech. 
I think that is an important announcement. The proponents of campaign finance reform have said they are not going to go away. The opponents are not going to go away. The James Madison Center is going to be there every time free speech is threatened anywhere in America. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call under rule XXII be waived.

Most Americans think that friendly reporters are more important to a successful political campaign than money, according to a Rasmussen Research survey of 1000 adults. By a 3-to-1 margin (61 percent to 19 percent) Americans believe that if reporters like one candidate more than another, that candidate is likely to win--even if the other candidate raised more money in a campaign.

Mr. McCONNELL. Also, there was a fascinating column by Robert Samuelson in Newsweek of October 6, Monday of this week. The headline says, `Making Pols Into Crooks--Campaign-Finance `Reform' Criminalizes Politics and Deepens Public Cynicism.' 
Let me just take a few excerpts out of this article, because I think it really is excellent, and sums up the nature of this debate. Bob Samuelson says: 
The `reformers' claim they're trying to lower public cynicism by cleansing politics of the evils of money. Actually, they're doing the opposite: by putting so many unrealistic restrictions on legitimate political activity, the `reformers' ensure that more people--politicians, campaign workers, advocacy groups--will run afoul of the prohibitions. Public cynicism rises as politics is criminalized. 
Mr. Samuelson goes on: 
There is no easy way to curb the role of money in politics without curbing free expression. If I favor larger (smaller) government, I should be able to support like-minded candidates by helping them win. Campaign `reformers'--who would like to replace private contributions with public subsidies and impose strict spending limits--reject this basic principles. 
Money, they say, is corrupting politics. It isn't. 
Campaign spending isn't out of control or outlandish. In the 1996 election, campaign spending at all levels-- 
At all levels, Federal, State and local-- 
totaled $4 billion, says political scientist Herbert Alexander of the Citizens' Research Foundation. That was one twentieth of one percent of the gross domestic product of $7.6 trillion. Americans spend about $20 billion a year on laundry and dry cleaning. Is the price of politics really too steep? 
Robert Samuelson asks. 
Further in the article he says: 
More menacing are the artificial limits that `reformers' have imposed on political expression---- 
Something the Senator from Arkansas was just referring to a few moments ago in his speech---- 
What's been created is a baffling maze of election laws and rules that, once codified, establish new types of criminal or quasi-criminal behavior. Anyone tiptoeing around the rules is said to be `skirting the law.' And there are violations. In the futile effort to regulate politics, the `reformers' have manufactured most of the immorality, illegality and cynicism that they deplore. 
Today's `abuses' stem mostly from the 1974 `reforms' enacted after Watergate. Congress then limited the amount individuals could give a candidate to $1,000 per election; total giving to all candidates (directly, through parties or committees) was limited to $25,000 a year. What happened? The limits inspired evasions. Suppressing contributions to candidates encouraged new political-action committees. People gave to PACs, which give to candidates. In 1974, there were 608 PACs; now there are 4,000. 
Another evasion is `independent spending': groups (the Supreme Court says) can promote a candidate by themselves if they don't `coordinate' with a candidate. The present evasion of concern is `soft money': contributions to parties for `party-building' activities like voter registration. `Soft money' contributions have no limits; so Tamraz could give $300,000. But `soft money' can also be used for general TV ads that mention candidates as long as they don't use such words as `vote for.' Does any of this make any sense? Not really. Ordinary people can't grasp all the obscure, illogical distinctions. 
And he is talking, Mr. President, about current law, even before we talk about making it more complicated. 
No matter. The failure of past `reforms' is no barrier to future `reforms.' The latest effort is the McCain-Feingold bill now before the Senate. 
Samuelson says: 
Most of the bill flouts the spirit, if not the letter, of the First Amendment.

<TEXT>
Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, also in the Wall Street Journal of October 1, there was a piece by Jonathan Rauch, who is a contributing editor to the National Journal. I want to read a few parts of that. 
Mr. Rauch said: 
The McCain-Feingold bill being debated in the Senate this week has become the default option for campaign-finance reformers: If you are an editorialist who needs to suggest something better than today's tumbledown system, you press the McCain-Feingold button on our word processor. Well, the system today is rotten, and radical change is needed. But McCain-Feingold, for all its good press and good intentions, is a bad bill. It would do nothing to end the failures of the past 20 years. Indeed, it would unflinchingly compound them. 
At the core of today's troubles are two realities that will not yield to any amount of legislative or lawyerly cleverness. The first is that private money--a lot of it--is a fact of life in politics, and if you push it out of one part of the system it tends to re-enter somewhere else, usually deeper in shadow. The second is that money spent to communicate with voters cannot be regulated without impinging on the very core of the First Amendment, which was written to protect political discourse above all. 
That is what they were thinking about when they wrote the first amendment, political discourse. 
We got into today's mess by defying both of these principles, with predictable results. When reformers placed limits on money spent to support or defeat candidates, lobbies simply shifted to ad campaigns that omitted explicit requests to vote for or against candidates: `issue advocacy,' which the courts have ruled is constitutionally protected. And when reformers placed tight limits on contributions to candidates, donors began giving to political parties instead: `soft money.' 
The distinctions between `hard' and `soft' money, and between `express advocacy' and `issue advocacy,' are grounded in legalistic mumbo-jumbo, and so the attempts to enforce them have made campaign law bewilderingly complex without accomplishing any of the law's goals. Campaigns are neither cheaper nor fairer nor less dependent on private money than, say, 30 years ago--just the opposite, in fact. One conclusion you might draw is that the 1970s-style, money-regulating model is bankrupt. Another is that a horse-doctor's dose of the old medicine will finally heal the patient. Enter Sens. John McCain and Russell Feingold. 
Among many things their bill would do, two are paramount. First, it would ban `soft money' given to political parties. Second, to make the `soft money' ban work, it would also restrict independent `issue advocacy.' Voila--no more money, right? 
Wrong. Lots and lots of money, but in different places. Ban soft money, and lobbies would bypass the parties and conduct their own campaign blitzes. Candidates and parties are already losing control of their messages as lobbies--which, unlike candidates and parties, are not accountable to voters--run independent advocacy campaigns.

That is what the leader's amendment would have provided, not just for union members but employees of corporations who are not union members, and of course any shareholders who are aggrieved have the option to sell the shares, if they object to any political donation of a corporation. So I commend the majority leader.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I just want to thank the distinguished majority leader for his leadership on this very important issue. In the judgment of this Senator, there is nothing 
more important than protecting the first amendment and giving American citizens an opportunity to participate in the political process. 
I would say that is not just my view. That is the view of the United States Supreme Court. It is the view of the American Civil Liberties Union. The Court has said you have a constitutional right to support, to contribute to the candidate of your choice. So we are talking about fundamental first amendment rights in this debate. 
I also want to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues who have spoken during the course of this debate. The number of speakers has been roughly equal on both sides. Every one of the Senators who spoke on my side of this issue spoke in defense of the first amendment. 
I also extend my gratitude and my appreciation to Tamara Somerville, my long-time assistant in this struggle to protect the first amendment. Nobody has ever worked harder, produced more brilliant subject matter, and done it with greater humor than she. So, my thanks to Tam, not only for her good work for me but also on behalf of the country, in defense of the first amendment. 
I also want to thank her assistant, Lani Gerst, who did a remarkable job as well, for all of her help. 
Mr. President, it has indeed been a wonderful debate. We will in all likelihood have it off and on again. It seems that is the history of this issue. It has been around a few times over the last 10 years, but I think the opposition to ruining the first amendment continues to grow. Today's cloture vote against cloture was the highest in 10 years. 
So, I end today on an optimistic note, that the first amendment will, indeed, survive for another year. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this would be a good time, in the beginning of the debate, to thank my colleague from Nevada for his kind words. I appreciate that very much. Also, Mr. President, I would like to insert a number of things into the Record with some explanation, just to make the Record complete, before we go to further debate later this afternoon. There are a number of Senators on my side of this issue who want to speak, and they will be coming over at various times during the course of the afternoon's debate. 
First, Mr. President, I would like to submit a sampling of the opinion pieces I have authored in the past year. One is from January of this year, published by the Washington Times, in which I had a premonition that President Clinton, as his own campaign finance scandal deepened, would become campaign finance reform's No. 1 fan. Frankly, it's not that I am particularly clairvoyant, but rather that they are so predictable. 
As the Clinton administration and the Democratic National Committee have sunk in a scandalous quicksand of their own making, the more they publicly thrashed around groping for a campaign finance bill as if it were a life preserver. Unfortunately for America, the President and Vice President Gore seek to save themselves from their own embarrassing malfeasance in raising money from foreigners and the other episodes which have been so much in the newspapers. They want to save themselves at the expense of core constitutional freedoms for all Americans.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, further, I submit for the Record four illuminating documents from the American Civil Liberties Union. Say what you will about this organization--one that Members on my side, including me, are infrequently aligned with--they take some gutsy positions. It is tough for a liberal group--a label usually given to the ACLU--to go against the liberal grain, particularly on an issue this high-profile, as this one which we are debating today. 
Particularly, Mr. President, I want to single out Laura Murphy, director of the ACLU's Washington office, and no doubt others in that organization, have taken a lot of grief for their brave and resolute position in defense of political freedom for all Americans--liberals, conservatives, and every ideological shade in between. I cannot say enough good things about the work that Laura, Joel Gora, Ira Glasser, and other folks in the ACLU have done on this issue. Their effort against McCain-Feingold has been truly heroic. Two-hundred and sixty million American beneficiaries of the first amendment owe these people a debt of thanks. 
With a few notable and admirable exceptions, I have been sorely disappointed by the willingness of liberal groups to walk off a cliff for this blatantly unconstitutional reform effort. I'm told some have made the calculated decision that if the McCain-Feingold bill passed, liberal causes would benefit. 
I think they are right on that score but it is shameful that so many would eagerly jettison 200 years of core political freedom--which benefits all citizens and makes America a uniquely free country--in order to stick it to conservatives and anyone else who does not support the liberal agenda. 
These liberal, Democrat-leaning groups know McCain-Feingold is outrageous--that its issue advocacy provisions, to name just a few, are unconscionable assaults on the first amendment right of all Americans to petition the government as individuals, and as groups, and to weigh in on public issues. But still some actively promote McCain-Feingold, more simply look the other way--acquiescing on the sidelines of this critical debate over core constitutional freedoms they get paid to exercise. 
Perhaps they believe, correctly I might add, that Republicans will save the Nation from McCain-Feingold. I predict that will be the outcome. 
Mr. President, I will now read into the Record some highlights of the ACLU's most recent denunciation of the McCain-Feingold bill, dated October 1, 1997: 
Ever since the very first version of the various McCain-Feingold campaign finance bills was introduced in the Senate, the ACLU has gone on record to assert that each version was fatally and fundamentally flawed when measured against settled First Amendment principles. Now the Senate is debating a new `revised' incarnation of the bill. While we are pleased that the sponsors of the new version have abandoned some of the more egregious provisions that appeared in earlier versions, the `pared down' bill still cuts to the core of the First Amendment. We once again urge you to reject McCain-Feingold's unconstitutional and unprecedented assaults on freedom of speech and association. 
Although the bill has a number of constitutional flaws, this letter focuses on those that impose restrictions primarily on issue advocacy. It is important to note at the outset that the recent letter from 126 law professors, commenting on McCain-Feingold, was silent on the issue advocacy restrictions in the bill, which are the subject of this letter.  
1. The unprecedented restrictions on issue advocacy contained in the McCain-Feingold bill are flatly unconstitutional under settled First Amendment doctrine. 
Last week there was a lot of discussion of a law professor named Burt Neumann at the Brennan Center of New York. I believe it is interesting that everyone believes Brennan wrote the Buckley case, one of the ironies of this debate. Mr. Neumann for 24 years had said the Buckley decision was wrong. And he is free to say that. He wishes it were otherwise. But his position and the position of the man he presumably admires the most, William Brennan, not only prevailed in the Buckley case but has been further elaborated on in 21 years of litigation. Thus, the ACLU says under settled first amendment doctrine: 
What we are talking about here is not the law as some wish it were but the law as it is. And that is what the ACLU is referring to. 
Further, in another place in the letter, Mr. President, they say: 
The unprecedented and sweeping restraints on the `soft money' funding of issue advocacy and political activity by political parties raise severe first amendment problems. 
At another point in the letter, the ACLU says, `The same principles that protect unrestrained issue advocacy by issue groups safeguard issue advocacy and activity by political parties.' 
So, if issue advocacy has been well laid out by 21 years of court cases for groups, the same thing applies for political parties. 
By the way, Mr. President, this letter was signed by Ira Glasser, executive director; Laura Murphy, director, Washington office; Joel Gora, professor of law at Brooklyn Law School. 
I might just say a word about Joel Gora. He was cocounsel in the Buckley case. So my side in this argument is that they didn't have to go out and find somebody to certify that they wish the law were what it isn't. These folks know what the law is, were involved in litigating these cases, and are simply certifying as to their opinion based upon deep experience in this field as to the constitutionality of the measure before us. 
So, here is what they say at the end of the letter. 
Accordingly, we submit that McCain-Feingold's sweeping controls on the amount and source of soft money contributions to political parties and disclosure of soft money disbursements by other organizations continue to raise severe constitutional problems. Disclosure, rather than limitation, of large soft money contributions to political parties, is the more appropriate and less restrictive alternative. 
McCain-Feingold's labyrinth of restrictions on party funding and political activity can have no other effect but to deter and discourage precisely the kind of political party activity that the First Amendment was designed to protect. 
. . . While reasonable people may disagree about the proper approaches to campaign finance reform, this bill's restraints on political party funding and issue advocacy raise profound First Amendment problems and should be opposed. The bill has a number of other severe flaws, some old, some new, which we will address in a future communication. But we wanted to take the opportunity to share our assessment of two of the most salient problems with the bill now. 
So, Mr. President, there it is from America's experts on the first amendment, one of whom was one of the lawyers in the Buckley case. These are people who are experts on this kind of litigation, and that is their opinion about the constitutionality of McCain-Feingold, as revised. 
Now, Mr. President, a September 25, 1997, letter from the Christian Coalition. It says: 
Dear Senator: The Christian Coalition has long supported campaign finance reform that encourages citizen participation and nonpartisan voter education. Any reform of our system of campaign financing should allow for educational tools such as nonpartisan voter guides, issue advertising, congressional scorecards and newsletters. Christian Coalition vigorously opposes the McCain-Feingold legislation which unconstitutionally restricts these types of issue advocacy. 
I will just read one other sentence, Mr. President, from this particular letter. This organization says: 
Voter education should be encouraged, not discouraged. An informed electorate is part of the solution, not part of the problem. 
I could not agree more.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will read just a few of the highlights from the cover letter. This is dated October 3, 1997. 
Dear Senator McConnell: Thank you for requesting our comments on the revised McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill. . . . 
Much of what the Cato Institute and similar nonprofit research and public policy corporations do could no longer be done or, done only if we are comfortable having research publications, public policy forums, city seminars, conferences and the like classified as `contributions.' In this bizarre scenario, these `contributions' would have to be paid for out of our `PAC' (which, of course, we would never have), and, probably, could not be done at all since much of the `anything of value' we produce often costs more than the $5,000 limit on contributions. 
Here is a group, Mr. President, not in politics. They do not go out and create a PAC, they do not do voter guides, and they think that the most recent version of McCain-Feingold is going to make it hard for them to function. 
The Cato Institute goes on: 
For example, if we published a study on the flat tax, or tax reform and ever discussed the issue with Representative Dick Armey--or, heaven forbid, held a policy forum or city seminar with Dick Armey, Steve Forbes, Reps' Paxon, Tauzin, Archer, or any of the other leading proponents of tax reform--under the new McCain-Feingold, these could become contributions. 
I guess the good news is, as Bob Levy says, that `the September 29 version of McCain-Feingold reduces the first amendment to scrap'--so blatantly unconstitutional that it will never become law. As Bob also says, `McCain-Feingold is an insidious and destructive piece of legislation. It deserves an ignominious burial. To be blunt, either it dies, or we do.'

Mr. McCONNELL. Preferring substance to petitions, I have a couple of constitutional analyses to have printed in the Record. I understand from the Government Printing Office that it will cost approximately $12,000 to print this material in the Record. 
The first is an outstanding dissertation on the constitutional implications of campaign finance reform by law professor and renowned legal scholar Lillian R. BeVier of the University of Virginia, and again I will just read some of the highlights for the information of those listening to the debate. 
Professor BeVier appeared before the Rules Committee on several occasions. Her report of September 4, 1997, says: 
The shortcomings of current `reform' proposals are no small matter, given the First Amendment's crucial historical role in protecting our right to self-government and its sustaining liberty. For the proposals to pass constitutional muster, the First Amendment would have to be itself `amended' by judicial fiat.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am not the majority leader, but I wanted to make a couple observations about the comments of the Democratic leader. First of all, paycheck protection is not a poison pill; it is an important piece of legislation. It was in 
the top 10 pieces of legislation, I say to my friend from South Dakota, that we introduced at the beginning of this year on this side of the aisle. It has probably as many supporters as McCain-Feingold does. So it is curious to me that paycheck protection, when linked up with McCain-Feingold, is a poison pill but the converse apparently isn't true. 
So, again, I am not the majority leader, but I will say it is my intent to bring up paycheck protection any time any effort was made to try to force through McCain-Feingold. 
But what the majority leader has done here is offer an opportunity with a very good debate. I disagree with my friend from South Dakota; I think it is a good debate. I wish he had had a chance to listen to more of it. He might have changed his position. We are going to have a good debate this afternoon. A number of Senators want to speak. 
Let me be very clear, at least as far as this one Senator is concerned, there is no campaign finance reform without paycheck protection. They are the Siamese twins, Mr. President, the Siamese twins of this discussion. So paycheck protection will, indeed, be back as well. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.

We . . . have concerns about McCain-Feingold's provisions that would curb issue advertising in the 60 days prior to elections. These provisions are ill-defined and overly restrictive of legitimate legislative activity, and would inhibit the ability to speak freely on issues while they are being debated and decided in Congress.

Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, there has been a development today that has a direct bearing on this debate that I thought would be of interest to our colleagues and particularly the occupant of the chair. 
The Supreme Court today denied cert and, therefore, refused to overturn a first circuit decision, in effect confirming a district court decision, specifically ruling unconstitutional, once again, most of the issue advocacy language in the McCain-Feingold bill which we have before us. The similarities are noteworthy. Two of the three categories of restrictions on issue advocacy in McCain-Feingold read as follows. As we all know, the courts have been very clear for 21 years that you are free to go out and express your views about any of us as often as you want to, in any way that you want to, as long as you don't say certain things like `vote for' or `vote against.' That does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Federal Election Commission. That group does not have to answer to a 
Federal agency in order to criticize us. The Federal Election Commission, as we all know, doesn't like that. So they have issued regulations seeking to change by regulation previous Court decisions on what is or what is not issue advocacy. 
In those regulations, which are remarkably similar to two of the three sections in McCain-Feingold dealing with issue advocacy, the similarities are noteworthy. 
In the McCain-Feingold bill, the following words are used, and the words mean this in the bill, as I understand it, that if any of these things happen, the group would fall under the Federal Election Commission and be subject to their jurisdiction. In addition to the bright line test that the Supreme Court has already laid down, the bill would seek to add to that the following:  
. . . or a campaign slogan or words that in context can have no reasonable meaning other than to advocate the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidates. 
Madam President, that is part of the language in the underlying bill.

Mr. McCONNELL. As the Senator from Washington pointed out, today's huge news that the Supreme Court has struck down essentially most of the issue advocacy language in the McCain-Feingold bill, maybe we shouldn't waste our time talking about this. But if you look at the original bill, it was designed to shut down campaigns, shut down parties, and shut down issue advocacy, and the Senator from Washington pointed out the only entity exempt from this would have been the press which enjoys a specific exemption under the Federal Election Campaign Act. 
In fact, I have it here for our viewers if they want to look, section 431(9)(B), subsection 1: 
Any news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through the facilities of any broadcasting station, newspaper, magazine, or other periodical publication, unless such facilities are owned or controlled by any political party, political committee, or candidate; 
In other words, a blanket exemption for the press that no one else would enjoy. 
I say to my colleague from Washington, just to ask a question, Westinghouse owns CBS, Disney owns ABC, and GE owns NBC. Now, these big corporate giants in America will, through the ownership of these television broadcast networks, enjoy a total exemption from all the restrictions that would be placed on the political speech of everybody else. This is not an unrealistic hypothetical. We just saw Ted Turner, who used to control CNN, declare on Friday he would not sell ads to a certain group because he did not like what they were saying. 
So I ask my friend from Washington if he could speculate with me for a moment the mischief that might be created by the ownership of the only exempt avenue to engage in free and unfettered political expression without the heavy hands of the Federal Government, 
what kind of mischief he might imagine could happen in our country?

Mr. McCONNELL. Is my colleague from Michigan familiar with the Federal Election Commission versus Christian Action Network, which was decided April 7 of this year? The language in that decision on page 7, I directly quote for my friend from Michigan: 
Seven years later and less than a month following the Court's decision in MCFL, the ninth circuit in FEC v. Furgatch could not have been clearer that it, too, shared this understanding of the Court's decision in Buckley. Although the Court declined to strictly limit express advocacy to the magic words of Buckley's footnote 52 because that footnote list `does not exhaust the capacity of the English language to expressly advocate election or defeat of a candidate,' the entire premise of the Court's analysis was that words of advocacy such as those recited in footnote 52 were provided to support Commission jurisdiction over a given corporate expenditure. 
I think what the Supreme Court was saying, or what the fourth circuit was saying is that there might be another way beyond the precise words of the footnote to expressly advocate the election or defeat, but that that was basically it. There might be another way to say the same thing beyond words actually chosen in footnote 52. But you are not permitted to wander further. Is that not the----

They have been involved in a number of cases. I am looking at a whole list here, FEC versus AFSCME, in 1979; FEC versus CLITRIM, in 1980; FEC versus Machinists, in 1981; FEC versus Massachusetts Citizens for Life, in 1986; FEC versus----

Mr. McCONNELL. FEC versus Phillips Publishing, in 1981; FEC versus National Organization for Women; FEC versus Survival Education Fund, in 1995; FEC versus Christian Action Network, in 1996; FEC versus GOPAC, in 1994; FEC versus Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee, in 1996. 
Now, in all of those cases the Federal Election Commission was trying to snuff out issue advocacy. It was rebuffed in all of those cases and, in the case of FEC versus the Christian Action Network, in the fourth circuit, the court was so angry at the FEC for continuing to pursue these citizens groups that it ordered the FEC to pay the legal fees of the citizen group which had been harassed by the FEC. 
Mr. President, there may be some things that are in a gray area in this debate, but issue advocacy is not. The court has been very, very clear, since Buckley, that it is impermissible for the 
Congress to shut these people up when they seek to criticize us. An effort to say that in proximity to the election they can't criticize us would be an exercise in futility. I mean, these citizens have a right to band together. We don't like it. I stipulate that I have been subjected, shall I say, to these issue advocacy campaigns myself. I don't like it. I would rather not be criticized. But, as a practical matter, the courts are not going to allow us to shut these people up just because we find what they say about us offensive. 
The enforcement actions that I mentioned are just the tip of the iceberg, since many enforcement actions never progress beyond the administrative levels. But these administrative investigations can be equally chilling on free speech. 
The FEC has attempted to buttress its position regulating issue advocacy by extensive regulatory proceedings resulting in the adoption of the following regulations, which have been invalidated by the courts. 
The FEC has been on this mission to shut these people up for a long time. So they issued a variety of different regulations, 11 CFR 114.4(b)(5), which was invalidated in Faucher versus FEC, in 1991; 11 CFR 114.1(e)(2), invalidated in Chamber of Commerce versus FEC, in 1995; 11 CFR 100.22, invalidated in Maine Right to Life Committee versus FEC in 1996; 11 CFR 114.10, invalidated in Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life versus FEC, in 1995; 11 CFR 114.4(c)(4) and (5) invalidated in Clifton versus Federal Election Commission, in 1996. 
I don't know who these constitutional scholars are. I am not prepared to argue with the Senator from Arizona or the Senator from Wisconsin that they all went to law school. But this business of seeking to regulate the expressions of citizens against our voting records doesn't have any chance at all of being upheld in the courts. I would hope the Senate would not waste its time engaging in some ill-conceived idea here to try to keep people from criticizing our records. It is a clear violation of the first amendment. 
So, it seems to this Senator that that is something we ought not to be engaging in. As the Senator from Arizona pointed out, that provision of McCain-Feingold remains largely the same as it was in the original version. 
I see my friend from Wisconsin is on his feet and would like to engage in a colloquy. I had in mind asking him a few questions as well, so I will be happy to yield to him for a question.

Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Wisconsin, that is precisely what I was saying. That is what the constitutional scholars, in the letter released by the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin, were talking about. It's their view of what a court would likely rule in the case of soft money and in the spending limits proposals, since dropped, that would apply to individual campaigns. That was precisely the point the Senator from Kentucky was trying to make, that the constitutional scholars are not certifying that they believe that provisions of the bill related to issue advocacy or independent expenditure are constitutional.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, regaining the floor, let me suggest to the Senator from Wisconsin that the bright-line test probably makes it even more unconstitutional. I think it is inconceivable that the courts would say that you can criticize a Member of Congress anytime you want to, except right before an election. 
Let me say with regard to this ongoing discussion of constitutional scholars that I don't know how many of the constitutional scholars in the letter presented by the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin have actually practiced these cases in court. I don't know the answer to that. It could be that many of them have. But the American Civil Liberties Union, which was cocounsel to Senator Buckley in the 1996 case and has handled a lot of this litigation over the years, believes that the provisions of the McCain-Feingold substitute with regard to issue advocacy is unconstitutional. 
The American Civil Liberties Union is America's expert on the first amendment. It is true that the Senator from Wisconsin has diligently searched for years and managed to come up with some folks who will sign a letter saying this is constitutional. I said last week I could probably find 126 people who say the Earth is flat. But, the experts on the first amendment, the American Civil Liberties Union, believe that these provisions are not constitutional. 
Let me just read from a letter earlier this year, to me from the ACLU, regarding independent expenditure provisions in McCain-Feingold at that time.  
The new restrictions on independent expenditures improperly intrude upon that core area of electoral speech, and impermissibly invade the absolutely protected area of issue advocacy. 
Mr. President, the ACLU went on: 
Two basic truths have emerged with crystal clarity after 20 years of campaign finance decisions--[20 years]. First, independent expenditures for express electoral advocacy by citizens groups about political candidates lie at the very core of the meaning and purpose of the first amendment. Second, issue advocacy by citizen groups lies totally outside the permissible area of Government regulation. 
This bill assaults both principles. 
So, Mr. President, I am not disputing for a moment that the Senators who are the principal sponsors of this bill have found some folks who went to law school who were certifying that they believe this bill is constitutional. But I am suggesting that the people who litigated in this area, the lawyers, the distinguished lawyers who have litigated in this area for the last 20 years, who were involved in the original case, the Buckley case, that went to the Supreme Court, believe that these provisions on independent expenditures and issue advocacy are fatally flawed. 
I rest my case. I guess we can all sort of pick our own expert and decide who we want to rely on, depending upon the outcome that we want to achieve. But I think most people would believe that the first amendment lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union know a little bit about this area of litigation. 
I want to take a few moments to pose a few questions to my friend from Wisconsin, if I may.

He has a view that is contrary to the state of the law.

The ACLU felt that even the contribution limit, Mr. President, was a violation of free speech. They didn't win that one, but they won the rest of the case. 
Thurgood Marshall said spending is speech, and all nine Supreme Court Justices said spending is speech. I heard the Democratic leader out here Friday talking about a 5-to-4 case. It wasn't a 5-to-4 case. It was 9 to 0 that spending is speech. My friend from Wisconsin wanted to ask a question or observe----

So, Mr. President, I still have the floor, I believe, and if the Senator from Wisconsin is up for a few more questions, I would like to ask him a few. 
I gather that the Senator from Wisconsin said last Friday--I know the Senator from Arizona did, too--that they hoped to

Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Utah. Let me just read the formula that is in the McCain-Feingold bill. I say to my friend from Utah, that might be helpful in giving my colleague from Wisconsin an opportunity to answer the question, How much is too much? 
The formula, as I understand it, in the original bill is $400,000 plus 30 cents times voting age population less than or equal to 4 million plus 25 cents times the voting age population greater than 4 million. 
So in the case, I say to my friends from Utah and Wisconsin--but there is one State that is different. In the case of New Jersey, where they have only one VHF station, the formula is different. It is 80 cents and 70 cents instead of 30 cents and 25 cents. Moreover, the minimum general election limit is $950,000, maximum being $5,500,000. That is for any State, no matter how big. And then the primary is 67 percent of the general limit, and the runoff limit is 20 percent of the general. 
I am a little confused here. I gather that means that you can spend more per voter in New Jersey than you can in Utah; is that right?

<TEXT>
Mr. McCONNELL. If I may regain my time, the answer is I don't think the Government should be determining how much speech there is in any Senate race, I don't care what the size of the State is. 
I see my friend from Utah standing up again. Here is an explanation that I think will help the Senator from Wisconsin. Obviously, he hopes that people will accept their spending limits and the provision in their measure that would make it pretty hard not to, because if you don't accept the spending limits, you have to pay way more for television than somebody who doesn't. 
It is my view the courts would strike that down as unconstitutional because they are punishing you if you choose to express yourself too much. You get punished because you have to pay more for your broadcast time. 
Clearly, the Senator from Wisconsin wants people to accept the spending limit, and I would argue the spending limit in the original McCain-Feingold is not voluntary at all because the Government basically has a gun to your head. 
If you do not accept it, it costs you a heck of a lot of money. It gets back to this formula we were just discussing. The measure's spending limits are based on a formula that takes each State's voting age population into account. The basic general election spending limit is $400,000, plus 30 percent per voter up to 4 million of the voting age population and 25 percent per voter in excess of 4 million of the voting age population. 
I say to my friend from Utah, it appears as if the voters in excess of 4 million do not get as much spent on them as the voters below 4 million. So presumably you do not speak as much to the people over 4 million as you do to the people under 4 million. But then the general election spending limit can be no lower than $950,000. So presumably if you are in a little State, it cannot go below $950,000 or more than $5.5 million in any State. That presumably would limit California to $5.5 million. Then the basic primary election spending is two-thirds of the general election spending limit, but not more than $2.75 million in any State. 
If I could read on just a minute before taking the question of the Senator from Utah. 
The proposed legislation creates some incredible anomalies that have been omitted from the public debate. Incredible? How else to describe a law, when figured on a per-voter basis, that would allow a Senatorial candidate in Wyoming to spend almost 11.5 times the amount that could be spent by a candidate in California? 
With a 22.8 million voting age population, the biggest of any State, California, under the McCain-Feingold scheme, gets the biggest spending limit. If figured on the same basis as other States, California spending would be $10.5 million; but, in fact, it is capped at $5.5 million. But California is the only State where maximum spending limits, $5.5 million per general and $2.75 million for a primary election would be applied; thus, California's total campaign spending is $8.25 million for the general election, which works out, Mr. President, to about 24.1 cents per voter. 
Not too far away from California, in Wyoming, the State with the least population where there are only 344,000 people of voting age, the spending limit would be $503,200 if it were not for the laws of minimum limit of $1.586 million, general election and primary election, $636,000. The general election spending limit works out to $2.74 per voter. 
Mr. President, over in California under the spending limits regime in the McCain-Feingold bill, which is not in the substitute but will be offered as an amendment if given the opportunity, a voter in California is treated to 24.1 cents in campaigns while Wyoming is $2.76 per voter. 
Putting this in a different perspective, the McCain-Feingold legislation allows senatorial candidates in California to engage in first amendment protective activity at a level of financial activity that is barely one-tenth of the amount that a candidate could spend in Wyoming. To achieve parity so that the voters in the two States receive the same level of general election campaigning from their U.S. Senate candidates would require California candidates to spend an amount that is 11.5 times greater than allowed in the McCain-Feingold bill, a whooping $63.25 million; or you could reduce the amount that could be spent in Wyoming to $82,600. 
Now, why do I bother to mention this Mr. President? This is truly a Rube Goldberg scheme. `We are here from the Government to help you,' and we have concocted this spending limit regime up here in the Government so that the voters in these various States will not be tainted by too much expression being directed at them in the course of their campaigns. But as often is the case when the Federal Government tries to micromanage something, particularly something so difficult as micromanaging political expression, you end up with a sort of absurd result. 
Mr. President, the reason I talk about these spending limits is that they are in the original McCain-Feingold bill. Senator McCain, Senator Feingold do intend--if they have the opportunity--to offer that amendment to give the Senate an opportunity to go on record as saying that California voters only get 24.1 cents spent on them while Wyoming voters get $2.76. This scheme is something that they want us to sanction. 
Mr. President, this is an extraordinarily difficult concept for people of average intelligence to understand. Besides the constitutionality problem, they are also saying that in order to speak more you have to pay more--and you do not get the broadcast discount--or if you decide to speak too much, you pay more for your speech. It is just one of the many problems with the spending limits regime with which the Senate has been confronted not just in this debate, but at various times over the last decade. 
And I ask my friend from Utah, is a voter in Wyoming entitled to more of a campaign than a voter in California?

Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Utah is entirely correct. Even people like Ronald Reagan, who opposed the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974, always checked no on his tax return as a protest against using tax dollars for the Presidential campaign. He had no choice because the contribution limit on candidates for 
President was only $1,000. You simply could not raise enough to compete for President unless you accepted the bribe that the Government offered you to give you so much money to limit your speech. There was simply no choice. And that kind of choice, it seems to me, is similar to what we have here and is really quite unfortunate for candidates because it restricts their options. 
If I may just for a moment go back to the spending limit analogy while my friend from Utah is still up, another example would be to compare New Jersey to New York, two States right next to each other. In New Jersey they are able to spend more money on a candidate than in New York, even though New York has more than twice as many voting age residents as New Jersey. Two States right next to each other, people commuting back and forth to work all the time, and yet somebody in the Government determines that the voters of New Jersey are entitled to more communication than the voters in New York under the formula in the original McCain-Feingold bill. 
Does that strike the Senator from Utah as really very difficult to understand?

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am sure my good friend and colleague from Arizona will agree that politics is a team sport. In order to be effective, we have to have allies. The bill he went back 4 years to had 24 cosponsors. I can assure my friend from Arizona, it had a good idea from all 24. Legislation is, someone said, sort of like making sausage: a little bit of this and a little bit of that. 
I confess to having joined in cosponsoring a bill with a whole lot of things that my friend from Arizona will surely remember that I have consistently argued against for 10 years. But the feeling was, and he remembers it because he cosponsored the bill, that we needed to have a Republican alternative. And in the spirit of being a part of the team, I put my name on a bill. I am sure the Senator from Arizona has never put his name on a bill with which he disagreed with any part. In fact, he said here today he is not entirely happy with the union provision in the bill that he is putting forward. 
The Senator from Kentucky may be guilty of many things, but I think in this debate rarely guilty of inconsistency and many of the things that the Senator from Arizona mentioned I personally argued against prior to coming up with this five-legged dog. Somebody said you might be able to make a five-legged dog, but nobody has ever seen one in nature. 
That is sort of what that bill was. So I confess to having signed on to a bill much of which I thought was probably not the right thing to do. 
But let me ask the Senator from Arizona--he said on Friday and again, I believe, today, any genuinely independent expenditure made to advocate any cause which does not expressly advocate the election or the defeat of a candidate is fully allowed. Is that the view of the Senator from Arizona?

Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Arizona, under the Federal Election Campaign Act the term `independent expenditure" is defined as follows: 
The term `independent expenditure' means an expenditure by a person expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate which is made without cooperation or consultation with any candidate or any authorized committee or agent of such candidate and which is not made in concert with or at the request or suggestion of any candidate or any authorized committee or agent of such candidate.

Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I have the floor. 
All I was trying to say to my friend from Arizona is that worth a good deal more than the opinion of the Senator from Kentucky is the opinion of the Supreme Court, which has said in order to avoid--and admittedly these groups want to criticize us. There is no question about it. They want to criticize us. They want to criticize us. And we hate it. They want to criticize us in proximity to the elections. Sometimes they criticize us earlier than that. 
But the Supreme Court has said that it is issue advocacy unless the words `vote for,' `elect,' `support,' `cast your ballot,' `Smith for Congress,' `vote against,' `defeat,' or `reject'--or it lists the magic words here. It is not really vague. I think the reason the Court did this is because they want to encourage citizens to be free to be critical of us any time they want to. 
I would readily concede to my friend from Arizona we have gotten a lot more criticism in the last couple of years than we used to. I will also readily concede that having been the beneficiary, or victim, depending on your point of view, of some of that myself, I do not like it. But the Court, it seems to me, has made it rather clear that we do not have the right to keep these people, these groups, from expressing their views about our records at any point, whether it is in close proximity to the election or not. 
Now, an independent expenditure, as my friend from Arizona knows, is different. That is hard money. That is regulated by the FEC. In order to qualify as an independent expenditure, you must not consult with those whom you are seeking to aid or reject. 
Issue advocacy is a different animal. The Court has put that in a separate category. Admittedly, the distinctions are sometimes blurred. The Court anticipated in the Buckley case that many times the distinction would be blurred. But they erred on the side of more expression. They erred on the side of allowing more and more citizens, if they chose to, to criticize us at any point they wanted to. 
Now, what we all saw in 1996 was there was a lot of criticism, a lot of criticism by a lot of groups that a lot of people on my side of the aisle did not like. But I think there is not any chance whatsoever the Supreme Court is going to allow us by legislation to make it difficult for people to criticize us just because it may be in close proximity to an election. 
Therein lies the dilemma. My good friend from Arizona is trying hard to do that. I understand why he would like to do it. These campaigns are a source of great irritation to the people who run for public office. I understand that.

That is just my opinion. But it is also the opinion of many, including the American Civil Liberties Union, who have looked at this particular area.

Mr. McCONNELL. No, not right now. 
I say to my friend from Arizona, it is not at all clear that express advocacy has to be independent. But nevertheless, the Senator from Arizona is entirely correct that the words are in a footnote. There is no question that the words are in a footnote. 
On the other hand, there have been at least 15 cases in this field. This has been a field that has been very much litigated. The Federal Election Commission has been interested in going after issue advocacy groups for years. So there has been a lot of litigation on the issue that my friend from Arizona raises. 
He raises a good point, it is in a footnote. It is not like we haven't been there before. There have been 15 cases. The FEC has lost every single issue advocacy case seeking to do things similar--similar--to what is sought to be done by legislation here. 
Recently in the Citizens Action Network case, not only did the fourth circuit rule against the Federal Election Commission trying to do what we are trying to do here, it ordered them to pay the legal fees of the group that they were out to quiet. 
So the only thing I say to my friend from Arizona, he is right, it is a footnote. On the other hand, this is something that the courts have had a good deal to say about, a good deal to say about, and there has been a lot of litigation on this whole question of trying to quiet the voices of those who would criticize us for our votes. 
I see my friend from Utah is on the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. My friend from Wisconsin, who is a distinguished lawyer and went to Harvard knows that pornography does not enjoy the same level of protection as political speech. The Supreme Court has always put political discourse in a special protected category. Pornography, by its very definition, has been excluded from first amendment protection. 
My guess is that in that particular piece of litigation we didn't have a very good idea how the Supreme Court was going to decide and the Senator from Wisconsin is probably going to say why not take a chance here and see if the Court will uphold these restrictions on express advocacy.

Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, that ad sounds very similar to some newspaper editorials I have read during the end of campaigns and in editorial endorsements, another form of criticism that we typically find very offensive. 
My guess is, absent the words `vote for,' or `vote against,' the others that we went over in the Buckley case, the Court would in all likelihood say those voters are perfectly free to make candidate Winston Bryant very uncomfortable before his election. 
And I understand that the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Arizona would like to change that standard and give the Supreme Court another chance to try to reach a different decision. 
Let me tell you why, Madam President, I think it is extremely unlikely that the Court would go in the direction that the Senator from Wisconsin would like it to go. Referring again to the American Civil Liberties Union, America's experts on the first amendment, dealing with the restrictions on independent expenditures and issue advocacy in the bill we are discussing. 
They say the new restrictions on independent expenditure are improperly intruding upon the core area of electoral speech and invading the absolutely protected area of issue advocacy--absolutely protected area of issue advocacy. 
The ACLU went on: Two basic truths have emerged with crystal clarity after 20 years of campaign finance decisions-- 20 years. This is not a new area of the law; 20 years of campaign finance decisions. 
First, independent expenditures for express electoral advocacy by citizen groups about political candidates lie at the very core of the meaning and purpose of the first amendment. This is not some peripheral area here--the very core of the first amendment. 
Second, issue advocacy by citizen groups lie totally outside the permissible area of Government regulation. So I say to my friend from Wisconsin, my prediction that no matter how much candidate Bryant may not have liked that criticism, my prediction that the Court is likely to uphold the ability of citizens to band together and engage in that criticism is based not on some kind of speculation but on 20 years of decisions in this field. 
So I guess my prediction, in answer to the question the Senator from Wisconsin asked, is that I don't think there is any chance the Court would allow the Congress to make it tougher for people to criticize us. There is absolutely no hint in 20 years of cases in this area that the Court is going to backtrack and give us the ability to quiet our critics. We would love to do this. 
One thing I am sure the Senator from Wisconsin and I agree on, we don't like this kind of thing. We really would prefer not to be criticized by either of these avenues, whether it is independent expenditures or whether it is express advocacy, we don't like it. I think we can stipulate that. 
However, the Court has been rather clear over 20 years that 
we are not going to be able to quiet these voices. So my prediction would be that they would not allow us to do it. 
There are others who want to speak. I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. As an observation on what the Senator said about leveling the playing field, that was raised in the Buckley case, and the Supreme Court said it was constitutionally impermissible for the Government to try to level the playing field. In fact, the Court said: 
The concept that Government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the first amendment. 
So my friend from Utah is correct, even if it were possible somehow for the Government to figure out how to micromanage and level the playing field, it is truly constitutionally impermissible for the Government to try to do that.

Mr. McCONNELL. I was listening with great interest to my friend from Utah in describing the Government controls over political speech that are a part of or actually at the heart of McCain-Feingold. I know, for example, that there is this distinction which the Senator from Utah referred to in terms of what is commonly referred to as issue advocacy. Do things on the 61st day before the election, but if it is the 60th day or closer, you can't do other things. 
I am sure my friend from Utah knows this, but an agency of the Federal Government would be put in charge of making these decisions, would it not?

Is the Senator from Kentucky right in assuming that would be the likelihood of this?

Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Utah, this is an interesting hypothetical to discuss, but there is virtually no chance the courts would allow the kinds of restrictions on issue advocacy in the McCain-Feingold bill. The Supreme Court addresses issue advocacy; that is, the way others are able to criticize our records. 
What the Senator from Massachusetts is saying, I think, is that he would like that criticism to be less effective. In other words, do not use something really effective like television, just go out and go door to door. There isn't any chance the Supreme Court is going to say, `Deny to an aggrieved group the opportunity to use the most effective way to criticize our records,' which we all know requires: (a) The expenditure of money, and (b) the use of television. That is the easiest way for that criticism to have an impact. 
The good news is--the good news is--there is virtually no chance that any court in America would uphold the kinds of restrictions on issue advocacy by groups that are contained not only in the original McCain-Feingold bill but in the substitute that in all likelihood will be offered Monday. That is the good news. 
I thank my friend from Utah.

<TEXT>
Mr. McCONNELL. I want to commend the distinguished Senator from Utah for his very enlightening presentation. Since I have not yet spoken on issue advocacy, I want to pick up for a few moments what we were discussing at the end of the colloquy with the Senator from Massachusetts. On the question of issue advocacy, the Court has not been vague on this at all. This is not a gray area. 
The Court has been quite precise in the area of issue advocacy. Issue advocacy is criticism of us. Groups are entitled to do it at any time they want to and as loud as they want to. We never like it. We can stipulate that we never like it. Now, the biggest group in America in the field of issue advocacy on television is the AFL-CIO, and it is mostly targeted to Members of my party. We can stipulate that we do not like it worth a darn. But no effort to try to restrict that through legislation in the Congress is going to change it. 
It is not a gray area. The Nation's experts on the first amendment, I think we would all agree, is the American Civil Liberties Union. In a letter to me earlier this year, they said this about the provisions in McCain-Feingold dealing with issue advocacy. This is the exact quote, Mr. President: 
Worst of all is S. 25's blunderbuss assault on issue-oriented speech. The weapon is an unconstitutional expansion of the definition of `expressed advocacy' in order to sweep classic issue speech within the zone of regulation as independent expenditures. 
So let me just make it simple. There isn't any chance, Mr. President--no chance--that through legislation, we can shut up all of these groups who seek to criticize us. We can stipulate that we do not like it, but they are going to keep on doing it. No amount of standing up here on the floor of the Senate and arguing that somehow we are going to be able to purify the process and get rid of all these critics is going to get the job done. 
In this whole field, Mr. President, at the end of the day we get back to the Constitution. You begin and you end this debate with the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as the Senator from Utah has pointed out. This is core political speech, according to the U.S. Supreme Court. That is not Mitch McConnell's interpretation. That is not Bob Bennett's interpretation. This is the law of the land. As the Senator from Utah said, when you start moving around in this field, you better tread lightly. The courts were not only good in the Buckley case, they have been good since. The whole trend has been to more broaden the area of permissible political discourse in this country. 
The Court has said it is impermissible for us to decide how much political speech is enough--impermissible. In spite of that, the reformers persist in promoting the notion that it is somehow desirable for the Federal Government to determine how much political discourse we are going to have in our campaigns in this country. 
You hear them say time and time again--we heard it this morning, and we will hear it next week--`We're spending too much in American politics.' 
Remember what the Supreme Court says that means: that they are saying, `We're speaking too much. We're speaking too much.' How much is too much? 
Last year, there was a lot of political speaking because there was a war on out there for the future of the country. We had a change in 1994, and a Republican Congress came in for the first time in 40 years. The status quo forces didn't like it, and they fought back in 1996. A good deal was said. That is speech. A lot of it cost money, and spending did go up. 
When all was said and done, I say to my friend Utah, we spent 
per eligible voter last year $3.89, about the price of a McDonald's value meal. Looking at it another way, of all the commercials that were shown on television last year, 1 percent of them were political commercials. And they say we are speaking too much. They think it is a good idea to shut all these people up, shut down those outside groups that are criticizing us, put a cap on how much a campaign can say. 
Who gets the power then? Conspicuously exempted--and I am not arguing we ought to take away the exemption--but conspicuously exempted from the Federal Election Campaign Act is the press. 
I have looked and I have searched to see whether there is any provision in here, and I say to my friend from Utah, that the press cannot criticize us in the last 60 days of an election. I have been looking feverishly to see if I can find if there is any prohibition on the press endorsing candidates in the last 60 days of the election. Maybe I just have not read this carefully enough, but I cannot seem to find it. 
So what we are talking about here is a transfer of power away from groups that want to comment about our record and talk about us, frequently in an unfavorable way. The original version of McCain-Feingold wanted to shut up the campaigns themselves so they could not talk too much. And I hear from Senator McCain, he is going to offer an amendment to try to bring that back. 
We shut down the campaigns and we shut down the issue groups. Who gets to talk? Who gets to talk about Government interference in the last 60 days of the election? Why, the press gets to talk. We know darn good and well that all of this issue advocacy restriction in here is flatout unconstitutional and is not a question in anybody's mind that knows anything about the Supreme Court. 
OK, so issue advocacy survives in the courts. Even if we passed it here, somehow that spending limits on campaigns survives, so you are going down the home stretch, you are in the last few days, and the campaign runs out of money and you can't say anything. But the labor unions are there with issue advocacy, they have raised their money by checking off union dues, taking it in many instances from people involuntarily. They are hammering away at you, the liberal press is running exposes on the front page and endorsing your opponent on the editorial page--welcome to the brave new world of campaign finance reform where the groups are shut up, the candidates are shut up, and the press is running the game. 
Now, the good news is the Court will not allow this to happen. But what is sad is that anybody would even be proposing this. What is disturbing is that anybody would even be suggesting that it would be a good idea to have less political discourse in this country. 
There is a lot of discussion going on all the time about public affairs in this country. The press is talking about it every day. Most objective studies would indicate that 85 to 90 percent of the people in that line of the work are on the left. Hollywood is making statements all the time about what kind of society we have. Many of us feel about 100 percent of them are on the left. So you have the press on the left, you have Hollywood on the left, and the candidates and the groups with the Government clamping down on what they can say in the heat of a campaign. It sounds like something straight out of Orwell's `1984.' Yet there is serious discussion here on the floor of the U.S. Senate that this somehow would be an improvement in the American political system. 
Write it down--we are not speaking too much in the American political process. We are not going to pass this unconstitutional piece of legislation. If we were foolish enough to do it, the courts would strike it down. The argument we hear is the people are crying out for us to do this, that they are just desperate for us to pass this kind of legislation. Let me say in a survey taken just a few months ago by a reputable polling firm which I was just looking at this week, they asked 1,017 registered voters open-ended what they thought the most important problem in America was, and not a single one of them mentioned campaign finance reform. Then the pollsters thought maybe it will be different if they put it on the list, so they put it on a list of 10 topics. It came in dead last of the 10. 
We will hear time and time again, as I have today, and we will hear it more next week, that everyone is clamoring for us to pass this big Government solution to this nonexistent problem of too much political discussion in this country. Eighty-seven percent of the people, by the way, would be less likely to vote for a Member who supports unconstitutional reform. 
Now the proponents of this legislation this week sent out a press release saying they had found 126 people who said this bill was constitutional. My reaction to that is that I could probably find 126 people who say the Earth is flat. But the people who handle this litigation, America's experts on the first amendment--the American Civil Liberties Union, and clear and unambiguous decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court--make it abundantly clear that this is unconstitutional. 
Now, the people of the United States did not send us up here to pass blatantly unconstitutional legislation. Sure, you can craft a question that will get the answer you want. Spending limits on the surface sounds like a good idea. If you ask people 
if they are in favor of spending limits they will say yes. On the other hand, if you rephrase the question and say do you think there ought to be a limit on how many people can participate in your campaign, 99 percent of them will say no. The same issue expressed a different way. 
So the people are not clamoring for us to shut down political discussion in this country. They are not clamoring for us to push people out of the process. They are not asking us to make it impossible for them to criticize our records in proximity to an election. Sure, if you ask them about the influence of special interests they will say that is a terrible thing. Do you know the definition of a special interest, Mr. President? Special interest is a group that is against what I am trying to do. But of course the organization I belong to--whether it is the VFW, the Farm Bureau, the National Rifle Association or the Electrical Workers Union--we are not a special interest. We are a bunch of Americans trying to do the right thing for our country. The term special interest is meaningless. It is a pejorative term applied to any group opposed to what we want done. 
As a practical matter, the founders of this country knew that there would be a seething cauldron of special interests. They expected us to organize. They expected us to contribute to campaigns. They expected us to be criticized if we came here to serve in the Senate or in the House. We were not to be above criticism. They envisioned lobbyists. That is another part of the First Amendment. It gives people the right to petition the Government. A lobbyist, of course, is a person working for a group trying to do something I'm against. But the person we have hired to represent our group in Washington is doing the right thing. 
Mr. President, this is going to be a good debate. There may be an effort in this bill to shut off campaigns, to quiet the voices of independent groups who want to criticize us, but there is going to be plenty of discussion on this issue here in the Senate. I hope, Mr. President, that many people will take an opportunity to listen in because when they hear the words `campaign finance reform,' they don't understand that generally means somebody is trying to put the Government in charge of their ability to participate in the American political process. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before the Senator from New Jersey leaves, if I might just impose upon him for a few moments. I was listening to his comments and his enthusiasm for the portions of the McCain-Feingold bill that seek to make it more difficult for citizens to engage in issue advocacy and to 
change the rules with regard to independent expenditures. 
I make reference to a letter I received from the American Civil Liberties Union earlier this year discussing those two types of citizen expression. Quoting from the letter: 
Two basic truths have emerged with crystal clarity after 20 years of campaign finance decisions. 
That is after a whole string of cases, beginning with Buckley. 
First, independent expenditures for `express electoral advocacy' by citizens groups about political candidates lie at the very core of the meaning and purpose of the first amendment. 
Second, issue advocacy by citizen groups lies totally outside the permissible area of Government regulation. 
I say to my friend from New Jersey, on what basis does he reach the conclusion that there is any chance whatsoever that these portions of the McCain-Feingold, since there is no hint that the courts are ever going to tamper with express advocacy--there is a whole line of cases, the most recent one about 3 months ago--does my friend from New Jersey think there is going to be some revelation in the courts? Are they going to rethink 20 years of decisions in this area? Or does he think we ought to just pass, blatantly, unconstitutional legislation regardless of what the Supreme Court says?

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may regain my time. The Senator from Washington has been waiting to speak. Mr. President, it is not an open constitutional question; it is a closed constitutional question. There is no chance that the courts are going to allow these kinds of restrictions on independent expenditures and issue advocacy.

Mr. McCONNELL. I think the Senator from Washington is correct. There are simply no cases on the issue of whether the Congress could in effect federalize the two national parties; what McCain-Feingold seeks to do. Soft money by definition means non-Federal money. Our two great national parties get involved in Governors' races, county commissioners' races, legislators' races, and so on. 
This bill seeks to basically turn them into Federal parties, and take away their ability to participate outside the Federal system. 
The Senator from Washington is entirely correct. There simply aren't any cases on that point because nobody has ever thought that was a good idea before. 
So I think my colleague is correct. Even if maybe some court would rule that you could do it, it is not a desirable result.

Mr. McCONNELL. If I could ask my friend from Washington, I listened carefully to his observations about independent expenditures, which are so-called hard money, federally regulated within the FEC jurisdiction, and his observations about non-Federal money, soft money, which is outside the Federal jurisdiction, both of which there are whole lines of cases--I have counted 13 here just in the few moments I was 
listening to Senator from Washington--making it abundantly clear there is nothing we can do here in the Congress to restrict either. 
My question to my friend from Washington is, if a Member of Congress were sort of cynically approaching this issue and his real goal was to weaken, for example, the Republican National Committee, would he not be pretty safe to advocate some kind of new restrictions on independent expenditures and issue advocacy since there is literally no chance the courts would uphold it and take the gamble that a court might, never having ruled in a whole area of party soft money, weaken the parties with a ruling saying it is possible to federalize the two parties; organized labor would then, as the biggest force engaging in issue advocacy, still be totally unrestricted, as you and I think they should be. And since the Republican National Committee responds to those issue advocacy campaigns with its soft money, would not such an approach benefit substantially, it could be argued, our dear colleagues on the other side of the aisle for whom the AFL-CIO issue advocacy is almost 100 percent favorable?

If my friend will yield, in fact the Democratic National Committee had the option to report in October, chose not to, for the very reason we all know now, that it would have been horrible publicity. So the act of rather contemporaneously disclosing, as my friend is pointing out, would have created at least a decision on their part, Are we going to take the money and take the heat or are we going to forgo the money? Disclosure would have been the best disinfectant.

Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my good friend from Washington for his really quite straight observations about this debate. They are right on point. He has articulately pointed out that in a country where the Government is $1.6 trillion a year, it is not unreasonable to assume that people would want to influence in whatever way they could the decisions that are made that affect their lives so greatly. The Court has made it perfectly clear that the ability to speak and to influence the course of events in any way that is constitutionally permissible is going to be protected, and the only really honest debate, as the Senator from Washington pointed out, was from those who stood up and said we ought to amend the first amendment for the first time in 200 years to give the Government the power to control political discourse. The good news is, Mr. President, only 38 Members of the Senate voted to amend the first amendment for the first time in 200 years. The first amendment is going to be secure today and it is still going to be secure when the debate on McCain-Feingold is over.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the career of Don Gordon, an outstanding newspaperman, who has retired after a distinguished career in journalism. Don served the western Kentucky area for 8 years as editorial editor for the Paducah Sun. 
Don was born in Overland, MO, and upon graduating high school, served his country in the navy during the Korean war. In 1959, he graduated from the University of Missouri with a degree in journalism and has worked for newspapers ever since. Don has been a reporter, city editor, copy editor, and managing editor and has worked for newspapers in Missouri, Illinois, Oklahoma, and South Carolina, before coming to Kentucky. He and his wife, Zona, moved to Paducah in 1989, to return to a part of the country they love. 
Don's interest in writing began at a very early age, and during his school days he was involved in printing neighborhood news and sports sheets. In the years when Don first became a professional journalist, it was very rare for a reporter to be credited with a byline. However, a series of articles Don wrote covering a murder trial so impressed one of his first editors, that he was given a byline for his good work. This was only to be the first of many instances in which Don's work was to be recognized by his peers. While reluctant to mention such things, he has won awards for best editorial from the Kentucky Press Association and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for journalism. 
`Excellence' is the word that best describes Don's work. Day after day, he consistently brought public issues into perspective by combining a mastery of the written language and knowledge of a variety of subjects, both local and national. He was a newspaperman's newspaperman. 
Retirement in Don's case does not mean that he will be inactive. After 41 years of marriage, he and Zona will now have the opportunity to travel. The West and Alaska beckon. The couple also looks forward to serving as volunteer missionaries. They are active in Trinity Baptist Church, and have been involved in the Gideon Bible Society, and served in jail and prison ministries. 
Mr. President, I commend Don Gordon for his outstanding service to western Kentucky. He will be missed by friends and coworkers, and just as importantly, by his many devoted readers. I ask that you and my fellow colleagues join me in recognizing the career of this outstanding Kentuckian, and wishing him well in all future pursuits.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for the inclusion of my two amendments in S. 830. My amendments address specific food labeling reforms that benefit both consumers and the food and agriculture industry. 
First, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 [NLEA] requires that any nutrient content claim on a food label be accompanied by a referral statement--`See Back Panel for Nutrition Information.' The original intent of this provision was to help educate consumers about the presence and location of nutrition information on food products. Based on the NLEA's success, today few consumers even notice this generic referral statement because most individuals immediately look to the mandatory Nutrition Facts panel to obtain nutrition information. 
My proposal seeks to improve the effectiveness of this consumer notice by requiring a referral statement only in those instances where the FDA identifies that a food contains a nutrient at a level that could increase the risk of a health condition for vulnerable persons. 
For example, if a food label states that the product is low in fat, but the FDA finds that the sodium content could prove harmful to persons with high blood pressure, the referral statement would state--`See Nutrition Information Panel for Sodium Content.' 
Through the continued use of a specific referral statement, persons who may find themselves at risk from potentially harmful levels of some nutrients would be reminded where to find detailed nutrition information. My proposal simply removes the requirement for a generic referral statement whose purpose is now fulfilled by active consumer use of the Nutrition Facts panel. 
My second proposal addresses a keen concern for American consumers today--food safety. The much publicized outbreaks of E. Coli 0157:H7, cyclospora, and salmonella have captured the attention and apprehension of Americans, particularly parents, who are concerned about the inadvertent exposure to food pathogens. 
Since the 1960's, food irradiation has presented a safe, simple, and inexpensive process to kill harmful pathogens in many foods. Today, this approved food safety technology promises to reduce the incidence of many food borne illnesses which threaten the health of millions of Americans, especially the very young and the very old. 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>105-mcconnell-ky-2-19970924</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. McCONNELL. In addition to the FDA, the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture agree that food irradiation presents no health risk, and have endorsed irradiation as a method to prevent food borne diseases. Today, more than 35 countries have approved irradiation as a safe food treatment technology. 
Despite their well-documented food safety benefits, few irradiated foods are marketed in the United States. Why? Because the 
current labeling requirements render the foods virtually unmarketable. FDA regulations require that irradiated foods prominently and conspicuously bear the international radura symbol and the phrase `treated with irradiation' or `treated by irradiation.' Clearly, public notice of irradiation is necessary for informed consumer choice. However, the degree of prominence for the current irradiation labeling creates a false impression among many consumers that the irradiation statement is a warning. This unintended labeling result must be corrected. Targeted improvements in the labeling will provide consumers with clearer information on irradiation's approved use and provide a simple means to further food safety in our Nation. 
My amendment simply requires irradiated foods to bear an appropriate disclosure requirement and specifies that the FDA-approved disclosure need not be more prominent than the ingredient statement. The intent of my amendment is for the FDA to revise its irradiation disclosure requirement to assure that consumers do not misinterpret this disclosure as a warning. 
Clearly, the FDA should have the authority to require appropriate disclosure of food irradiation. However, the use of a disclosure design that discourages the utilization of this government-approved technology compromises efforts by the FDA and food processors to improve food safety in our Nation.

<DOCNO>105-mcconnell-ky-3-19970924</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. McCONNELL. I want to emphasize that even with this amendment FDA would retain full authority to regulate all aspects of irradiation on food, including products on which it can be used, what dose can be used, and the content and placement of irradiation labeling. Under my amendment, the FDA can still use the current radura symbol and the disclosure statement. No information would be hidden from consumers. In the same manner that the FDA alerts purchasers to the presence of allergens, the FDA has the ability to inform consumers of the use of food irradiation. I also want to emphasize that this modest labeling improvement does not diminish the need for the FDA, USDA, the food industry, and consumer groups to work together to improve the public's understanding of how food irradiation works and its potential benefits to public health. 
Mr. President, I believe that the inclusion of these amendments in S. 830 demonstrates the U.S. Senate's interest in food safety and effective labeling. Again, I greatly appreciate the consideration that the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources have given to these targeted food labeling reforms.

Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, in 1906, Congress approved the first national statute to prevent the sale of adulterated and misbranded food and drugs. Since then, the FDA's responsibility to protect the health and safety of American consumers from unsafe products has expanded to cover over one-third of the products sold in our Nation. 
While medical research and technological developments have revolutionized our Nation's capacity to advance the public health, the FDA's adherence to bureaucratic and inefficient practices threatens to undermine the potential benefit of these hard-earned innovations. In the 1950's, it took a new drug or medical device approximately 8 years or less to achieve FDA approval. Today, the average time for approval runs between 12 to 15 years. Over the course of 20 years, the FDA's product approval system has undergone careful study by Congress, investigational committees, and the FDA itself, and each has identified key areas of reform that would enhance FDA performance. 
This week, the U.S. Senate considers vital legislation to ensure that the FDA can successfully fulfill its core mission to protect public health and safety through priority management, timely review of product applications, and effective use of expert resources. S. 830, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization and Accountability Act, reflects the fundamental recommendation of the Advisory Committee on the Food and Drug Administration that the FDA `should be guided by the principle that expeditious approval of useful and safe new products enhances the health of the American people.' The Advisory Committee noted that product approval `can be as important as preventing the marketing of harmful or ineffective products, . . . especially . . . for people with life-threatening illnesses and for diseases for which alternative therapies have not been approved.' In other words, antiquated procedures that promote unnecessary delays in the review of new products and therapies fail to promote the public health. 
In recent weeks, misinformation regarding the purpose and application of S. 830 reforms has been disseminated. As a supporter of S. 830 and a member of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, I want to clarify the objectives of this important legislative initiative. 
First, this bill clearly sets forth the FDA's mission to protect the public health by ensuring products meet appropriate regulatory standards, and to act promptly and efficiently in its review of clinical research and other information relevant to the marketing of approved products. 
Second, S. 830 responds to increasing public concern on the lack of access to investigational products for patients suffering from serious or life-threatening diseases. The FDA has established programs for the compassionate use of investigational products, however, only a limited number of patients have benefited from these opportunities. This bill will enable any patient with a seriously debilitating or immediately life-threatening condition to gain access to an investigational drug or device if the request is made by a licensed physician and the product's use meets the FDA's standards for expanded access. S. 830 also improves patient access to new therapies through a new fast-track drug approval process. 
Third, the bill addresses key deficiencies in the assessment of pharmaceutical effects on children. Currently, there is no systematic means for testing drug safety and efficacy for pediatric use. S. 830 will allow the Secretary to request pediatric clinical trials for new drug applications and provide an extra 6 months of market exclusivity to manufacturers who voluntarily meet conditions under the trial program. 
Fourth, this measure will improve the availability of health care economics information for medical providers, and create data bases about on-going research and clinical trials for new lifesaving therapies for patients. Access to clear, concise information will help both health care professionals and patients identify the best course of medical treatment available. 
Fifth, S. 830 contains a series of reforms to assure that the FDA utilizes the scientific expertise of qualified Federal agencies, like the National Institutes of Health, and accredited outside organizations in order to improve the timeliness and quality of product reviews. The bill also contains reforms to ensure that the application process for new products is governed by consistent and equitable regulatory requirements in the areas of product classification, review, and approval. 
Sixth, this measure reaffirms the FDA's accountability for the performance of its Federal obligations. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee for Agriculture, I have repeatedly questioned the FDA regarding its failure to prioritize resources for the fulfillment of its statutory requirements. In response to these concerns, S. 830 requires the FDA to develop a clear plan outlining how it will comply with its obligations under Federal statute, and report to Congress annually on the plan's implementation. In addition, the FDA must streamline and update procedures for product review and inspection so its resources are applied cost effectively. 
Seventh, S. 830 contains targeted reforms for food regulation. The bill simplifies the approval process for indirect food contact substances. It provides a more reasonable standard for the use of bona fide health claims based on the authoritative recommendations of qualified scientific bodies, such as the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While food reforms take on a minor role in this bill, I look forward to working with my fellow members on legislation that will more thoroughly address the regulatory concerns of the food industry. 
Finally, S. 830 reauthorizes the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. In 1992, the FDA and pharmaceutical industry agreed to the collection of additive user fees to pay for the additional staff needed to rectify delays in the review of new drug applications. This reauthorization proposal seeks to build upon those successes through new performance goals and equipment modernization plans. PDUFA serves as a clear example that the FDA can work with regulated industry and consumers to advance the public health through priority management and efficient use of resources. 
Madam President, S. 830 has been formed brick by brick from inclusive, bipartisan negotiations by representatives of the FDA, the Clinton administration, the U.S. Senate, industry, and consumer groups. The purpose of this bill is not to weaken the FDA's ability to defend the public health, but rather to enhance its capacity to fulfill this statutory obligation. Whether the issue is food safety or a breakthrough medical treatment, our Nation's researchers will only be successful if the FDA is prepared to effectively respond to the quickening pace of scientific discovery. S. 830 lays this essential foundation for the FDA's future, and I urge my colleagues to join in its approval.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the comments of the Democratic leader and Senator Feingold. I would just like to say briefly in response, there is no reluctance to debate this issue. Those of us who oppose McCain-Feingold look forward to the debate. We relish the debate. 
My colleague in the chair remembers when we stayed up all night to debate this about 5 weeks before the 1994 election, which was the greatest victory for my party in congressional races in this century. 
So let me just disabuse all of my colleagues of the notion that there is any reluctance on the part of those who oppose putting the Government in charge of political speech of individual groups, candidates, and parties in this country, any reluctance to debate the merits of that proposal. There is no reluctance whatsoever. 
What the majority leader was trying to do here today was to structure that debate in such a way as to provide minimal inconvenience to Members of the Senate. The Democratic leader said we can get there the hard way or the easy way. We have no reluctance to get there the hard way, Mr. President, no reluctance whatsoever. 
The majority leader was simply trying to accommodate all of the Senate by providing an orderly, structured way to have a debate that we relish, look forward to making. My experience with this issue over the years is the more colleagues and the American people and, yes, the press learns about the issue the better, the greater likelihood the first amendment will be protected. 
So bring on the debate. We are ready for it. But, obviously, it will be a lot easier on everyone if we did it an orderly, structured way. That is what the majority leader was seeking to do. I commend him for that, and look forward to the debate that will be forthcoming. We will be happy to do it either the hard way or the easy way, whichever seems to suit the Senate the best. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Madam President, I think the explanation of the distinguished Senator from Washington makes it quite clear that support for his amendment would mean more money for the school districts of my State of Kentucky and substantially fewer regulations with which they would have to comply. 
It seems to me, Madam President, as education moves into the position of No. 1 on the interest chart of the American people, it is our responsibility here at the Federal level to think of ways that we can further enhance American education and help those who are really doing the job, which are obviously the local school districts and the parents of our country. 
So I commend the Senator from Washington for a superb amendment and indicate my enthusiastic support for the Gorton amendment. I urge my colleagues, when we finally have a vote, to resoundingly support a proposal that clearly will benefit the school districts and the children of America. 
Madam President, few would dispute that one of the primary concerns of American families today is the quality of education that our children receive. I am sure that other Members of the Senate have heard from concerned parents as I have. They don't understand why instruction in the most basic skills has fallen to the wayside, and they fear that a rudderless education will leave their children adrift and unprepared for the future. 
Nearly everyone involved in education today--parents, teachers, administrators, and legislators--wants to improve the quality of learning in America. But the quest for education reform will only be successful if the classrooms--the classrooms--have the money they need to implement change and follow-through on the academic programming our children need. 
When the Senate approves funding for education, most of our constituents believe--and trust--that those moneys are going directly to their child's school. But, the numbers show that this is not the case. An examination reveals that out of $100 billion in Federal education support, local schools received only $13 billion. Let me repeat--$13 billion of $100 billion. Where is this money going? It's supporting paper-pushing and concept discussions in the Washington, DC education offices of adults while our children starve for learning aides and chalk at home. 
Senator Gorton's amendment to S. 1061 seeks to help our children by actually providing their schools with the funds we assign to them. This amendment consolidates selected Federal education funds for kindergarten through 12th grade and sends the money directly to school districts. State and local education agencies can then use these additional funds to design and operate the quality education programs families are begging for. It does not change the administration of funds for special education, professional development for teachers, adult education, education research, the national writing project, impact aid, and other similar programs. 
This amendment will not undermine education in America. It seeks to strengthen a teetering educational system by focusing our resources on the construction of a firm foundation--strong schools. I am confident that Kentucky communities can use these funds to better their future. Local educators must negotiate through a teeming swamp of administrative rules and regulations in order to meet the day-to-day needs of their students. They need flexibility to implement change and determine what works. The Gorton amendment provides the first key step to stronger schools across America--funding children's education not layers of repetitive bureaucracy. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the Gorton amendment and its promise to help our Nation's schools fulfill their commitment to our children and communities.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I commend my friend and colleague from Alabama for an outstanding amendment. I listened carefully to his comments, Senator Faircloth's comments, and Senator Craig's comments. 
As I understand the amendment by the distinguished Senator from Alabama, he is in effect here giving the Senate a choice, if I understand correctly, a choice between legal fees and children's health. The Senator from Alabama pointed out that as a State attorney general he had the option to retain private counsel to engage in this litigation which is going on in 30-some odd States around the country, and that he chose not to do it, but that many State attorneys general chose to hire private counsel to pursue this litigation against the tobacco companies. 
Now we understand, as the distinguished Senator from Alabama pointed out, there are fee arrangements not known to the public under which there could be billions of dollars in fees paid to these lawyers who in effect were acting on behalf of State governments---- 
Is that right, I say to my friend from Alabama?

Mr. McCONNELL. Engaged in the business of the public to recover the Medicaid costs. And we are not sure how much those fees are. 
Now, it is suggested that the Federal Government, the Congress of the United States, ratify--we will have a proposal at some point this year or next year--ratify what is referred to as the global tobacco settlement. So the distinguished 
Senator from Alabama is simply saying that this is a matter of public concern. 
It will actually, if it is passed, be a matter of Federal law. If we are going to sanction this kind of agreement, the distinguished Senator from Alabama is saying we would like to make a decision as how best to deploy the public money in this global settlement. Some of the public money, Mr. President, is obviously legal fees for those who, on behalf of State governments, brought these lawsuits. 
The distinguished Senator from Alabama is not being unfair, it seems to me, to the lawyers. As I understand the amendment, he is saying, up to $5 million per State or at a rate of $250 an hour, whichever is less----

Mr. McCONNELL. Would be the capped fee arrangement for these private lawyers doing public business at the behest of the State attorneys general. And $5 million, Mr. President, is not a bad year's work, not a bad 2 years' work--for many Americans not a bad lifetime's work. 
So the distinguished Senator from Alabama is not saying that these lawyers, if you have been hired by the State government, you have to do it for nothing. All he is saying in effect is you don't get to gouge us. So he has set here a reasonable limit, some would argue maybe even too generous, and saying any excess amounts that have been agreed to should be diverted to the children of America at the National Institutes of Health to fund research for children and children's diseases. 
I think it is an outstanding amendment. I commend the distinguished Senator from Alabama for his amendment. I think it makes an awful lot of sense. It is clearly an amendment in the best interest of the children of America. So, Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for his leadership on this issue. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Trade and Professional Association Free Flow of Information Act, and ask my colleagues to join me by co-sponsoring this important legislation. 
Our society is increasingly litigious, especially in the area of product liability. Unfortunately, complex product liability litigation ensnares trade and professional associations that do not manufacture, buy, or sell the product. America's litigation maze often traps associations who do nothing more than publish good-faith factual information for its members regarding various products. 
This service is particularly helpful to small business owners who become involved in product litigation, but lack the funds to conduct expensive and time-consuming product research. Additionally, trade and professional associations help their members to avoid litigation by alerting them to critical characteristics of different products. This research and information service is clearly in the best interest of both consumers and small businesses. 
My bill would acomplish three goals. First, it grants trade and professional associations limited protection from liability when acting in good faith to provide information to their members. The associations may still be held liable for fraudulently or recklessly distributing false information to their members. 
Second, before information may be subpoenaed from an association, a clear case must be made that the information is vital to the case and is unavailable from any other source. Let me point out, however, that this provision does not prevent associations from being served with subpoenas. It merely ensures that the information requested is vital to a particular action and unavailable from any other source. 
Finally, the bill establishes a qualified privilege between an association and its members to ensure that confidential materials can be provided for the benefit of association members. This privilege is not absolute--it may be overcome upon proof that the party seeking the materials has a compelling need for the information. This provision is based on a joint defense privilege currently recognized by state and federal courts. 
Additionally, this bill includes an opt-out provision similar to the one we included in the Volunteer Protection Act, which the President recently signed into law. This provision permits a State to opt-out of the bill's coverage in any civil action in which all parties are citizens of the State. 
Mr. President, the need for this bill was recently discussed in an article of the Legal Times. I ask unanimous consent that this article be published in the Record. 
In closing, I would like to emphasize that this bill will allow associations to continue to actively disseminate valuable information to their members, while safeguarding current legal protections against fraud and abuse. The goal of the Free Flow of Information Act is one that I believe I share with a majority of my colleagues--a decrease in costly litigation coupled with an increase in the flow of information between associations and their members. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Dave Nakdimen, an outstanding newsman, who retired after a wonderful career in television news. 
Dave served the Louisville area for 36 years on WAVE television news. 
Dave was born in London, KY, and became interested in journalism by listening to the radio at an early age. After years of listening to political news and election-night returns, Dave decided to study journalism at the University of Kentucky. After graduation in 1955, he took a job as a sports writer with the Lexington Leader. While working in Lexington, he met his future wife, Wanda, who was moving to Louisville to take a job at a local hospital. After they became engaged, they packed their bags and headed to Louisville, where Dave landed a job at WAVE-TV. The rest is history. 
WAVE was his first job in broadcast media. Dave was assigned to cover city hall, and there he met and interviewed some of the most important men and women in the last half of this century. Dave covered the civil rights movement of the 1960's, where he interviewed Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. during an open-housing march. He also interviewed Ronald Reagan, George Bush, David Brinkley, John Wayne, and countless other memorable personalities. 
Dave won't be resting during his retirement, though; he's returning to WAVE-TV after a brief vacation to produce weekly commentaries for the station's 6 o'clock newscasts. When asked by the the Courier-Journal if he would repeat his experience in journalism, Mr. Nakdimen responded: `I think so. I really enjoyed it. It was a lot of hard work, but it was a lot of fun, too.' Dave's colleagues also remember him fondly. Kathy Beck, the news director at WAVE-TV, said Dave is `a man of great integrity' throughout the news world. 
All those who know Dave know that he gives his endeavors his all. He is a deacon at his church, and he shows intense faithfulness in supporting his beloved University of Kentucky Wildcat basketball team. Dave's retirement means he will be able to do more of the things he loves, including spending time with his wife, Wanda, and his daughter, Suzanne. 
Mr. President, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in paying tribute to the career of Dave Nakdimen. It surely has been a memorable one. 
Mr. President, in the world of television news it is extremely difficult to develop expertise in covering politics. Most of the political reporters that we deal with who are really talented in covering what the occupant of the Chair and myself do everyday tend to be in print journalism. 
There is one real exception to that: Dave Nakdimen. Dave was the only expert political reporter I ever met in local television. He had a distinguished career. We will all miss him greatly. He is a man of great principle, a personal friend. I remember meeting him when I was in my twenties sitting in the office of a local official in Jefferson County, that is, Louisville, KY. He was doing his job then. He is a superb individual, a fine man with deep religious convictions who will be missed in the reporting of political news in my hometown. 
Mr. President, I wish Dave Nakdimen well in his retirement years. 
I ask unanimous consent that an article from The Courier-Journal be printed in the Congressional Record.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to raise a matter that is of great concern to me and that is the inequitable repayment policy of the Appalachian Development Highway System [ADHD] Program. States like Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi, and New York, which have prefinanced Appalachian road projects, are reimbursed at a 70-percent Federal match, while States expending funds for new mileage receive an 80-percent match. 
Unfortunately, this error will cost Kentucky at least $7 million if it isn't corrected. Kentucky is one of five States to prefinance Appalachian development highway projects. According to the Appalachian Regional Commission, this error will cost those States up to $30 million. 
It is my understanding that this inequity is due to clerical error that occurred during consideration of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1978. Language amending subsection (f) regarding regular highway funding was included, but subsection (h) on prefinancing was inadvertently left out. Both the Carter and Reagan administrations attempted to fix this inequity, but not of the efforts have succeeded. 
I have requested the assistance of both the bill managers in correcting the problem. I have also sought the advice of Senator John Warner, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation, which has the responsibility of authorizing this program. I appreciate their willingness to assist me in finding a solution to this problem. 
Mr. President, I would like to ask the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Shelby his views on this matter.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Byrd/Hagel resolution. This legislation expresses the sense of the Senate regarding the conditions for the United States to become a signatory to any international agreement on global climate change. Consideration of this legislation is critical to shaping the upcoming debate on global climate issues and amending the Framework Convention on Global Climate Change. An upcoming meeting in Kyoto, Japan, has the potential to cripple our economic potential, while allowing the emissions from less developed nations to grow unchecked. 
The Rio Treaty signed by President Bush called for industrialized nations to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels or lower by the year 2000. All but two countries will miss the goals, including the United States which missed the mark by 10 percent. The administration blamed this on low fuel prices and a strong economy. Mr. President, this is not a liability or something the United States should apologize for. 
Nonetheless, in an effort to reverse this success, the Clinton administration signed on to the Berlin mandate in 1995. This is an agreement of industrialized nations to further reduce emissions after 2000. Unfortunately, this agreement exempts 130 developing countries from reductions or commitments in greenhouse gases. This enormous loophole will guarantee the failure of this agreement. In 1996, the administration decided that it would use the Berlin mandate to create a new treaty with legally binding mandates on emission levels. 
Mr. President, I am very concerned with the administration's intention to sign an agreement that commits the United States to legally-binding emissions levels that will not achieve significant environmental gains. The fatal flaw of this agreement is that it exempts developing nations, including China which is estimated to exceed the United States in greenhouse gas emissions by 2015. By 2010, the share of U.S. global emissions will fall from 20 percent to just 10 percent as developing nations continue to grow in population and industrial capability. By the year 2100, developing nations are estimated to produce three-quarters of the total greenhouse gases. 
In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on July 21, Under Secretary Tim Wirth argued this agreement was like a row boat and the United States should `pull a heavier oar at the beginning; over time, we must all pull together.' 
Mr. President, anybody who has ever operated a rowboat knows that when you pull harder on one oar you end up going in circles. And that is precisely what this agreement will do. It won't achieve any net environmental gains and worse, will succeed in sending our economy into a tailspin. 
Left unchanged, this agreement will provide a significant advantage to our competitors. In order to achieve lower emission levels, new energy costs and other costly regulatory burdens required to reduce energy use reduce our competitive advantage in all industries. It is likely to force our most energy-intensive industries like steel, aluminum, chemicals, refining, and paper production to move overseas. Mr. President, this is unacceptable. 
Study after study has demonstrated that this agreement would cripple our economy. A DRI/McGraw Hill study shows our Nation's GDP would be reduced annually by 2 to 3 percent. According to the AFL-CIO, between 1.25 million and 1.5 million U.S. jobs would be lost. These jobs would reemerge in other countries where, as a result of the flawed agreement, emission levels and high energy taxes are not a concern. On top of this consumer costs would rise by $50 to $100 billion annually. Higher energy prices would mean increased costs on all goods including groceries, electricity, and gasoline. 
Mr. President, I represent a State that this treaty puts right in the cross hairs. There are 25,000 people whose jobs are tied directly to the coal industry. Higher energy taxes, like the Btu tax proposed by this administration, hits coal harder than any other energy source. Thousands of well-paying jobs would be lost in my State as this administration seeks to eliminate coal as our primary energy source, while giving developing nations an unfair advantage. 
It is important to keep in mind that coal provides over 50 percent of our power needs nationwide. This is the low cost fuel source that helps maintain this Nation's competitive edge and reduces increased dependency on foreign oil. 
Not only would the Kentucky mining industry be devastated, but industries across my State would feel the impact of higher energy prices. As I noted earlier, industries like chemical, steel, paper, and aluminum would be greatly impacted. Three of our leading manufacturers General Electric, Ford and Toyota use significant amounts of energy. The 30,000 jobs at these facilities would all be threatened by our foreign competitors. 
The Byrd/Hagel resolution addresses the unfairness in the agreement being considered by the administration. This resolution mandates specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emission for developing nations, with the same compliance period. 
If every nation doesn't agree to the same emission levels and timetables, what incentive will they have to negotiate in the future when they have an overwhelming competitive advantage? It is important that we not bargain away the economic advantages we have worked so hard to achieve. 
Passage of this resolution will send a clear message to the administration when they begin negotiations in Kyoto. I am hopeful this will prevent the administration from signing an unacceptable agreement that puts the burden of cleaning up the environment on American workers just to have these gains wiped out by developing nations. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in sending a strong message to the administration by voting for the Byrd/Hagel resolution. This is a vote for jobs and a vote for the environment.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, independence is the first step toward democracy--hardly the last. As our own nation's history records, 87 years after our revolution, President Lincoln stood at Gettysburg to remind a deeply wounded nation---- 
It is for us, the living to be dedicated . . . to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced . . . the great task remaining before us--that this nation, under God shall have a new birth both of freedom--and that government of the people, by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth. 
We all, at one point or another in our school careers, memorized that famous address. Eighty seven years after our Nation's birth--when we had a strong, well established representative government--Lincoln spoke of our unfinished work--because we saw our democracy, our Government and Nation divided and devastated by civil war--a war which serves as a caution that even healthy, strong democracies suffer attack and setbacks. 
One hundred years after President Lincoln reminded us of our unfinished work, President Reagan stood before the British Parliament in 1982 and predicted the certain end of communism. 
But, in forecasting communism's imminent demise, President Reagan called upon his country, our allies and our American political parties to `contribute as a nation to the global campaign for democracy gathering force.' 
This remarkable speech set in motion the people and events which established the National Endowment for Democracy. 
President Reagan's message was as simple and pure as it was powerful and enduring--the mission he defined was to create a world illuminated by individual liberty, representative government and the rule of law under God. 
Eighty-seven years after our revolution, we needed to recommit ourselves to that purpose at Gettysburg. President Reagan renewed the call and, now, we must rededicate and redouble our efforts to secure democracy around the globe. 
With the end of the cold war, this mission and our responsibilities have only just begun. It is not ending, it is the beginning. 
The National Endowment for Democracy--and especially its four core institutes--offer the best, most effective, and strongest tools we have available to consolidate the gains we have made in dismantling the structure of Communist and totalitarian governments. 
We need to remember that tearing down the weak practices and government architecture of communism is not the same thing as creating or sustaining strong, viable democratic principles, laws and institutions. 
Communism has indeed been cast on the ash heap of history. The question remains what will take its place. 
Virtually every nation which suffered behind the Iron Curtain has enjoyed some form of free and fair elections--but the first election is not as important as the second then third when there is a real test of democratic principle and practice--when those who have enjoyed elected office must relinquish power if the principle of self determination is to survive. In other words, only after an orderly transition of power from election to election occurs can democracy truly take root. 
The key to self-determination--the core of democracy--is the active engagement of citizens in their government. NED and its institutes, in turn are the key to building and encouraging this deep, informed involvement. 
These organizations carry out this important work in a number of ways. 
In Burma, NED funding is keeping the faint but fervent hopes for freedom and democracy alive. Let me explain why their work is so vital. 
Burma and North Korea have a lot in common with the Stalinist era in the Soviet Union. A ruthless 400,000 man military force, led by the State Law and Order Restoration Council--SLORC--have systematically destroyed the education system and detained, tortured, and executed anyone opposing their brutal rule. 
NED is a lifeline for the courageous opponents who resist SLORC inside Burma and the large, exiled community who struggle every day to restore the results of the 1990 elections and their leader Aung San Suu Kyi to office. 
With less than $200,000 NED has kept alive the only uncensored, independent newspaper circulated inside Burma. The New Era, a monthly newspaper, is vital to the effort to raise awareness of SLORC's violations of human rights and civil liberties, to assure independent reporting of events and to provide counterbalance to SLORC's daily campaign to smear and slander Aung San Suu Kyi. 
Let me point out that it's a crime in Burma to have a copy of this newspaper, yet in spite of threats of imprisonment and death, an extraordinary network of students and citizens take this risk to assure monthly delivery and circulation of the New Era. 
The NED also supports the Democratic Voice of Burma which produces and transmits a daily morning and evening broadcast of news, features and ethnic language programming as well as broadcasting recordings of Aung San Suu Kyi's speeches, the texts of U.N. decisions and other information of intense interest to Burma's citizens. 
Beyond sustaining the independent media, NED supports efforts to strengthen cooperation among the more than 15 ethnic groups which work in peaceful opposition to the military junta. This support has enabled the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma under the direction of elected Prime Minister Dr. Sein Win to continue to represent to the outside world the views and aspirations of the legitimately elected parliamentarians of Burma. 
Although they are victims of one of the world's most repressive regimes, Dr. Sein Win works with his colleagues inside and outside Burma, calling for peaceful dialog to restore democracy to his beleaguered nation. 
Burma is just one example of the Endowment's exceptional service to the cause of democracy. 
I have also observed the crucial role they have played in the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union. 
Each of these countries illustrate my earlier point that while trappings of communism have been dismantled, it is far too early to judge the transition to democracy a complete success. 
Communities across the region desperately need precisely the kind of training and support available through NED. One of the most compelling reasons why NED is so vital is illustrated by the work done through their core grantee in Russia. 
Although we are all concerned about the reactionary elements which continue to dominate the Russian Parliament, there is some reason to be hopeful. During the last election, in every community and town where the International Republican Institute ran training programs and supported efforts to strengthen local political parties, reformers were elected to office--reformers who shared our interests in free market economies and individual liberties. 
Obviously, reformers do not control a majority yet, but IRI's impressive record suggests we should be substantially expanding our support for endowment activities to secure the kinds of governments and societies which share our interests. 
The cold war may be over, but repression and authoritarian impulses are alive and well. 
NED nourishes the ambitions of all those who want to participate and shape their own great experiment in democracy--Muslim women in the Middle East, journalists under fire in Cambodia, trade unions in Belarus, political scientists in Azerbaijan, legal defense funds in Latin America--all benefit from NED's small grants--all contribute to building the foundation which sustains a healthy democracy. 
The National Endowment for Democracy and its core grantees work citizen by citizen and community by community to transform individual aspirations of self-determination into the governing nations which Ronald Reagan defined so well--nations which preserve and protect individual liberty, representative government and the rule of law under God. 
NED deserves our support. It does a good job and it does it in service to our national interests. Each democracy which grows is one more trading partner, one less crisis which may require our political or military intervention. 
We abandon this extraordinary campaign for democracy gathering force at our own peril.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me just say very briefly--we are anxious to hear from Senator McCain, and move on to a vote--the capital investment account referred to by the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member will still be $105 million after the Lugar amendment is approved. That would exceed the President's request by $10 million and exceed the 1997 level of last year's bill by $80 million. 
The distinguished chairman of the subcommittee certainly raises a valid point with regard to the infrastructure at the State Department. But it will be substantially increased for all the purposes he alluded to even after the amendment restoring the National Endowment for Democracy is hopefully approved. 
Just one other point, Mr. President. I just want to mention a letter that was sent to the chairman and the ranking member in support of the National Endowment funding at $30 million signed by, in addition to Senator Lugar and myself, Senator Graham, Senator Mikulski, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Mack, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Cochran, Senator Lieberman, Senator Hatch, Senator Bob Kerrey, Senator Inhofe, Senator Dodd, Senator Abraham, Senator Kennedy, Senator Murkowski, Senators Leahy, Roth, Kerry of Massachusetts, Robb, Levin, Breaux, Kyl, DeWine, Coverdell, Jeffords, Moynihan, Reed, Hagel, Torricelli, Thomas, Reid, Rockefeller, Frist, and of course the distinguished Senator from Arizona, who is about to speak who has been an enthusiastic supporter of this program over the years.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I congratulate my friend and colleague from Kentucky, Senator Ford, for his statement on behalf of the tobacco growers of our State. 
Mr. President, the Durbin amendment is not directed at the tobacco companies; it's directed at the tobacco farmer. We don't have many big farmers in my State. We have about 60,000 tobacco growers in 119 of our 120 counties. They are everywhere. And the average base in Kentucky, Mr. President, is about an acre. 
The profile of a typical tobacco farm family in Kentucky: 
The husband probably works in the factory, the wife probably works in a cut-and-sew plant. They tend to their 1 acre of burley tobacco, and they sell it in the November and December auction, which provides for Christmas money and, for a lot of families, a lot more than Christmas money--Christmas plus a lot of other things they need for their families during the course of the year. 
Now, the Durbin amendment seeks to drive these tobacco farmers out of business, as if somehow, if you drove the tobacco farmers out of business, there would not be any more tobacco grown. Of course, it would be grown. It would just be grown by others. It would be grown in big corporate farms of hundreds of thousands of acres under contract with the companies. 
So bear in mind, my colleagues, you do nothing to terminate the growth of tobacco by driving the little tobacco grower out of business. It serves no useful purpose. Tobacco is going to be grown. It is going to be grown in this country, overseas, and already is grown in virtually a great many countries in the world. It is going to be grown, and nobody is proposing to make it illegal. The only issue before us, Mr. President, is who grows it? Who grows it? The tobacco program, which the tobacco growers themselves and the companies pay for at no net cost to the Government, guarantees that the production is in a whole lot of hands. In the case of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, it is in over 60,000 hands. 
Senator Durbin's amendment prohibits tobacco farmers from obtaining Federal crop insurance, as well as disaster payments. That is clearly directed at the farmer, the grower, not at the companies. The companies are going to get their tobacco, Mr. President. They are either going to get it from large corporate farmers under contract, or they will get it overseas. But they will get their tobacco, even if the 1-acre burley grower in Kentucky that Senator Ford and I represent is out of business and a whole lot poorer. 
Currently, 1,500 crops are eligible for disaster payments under the noninsured assistance program. These are crops that are already eligible for traditional crop insurance. Therefore, if Senator Durbin's amendment passed, in a natural disaster most small tobacco farmers would simply not be able to recover their losses, putting them out of business. That is why I say--and as Senator Ford has said--this is an amendment directed at the farmer and not at the companies. 
We have been plagued in Kentucky this year by natural disasters, as many other areas have as well, and with every other unpredictable element that farmers have to deal with--disease, labor, incredibly high expenses. Imagine that we would take away their only meager defense against Mother Nature just because they farm a legal commodity. It is simply unfair. 
The amendment of the Senator from Illinois prevents many small- and medium-sized farmers from receiving protection against what could be catastrophic risks. Farmers may invest up to $2,800 per acre growing tobacco. Many of them do. A natural disaster--a loss of this magnitude--simply could not be overcome. So we are talking here about farmers who depend on their income from this crop. 
Additionally, it is important to note that banks and lending institutions will find it difficult to approve loans for farmers who cannot obtain crop insurance. So we come down to the real issue here. 
Senator Durbin's amendment unfairly singles out tobacco farmers and tobacco-farming communities who grow a legal crop simply to try to get at the tobacco companies. Eliminating crop insurance for tobacco farmers does nothing to stop growing of tobacco or punish cigarette companies. The only individuals injured are those who can least afford it, those closest to the poverty level, and those most likely to be unable to find or afford alternative private insurance. 
There is a lot of discussion about alternative private insurance. I don't think my typical grower with a 2,500-pound base is going to be able to afford to do that and still purchase that, and still grow the crop profitably. This amendment is not going to stop people from smoking. It will only hurt U.S. tobacco growers for whom tobacco pays the bills--not the big companies. 
Tobacco farming, as we all know, is the starting point of over $15 billion that goes to Federal, State, and local governments in tax revenue, and contributes an additional $6 billion to the U.S. balance of trade. That is a $6 billion positive balance of trade. 
By ignoring the need for disaster relief for the tobacco farmers, the precedent is being set for the elimination of crop insurance for other major commodities. 
In 1994, we passed a law to end ad hoc disaster programs and have crop insurance be the primary risk management tool for farmers. 
By ignoring the need for disaster relief for just one set of farmers--tobacco farmers who suffer natural disasters in the same manner that corn, wheat, soybean, and other farmers do--a precedent is being set to eliminate crop insurance for other commodities. 
Mr. President, as Senator Ford has pointed out, Secretary Glickman is opposed to this amendment. The Farm Credit Council is opposed to this amendment. And the American Association of Crop Insurers is opposed as well. 
Crop insurance is to protect families. That is what crop insurance is about: Helping to minimize the financial interruptions to their plans and lifestyles due to crop losses. 
These are families who usually work two jobs, as I suggested earlier. In my State, these are not rich farmers. We are talking about people who cultivate about an acre of tobacco on the side, in addition to their normal sources of income. These farmers aren't in a business where they have excess amounts of money in savings. Everything is calculated, and income from tobacco is relied upon. By having crop insurance, it gives farmers, bankers, and communities peace of mind through income stability and minimizing risk. 
Crop insurance also provides farm lenders with collateral that helps minimize liens on other assets, obviously avoiding or reducing a farmer's needs to rely on credit. 
As I believe my colleague from Kentucky pointed out, Secretary Glickman said:  
I am determined that everyone will have access to crop insurance, large farmers and small farmers alike, especially those with limited resources--minorities and producers--in all areas of the country. 
That certainly describes the 60,000 tobacco growers of Kentucky. 
This amendment would have a particularly detrimental effect on thousands of small farmers in States like my own. An overwhelming majority of crop insurance policies in this area are sold to small farmers. Therefore, eliminating crop insurance for tobacco will not fulfill the Secretary's promise to poorer farmers. Rather, this amendment is squarely in opposition to the Department's stated policy of fighting discrimination against minorities and economically disadvantaged farmers. 
Let me sum it up again. This amendment is directed at the farmer who is growing a legal crop. To the extent that this small farmer finds it difficult to acquire crop insurance, the potential for disaster for these small farm families is greatly enhanced. 
The Durbin amendment does nothing to fight smoking. It does nothing to punish the companies. In fact, it is directed at the heart of the farming areas in the southeastern part of the United States. 
I repeat: The average grower in Kentucky has about 2,500 pounds. That is about 1 acre. You push that fellow out of business, and tobacco will still be grown. It is going to be grown by big corporate farms. They are not going to be particularly concerned about this crop insurance issue. They do not have any trouble paying for it. 
This amendment serves no useful purpose. If you want to fight smoking, this amendment is only directed at low- and medium-income farmers in places like the Commonwealth of Kentucky. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have never professed to be clairvoyant, but I was able to predict 8 months ago and subsequently authored an op-ed piece to this effect: that obfuscation and diversion would be the damage control strategy of the Clinton White House and its allies in Congress. They would be engaged in that kind of activity, Mr. President, in seeking to avoid the fallout from the Clinton campaign-DNC fundraising malfeasance in the last election. 
This damage control strategy was to be expected from this White House, as wave upon wave of scandal has lapped up on the White House lawn these past 4 years. President Clinton's aides have become highly skilled at putting out press fires, lest, of course, the President be singed. I had hoped for better from Democrats here in the Congress embarrassed--I should hope mortified--by the evidence and admission of illegal conduct by the Clinton campaign-DNC fundraisers. 
I thought my Democratic colleagues would step up to the plate, seek the truth and let the chips fall where they may. 
A disappointing spectacle it has been to witness this collusion in a disingenuous effort to blur the truth, smear the innocent and protect the guilty, by saying everyone does it, and even trying to drag innocent private citizens before the committee. 
We are all victims of the system, they say. What we need, they say, is campaign finance reform. Well, in fact, Mr. President, what we need is an independent counsel. That has been clear for a number of months--an independent counsel to remove the investigation from an obviously politicized Justice Department. 
Bearing in mind the Attorney General's indefensible refusal to appoint an independent counsel, and the Justice Department's outrageous conduct in the past few weeks in which it has injected itself into partisan maneuvering regarding the granting of immunity for low-level but key witnesses, the inexplicable and entirely inappropriate action by a Justice Department political appointee to distance the administration from United States intelligence agency findings that the Chinese Government plotted to influence United States elections, Mr. President, there is simply no other recourse to ascertain the truth in a nonpartisan manner but to appoint an independent counsel. 
That is why this law was passed some 25 years ago, for precisely these kinds of situations, in which you had a highly political investigation affecting covered employees--for example, the President or the Vice President--where it could be suspected that the Attorney General would be reluctant to pursue alleged claims of wrongdoing. 
This episode over the last few months is precisely the fact situation which brought about and argued for the passage of the independent counsel statute. 
Now, Mr. President, the truth is going to come out sooner or later. No one here should want to be seen in a position of trying to keep the truth from coming to the public. So the point I would like to make this morning very briefly once again, the Attorney General would appoint an independent counsel to investigate the fundraising abuses of the 1996 election, the violations of existing law that may have occurred--contributions from foreigners, money laundering, raising money on Federal property, all violations of existing law. The Attorney General of the United States is responsible for enforcing existing law, and in situations such as this when a clear conflict of interest is apparent, there is no other logical recourse other than the appointment of an independent counsel. 
I call upon the Attorney General one more time, Mr. President, to appoint an independent counsel to complete this investigation.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the military construction appropriation bill before us today. Senator Burns and Senator Murray are to be congratulated on crafting a measure that adequately meets our military needs while at the same time addressing the pressing concerns of our soldiers. 
Mr. President, at a time when our services are having difficulty meeting their recruiting goals and retention is suffering, it is more important than ever that the military address quality of life issues. Unfortunately, the administration has chosen to ignore the reality and not budget the appropriate resources for this goal. 
The budget for all military construction contained in the Senate bill totals just over $9 billion, almost $800,000 above what the administration requested. As anyone who has visited some of our installations can tell you, this money is desperately needed. 
I salute the work of Senators Burns and Murray as well as their staffs. Their ability to prioritize within the declining budget is crucial to improving the everyday lives of our soldiers and their families. Mr. President, if we are going to continue to ask more from our military around the world, the very least we can do is to provide them with adequate housing and facilities. In addition, it should be pointed out that the committee worked with both the House and Senate authorizing committees and did not appropriate funds for any project that was not authorized. 
I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this excellent bill.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with regard to the amendment of my good friend from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson, I, along with a number of other Senators, were in Hong Kong 10 days ago to watch the turnover of Hong Kong to the Chinese. I mention Hong Kong because Hong Kong is really the best indicator of what China is likely to become in the coming years. 
Some people suggest that the People's Republic of China will ruin Hong Kong. Others suggest that Hong Kong will be the engine that changes China. I think clearly the latter is most likely to be the case. Even though the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas deals with MFN for China and not MFN for Hong Kong, I think it is worthy of note that no one in Hong Kong, no one, not the democracy activists, the businessmen, no one, you can't find anybody in Hong Kong who thinks terminating MFN for China is a good idea. 
I cite, for example, Martin Lee, the person who most of us are familiar with who is the prodemocracy activist in Hong Kong and the one the Chinese tend to fear the most and the one who says the greatest number of things that tend to irritate the regime in Beijing. Martin Lee is not in favor of terminating 
MFN for China, because he believes that the economic engine that is roaring in mainland China is pulling it inevitably in the direction of democracy and human rights. 
So, Mr. President, I hope that the Hutchinson amendment will not be approved. I think it sends the wrong signal. 
Having said that, let me say that nobody that I know is entirely happy with the internal government in the People's Republic of China. I might say the same thing about some of the countries that are still receiving foreign assistance from us. We are not entirely happy with what is going on in Russia these days. I, for one, am not happy with a number of things that have happened in Egypt recently, and these are countries that are foreign aid recipients of the United States. 
We are not talking about foreign aid for China; we are talking about MFN for China. It seems to me it makes no sense, in terms of our growing relationship with China, to send this kind of message by terminating the trade status which benefits American business and benefits reformers in China who, in my judgment, will ultimately bring about the kind of changes in China that we would all like to see. 
Mr. President, how much time remains? We are set for three votes at 10 o'clock, are we not?

<TEXT>
Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Nebraska for his comments about OPIC. With all due respect to our colleague from Colorado, I, too, oppose the amendment. OPIC does not cost a single taxpayer dollar. OPIC is required by law to operate on a self-sustaining basis. Since 1971, it has reimbursed the U.S. Government for every dollar it has received and has reported positive net income every year since its inception. As the Senator from Nebraska pointed out, last year it returned $209 million to the Treasury. OPIC creates American jobs and exports. All major U.S. economic competitors have similar export promotion agencies. Scuttling OPIC would put our companies at an even further disadvantage than they already are. 
Today, for example, at least 36 percent of Japan's exports enjoy Government subsidies compared with just 2 percent of American exports. In addition, Japan and France provide 77 percent of the total amount of export subsidies made available around the world. 
As Senator Hagel pointed out, that is what American businesses typically are up against in the international market. OPIC is not corporate welfare. OPIC charges market and risk-based interest rates and fees for all of its services, and all loans must be paid in full. All clients must pass industry standard and OPIC policy reviews. This is an agency that has functioned very well in behalf of American interests and is actually returning money to the American Treasury. OPIC strongly supports small business, which is the heart of America's economic engine. The source of 6 out of every 10 jobs in this country is directly attributable to small business. 
We have had this amendment every year and so far have been able to defeat it. I certainly hope we will be able to again, because OPIC is an important part of what makes American business competitive overseas. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say in response to the amendment of my colleague from Arkansas, I and a number of other Members of the Senate were in Hong Kong a couple of weeks ago. I raise Hong Kong--even though I know the sense-of-the-Senate amendment deals with China--I raise Hong Kong because I think Hong Kong is the best hope for China. Hong Kong is going to lead the way to a new China, and a new China is already developing, which is not to say that any of us are entirely happy about everything going on in the People's Republic of China, but a lot of good things are happening, particularly on the economic side. No one in Hong Kong, not even Martin Lee and all of the democratic reformers that many of us know, is in favor of terminating MFN for China. You cannot find anybody in Hong Kong who thinks terminating MFN for China is a way to promote a better, more democratic, more open China. 
So with all due respect to my friend and colleague from Arkansas, I think we have worked our way through this MFN debate. The President of the United States, as we all know, in 1992, when he ran, thought that MFN for China ought to be linked to human rights and democracy evolving in China, and as soon as the election was over, he took a closer look at it and he changed his mind. I must say I give him credit for changing his mind because I don't think this will bring about the kind of positive reform in terms of human rights and democracy in China that we would all hope. 
What is changing China--unquestionably what is changing China--is economic reform. So I hope we will not support the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas. I think it would be a step in the wrong direction. I know there are other colleagues who share my view. 
I see Senator Feinstein on her feet now. I yield the floor.

So we are almost through. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I now be recognized for up to 8 minutes for an explanation of the amendment on Cambodia, which is at the desk, and further, following that debate, the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the McConnell amendment No. 886, the one I will describe shortly, to be immediately followed by a vote on or in relation to the McConnell amendment No. 887, also about Cambodia, which I anticipate will be voice-voted, to be immediately followed by a vote on or in relation to the Allard amendment No. 891, to be immediately followed by a vote on or in relation to the Dodd amendment No. 901. I further ask consent that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to the remaining votes in the sequence. I finally ask unanimous consent that all votes in the sequence following the first vote be limited to 10 minutes in length.

Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I might say that, other than the Hutchinson amendment, I am not aware of any other votes that we will need before going to final passage. 
When the subcommittee marked up this bill, the situation in Cambodia was grim. The Far Eastern Economic had labeled Phnom Penh, the Medellin on the Mekong. In a shocking series of stories, the Review described a nation's slide into corruption and the close collaboration between senior Cambodian officials and drug smugglers. Making matters worse, a senior officer said, `Cambodia is now like Noriega in Panama. Nobody dares to speak out because they will be killed.' 
Journalists who have called attention to the corruption and smuggling have been fined, jailed, and assassinated. Days after running a story detailing the criminal kingdom built up by a close associate of Hun Sen, the newspaper's editor was gunned down midday in downtown Phnom Penh. 
However, this is not a situation which has just unraveled over the past month. This is a story which has unfolded over the past 2 years and unfortunately, U.S. Government officials and policy appear to have aided and abetted this sorry turn of events. 
As the committee report notes, the evidence of corruption and political violence is not new. Democracy has been under attack for the past 2 years. 
In testimony before the House International Relations Committee, the president of the International Republican Institute pointed out in 1995, tiring of his attacks on their corruption, Government officials engineered the ouster from the party and Parliament of Sam Rainsy. The testimony then went on to say the following: 
Building on their success in removing one vocal critic, the government has targeted up to six other parliamentary members for expulsion . . . the number of newspapers is declining by the month. Journalists are regularly harassed and beaten and several have been killed . . . The government has been largely successful in silencing all internal opposition and criticism. 
Unfortunately, for the past 2 years as the problems mounted, the administration failed to use our assistance programs, strong ties, and close relationships to leverage reforms crucial to the country's survival. 
A few short months ago, in testimony before the subcommittee, AID's administration compared Mongolia and Cambodia, citing both as democratic success stories. At the same time, the lives of opposition candidates were being threatened, Hen Sen was actively thwarting all efforts to appoint independent judges or create a commission to establish the framework for the planned 1998 elections. 
When weeks of Mr. Atwood's testimony, 16 people were killed and another 120 wounded in a grenade attack on a public rally against corruption. Human rights organizations claimed this was a clear attempt to assassinate one of the Government's most vocal critics, Sam Rainsy. 
As the political violence escalated, the administration continued to endorse Cambodia as a responsible candidate to join ASEAN. Evidence that narcotics traffickers were subsidizing the leadership was dismissed. In May, in the face of overwhelming evidence that drug related corruption tainted the most senior leaders in government, Secretary Albright testified before the subcommittee, that `we are very careful in the way we do the certification' and expressed confidence that Cambodia deserved to be recognized as fully cooperating in our international counternarcotics efforts. 
During his visit here this spring, Sam Rainsy, the critic who has been targeted by Hen Sen's henchmen, pleaded with the State Department to change course and move quickly to condition aid to his country--to take every step necessary to force Prince Ranariddh and Hen Sen back to the negotiation table--to make every effort to salvage what was left of his country's hope for democracy. He called attention to the increasingly public efforts both leaders were making to arm private militias--a sign, he warned of the civil conflict to come. 
While the administration continued to talk of Cambodia's success, the committee listened to the Cambodians and international observers who urged action to stop the slide toward war. In response to the deteriorating situation, we reported out a bill which required the Secretary to certify that four conditions had been met prior to the release of any additional assistance. Specifically, she had to determine that the Government had taken steps to: First, end political violence and intimidation of opposition parties and members; second, establish an independent election commission; third, protect the rights of voters, candidates and election observers and participants by establishing laws which guaranteed freedom of speech and assembly; and fourth, eliminate all official corruption and collaboration with narcotics smugglers. 
We had hoped that the Secretary would deliver a similar tough 
message during a planned June trip to Phnom Penh. Many of us held out the slim hope that she would be take on the important challenge of getting the two leaders to the table to work toward reconciliation and free and fair 1998 elections. I believe her planned visit represented the last window of opportunity to effect any change. Unfortunately, there were sufficient uncertainties about the outcome that prompted her advisors to recommend the visit be canceled--and with that, the window of opportunity slammed shut. 
The rest, as they say, is history. 
Since the coup, it is clear, the administration continues to be reluctant to challenge or confront Hun Sen. I think this is a serious mistake. It not only causes friends and allies to doubt our commitment to democracy, we risk further instability in a vital part of he world. If an interest in South East Asian stability does not persuade my colleagues of the merits of engagement, they might consider the need to see some good come out of the substantial bilateral and multilateral commitment we have supported which now exceeds $4 billion. 
To address the changes which have occurred since the bill was reported from committee, I would now like to offer two amendments which modifies the two Cambodia-related sections in the bill. They are virtually identical but affect two different spending accounts. In each, I have added a new condition which prohibits aid to Cambodia unless there is a certification that the Government has not been installed by the use of force or a coup. 
I understand that some of my colleagues believe there should be language linking aid to the restoration of a democratically elected government. In theory, I agree. However, given the fact that Hun Sen actually participated in the election, I believe the administration would continue on the wrong policy track and take advantage of such a provision and simply certify that an elected official was serving in office. 
Prince Ranariddh must be restored to office and his party must be given the opportunity to actively and freely engage in the political process. But that will not happen unless the Administration takes the first basic step and acknowledges that he has been the victim of a bold, ruthless military coup. These amendments compel the administration to make that decision. 
To address the changes which have occurred since the bill was reported, I have an amendment at the desk which adds a new condition banning aid until the Secretary certifies the government was not installed by force or coup.

<TEXT>
Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring the fiscal year 1998 foreign operations, export promotion, and related programs appropriations bill to the Senate for consideration today. I might say at the outset that we anticipate finishing this bill tonight. There are very few amendments of which I am aware and, hopefully, we can mirror the speed with which the Department of Defense appropriations bill and the energy and water appropriations bill were completed. 
Senator Leahy and I have worked closely together to produce a bill which effectively serves vital international U.S. political and economic priorities with the $13 billion allocated to our subcommittee. 
Let me point out right up front that while the bill stands at $13 billion, we are funding $13.2 billion on programs; the difference is due to the Budget Committee's treatment of arrears at international financial institutions. 
For the first time in more than a decade, the foreign operations account actually experienced an increase. We can thank Senator Stevens for understanding how important it is to have international options short of sending in U.S. troops. I might just say, Mr. President, on that point, there are a number of our colleagues who are particularly enthusiastic about the defense option, and I am among them. On the other hand, being able to engage overseas without the use of troops is frequently, always, less dangerous and, many times, less expensive. 
For the better part of the last 3 years, Senator Leahy and I have warned that the United States would pay long-term consequences if we continued the pattern of shortsighted gains made by reducing foreign assistance. 
Finally, the administration listened. I want to commend Secretary Albright for making an increase in the 150 account her first and foremost priority. The nearly $1 billion increase arrested a devastating decade-long decline. 
I think it is important to put this increase in perspective. Measured against foreign aid's peak year of 1985, our resources have dropped nearly 60 percent. Since 1990, we have seen a 40-percent reduction. Keep in mind that those cuts have occurred in times when the United States established assistance programs to help strengthen and stabilize more than two dozen new, emerging democracies. 
As we welcome Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into NATO, thereby expanding European stability and security arrangements, we should all remember it was the United States economic and security assistance that helped make this possible. 
Just taking a look, Mr. President, at the chart here behind me, my colleagues will notice that in 1985, in billions, the foreign operations account was $28.2 billion. A mere 12 years later, it was $12.2. And what we are seeing this year, after a decline of $28.2 to $12 billion, is an increase back up to $13.4 billion. 
I will argue, as I did a few moments ago, that given the new responsibilities to the new emerging democracies, that this increase this year in the 150 account is entirely appropriate. 
The aspirations, ingenuity, and determination of the citizens of these countries--particularly in Central Europe--combined with American grants, loans, exchanges, training, and equipment to build democratic institutions, strong free markets, and responsible military partners makes a lot of sense. 
Obviously, this effort should be continued. The combination of an increase in the foreign assistance allocation, along with progress made by emerging European democracies, have made this a key transition year--one in which we have an opportunity to initiate support for new priorities while ending or establishing clear performance benchmarks in countries where U.S. support is not fulfilling political or economic expectations. 
In this context, let me review some of the bill's highlights. 
In title I, we have increased export promotion support over the administration's request. We have fully funded the Trade and Development Agency and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and to compensate for dismal forecasting at the Eximbank, we have increased the funding there as well. 
No one is more pleased than I am that there is a new team directing the Bank's important work. However, the new Chairman arrives in with the news that the Bank expects to have to carry over into 1998 nearly $400 million in planned or possible 1997 projects because of a shortfall in available funding. At a time when everyone recognizes that exports are key to American economic growth, we need to support Exim's vital mission. While the administration asked for $632 million, we have provided $700 million to support American business as they venture into tough emerging markets. 
Title II provides funding for all bilateral programs, including development assistance activities, programs in the new independent states and Central and Eastern Europe, disaster aid, the Peace Corps, international narcotics control, and a consolidated fund which covers nonproliferation, demining, antiterrorism, IAEA activities, and related programs. 
Within this title, there are a number of provisions which reflect the committee's new emphasis of building on success and objectively recognizing and reversing failures. 
Nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East. I will not spend a great deal of time at this point on the issue of Egypt's record over the last 2 years. Let me simply say that funding for both Egypt and Israel has always been provided in the context of the Camp David accords and a national commitment to serving the interests of peace. 
Leading a renewal of the Arab economic boycott of Israel, rejecting President Clinton's plea to participate in the peace summit, and actively opposing the Hebron agreement between Israel and the Palestinians are a few reasons why Egypt no longer seems to share our commitment to regional stability and peace. To send a signal that improvements are expected if aid is to continue to flow, the committee did not earmark funds for Egypt. 
In contrast, King Hussein has taken enormous risks to advance peace, and the committee reflected its support for this effort by substantially increasing economic and security assistance to Jordan. Egypt and Jordan define the basic tenet of this bill: Aid is not an entitlement program. It must be earned, and it must be deserved. 
The NIS offers other examples of this approach. For several years the Senate has earmarked funds for Ukraine. Now I believe it is time to assess results. Although Ukraine has made 
remarkable progress in passing a constitution and introducing a new currency, I think it is time to register our concerns that corruption and the slow pace of reforms may defeat the relevance and impact of our assistance. 
As in the past, we have earmarked $225 million, making clear we still believe in Ukraine's strategic importance and support the constitutional and economic changes which have been achieved. However, to leverage improvements and accelerate the pace of reforms, 35 percent of the aid package is withheld until the Secretary of State certificates progress has been made combating corruption, and moving forward with key economic and political policy changes. 
Russia offers another example of where aid must better serve United States interests. For the past 2 years, the bill has included language linking the provision of aid to the termination of Russia's nuclear cooperation with Iran--a provision always watered down by the administration. With elections around the corner, the administration's argument last year was simple: If we cut off aid, they said, we undermine the election chances of the only people who are committed to ending this lethal program. 
Well, we all know the reformers won the election last year, and, unfortunately, the nuclear program is still around. Only now it is expanded, and the Russians are not only collaborating with Iran on a nuclear powerplant. They are working together on a missile technology program. This year a waiver allowing aid to continue--no matter what the Russians do with Iran--is simply out of the question. 
Consistent with our effort to take aid off autopilot, the bill also includes language addressing the crisis in Cambodia. In our opening hearing this year, the administrator of AID referred to Cambodia as a democratic success story, a view echoed by the Secretary of State in our closing hearing. Persistent allegations of close collaboration between Cambodia's leadership and major regional drug traffickers were dismissed in that hearing, as were alarming accounts of the two prime ministers arming themselves for a resumption of civil war. 
As we all know, a few short weeks ago the committee report called attention to this rapidly deteriorating situation and conditioned assistance of all further aid on progress in four key areas. The Secretary had to certify the government had taken steps to: First, end political violence and intimidation of opposition candidates; second, establish an independent election commission; third, protect voters and election participants by establishing laws and regulations guaranteeing freedom of speech and assembly; and, fourth, eliminate corruption and collaboration with narcotics dealers. 
Mr. President, however elusive that goal now seems, each of these steps remains important to the future of democracy in Cambodia. With the coup engineered by Hun Sen last week, I intend to further modify these conditions as we proceed forward with this bill today. 
Turning to title III, the committee has provided over $3.3 billion in security assistance, loans and grants and support for international peacekeeping. While this level reflects a slight reduction of the administration's request, we were able to provide an increase in aid to Jordan and an increase in support for Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia. 
Let me speak for a moment to the case of the Baltic countries. I know I am joined by many of my colleagues who believe the Baltic nations should be the next nations on the list of NATO entrants. Having never recognized their domination by the Soviet Union during the cold war, I think it is a serious mistake for the administration to now bow to Russian demands that the Baltic nations be excluded from NATO. In effect, the administration's policy relegates the Baltic States to the Russian sphere of influence, a perverse reversal of political fortune and a mistake of historic proportions. 
These nations are ready, willing, and able to make a meaningful military and political contribution to NATO's mission. The funding we have provided will strengthen and deepen the Baltic ties to NATO by facilitating the completion of a civilian military regional airspace control system, an important step toward membership. This funding reflects a strong view that Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia deserve to be integrated into a stable European security structure and have earned our political commitment and continued support for NATO admission. 
Finally, let me turn to title IV in the bill, which provides funding for the international financial institutions. Although we have reduced the administration's request, we have been able to meet virtually all current-year obligations as well as make substantial progress on past obligations incurred by this administration. 
I want all of my colleagues to know that we have once again withheld funds for IDA until the Secretary of the Treasury certificates that the interim trust fund has removed all procurement restrictions imposed which exclude American contractors. 
I want the members of both the trust fund and IDA to be on notice that these restrictions must be gone before this legislation is enacted or I cannot support full funding for IDA in conference. 
The last section of the bill is devoted to general provisions. One in particular is worth noting because it is in keeping with the principles we have developed to end aid as an entitlement program. 
When the Dayton agreement was signed, each party pledged to support the International Tribunal's efforts to arrest and prosecute war criminals. Today, 66 indicted fugitives remain at large--with potentially many more under sealed indictment. 
These are not bandits in hiding living in fear of capture. These outlaws continue to work and wander the streets and, in some cases, such those of Radovan Karadic and Ratko Mladic, they continue to exercise real power. 
Section 573 ends assistance to regional authorities refusing to cooperate in the international effort to bring these fugitives to justice. Peace in Bosnia cannot be sustained if the Tribunal fails to complete its task. Stability and economic growth depend on the repatriation of refugees consistent with the Dayton agreement--and those refugees will not return to communities which continue to be terrorized and intimidated by war criminals. 
Section 573 bans aid to countries which have not cooperated in the arrest of war criminals. Waiver authority is granted to the President for a period of 6 months, if he certifies that a country has turned over a majority of war criminals. However, at the end of the 6 months, aid can only continue if the President certifies that all war criminals have been arrested. 
The provision exempts democracy building, demining and humanitarian programs in an effort to afford the administration some carrots as it attempts to encourage compliance. 
But, this should not be seen as a door which will be opened wider creating more exemptions and weaker standards. Let us be clear on a single point: after more than $400 million in U.S. aid, we need to implement and enforce the moral reckoning which only the Tribunal can offer. Only justice can bridge the deep divides which continue to fracture the former Yugoslavia. 
Let me conclude by once again emphasizing that the increase in the 150 account represents both an opportunity and an obligation to more effectively serve American international interests. We can only accomplish this purpose if we end aid as an entitlement program. I believe this bill sets us on the right course and I encourage my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished occupant of the Chair, the Senator from Oregon, for an excellent amendment. I was in the Senate when we started the Russian aid program. I would say to Senator Smith and Senator Hutchinson, who spoke so eloquently in behalf of this amendment, the whole Russian aid program was predicated on the notion that we were going to have a Russia based on the principles of democracy, free speech and freedom of religion--the fundamental underpinnings of our Western society, led by the United States many years ago when we were largely alone in establishing these principles; that the new Russia, at least in those very basic respects, was going to be not dissimilar to the United States on these fundamental freedoms. And, as an enthusiastic supporter of Russian assistance, both in the beginning and since, I can tell you that is not assistance without stipulation. It is not assistance no matter how you act. 
As I said in my opening statement, this foreign aid bill this year, if it stands for anything, it stands for the notion that foreign assistance is not an entitlement. It is not something you get automatically this year because you got it last year. Foreign assistance is designed to promote American interests abroad. Foreign assistance is the only way that the Government directly impacts overseas, other than sending in the troops, which is expensive and dangerous. But, with the less than 1 percent of our budget that we devote to this activity, we must use it in a way that promotes American values as well as American interests. 
So, the distinguished Senator from Oregon and Senator Hutchinson, who has spoken in his behalf in support of this amendment, have it exactly right. You have it exactly right. This is the sort of action that ought to jeopardize the Russian aid program. We ought not to be giving assistance to a country that, as a result of direct government initiative in what purports to be a democracy, is seeking to grant religious favoritism to certain kinds of religions at the expense of the others. 
So, I commend the Senator from Oregon, Senator Smith, for this outstanding amendment. I intend to support it. Again, I might say, we are hopeful that a vote on this amendment will occur around 12:30. That is not something I can announce yet, but we are hopeful it will occur around 12:30. 
I would say to my colleague from Oregon, does he wish additional time to discuss the amendment? 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I commend my friend and colleague from Washington, Senator Gorton, for this amendment. As the Senator knows from previous discussions, I share his view that if we were establishing the parade, the next countries at the front of the parade clearly ought to be the Baltic countries. As a matter of fact, as my friend from Washington knows, we included in the bill $20 million in grants and loans to the three Baltic countries, just as we provided financial assistance last year to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in order to help them upgrade their militaries in order to seek to achieve a level of acceptance for admission to NATO. 
So I think the amendment of the Senator from Washington, of which I am a cosponsor, is an excellent addition to this debate, and I completely share his views. The countries are most worthy for admission to NATO. We have recognized their independence throughout the cold war. They are doing an awful lot of things correctly. These countries are making enormous progress, and some have argued that they have done every bit as well as Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, if not even better. 
So I commend my friend from Washington for his amendment. I think it is an excellent amendment.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, one of the managers' amendments we will be voting on--actually approving on a voice vote at some point during the debate--relates to our friends in Egypt. I want to make a few observations about the current relationship between the United States and Egypt. 
Since the Camp David accords were signed in 1979, United States foreign assistance to Egypt has topped $42 billion. While some progress has been made in the last 16 years, I think it is important to point out the obvious, which is Egypt's role has changed and changed significantly. 
Let me review the record so there is a better sense of why the bill reported from the committee did not include the longstanding earmark for Egypt. 
First and foremost, Senator Leahy and I tried this year to get our aid program off autopilot. Our domestic agencies and programs have been put through the budget ringer to determine where we could reduce spending. Foreign aid obviously should not be exempted from this critical appraisal. As we conducted this review, we established very simple tests for evaluating performance. Does the program serve U.S. interests in stability, democracy, and market economies? Are U.S. resources well invested and well spent? 
The basic principle which has guided the provision of support in the Middle East has been a shared commitment to the Camp David accords and the promotion of peace. Unfortunately, Egypt's record over the last 2 years indicates a shift away from that commitment. 
Let me begin by referring to a letter sent by 25 Senators to President Mubarak last July following an Arab summit convened in Cairo. 
</TEXT>

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me just quote from the letter. The Senators said in that letter: 
We are concerned that the communique issued at the end of the summit compromises prospects to advance negotiations with the new, democratically elected government of Israel. We believe that limiting or conditioning options for peace discussions with the newly elected government of Israel before its policies have been officially formulated damages prospects for peace. Threats from countries of the Arab League to `reconsider steps taken in the context of the peace process, in relation to Israel' do little to enhance successful negotiations. . . 
The letter went on:.  
We are especially troubled that a leader of your stature created a forum, including Libya and Sudan, which question Israel's right to exist. 
Inviting Libya and Sudan to Cairo to condemn Israel is not the kind of initiative which serves peace or, for that matter, should be rewarded with another $3 billion. 
The July Cairo summit was followed in late September 1996 by an escalation in tension between Israelis and Palestinians over the so-called tunnel crisis. When violence erupted in the streets, President Clinton called upon Prime Minister Netanyahu, Chairman Arafat, King Hussein, and President Mubarak to come to Washington to negotiate a solution. Every leader came except Mubarak. Every leader had as much to gain and certainly a great deal to lose if the discussions failed. Every leader knew there were costs associated with a high-profile summit which might not relieve tensions. 
Only President Mubarak decided it was not worth his time or effort to continue a crucial dialogue with the simple objective of salvaging the peace process. After refusing to participate in this summit, President Mubarak decided to convene another Arab round-table. In March of this year, he called together the Arab League in Cairo where the foreign ministers passed a resolution which is worth taking a look at. The text read:

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commend an extraordinary woman for her lifelong dedication to service and charity. Ninety-two-year-old Mildred Sosh volunteers at the Wayside Christian Mission in Louisville one morning every week where she showers needy infants with loving care. 
Mrs. Sosh never had children of her own, so she loves the children at Wayside with all her heart. Mrs. Sosh also taught first grade for 44 years. This remarkable woman has volunteered at Wayside Christian Mission for 28 years where she first worked with the Mission's auxiliary mending clothes and making homemade gravy. She later volunteered in the day care where she remains today. Mrs. Sosh also volunteers at Salem United Church of Christ where she is a member. Mrs. Sosh was deservedly honored this spring at the J.C. Penney Golden Rule Awards Banquet for her dedication to helping the homeless. 
Despite her dependence on a cane to walk, Mrs. Sosh arrives at Wayside every Tuesday morning to rock the babies. She recruited a friend about 4 years ago to volunteer also so that she would always have a ride to the mission. Although not everyone can volunteer as extensively as Mildred Sosh, we can all take inspiration from her selfless sacrifice for the sake of others. 
Mr. President, I ask that you join me in honoring Mildred Sosh.

<TEXT>
Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today in support of the tuition savings provision included in this bill. I believe the Finance Committee has done a thorough job providing broad incentives to help families save and provide for the education of their children. 
I commend Senator Roth and the Finance Committee for their efforts to include many of the provisions in S. 594, the College Savings Act. The Finance Committee has included language to make earnings in qualified tuition savings plans exempt from taxation as well as expanding the definition of qualified education costs to include room and board. Once implemented this legislation will reward all families who plan ahead and save for a child's education. 
For the past several years, I have worked hard to make college more affordable by helping families who save. In both the 103d and 104th Congresses, I introduced legislation to make earnings invested in State-sponsored tuition savings plans exempt from Federal taxation. States have also recognized the needs of families and have provided incentives for them to save or prepay their children's education. State savings plans provide families a safe, affordable, and disciplined means of paying for their children's education. 
Last year, Congress took the first step in providing tax relief to families investing in these programs. The provisions contained in the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 clarified the tax treatment of both the State-sponsored tuition savings plans and the participants' investment. This measure put an end to the tax uncertainty that has hampered the effectiveness of these State-sponsored programs and helped families who are trying to save for their children's education. 
Mr. President, this action is long overdue. We have ignored the needs of middle-class families who have seen their income hold steady, while tuition costs go through the roof. According to the GAO, tuition at a 4-year university rose 234 percent between 1980-94. 
During this same period, median household income rose 84 percent and the consumer price index rose a mere 74 percent. The College Board reports that tuition costs for the 1996-97 school year will rise 5 percent while average room and board costs will rise between 4 to 6 percent. While education costs have moderated throughout the 1990's, they continue to outstrip the gains in income. Tuition has now become the greatest barrier to attendance. 
Due to the rising cost of education, more and more families have come to rely on financial aid to meet tuition costs. In fact, a majority of all college students accept some amount of financial assistance. In 1995, $50 billion in financial aid was available to students from Federal, State, and institutional sources. This was $3 billion higher than the previous year. A majority of this increase has come in the form of loans, which now make up the largest portion of the total Federal-aid package at 57 percent. Grants, which a decade ago made up 49 percent of assistance, have been reduced to 42 percent. This shift toward loans further burden students and families with additional interest costs. It is important that we not forget that compound interest cuts both ways. By saving, participants can keep pace with tuition increases while putting a little away at a time. By borrowing, students must bear added interest costs that add thousands to the total cost of tuition. 
State-sponsored tuition savings plans have pioneered efforts to provide families with opportunities to save as a hedge against tuition inflation. States have established affordable tuition investment plans that guarantee parents a minimum level of investment return or guarantee a future education at today's prices. Such guarantees offer middle-class families the piece of mind that their children will be able to meet the tuition obligation and reduce the need to take on thousands of dollars in loans. 
States like Michigan, Florida, Ohio, and Kentucky were the first programs to be started in order to help families save for college. Today, there are 15 States with programs in operation. An additional 4 States will implement their programs this year. Also, I am informed by the college savings network that every other State, except Georgia, which has implemented the HOPE Scholarship Program, is preparing legislation or is studying a proposal to help their residents save for college. Today, there are 730,000 participants contributing over $3.23 billion to education savings nationwide. By year end, the college savings plan network estimates that they will have 1 million participants. By 2006, they estimate that over $6 billion will be invested in State-sponsored programs. 
Kentucky established its plan in 1988 to provide residents with an affordable means of saving for college. Today, 2,602 Kentucky participants have contributed over $5 million toward their children's education. I am confident with passage of this language these programs will grow dramatically. 
Many Kentuckians are drawn to this program because it offers a low-cost, disciplined approach to savings. In fact, the average monthly contribution in Kentucky is just $49. This proposal rewards those who are serious about their future and are committed over the long-term to the education of their children by exempting all interest earnings from State taxes. It is also important to note that 58 percent of the participants earn under $60,000 per year. Clearly, this benefits middle-class families. 
Mr. President, the Finance Committee has expanded the language to permit private nonprofit colleges to establish their own tuition savings plans as well as establishing education IRA's. This will ensure that all families have an opportunity to save. This legislation also allows individuals who invested in Savings Bonds to roll them over into the qualified State plan. This is a commonsense provision that will give those who are already saving the flexibility to invest in prepaid plans if available. 
It is in our best interest as a nation to maintain a quality and affordable education system for everyone. We need to decide on how we will spend our limited Federal resources to ensure that both access and quality are maintained. It is unrealistic to assume that the Government can afford to provide Federal assistance for everyone. However, at a modest cost, we can help families help themselves by rewarding savings. This reduces the cost of education and will not unnecessarily burden future generations with thousands of dollars in loans. 
Let me close by saying that I commend the work of Senator Graham and his staff on the issue of tuition savings. His cooperation and hard work have ensured that this issue enjoys bipartisan support. I would also like to thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for all his efforts in making education savings the cornerstone of this package.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for yielding me a few moments. I listened very carefully to my good friend and colleague from West Virginia and to his observations about the dangers of drinking and driving, with which I completely concur. 
Of course, representing Kentucky, as my friend from West Virginia knows, not only do we have 60,000 tobacco growers, which is, of course, the subject of a number of amendments that may come on this bill; we are also the home of bourbon. If this kind of whiskey is not made in Kentucky, it cannot be called bourbon. Let me suggest that there are no industries--and I checked with the Finance Committee staff--that have been singled out by law and, as a result of being singled out, are not allowed to deduct their expenses for advertising. So this would be a first. 
To begin with, as a matter of tax policy, certain kinds of legal industries are not allowed to deduct their advertising, and others are. There is also--while we are thinking of both cigarettes and alcohol--another important distinction. There is no argument that misuse of alcohol is a problem in this country. As a Senator from a tobacco-producing State, I never make the argument that smoking cigarettes is good for you. Obviously, it isn't. But there are many in the medical profession who would say that the consumption of alcohol, if used properly--properly--is actually good for you. I am not a physician, I can't make that argument, but there is a growing argument being made by many in the medical community that a certain amount of alcohol, properly used, is actually good for you health, not bad for your health. 
So we have here a legal product, Mr. President, which, arguably, if properly used, might actually be good for you, which the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, I gather, is saying when misused, of course, is clearly a terrible thing and a disaster not only for the person misusing it, but for others who may be affected by that, and that because a product may be misused, the Government should step in and say: Your advertising is not allowed. 
Regardless of how you may feel about this----

Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator. I think I did understand his amendment to disallow a deductibility for advertising, which would make this the only industry of which the Finance Committee is aware where such deductibility would be disallowed. 
Aside from my home State and the product, which, if properly used, might actually be good for you, I wonder if my friend from West Virginia doesn't share my concern that once we go in this direction, we might find other activities that some may find offensive being subject to the same kinds of efforts to disallow deductibility for certain kinds of business expenses. 
I think, for example, West Virginia and Kentucky used to trade back and forth in terms of coal production. One year West Virginia would be first; the next year Kentucky would be the first. Alas, neither are first anymore. Wyoming is. But there are many Americans who think, as a result of the burning of coal, that the area is polluted and that, as a result of that, people contract lung problems. In fact, there is an initiative by the Clinton administration just announced this week which the Senator from West Virginia and I both have serious reservations about designed to cut down on air pollution--so the argument goes--so there will be less lung disease. 
I wonder, if we go down this path of trying to pick out which industries' deductions for certain kinds of business expenses are to be allowed or not allowed based upon our judgment about what is harmful to the public, whether or not somebody might come in and say, `Well, we shouldn't allow production costs associated with the mining of coal to be deductible because, after all, the burning of coal leads to the pollution of the air, which then leads to lung disease, which then leads to death.' 
I just am concerned that this is a step in the wrong direction. I understand fully the concerns of the Senator from West Virginia, and I share them. I think the use of alcohol leads to a great deal of tragedy. 
But I hope we will not single out this legal industry producing a product, which, if properly used, many people in the medical field feel is actually good for you, for this kind of selective treatment on deductibility. 
Finally, let me say that I am not an expert on the budget deal. But it is clear that there is a lot of momentum in this body to hold the deal together, and this is clearly not part of the budget deal. 
I hope that the proposal will not be approved, in all due respect to my good friend and colleague from West Virginia. I hope this would not become part of the measure before us. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I were a Senator from any other State listening to this debate, I guess I would have to conclude that I don't have any tobacco growers. Cigarette smoking is obviously not good for your health. Why should I not vote for the Durbin-Bond amendment? 
Reason No. 1: We entered into a budget agreement and this breaks it wide open. There has been a lot of momentum in this Chamber over the last week to stick to the budget agreement. This is a deal breaker. It wasn't negotiated by the President and the leaders of the Republican Congress. It wasn't even voted on by the Senate Finance Committee. 
So the stake you have in this, I say to my colleagues, you will be voting to bust the budget deal wide open, in order to raise taxes on low-income Americans. What a great idea. This is supposed to be a package about lowering taxes by $85 billion, or close thereto, over the next 5 years, and a vote for the Durbin-Bond amendment turns it into a tax increase bill--a tax increase bill on the lowest income people in America. In fact, 60 percent of any tobacco tax increase will be borne by Americans making less than $30,000 a year. So you will be transforming this bill, which has been criticized by some downtown as somehow a benefit for the wealthy, into a major tax increase on the most vulnerable, low-income people in our society. 
Regardless of how you feel about tobacco, regardless about how you feel about smoking--I don't smoke and don't support it particularly; I think it is not good for you--it is a legal product. That isn't the issue here. Why in the world, in a bill designed to lower taxes, would we want to have a whopping tax increase on the lowest income people in America? 
My good friend from Missouri said it is a matter of equity. It sure is. What is equitable about it? We are singling out one industry and one socioeconomic group in America for a major tax increase in a bill designed to lower taxes on working American families. It absolutely distorts everything this tax reduction bill is supposed to be about. Obviously, it has an impact on my State. Senator Ford and I feel passionately about this. Maybe some product in your State will be next. But this transforms this bill into a major tax increase on low-income Americans. I can't think of a worse direction to go in. 
Finally, let me say that it is estimated that it will cost our State of Kentucky 2,700 jobs, just like that. Clearly, that is a matter of major concern to us. But the consumers of cigarettes are all over America, not just in Kentucky, not just in North Carolina. They are, by and large, lower income people, who will continue to smoke after that, and you have just socked them with a major tax increase, Mr. President. 
I certainly hope my colleagues will not, A, break the budget deal and, B, have a whopping tax increase on low-income Americans. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased today to announce the introduction of the Civil Rights Act of 1997. President Clinton has asked for a national dialog on the issue of race in America. I applaud his efforts and welcome this opportunity. 
Any discussion of race must begin with the basic principle that all are created equal. In fact, the Constitution, our Nation's most cherished document, mandates that all individuals receive the equal protection of the laws. 
No one in our history understood the principle of equality better than the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. Reverend King spoke eloquently about a time when people would be judged by the `content of their character' and not the `color of their skin.' He, like so many of us do today, prayed for America to become a colorblind society. 
This fundamental principle of equality is the foundation for the Civil Rights Act of 1997, which declares that: the Federal Government shall not discriminate against or grant a preference to any individual or group based on race, color, national origin, or sex. 
The Federal Government must lead by example. We must promote a nation where our citizens are seen as individuals and not as mere members of a group. We must declare that the immutable traits of race and sex will not be relevant in Federal contracting and employment. Simply put, the Federal Government should not decide who gets the contract or who gets the job based on race and gender.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Health Care Liability Reform and Quality Assurance Act of 1997. This is virtually the same legislation as S. 454 that I introduced in the last Congress with Senators Lieberman and Kassebaum. That bill was reported out of the Labor Committee and received the support of 53 Senators when it was added as an amendment to the product liability legislation. Ultimately, however, the amendment was withdrawn under the threat of a filibuster. I am very happy to, once again, be joining with Senator Lieberman in this effort. 
Health care liability is one issue on which there has been some bipartisan consensus about the need to make significant changes. This bill which I am introducing today with the cosponsorship and assistance of Senator Lieberman represents this bipartisan effort. 
The purpose of our bill is to promote patient safety, compensate those who suffer injuries fully and fairly, without enriching lawyers and bureaucrats, make health care more accessible, gain some cost containment in health care, strengthen the doctor-patient relationship and encourage medical innovation. Our present system, unfortunately, does none of the above. 
First of all, patients don't get compensated. The Rand Corp. has reported that only 43 cents of every dollar spent in the liability system goes to the injured party. That means lawyers, experts, and court fees eat up a significant percentage of every dollar spent in the liability system. 
Second, the prohibitive cost of liability insurance means some doctors won't provide care to those in our society who need it most. Half-a-million rural women can't get an obstetrician to deliver their babies. This problem, however, is not limited to rural areas. High malpractice premiums force doctors to avoid the practice of medicine in urban areas as well, making it more difficult for minority communities to get necessary care. 
Third, companies that invent new products are discouraged under the current system from putting them on the market. Medical device manufacturers are finding it more difficult to get raw materials to produce life saving devices because of the risk of lawsuits. 
Fourth, doctors are less likely to explore risky treatment because of the proliferation of lawsuits. A doctor has a better than 1 in 3 chance of being sued during his practice years. And the likelihood of suit has nothing to do with whether the doctor was negligent. The General Accounting Office reports that almost 60 percent of all suits are dismissed without a verdict or even a settlement.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wanted to take a minute to express my deep satisfaction with the results produced by the conference on the emergency supplemental bill. The negotiations were complicated by how many issues were in play, but the chairman did a masterful job at methodically and successfully working through each and every item. Chairman Stevens' patience and perseverance are why we are here today. 
I want to take note of two sections of particular importance to me. First, the transportation chapter includes language which is essential to Kentucky. This legislation provides for a long overdue funding correction in Federal-aid highway funding. As a result of an accounting error, Kentucky's highway funding in 1996 resulted in a loss of Federal funds. This bill will provide Kentucky with $29.8 million to correct this funding shortfall. I am pleased to report that this level exceeds the $12.6 million requested by the Governor to complete the William H. Natcher Bridge. I know the people of Daviess County and western Kentucky look to the completion of this bridge. 
Second the foreign operations chapter in the House bill included language giving the President permission to waive earmarks for Ukraine which the Senate had included in last year's bill. This waiver authority was being offered in response to a deteriorating situation involving corruption and a slow down on crucial economic reforms. Congressman Callahan and I have very different views on the need for earmarks, but we share a concern about the trends in Ukraine. We were able to craft a compromise which made clear we are not content with the pace or scope of reform by allowing the President to waive any earmark as it affects aid to the Government of Ukraine. The compromise exempted important projects such as nuclear safety and all activities carried out by the private sector and nongovernment organizations. Most importantly, we did not permit any reduction in the overall level of the aid we provided--the $225 million stands intact. Should the administration choose to withhold or suspend funds for the government, they must reallocate the funds to other programs within Ukraine. 
We have sent a clear and focused message to the government that reforms are essential if businesses are going to have the confidence to invest. But, we have narrowly crafted that message so that we do not damage our bilateral relationship or the support we provide to organizations committed to advancing both Ukrainian and American interests. Both Congressman Callahan and I will review the progress made on this important issue when we take up the fiscal year 1998 bills in the coming weeks. I want to congratulate him on concentrating our attention on Ukraine's problem and working so effectively with me and my Senate colleagues to produce a compromise which we all hope will generate real results.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my esteemed colleague from Michigan in the introduction of the Small Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act of 1997. 
Over the past 30 years, the American civil justice system has become inefficient, unpredictable, and costly. Consequently, I have spent a great deal of my time in the U.S. Senate working to reform the legal system. I was particularly pleased to help lead in the efforts to pass the Volunteer Protection Act, which offers much-needed litigation protection for our country's battalion of volunteers. America's litigation crisis, however, goes well beyond our volunteers. 
Lawsuits and the mere threat of lawsuits impede our country's invention, innovation, and the competitive position our Nation has enjoyed in the world marketplace. The litigation craze has several perverse effects. For example, it discourages the production of more and better products, while encouraging the production of more and more attorneys. In the 1950's, there was one lawyer for every 695 Americans. Today, in contrast, there is one lawyer for every 290 people. In fact, we have more lawyers per capita than any other western democracy. 
Mr. President, don't get me wrong--there is nothing inherently wrong with being a lawyer. I am proud to be a graduate of the University of Kentucky College of Law. My point, however, is simple: government and society should promote a world where it is more desirable to create goods and services than it is to create lawsuits. 
The chilling effects of our country's litigation epidemic are felt throughout our national economy--especially by our small businesses. We must act to remove the litigation harness from the backs of our small businesses. 
The Small Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act is a narrowly crafted bill which seeks to restore some rationality, certainty, and civility to the legal system. Specifically, this bill would offer limited relief to businesses or organizations that have fewer than 25 full-time employees. 
First, the bill seeks to provide some reasonable limits on punitive damages, which typically serve as a windfall to plaintiffs. The bill provides that punitive damages may be awarded against a small business only if the claimant establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the business engaged in wanton or willful conduct. The bill would also limit the amount of punitive damages that may be awarded against a small business to, the lesser of: First, $250,000, or second, two times the amount awarded to the claimant for economic and noneconomic losses. Third, the bill provides that a business' responsibility for noneconomic losses would be in proportion to the business' responsibility for causing the harm. Any other defendants in the action who are not small businesses would continue to be held jointly and severally liable. 
Now, let me explain what this bill does not do. It does not close the courthouse door to plaintiffs who sue small businesses. For example, this bill does not limit a plaintiff's ability to sue a small business for an act of negligence, or any other act, for that matter. The bill also does not abolish joint and several liability for economic losses. 
Mr. President, this is a sensible, narrowly tailored piece of legislation that is greatly needed to free up the enterprising spirit of our small businesses. I look forward to Senate's consideration of this important legislation.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I literally cannot remember life without Strom Thurmond. My first awareness of Strom Thurmond was one of the first things I remember in my entire life. I was 6 years old. I was in the first grade at Athens Elementary in Athens, AL. It was 1948. One weekend we were on the porch at my grandfather's house, and I was sitting there listening to my dad and to my grandfather talk about the Presidential election of 1948. 
Now, I must confess at age 6 that was not a big item in my life, but that was the first time I heard the name Strom Thurmond. My dad and my granddad talked about the election for a little while, and all I remember for sure is that they said Strom Thurmond was a fine man, they were going to vote for him for President of the United States. 
The second time I remember hearing of Strom Thurmond, my family had moved from Alabama to Augusta, GA. My dad was a civilian employee for the Army after having served in World War II in the European theater, as did our fellow Senator whom we honor today. My father was working at the Savannah River plant in Aiken, SC, in 1954. 
And again, at age 12, obviously politics was not something I was thinking about very often. It seems to me baseball was most in my interest at that time. But that was the year our colleague whom we honor today got elected to the United States Senate on a write-in in South Carolina. The only time that has been done in history, Mr. President--a remarkable accomplishment. 
The next time I remember thinking about Senator Thurmond's distinguished career I was 22, and it was 1964 and we had moved to Kentucky by that point. I had begun to think of myself as a Republican and taken an interest in politics, and I remember the excitement, having been a son of the Deep South, when Senator Thurmond decided to become a Republican. In those days, as the occupant of the Chair certainly knows, too, there were not any Republicans in the Deep South. 
I remember the story my dad told me about his father, my grandfather, sitting him down at an early age and explaining to him politics. He said, `Now, son, this won't take long, just a minute.' He said, `The Republican Party is the party of the North and the Democratic Party is the party of the South.' And that was the end of it. So imagine my excitement as a 22-year-old college senior to see Senator Thurmond from the Deep South, as deep as it gets, South Carolina, saying, I'm going to be a Republican as a matter of conviction. Now, that was a pretty courageous thing to do in 1964 in South Carolina even if you were a pretty established figure, as Senator Thurmond obviously already was. 
He didn't have to do that. It would have been easy for him to continue to be a Democrat. That was certainly what everybody was in the South in those days. But, as a matter of conviction, Senator Thurmond said, `I can't be a Democrat anymore. This party doesn't reflect my beliefs and I am going to change.' That was the beginning, in every real sense, of the growth of the Republican Party in the South--which I want to say the occupant of the Chair and myself have been substantial beneficiaries of on down in subsequent years. 
The next time Strom Thurmond impacted my life was in 1969. I was a legislative assistant to a newly elected Senator from Kentucky who got assigned to the Judiciary Committee. And there was Senator Thurmond. I observed him as a staffer for the 2 years that I was here. He was invariably courteous to those who were beneath him in rank. I oftentimes think that the true test of people's worth is how they treat those people who are not on the same level of influence as they. Senator Thurmond was a favorite of the staff that worked at the Judiciary Committee because he was unfailingly courteous to all of us, and we respected him greatly. 
Obviously, the next time Senator Thurmond's life and mine intersected was in 1985 when I was sworn into the Senate and became a member of the Judiciary Committee myself and Senator Thurmond was our chairman. 
So, when I say I can't remember life without Strom Thurmond I do not exaggerate. He has been somebody I have heard about, observed and admired all of my life. And, as other speakers have said this morning, and I'm sure others will in the course of the morning, it is an honor for all of us to be associated with this great American. He is truly a legend in our time and a legend that goes beyond simply his longevity, his tenure. Certainly that is a remarkable record. I remember many of us were there at his 90th birthday, when Senator Thurmond looked out at the audience and said, `Now, if you'll eat right and exercise and take care of yourself, you may be here for my 100th birthday party.' Obviously, that kind of optimism, the looking forward, planning ahead, thinking about what you want to achieve, that kind of uplifting optimism has been an inspiration to all of us who have had the opportunity to know and to learn from the senior Senator from South Carolina. 
But, beyond the legend of tenure, there is also the question of accomplishment. There isn't anybody in the U.S. Senate who knows more about the issues that the Senate Judiciary Committee deals with than Strom Thurmond. And when it comes to national security matters, not only has Strom Thurmond been a hero on the battlefield himself, having ridden on one of those gliders in behind the lines at Normandy in 1944, not only was he a hero himself, but when it comes to the question of securing and standing up for the solid national defense of the United States, Strom Thurmond has no peer. He has been there for 40 years in the U.S. Senate seeing to it that America had a strong national defense in order to protect this country and our way of life and our interests around the world. 
So, Mr. President, let me say again, the life of Strom Thurmond--which continues; he is just getting started--has been an inspiration to all of us who have had the opportunity to know him and to love him over the years. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise to mourn the death and celebrate the life of a close friend, Dr. Rudy J. Ellis, Sr., who passed away this past Monday, June 2, 1997. 
Dr. Rudy Ellis was an inspiration to those who knew him. He was a respected orthopedic surgeon in Louisville, KY, and was the team physician for University of Louisville athletics. Through the years, Rudy touched the lives of many people in the community as well as the thousands of Cardinal athletes that he treated during his 35 years as U of L's team doctor. 
I had one thing in common with Rudy, we both started at the University of Louisville at about the same time. He became the U of L team physician in 1961. Since that time, he treated athletes in all sports, except when he stepped down from the Cards' football and baseball teams in 1986. Dr. Rudy Ellis has done more good for more people through the university than virtually anyone else. 
As a U.S. Senator, I get to travel across Kentucky and meet many great people who have made a difference in the State. And if I had to make a list of the truly great Kentuckians, Dr. Rudy Ellis would rank in the Top five. 
A former member of the U of L's board of trustees and board of overseers, Rudy was one of the pioneers in sports medicine in Kentucky. He opened the Rudy J. Ellis Sports Medicine Center in 1980. And over the years, he has been an integral part of the athletic programs at many Jefferson County high schools, by providing free annual physical examinations for the 4,000 athletes in the school system. In 1993, to show their appreciation for his hard work and compassion for the young athletes, the athletic directors from across Kentucky created an award for people who provide distinguished service to high school sports. Who better to receive the first award than the man they named it after, Dr. Rudy Ellis. 
High school gyms and the University of Louisville weren't Rudy's only stomping grounds; he also participated in the athletic programs at Bellarmine College, Lindsey Wilson Junior College, Hanover College, St. Catherine College, Spalding University, Louisville Redbirds, Kentucky Colonels Basketball Team, CBA Catbirds Basketball Team and Louisville Shooters Basketball Team. And in 1994, Rudy was recognized for all his work when he was inducted into the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame. 
Mr. President please join me in extending my heartfelt sympathy and prayers to the Ellis family, his wife Ruth Anne and his four children, John, Jim, Linda and Amy, and to all those whose lives he touched. He will be missed very, very much.

Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend, the Senator from Washington. 
Mr. President, we are indeed here for a budget resolution designed to ultimately lead to a tax decrease for Americans. Advocating the Kennedy-Hatch proposal is a $30 billion tax increase for the American people. 
Mr. President, that is not exactly what I thought a Republican Congress had in mind in negotiating with the President of the United States to reach a balanced budget agreement. All of a sudden we throw that out right here in the second day of debate and suggest that we raise taxes $30 billion on the American people. 
Now, which people are we suggesting the taxes ought to be raised upon, Mr. President? This is a regressive tax against low-income Americans. All of my colleagues on the left of the political spectrum here are advocating a low-income tax increase of substantial significance all across America. It seems to me the worst way, even if the Kennedy-Hatch proposal were otherwise something that ought to be supported, the worst possible way to finance it by putting a tax on low-income Americans. So not only is this a new tax in a budget resolution designed to give us an opportunity to lower taxes on the American people, it is a tax directed at low-income Americans. 
In addition to that, Mr. President, this is a tax that is targeted at a region of the country. It is no secret that tobacco production is largely confined to the southeastern part of the United States of America. No one, as far as I know, is suggesting that cigarette smoking or the production of tobacco be made illegal. Controversial though it may be, no one is suggesting it be made illegal. 
So we have in my State over 60,000 tobacco producers engaged in the raising of a legal crop for American citizens. The average tobacco grower, Mr. President, used to have in Kentucky about three-quarters of an acre. It is a little bit higher than that now. The typical tobacco producer in my State is a part-time farmer. He probably has a job in a factory. His wife probably works in an apparel or cut-and-sew plant, as we call them. They raise this tobacco on their own. They cut it and strip it on their own. They sell it at auction in November and December, and it provides Christmas money, or, for many families, a lot more than Christmas. It may be the opportunity to send their kids to college. Frequently, these kids going to college are the first in the families to have that opportunity. 
Mr. President, 60,000 tobacco producers all across Kentucky are being singled out as they raise a legal crop, being singled out to pay for a children's health insurance proposal in this budget resolution, and I am told by the chairman of the Budget Committee, we have already taken care of that. There is $16 billion for children's health insurance in this budget proposal already. So what is going on here is, you will have a whopping new tax increase on low-income Americans that whacks the Southeastern part of the United States the hardest in order to get after cigarette smoking. 
Mr. President, I do not smoke. I do not advocate it. I think we need to do a better job of keeping cigarettes out of the hands of people who are underage. But why in the world should we, in this budget resolution, designed, among other things, to give tax relief to the American people, whack 
low-income Americans with a $30 billion tax increase is simply beyond my understanding. 
Now, looking at it from a job-loss point of view, Mr. President, from a Kentucky jobs point of view, estimates are that there are 78,000 Kentucky residents who have jobs in sectors linked to the production, distribution, and retailing of tobacco products. By increasing the Federal excise tax on cigarettes by 43 cents per pack, we estimate we would lose 43,000 of those jobs and 2,000 of them would be the Kentucky farmers. The total payroll loss would be $70 million in my State. Due to declining cigarette sales, total State cigarette tax revenues would also drop by just under $7 million. 
So not only does this proposal advocate a huge tax increase on low-income Americans, it is also going to lose a significant number of jobs in my State and a number of other States across the Southeast all, allegedly, to go after a habit that many Americans have, which is not a healthy habit, a habit that I do not participate in, but a habit that adults are entitled to engage in if they so choose. 
Now, Mr. President, this is a very, very serious proposal before the Senate. It will do great harm to my State and other States across the Southeast. We do not need to enact this proposal to provide additional health insurance for children. That is already provided in the budget agreement before the Senate. 
Mr. President, I strongly urge the Senate not to adopt this amendment. It is a huge tax increase. It is a tax increase against low-income people. It is a tax increase targeted at a region of the country. It will have devastating effects on the economy of my State. I strongly urge the Senate not to approve this proposal. 
To reiterate, Mr. President, I support this budget's constructive advancement of child health care, but I strongly object to the proposed amendment's destructive impact on child welfare in my home State of Kentucky. 
This budget makes an up-front commitment to address the needs of child health because it is the right thing to do. But it does not place the welfare of children at risk in order to score political points against Joe Camel. I believe that my colleagues believe that no child should be discriminated against in order to benefit another. But the Hatch-Kennedy amendment takes this course openly. This amendment makes it acceptable to reduce a farm family to abject poverty in order to provide a limited health care benefit. This choice is not necessary. This budget supports the health care of children without destroying the foundation of their family and community. 
As I have mentioned on this floor before, leading tobacco States like Kentucky, North Carolina, and Virginia are not the only States whose economies benefit from tobacco. Tobacco is grown on over 124,000 farms in 22 States and in Puerto Rico. Tobacco provides jobs to countless Americans. The hundreds of thousands of people involved in the tobacco industry buy cars built in Michigan, refrigerators built in Iowa, computers from California, and insurance from New York companies. 
The smokeless tobacco industry includes thousands of small farmers in States like Kentucky, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. In many cases, tobacco provides the cash margin that sustains a diversified family farm operation. Smokeless tobacco companies employ workers in States like Kentucky, Connecticut, Wisconsin, New Jersey, West Virginia, Tennessee, and Illinois. Many tobacco product distributors are in States like Texas and Georgia. With the inevitable loss of those jobs, the economic harm will be far-reaching throughout the larger farm and rural communities associated with tobacco. 
The billions of tax dollars supplied by the many facets of the tobacco industry support schools, pay for roads--help build America. Where will these funds come from now? Whose taxes are you going to raise next? 
This amendment will raise excise taxes on all tobacco products including cigarettes, chewing tobacco, and snuff. This represents a 179-percent increase from the current 24 cents per pack Federal tax on cigarettes; a 569-percent increase on chewing tobacco from 36 cents to $2.41 per pound; and a 4,975-percent increase on snuff from 12 cents to $6.09 per pound. I am unaware of any other product that has been subjected to such outrageous tax increases. The economic repercussions of these taxes are far-reaching in terms of the severe economic disruption they will cause. 
Excise taxes are regressive and discriminatory. Regressive, because the burden of paying them falls heaviest on low-income Americans. In 1987, the Congressional Budget Office [CBO] called consumer excise taxes the most regressive type of tax. CBO singles out tobacco excise taxes as the most regressive of all estimating that lower income persons pay 15 times more in tobacco taxes as a percentage of income than upper income individuals. A 1993 study by the Council of State Governments calls tobacco a worn-out tax source. 
The tax on these products will be devastating to those Americans whose household income is less than $30,000. 
Thousands of American jobs will be affected with such increased taxes in the form of lost wages and reduced spending, for example, local banks, farm equipment dealers, seed and feed stores, gas stations, grocery stores, and clothing stores. 
A 43-cent-per-pack increase in the Federal excise tax increases the total Federal excise tax to 67 cents per pack and boosts the total Federal, State, and local excise tax to around $1 per pack. A 50-cent-per-pack increase for cigarettes would cause cigarette consumption to decline by about 11 percent. A decline of this magnitude would reduce total burley consumption in the United States by about 40 million pounds. Kentucky produced about 420 million pounds last year. Last year the average price per pound was about $1.90 per pound, this would result in a loss of $76 million in farm income. 
The American Economics Group, Inc. [AEG] estimates that 78,280 Kentucky residents have jobs in sectors linked to the production, distribution, and retailing of tobacco products. By increasing the Federal excise tax on cigarettes by 43 cents per pack approximately 4,310 of these jobs would be lost, 2,019 would be farmers. Total payroll loss would be $70 million. Due to declining cigarette sales, total State cigarette tax revenues will drop by $6.7 million. 
Tens of thousands of Kentuckians earn a living from the growing, harvesting, manufacturing, and marketing of tobacco products. Additionally, nearly $130 million of Kentucky's tax revenue relates to tobacco production, and local governments receive approximately $5.5 million in property taxes from the value of the quota system alone. Where will this tax revenue come from when Kentucky farmers are taxed out of existence? 
Mr. President, if this tax increase is passed, who is going to pay their bills, provide them with job opportunities, and pay their health care? Who? If this tax increase is passed, you will see a ripple effect that will be devastating to rural communities in Kentucky. 
Supporters of the Hatch-Kennedy amendment have spoken often of the health care needs of America's children. For Kentucky families, the health of their children is not limited to an insurance benefit. The health of our communities and our families is directly related to the health of our children. For Kentucky's rural towns and counties, tobacco is their lifeblood. 
This amendment will dramatically impact the ability of Kentucky farmers to provide a living for their families. The tremendous loss of income will affect whole communities. Most tobacco farmers operate on borrowed money from the local bank. Where farmers have been in a position to diversify, they have done so but they have borrowed the money and use tobacco income to pay back the loans. Land values will decline. Bankers are going to be less likely to make loans. Rural communities will be decimated. 
Mr. President, the farmers in my State of Kentucky and across the country are real people, people with feelings, and people who are hard working. The income they generate does not go toward a lavish lifestyle. The money is used to put food on the table, pay the mortgage, keep the car running, support the church, educate their children, and makes Santa Claus real at Christmas. 
For over 200 years, tobacco has played an integral role in Kentucky's history and economy. More burley tobacco is grown in Kentucky than anywhere in the world. The average farmer grows less than three acres of tobacco, and there is no other crop which provides the income tobacco does on such small acreage. The economics of this intensively managed crop do not transfer to planting soybeans, peanuts, or corn. There have been attempts to replace tobacco production with other crops; however, almost none are economically sustaining. 
In eastern Kentucky the impact will be particularly devastating. These are proud, and hardworking families with few alternatives. Their farms are small and tobacco is their only form of income. 
Tobacco is one of the most economically productive crops for the type of soil we have in Kentucky, and researchers have yet been unable to find a viable alternative. 
Tobacco is a traditional crop for my home State, but Kentuckians do not grow it simply to keep a tradition alive. Tobacco is a hard, 
labor intensive crop. Imagine the strength and sweat it takes to cut and spear a pound plant in the heat and humidity of a southern August day. Now imagine repeating that effort until--pounds of tobacco are cut, hauled, and hung in the barn for curing. Kentuckians grow tobacco because no other crop provides the same level of economic return. 
Forcing farmers to leave tobacco for an unsuitable crop is irresponsible and will cause irreparable damage to thousands of Kentuckians. 
We have too many big-picture economists and self-appointed experts who say farmers can find something else to grow, few have ever been to a tobacco farm to even know what it looks like. If they would go with me to Morgan, Owsley, or Wolfe Counties, where over three-fourths of their farm income comes from tobacco, it becomes very clear why I say there are not many alternatives. Twenty-three counties, all in eastern Kentucky, rely on tobacco for more than one-half of their farm income. 
Owsley County--88 percent of farm income is from tobacco. 
Wolfe County--80 percent of farm income is from tobacco. 
Morgan County--75 percent of farm income is from tobacco. 
If they could diversify they would. In western Kentucky, where the land is flat, they are growing tomatoes and peppers. In central Kentucky, they have beef and dairy cattle. But in eastern Kentucky, the choices are coal, tobacco, or welfare. The options simply are not there, no matter what the experts say. 
Beyond the farm gate, tobacco farming is immensely important to hundreds of small rural communities. Without the tobacco program the value of farmland would fall dramatically, local tax bases would be wiped out, and the loss of income from leasing the tobacco quota or growing the crop would reduce the standard of living dramatically across my State. 
The real travesty of an excise tax increase would be the impact on family farmers who have been helping to stabilize and revitalize our rural communities. In Bath County nearly 50 percent of all personal income comes from tobacco sales. That means it keeps a steady flow of money going into the community. 
If this tax goes through, how are tobacco farmers going to pay the local truck dealership, church, the farm equipment store, the seed and fertilizer store, the local independent bank, and all the other important elements in the community. 
There is just no disputing the fact that Kentucky burley brings in far more money than any other crop raised in the State. 
The average Kentucky tobacco farmer gets about $3,500 in revenue from an acre of tobacco, but that same acre generates nearly $37,500 in excise taxes for Federal, State, and local governments. 
Other sectors will be impacted by this outrageous tax increase such as convenience stores. The convenience store industry is concerned that the large tax increase on tobacco products will invite substantial tax evasion, and concurrently, expand the underground market for tobacco products. They are also very concerned about the increase of security risks for convenience stores and other tobacco retailers. 
In many retail formats, including convenience stores the value of tobacco inventory will dramatically increase. Cigarettes are already being locked up in grocery stores because of the shrinkage and theft risk that they pose. 
In fact, the convenience store industry has already seen many cases in which, because the amount of money in the cash register is kept low, an armed robber has opted to rob cigarettes. With such increased excise taxes, a carton of cigarettes will be the most expensive item in any convenience store. This poses serious security concerns. 
Mr. President, and colleagues, I do not use tobacco products. However, the proposed increased excise tax on tobacco products will impact me and every nonsmoker across the country. The excise taxes on tobacco products, as proposed will have a dramatic impact: jobs will be lost, sales and income tax revenues to the local, State, and Federal governments will be lost, unemployment will increase, businesses will shut down, and family farmers will go bankrupt. The men and women who grow tobacco, who rely on the money from tobacco, cannot bear this unfair tax. 
I do not believe it is fair or equitable to single out one industry or region to finance such a proposal. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am proud tonight to see that we are one small step away from providing protections for one of our most cherished resources--that is, the men and women who serve as volunteers throughout our communities. The Senate is prepared to pass this bill tonight, and we anxiously await the President's signature. 
This country's long line of volunteerism is built upon the principle of loving your neighbor as yourself--of being a `Good Samaritan' and stopping along side the road to lend a helping hand. People from my home state of Kentucky understand and live this simple, yet powerful principle. 
Unfortunately, this volunteer spirit has become another victim to our national epidemic of litigation. William Cople, former pro bono General Counsel for the National Capital Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America has written that, `volunteer service is under assault from an unlikely quarter--the civil justice system. Like so many others, volunteers and their service organizations have been swept into the courts to face potential liability in civil suits.' 
Moreover, even the Little League faces major league liabilities. As Dr. Creighton Hale, former CEO of Little League Baseball, has noted, the Little League has become the `Litigation League.' For example, one woman won a cash settlement when she was struck by a ball that a player failed to catch. Incidentally, the player was her daughter. 
The chilling effect of even one settlement or judgment is astounding. Again, I quote the Boy Scouts' former General Counsel who has explained: `a legal judgment entered in a single 
case can have a multitude of consequences extending far beyond that case itself. This surely is a reason for concern in the case of volunteers to service organizations.' 
It is precisely this type of reasoning and this type of horror stories-come-to-life that prompted me to introduce legislation to protect volunteers. I have introduced such legislation in 1990, 1993, and 1995. In this Congress, I have been proud to work with Senator Coverdell to bring this bill to final passage, and I greatly appreciate his leadership. 
Specifically, our bill protects volunteers: First, who act within the scope of their responsibilities, second, who are properly licensed or certified, where necessary, and third, who do not act in a willful, criminal or grossly negligent fashion. 
The organizations whose volunteers will receive protection are both broad and worthy. Our bill not only covers 501(c)(3) organizations, but it also covers volunteers of the organizations which do good work, but do not have a tax exemption under 501(c)(3). For example, our bill covers volunteers of local charities, volunteer fire departments, little leagues, veterans groups, trade associations, chambers of commerce, and other nonprofit entities that exist for charitable, religious, educational, and civic purposes. 
Finally, this bill is significant because it provides a national solution for a national problem. Bob Goodwin, president and CEO of The Points of Light Foundation, testified recently that a national solution is necessary because `there is no consistency among our states with regard to volunteer liability statutes.' Moreover, Mr. Goodwin explained that `the lack of consistency has led to confusion in the volunteer community.' The Volunteer Protection Act responds to this need and provides a uniform minimum standard to protect our volunteers. 
In closing, let me say a deep word of thanks to all the volunteers and leaders who have helped me push for this legislation over the past 7 years. In particular, I want to offer a special and heartfelt thank you to my wife, Elaine Chao, who has kept me focused on this issue, and been such a steady and constant voice for the men and women who serve in our communities. 
I also thank the President for his efforts in joining with Gen. Colin Powell and with President Bush to promote volunteerism throughout our country. I encourage President Clinton to sign this legislation and provide much-needed protection for our volunteers.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 
the American workplace has changed drastically since the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act--nearly 60 years ago. In those days, for example, a small percentage of working mothers toiled in the fields, factories, and general stores. Today, nearly 70 percent of mothers with children under the age of 6 are now working. 
The constant refrain of both mothers and fathers in the nineties is: `There's just not enough hours in the day.' 
Well, the U.S. Senate can't put more hours in a day, but we can give workers more choices on how to spend those hours each day. 
The time has come to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. 
Taking a look at this bill that Senator Ashcroft has so skillfully put together and advocated. 
I think that the Family Friendly Workplace Act is one of the best opportunities we've had in a long time to make a substantial contribution to America's working families. This bill is based on the comments and experiences of men and women who know the difficulty of balancing work and family. 
Recently, a good friend of mine, Bill Stone, from Louisville, KY, my hometown, testified in support of S. 4 at a hearing before the Employment and Training Subcommittee of the Labor Committee upon which I serve. Bill runs the Louisville Plate Glass Co. Approximately three-fourths of this company's Louisville work force is paid on an hourly basis and would be directly impacted by S. 4. 
As Bill explained to our subcommittee, he said, `S. 4 will give a new and greatly needed measure of flexibility to our employees who are trying to meet the demands of raising children in single-parent or two-worker families. It will also,' Bill stated, `be a huge benefit to our employees who are pursuing training or educational activities.' 
Now, let us take a look, Mr. President, at the compensatory time off provided for under the bill. If an employee at the Louisville Plate Glass Co. has to work overtime, then compensatory time off allows him to choose if he wants to be compensated with time-and-a-half pay or time-and-a-half time off. 
A recent poll by Money magazine found that 66 percent of the American people would rather have their overtime in the form of time off than in hourly wages. And an astonishing 82 percent of people support legislation to allow workers to have this type of choice and flexibility. 
The findings of this survey point to one conclusion, as explained by Ann Reilly Dowd of Money magazine. She put it this way. She said, `People are considering time much more precious than money right now.' And that is an enormous change in our society, Mr. President. Moreover, as Ms. Dowd concluded, `it seems that people are working so hard and being so torn between the mounting demands of their job and their family life that they really, really want more free time and they, particularly, want more flexible schedules.' 
The Senate has a responsibility to respond to this overwhelming national need for choice and flexibility in the workplace. 
Passing comptime legislation is just the first step in our response. Unfortunately, comptime alone is not enough. A bill that only includes comptime provisions will only include a small percentage of workers who actually work overtime.

Mr. McCONNELL. I challenge my colleagues to enact this simple, sensible legislation. The family friendly workplace is about nothing more than choice and paid time off. S. 4 is the Federal Government at its best--benefits for working families with no Federal mandates and no excessive costs for small businesses. I also particularly commend Senator Ashcroft for his leadership in developing this important legislation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, since 1966, the Federal Government has supported special education services for America's disabled children. Today, school districts depend on the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [IDEA] for assistance in assuring that children with special needs receive a comprehensive education in a supportive environment. In Kentucky alone, over 85,000 children benefitted from IDEA during the 1996-97 school year. 
Today, the U.S. Senate takes a historic step forward in its consideration of S. 717, a bicameral, bipartisan bill to reauthorize IDEA. Over the last two decades, changes in educational resources and the needs of students have impaired the ability of schools to meet IDEA's goal of a free, appropriate education for disabled students. This measure seeks to ensure that the Federal statute effectively addresses the special education issues of today's classrooms and is prepared for the future needs of educators, parents, and students involved in special education. 
This bipartisan, bicameral legislation achieves these objectives by building upon three primary goals: To focus on the successful education of children with disabilities, instead of rote completion of paperwork; to assure increased parental participation; and to give teachers the tools they need in order to teach all children.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to strongly oppose the McCain amendment to strike the funding designation for two items I have proposed to the legislation being considered, the Natcher Bridge and the grant redirection for the Paramount Theater in Ashland. 
The proponents of this amendment are wrong to characterize these two provisions as wasteful and unnecessary. The fact of the matter is that these are important projects to the communities of Owensboro and Ashland, KY. Elimination of these two provisions will not save a single dime. In fact, this amendment would unnecessarily waste more tax dollars. 
Mr. President, in 1992, a special purpose grant was included in the VA-HUD appropriations bill giving $1 million to the city of Ashland to construct a parking garage. City officials have studied this proposal further and determined that it would be more cost effective to purchase existing lots. This alternative will add more parking spaces overall and at a lower price. The city has requested that the remaining funds be used to restore a downtown landmark, the Paramount Theater. 
Now, if the McCain amendment passes, the city of Ashland would be left with a grant mandating that they build a parking garage that will yield fewer spaces at a greater cost. Mr. President, this makes no sense. 
Mr. President, this supplemental appropriations bill also provides for a long overdue funding correction in Federal-aid highway funding. This bill will provide Kentucky with $29.8 million to correct the funding shortfall. I was able to include language that directs the State of Kentucky to provide $12.6 million of the $29.8 million allocated for completion of the Natcher Bridge. This will ensure the completion of Natcher Bridge. 
Again, by striking the language, not one dime will be saved and the bridge will be left unfinished. Keep in mind every year this bridge is left unfinished the total cost of the project increases. So again, this amendment would waste scarce tax dollars and delay the completion of this important project. 
Mr. President, I believe the supporters of the amendment have mischaracterized this amendment and are doing a disservice to taxpayers and the citizens of Kentucky. I strongly oppose this amendment.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code to modify application of passive loss limitations to horse activities. 
This week the eyes of the sporting world are focused on the 123d running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in Louisville, KY. While it is considered one of the greatest sporting events in the world, the Kentucky Derby is part of a much larger and broader horse industry--one that has a $112 billion economic impact in the United States and supports 1.4 million jobs. 
Whether it is owning, breeding, racing, or showing horses--or simply enjoying an afternoon ride along the trail--1 of 35 Americans is touched by the horse industry. There are 6.9 million horses in the U.S. involving more than 7.1 million Americans as horse owners, service providers, employees and volunteers. In Kentucky alone, the horse industry has an impact of $3.4 billion, involving 150,000 horses and 52,900 employees. 
What supports the industry--including the job base, the breeding farms, and the revenue stream in the form of $1.9 billion in taxes to all levels of government--is the investment in the horses themselves. The horse industry relies on outside investment to operate, just as other businesses do. Without others willing to buy and breed horses, the 1.4 million jobs supported by this industry are at stake. 
Since the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the horse industry has experienced a near-devastating decline with job losses occurring at racetracks, horse farms, and industry suppliers. In addition, hundreds of breeding farms have gone out of business. Most horse owners and breeders believe that the limits on passive losses are a major reason for the decline as well as for the chilled interest of investors in horses. Since the mid-1980's, the number of horses bred and registered has decreased--leading to losses in jobs and revenues for the States. 
The 1986 act indicates that in order to satisfy the material participation requirement, a person's involvement must be regular, continuous, and substantial. However, the horse industry is unique, and the passive loss rules are difficult for some to satisfy. Because of the expertise and physical ability that is required, many owners cannot ride, train, breed and show their horses.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is a very significant bill. I want to commend the Senator from Georgia for his leadership which has brought us to this point this year. As he knows, I introduced similar legislation in 1990 and in 1993 and again in 1995. So I take particular pride in seeing it moved to this point where, hopefully, it will pass the Senate in the next minutes ahead. 
This bill really, Mr. President, comes from the grassroots of American voluntarism. This bill sprang from the concerns and complaints of volunteers and national leaders in the volunteer community, thoughts of the men and women who are on the frontlines in our national volunteer efforts. 
Just last week over on the House side we heard from Terry Orr, a former Washington Redskins football player. He said when he came into the NFL a few years ago players were asked to volunteer, and they responded, `Just tell me where to go.' There was not a moment's hesitation. In today's litigious world, players are asked to volunteer, and they respond, as Terry Orr said, `Do we have coverage?' 
Players are afraid to play a benefit ballgame or do any kind of volunteer activity without engaging in extensive discussions with their lawyers. That is today's environment, Mr. President. 
Lynn Swann, another famous football player with the Pittsburgh Steelers, is a commentator on one of the networks. He was also at that press conference. He is the immediate past president of Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America. This is what he had to say. He said in the late 1980's the Big Brothers/Big Sisters federation endorsed Federal volunteer protection legislation. According to Lynn Swann, the Big Brothers and Big Sisters organization endorsed the legislation because `a series of high visibility law suits against direct service volunteers had dampened [the] enthusiasm for volunteering in our program.' 
He went on to say the legislation was necessary because: `We [can] not afford to lose prospective, high quality volunteers due to liability fears.' 
That was Lynn Swann and Terry Orr, two former professional football players, just expressing their own experience in this highly litigious society in which we live and how it affects the willingness of people to volunteer their time.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a true Kentucky legend. Triple Crown winners have a special place in every thoroughbred racing fan's heart, especially those of us who are lucky enough to have enjoyed their successes. 
The last favorite to win the derby and the only undefeated triple crown champion in history, Seattle Slew came into the famed mile and a quarter race full of promise. Overcoming a disastrous start, the big bay righted himself and headed for the front where he would remain for the rest of the race, securing the first of the three jewels he would collect during the spring of 1977. 
A mere 11 horses in history have won the triple crown, with only 3 accomplishing the feat since 1948. Select company indeed. If horse racing is the sport of kings then Seattle Slew is truly one of its emperors. 
Some may think the champion stallion now lives the `Life of Riley' at Robert and Alice Clay's Three Chimneys Farm in Midway, KY. But, Seattle Slew did not stop setting records when his racing days were behind him, a fact I know the Clay family is eternally grateful for. He has sired dozens of champions who have racked up almost $50 million in career earnings. 
The world recognizes that Three Chimneys is known for its champions, but even among the daunting lineup stabled in Midway, Seattle Slew stands out. 
So, here's to the Clays, Three Chimneys, and most importantly one of the great legends in sport, Seattle Slew. As I grow older, 20 years seems like a very brief time, but it has been more than long enough for this great stallion to leave his indelible mark on the sport and those who love him.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me start by thanking my friend and colleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, for his leadership on this important issue this year. 
As the principal cosponsor of this bill in the previous Congresses, I am excited about the fact it is on the agenda and has an excellent chance of becoming law. 
My wife Elaine, who many of my colleagues know is former head of the United Way of America, was up at the volunteer conference yesterday in Philadelphia and there is no question that the timing of this could not be better. I commend my colleague from Georgia and the majority leader for scheduling this important piece of legislation during the volunteer conference, obviously making it easier for more and more Americans to contribute their time to others. It is something that ought to be a high priority in America in 1997. 
Unfortunately, volunteer service has become a high-risk venture. Our sue happy legal culture has ensnarled those selfless individuals who help worthy organizations and institutions through volunteer service. They try to do good and end up risking their fortunes. These lawsuits are proof that no good deed goes unpunished. In order to relieve volunteers from this unnecessary and unfair burden of liability, I am pleased to join in the reintroduction of the Volunteer Protection Act. I am particularly happy it is being considered today. 
The litigation craze is hurting the spirit of voluntarism that is an integral part of our American society. From school chaperons to Girl Scout and Boy Scout troop leaders to Big Brothers and Big Sisters, volunteers, as we all know, perform invaluable services for our society. At no time is this value more evident than right now where organizations like the Red Cross are making such a big difference for the victims in flood ravaged North Dakota, just like they did for the folks in my home State of Kentucky during the floods there earlier this year. 
So how do we thank the volunteers? All too often we drag them into court and subject them to needless and unfair lawsuits. The end result: too many people pointing fingers and too few offering a helping hand. Even Little League volunteers face major league liabilities. 
In February 1995, Dr. Creighton Hale, the CEO of Little League Baseball, wrote in the Wall Street Journal that Little League had in fact turned into `litigation league.' He pointed out that in one instance two youngsters collided in the outfield, picked themselves up, dusted themselves off, and then sued the coach. In another case, a woman won a cash settlement when she was struck by a ball that a player failed to catch. Incidentally, the player was her own daughter. 
It is sometimes difficult to quantify exactly how much of an organization's time and money is spent on liability protection. But the Girl Scouts have been able to put it into terms we can all understand. The executive director of the Girl Scout Council of Washington, here in the District of Columbia, said in a February 1995 letter that `locally, we must sell 87,000 boxes of Girl Scout cookies each year to pay our liability insurance.' 
Very simply, this bill protects volunteers who act within the scope of their responsibilities--within the scope of their responsibilities--who are properly licensed or certified where necessary, and some places require that, and, third, who do not act in a willful, criminal or grossly negligent fashion. 
We are not trying to insulate from liability those who may act in a wanton way. Let me emphasize this bill does not create immunity for the organizations themselves or for volunteers who act, as I said, in a willful or grossly negligent manner. 
Let me also point out that our bill clearly spells out that there is no protection for individuals who commit hate crimes or violent crimes or who violate the civil rights of others. So the opponents of the volunteer protection bill who claim that this is a KKK bill are simply engaging in fear mongering and demagoguery at its worst. This is a bill about protecting our volunteers. That is what it is about, nothing more and nothing less. This bill creates a minimum standard for volunteer protection and then allows the States to add further refinements and protections to that standard. 
In short, the bill gives States flexibility. It strikes a balance between the federalism interests on the one hand and the need to protect volunteers from unfair and unnecessary litigation on the other. Specifically, any of the following State law provisions would be--I say would be--consistent with our bill. 
First, a requirement that the organization or entity be accountable for the actions of its volunteers in the same way that an employer is liable for the acts of its employees. 
Second, an exemption from liability protection in the event that the volunteer is using a motor vehicle or similar instrument. 
Third, a requirement that liability protection applies only if the nonprofit organization or Government entity provides a financially secure source of recovery such as an insurance policy for those who suffer harm. 
Fourth, a requirement that the organization or entity adhere to risk management procedures including the training of volunteers. 
Now, none of those would be inconsistent with our bill should they be the standards adopted by a given State. The bottom line: liability problems for volunteers is a national problem that deserves a national solution--a national problem that cries out for a national solution. My state of Kentucky just experienced devastating floods. During those floods, we also experienced an outpouring of compassion from volunteers all across the country. The volunteers were not just from Kentucky. They were from Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, just to name a few States from which people came to help us out in Kentucky. If a Red Cross volunteer from Ohio wants to cross the bridge and come into northern Kentucky and help on our flood relief, they cannot just put on their coat and boots and go to Kentucky. They need to do some legal research first. They need to do a survey of Kentucky and Ohio law to see if volunteers are protected and to what extent they are protected. Voluntarism is obviously a national issue and volunteers regularly and repeatedly cross State lines to help their neighbors. 
That is why, among other reasons, this is a national problem calling out for a national solution. I urge my colleagues to move forward on this bill. The volunteer summit in Philadelphia is a testament to our country's strong efforts in this regard. And we think that clearly this is the time for action. 
Today, in the cooperative spirit of the President's summit, I would ask our colleagues to set aside our differences on other issues like labor issues. I also would respectfully ask my colleagues not to try to suggest that this bill is about anything other than what it is about. It is not about the Ku Klux Klan. It is about protecting American volunteers. 
I am amazed, I might say further, Mr. President, how one day we are criticized for moving too slowly and the next day we are criticized for moving too fast. It is pretty difficult here to figure out exactly what avoids criticism. These criticisms appear to be nothing more than attempts to divert this legislation which is obviously good for volunteers and good for our country. 
Let me just summarize. What we are talking about here is a national problem crying out for a national solution to make it more possible for American volunteers to go to the assistance of their neighbors. We are bringing this bill up in the middle of the national summit in Philadelphia to encourage voluntarism and some are saying we are moving too fast. This bill has been around for quite a while. I offered a measure similar to this in 1991, I believe it was. It got about 31 votes. But times have changed. There is a growing awareness that legal reform of a variety of different sorts is important to our country, and we are starting in this area with the volunteer protection bill because it is timely, it is important, and this is obviously the time to move forward. 
So let me conclude by thanking my good friend from Georgia for his leadership on this important issue. I hope we will soon be past the motion to proceed and well onto sending this legislation down to the President for signature. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I want to take the floor this morning to make a few comments in favor of the Government Shutdown Prevention Act, which we hope will be a part of the supplemental appropriations next year, which will be offered next week by Senator McCain and Senator Hutchison and which, it seems to me, embodies the elements of good government. 
We had a pretty contentious discussion in the last Congress about how best to get a balanced budget. It led to a conclusion that no one was happy with. It involved several temporary shutdowns of the Federal Government. We think it is important that that be avoided for the future. Everybody now understands that was not a good result, and the amendment which will be offered by Senator McCain and Senator Hutchison would prevent that. 
It would simply provide 98 percent of the fiscal 1997 appropriations bill level and will be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the prior year's bill, with a specific prohibition on initiating any new projects or activities. To put it another way, if we are unable to reach an agreement, it provides for a reasonable funding level to avoid the Government shutdown. 
It seems to me this is something we ought to pass on a bipartisan basis unanimously. Obviously, the American people are not interested in seeing the Government shut down again. They are also interested in seeing us reach bipartisan agreement to balance the budget, which we all hope will happen. But the McCain-Hutchison bill will eliminate the threat of a Government shutdown and leverage the President to garner additional funding for his priorities. It is a good-government proposal. It makes it clear that those on my side who thought the Government shutdown might be good leverage in the past decided that it isn't and that it should not be pursued. 
It keeps the pressure an all of us to go forward to enact the appropriations bills, because that is what we would ultimately hope would happen in the course of this year as well. I think, Mr. President, this is clearly something that ought to be coupled with the supplemental appropriations which, presumably, we will be dealing with next week. 
So I would like to add my strong support to the efforts of Senator McCain and Senator Hutchison and commend them for their work on this important issue and suggest that the Senate, hopefully, will pass this unanimously at the appropriate time. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in addressing the issue of ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). 
While some who are less familiar with the advice and consent process may regret the pace the Senate has undertaken, I strongly believe it is a point of pride. The Senate, led by Majority Leader Lott, Senator Kyl, Senator Helms, Senator Lugar and many others, has painstakingly reviewed the CWC for many months. The 33 conditions which have been the subject of protracted negotiations have created a document which better protects our nation's security interests. I congratulate Senator Lott and the rest of the participants for their efforts. 
Despite the best efforts of all involved I continue to harbor a number of strong reservations about the convention. I am concerned about its verifiability, the impact on U.S. business, the effect on U.S. efforts to eliminate existing chemical weapons stockpiles, and the number of rogue nations which are not party to the CWC. 
Former CIA director James Woolsey testified that detection of violations of the CWC is so difficult that we cannot `have high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale.' Nowhere is this more evident than Iraq. In a recent column, Charles Krauthammer pointed out that Iraq has been subjected to the most intrusive, comprehensive inspections for weapons of mass destruction ever devised or implemented by an international organization. Yet, we continue to uncover secret sites and weapons and have no confidence we know the extent of Saddam Hussein's lethal stockpile. If we are uncertain under the best of conditions, we should not underestimate the significant risks under adverse circumstances. 
Mr. President, my second concern is the unforseen impact inspection requirements might have on U.S. businesses. One estimate puts the number of Kentucky businesses which are likely to be impacted by the CWC at 44. Not all of these companies are large enough to be able to afford the increased costs of additional burdensome regulations. The chemical industry is already one of the most over-regulated industries in America. Currently, the combined costs of EPA, OSHA and other federal regulations on the industry is near $4.9 billion annually. Adding to this incredible financial burden is overkill. 
In addition to the costly regulatory burdens CWC asks these companies to withstand, the treaty will require companies to open their books and facilities to foreign inspection teams--creating a Pandora's box of commercial hazards. Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld points out, despite best efforts its possible, even likely, that inspection teams could come away with classified and proprietary information. 
Specifically, the inspection requirements may compel companies to provide proprietary technical data which could be used to considerable financial advantage by competitors. Worse yet, the results might enable adversaries to enhance their chemical weapons capabilities, putting American soldiers and citizens at potential risk. These risks underscore the need to include the imperative protections in Condition 31 enabling the President to ban inspection teams with terrorist track records. 
The third issue of concern relates to Condition 27's direct affect on my state and on our ability to dismantle our existing stockpiles. Kentucky is home to the Lexington Bluegrass Army Depot where thousands of chemical munitions are currently stored. The community surrounding this facility is justifiably concerned over the method by which the weapons will be destroyed. The Treaty mandates signatories register specific technical plans for destruction shortly after the instruments of ratification are filed. This may undermine alternatives currently being explored.

Mr. McCONNELL. Condition 27 also presents another problem. Current law requires the President to destroy the U.S. stockpile by 2004. Condition 27 extends the deadline to 2007. Mr. President I am emphatically opposed to this provision. I do not believe it wise to give the Army, or any party the opportunity to slow down efforts to identify alternative technologies or to delay the destruction process. 
The weapons stored in the U.S. need to be dismantled now. They are aging and therefore becoming more unstable every day. As this occurs, safe destruction becomes increasingly difficult and the chance of an accident increases dramatically. I hope the Administration will not seek a delay in the destruction deadline unless it is absolutely necessary in order to undergo the safe and effective elimination of our weapons. 
Finally, Mr. President, the fact that many of the nations with either the intent or the means to attack U.S. soldiers and citizens with chemical weapons are not covered by the CWC is deeply troubling. Libya, Syria, Iraq and North Korea are all 
suspected of possessing chemical weapons and not one is a participant in the CWC. This fact is strong justification for maintaining Condition 30 which compels their participation. 
If the U.S. ratifies the CWC the horrors of chemical attack will not magically disappear. Those of us in the United States Senate must remain vigilant in ensuring that America continues to prepare adequate defensive capabilities against potential chemical or biological attack. Incidents such as the sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subway cannot be prevented by this or any other treaty. 
The world remains a dangerous place and this treaty will not substantially change that fact. The Secretary of State insists that this Treaty is not about our chemical weapons--it is a means to limit other nations'. The plain fact is it will not constrain one nation from acquiring or using these weapons. Even if we are able to determine that a participating nation is violating the CWC, the means of redress or sanction available under the treaty are toothless and largely ineffective. The United Nations Security Council must craft penalties which could avoid potential Chinese or Russian vetoes. I am certain this would be a near impossible task. 
With these objections stated, it is clear that I do not believe the CWC is a perfect document. In fact, it remains unclear whether the treaty will have any of the positive effects its proponents allege. 
Why then do I feel compelled to support U.S. ratification? Quite simply it comes down to one issue--the necessity to sustain the strength and credibility of U.S. leadership. As the principal architect of the CWC, the United States risks our authority and stature should we refuse to ratify the convention. If this treaty is to enjoy any success it will be due to U.S. participation and leadership. As President Bush has stated repeatedly, `it is vitally important for the United States to be out front.' I also agree with former Secretary of State James Baker's assertion that failure to ratify the convention `would send a message of American retreat from engagement in the world.' 
The United States must be in a position to lead, and it must use this leadership to push other nations to follow our example and eliminate their chemical stockpiles. Just this week we heard from a former high ranking North Korean official of that country's significant chemical and nuclear capabilities and willingness to use both. The U.S. must actively work to ensure that the North Korea's of the world recognize the futility in relying on these weapons. The CWC is a modest step on that road, a road which I hope yields success.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am happy today to join with my esteemed colleagues, Senator Moynihan and Senator Lieberman, to announce the introduction of the Auto Choice Reform Act. As you know, we introduced this bill in the last Congress, along with Senator Dole. We are proud to announce that Senator Slade Gorton and Senator Rod Grams have also joined us as original cosponsors. 
You will hear lots of discussion today, and in the coming months, about various aspects of automobile insurance and tort liability. But, everything you will hear about Auto Choice can be summed up in two words: choice and savings. 
Consumers want, need, and deserve both. 
Very simply, the Auto Choice Reform Act offers consumers the choice of opting out of the pain and suffering litigation lottery. The consumers who make this choice will achieve a substantial savings on automobile insurance premiums. 
Based on an analysis by the Rand Institute for Civil Justice, the Joint Economic Committee estimates that, under Auto Choice, consumers could save a total of $45 billion nationwide in 1997--at no cost to the Government. And, over 5 years, Auto Choice could make available a total of $246 billion in savings. Now, that's better than any tax cut that either party has proposed. 
What does a $45 billion annual savings mean to the average driver? Well, that savings is colorfully and clearly illustrated behind me with this check: `Pay to the Order of the American Driver--$243.' And this check is not a one-time payment. Motorists could achieve this type of savings every year. 
However, before you can truly comprehend the benefits of Auto Choice, you must understand the terrible costs of the current tort liability system. 
The Nation's auto insurance system desperately needs an overhaul. And nobody knows this better than the American motorist--who is now paying on average $757 for automobile insurance. Between 1987 and 1994, average premiums rose 44 percent--nearly 1 1/2 times the rate of inflation. 
Why are consumers forced to pay so much? 
Because the auto insurance system is clogged and bloated by fraud, wasteful litigation, and abuse. 
First, let's talk about fraud. In 1995, the F.B.I. announced a wave of indictments stemming from Operation Sudden Impact, the most wide-ranging investigation of criminal fraud schemes involving staged car accidents and massive fraud in the health care system. The F.B.I. uncovered criminal enterprises staging bus and car accidents in order to bring lawsuits and collect money from innocent people, businesses and governments. F.B.I. Director Louis Freeh estimates that every American household is burdened by an additional $200 in unnecessary insurance premiums to cover this enormous amount of fraud. 
In addition to the pervasive criminal fraud that exists, the incentives of our litigation system encourage injured parties to make excessive medical claims to drive up their damage claims in lawsuits. The Rand Institute for Civil Justice, in a study released in 1995, concluded that 35 to 42 percent of claimed medical costs in car accident cases are excessive and unnecessary. Let me repeat that in simple English: well over one-third of doctor, hospital, physical therapy, and other medical costs claimed in car accident cases are for 
nonexistent injuries or for unnecessary treatment. 
The value of this wasteful health care? Four billion dollars annually. I don't need to remind anyone of the ongoing local and national debate over our health care system. While people have strongly-held differences over the causes and solutions to that problem, the Rand data make one thing certain --lawsuits, and the potential for hitting the jackpot, drive overuse and abuse of the health care system. Reducing those costs by $4 billion annually, without depriving one person of needed medical care, is clearly in our national interest. 
Why would an injured party inflate their medical claims, you might ask. It's simple arithmetic. For every $1 of economic loss, a party stands to recover up to $3 in pain and suffering awards. In short, the more you go to the doctor, the more you get from the jury. And, the more you get from the jury, the more money your attorney puts in his own pocket. 
In addition to the massive fraud encouraged by the liability system, seriously injured people are grossly undercompensated under the tort system. A 1991 Rand study reveals that people with economic losses between $25,000 and $100,000 recover on the average only 50 percent of their economic losses. People with losses in excess of $100,000 recover only 9 percent. 
Moreover, liability insurance does not pay until the claim is resolved. Studies show that the average time to recover is 16 months, and it takes longer in serious injury cases. 
The Auto Choice bill gives consumers a way out of this system of high premiums, rampant fraud, and slow, inequitable compensation. Our bill would remove the perverse incentives of lawsuits, while ensuring that car accident victims recover fully for their economic loss. 
Now, I'd like to answer the question: what is Auto Choice? Let me first answer with what it is not. It does not abolish lawsuits, and it does not eliminate the concept of fault within the legal system. There will no doubt be less reason to go to court, but the right to sue is absolutely not abolished. 
What it does do is allow drivers to decide how they want to be insured. In establishing the choice mechanism, the bill unbundles economic and noneconomic losses and allows the driver to choose whether to be covered for noneconomic losses--that is, pain and suffering losses. 
In other words, if a driver wants to be covered for pain and suffering, he stays in the current State system. If he wants to opt-out of the pain and suffering regime, he chooses the personal protection system. 
This choice, which sounds amazingly simple and imminently reasonable, is, believe it or not, currently unavailable for over ninety percent of all motorists. Auto Choice will change that. 
Let me briefly explain the choices that our bill will offer every consumer. A consumer will be able to choose one of two insurance systems. 
The first choice is the tort maintenance system. Drivers who wish to stay in their current system would choose this system and be able to sue and be sued for pain and suffering. These drivers would essentially buy the same type of insurance that they currently carry--and would recover, or fail to recover, in the same way that they do today. The only change for tort drivers would be that, in the event that they are hit by a personal protection driver, the tort driver would recover both economic and noneconomic damages from his own 
insurance policy. This supplemental first-party policy for tort drivers will be called tort maintenance coverage. 
The second choice is the personal protection system. Consumers choosing this system would be guaranteed prompt recovery of their economic losses, up to the levels of their own insurance policy. These drivers would give up recovery of pain and suffering damages in exchange for being immune from pain and suffering lawsuits. Personal protection drivers would achieve substantially reduced premiums because the personal protection system would dramatically reduce: First, pain and suffering damages, second, fraud, and third, the bulk of attorney fees. 
Under both insurance systems--tort maintenance and personal protection--the injured party whose economic losses exceed his own coverage will have the right to sue the responsible party for the excess. Moreover, tort drivers will retain the right to sue each other for both economic and noneconomic loss. Critics who say the right to sue is abolished by this bill are plain wrong. 
The advantages of personal protection coverage are enormous. 
First, personal protection coverage assures that those who suffer injury, regardless of whether someone else is responsible, will be paid for their economic losses. The driver does not have to leave compensation up to the vagaries of how an accident occurs and how much coverage the other driver has. A driver whose car goes off a slippery road will be able to recover for his economic losses. Such a blameless driver could not recover under the tort system because no other person was at fault. No matter when and how a driver or a member of his family is injured, the driver knows his insurance will protect his family. 
Second, the choice as to how much insurance protection to purchase is in the hands of the driver, who is in the best position to know how much coverage he and his family need. He can choose as much or as little insurance as his circumstances require, from $20,000 of protection to $1 million of coverage. 
Third, people who elect the personal protection option will, in the event they are injured, be paid promptly, as their losses accrue. 
Fourth, we will have more rational use of precious health care resources. Insuring on a first-party basis eliminates the incentives for excess medical claiming. When a person chooses to be compensated for actual economic loss, the tort system's incentives for padding one's claims disappear. 
Fifth, Auto Choice offers real benefits for low-income drivers because the savings are progressive. Low-income drivers will see the biggest savings because they pay a higher proportion of their disposable income in insurance costs. A study of low income residents of Maricopa County, AZ, revealed that households below 50 percent of the poverty line spent an amazing 31.6 percent of their disposable income on car insurance. 
For many low-income families the choices are stark: car insurance and the ability to get to the job, or medicine, new clothing or extra food for the children. Or, they choose the worst alternative of all--driving without any insurance. Should we allow our litigation system to promote such unlawful conduct? 
Moreover, Auto Choice offers benefits to all taxpayers, even those who don't drive. For example, local governments will save taxpayer dollars through decreased insurance and litigation costs. This will allow governments to use our tax dollars to more directly benefit 
the community. Think of all the additional police and firefighters that could be hired with money now spent on lawsuits. Or, schools and playgrounds that could be better equipped. New York City spends more on liability claims than it spends on libraries, botanical gardens, the Bronx Zoo, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Department of Youth Services, combined. Imagine the improved quality of life in our urban areas if governments were free of spending on needless lawsuits. 
Last, we will create incentives for safer cars. Now, it actually costs more to insure a safer car. That's because a driver in a bigger car who is responsible for another's injury may have a bigger claim to pay. After all, the bigger, safer car may cause more damage to the person in a smaller, less safe car. So insuring a bigger, safer car costs more. But under auto choice and first-party coverage, insurance companies would reward customers with lower premiums for safer cars. 
The bottom line? We think that consumers should be able to make one simple choice: `Do you want to continue to pay $757 a year for auto insurance and have the right to recover pain and suffering damages? Or would you rather save $243 a year on your premiums, be promptly reimbursed for your economic losses, and forego pain and suffering damages?' 
It's really that simple. And, we're not even going to tell them which answer is the right one. Because that's not up to us. It's up to the consumer. We simply want to give them the choice. 
In closing, I'd like to do something I rarely do--quote the New York Times--which summed up the benefits, and indeed, the simplicity of Auto Choice: Auto Choice `would give families the option of foregoing suits for nonmonetary losses in exchange for quick and complete reimbursement for every blow to their pocketbook. Everyone would win--except the lawyers.' 
Now, before I turn over the floor to Senator Moynihan, I'd like to share with you a scathing indictment of the tort liability system that was written more than a quarter of a century ago by a true visionary:  
No one involved has an incentive to moderation or reasonableness. The victim has every reason to exaggerate his losses. It is some other person's insurance company that must pay. The company has every reason to resist. It is somebody else's customer who is making the claim. Delay, fraud, contentiousness are maximized, and in the process the system becomes grossly inefficient and expensive. Automobile accident litigation has become a 20th-Century equivalent of Dickens's Court of Chancery, eating up the pittance of widows and orphans, a vale from which few return with their respect for just[ice] undiminished. 
Well, those insightful and prophetic words were spoken by none other than the man who stands here with me as an original cosponsor today, my colleague from the State of New York, Pat Moynihan. Pat, it's taken over 25 years, but I think we're finally going to overhaul this broken-down auto insurance system.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today the U.S. Senate considers H.R. 1003, the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997. As an original co-sponsor of S. 304, the Senate companion to H.R. 1003, I rise in support of this measure's reasonable and responsible action in prohibiting the use of Federal funds to support physician-assisted suicide. 
Modern medical technology has made a significant difference in the health care challenges that patients and providers face today. While few Americans fear death from scarlet fever or cholera, a growing number are concerned about the potential for a slow, painful death from cancer or a degenerative neurological disorder. Advocates for physician-assisted suicide package the concept as purely an issue of patient choice and personal liberty in seeking relief from suffering. Moreover, they argue that this choice harms no one. I respectfully but stringently disagree. Physician-assisted suicide condones the intentional killing of a human being as a valid method for relieving pain and suffering when other means are available to address a patient's critical medical needs. 
Advocates for physician-assisted suicide point to secondary effect, the circumstance where a patient dies during treatment for pain, as a factor lending legitimacy to the legalization of euthanasia. Again, I disagree. A large number of Americans and a majority in the medical community identify the critical difference between the administration of pain medication and physician-assisted suicide. In the former, a physician makes a medical assessment and administers the level of medication necessary to relieve a patient's pain and suffering. Though the action is taken with the knowledge that the treatment could cause death, the physician's sole medical goal is helping the patient attain relief from suffering. In contrast, physician-assisted suicide is the intentional administration of a drug, not for pain relief, but to kill. H.R. 1003 recognizes the critical difference between secondary effect and physician-assisted suicide. 
While patients' rights have been raised in the debate over physician-assisted suicide, I want to draw attention to the broader implications of this action on the health care community. The American Medical Association makes clear in its Code of Medical Ethics that the intentional act of killing a patient is antithetical to the central mission of healing that bonds the physician-patient relationship. The AMA fully endorses H.R. 1003's purpose to assure that the integrity of doctors working for Federal health care programs and in Federal health care 
facilities is not compromised by the act of physician-assisted suicide. Without H.R. 1003, doctors face a painful dilemma of whether they are expected to conduct assisted suicide as a form of medical treatment. The AMA rejects such a concept, and 87 percent of Americans agree that Federal tax dollars should not support such a questionable practice. 
It is clear to all that patient concerns regarding the health care threats of degenerative and painful disease must be addressed. This critical need is one of the reasons why I and other Members of the U.S. Senate support Federal investment in medical research. The Federal Government should not invest in physician-assisted suicide as a legitimate option for pain control however. Medicine today is capable of managing physical pain, but patients are forced to endure pain and suffering because this information is not applied uniformly. For the welfare of patients and families, we should focus our energies on correcting these failures in medical care delivery, rather than diverting critical attention toward the questionable promotion of assisted suicide. 
Mr. President, I support the right of Americans to decide whether or not to withdraw or withhold medical treatment. I also appreciate the difference between acts to relieve the pain of a dying patient and acts that intentionally produce pre-mature death. H.R. 1003 does the same. This measure makes clear that Federal funds do not and will not support physician-assisted suicide to the detriment of patients, families, and the medical community. I urge my colleagues to join in support of H.R. 1003's intent to ensure that this vital concern for millions of Americans is properly addressed.

Mr. McCONNELL. 
 Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to introduce legislation that addresses an important issue facing families today--the education of their children. For the past several years, I have worked to make college more affordable by rewarding families who save. In both the 103d and 104th Congresses, I introduced legislation--S. 1787 and S. 386 respectively--to make earnings invested in State-sponsored tuition savings plans exempt from Federal taxation. 
States have recognized the needs of families and have provided incentives for them to save or prepay their children's education. State savings plans provide families, a safe, affordable and disciplined means of paying for their children's education. The College Savings Act of 1997, will provide Federal tax incentives to provide additional assistance to the efforts of the States. 
According to GAO, tuition at a 4-year university rose 234 percent between 1980-94. During this same period, median household income rose 84 percent and the consumer price index rose a mere 74 percent. The College Board reports that tuition costs for the 1996-97 school year will rise 5 percent while average room and board costs will rise between 4-6 percent. While education costs have moderated throughout the 1990's, they continue to outstrip the gains in income. Tuition has now become the greatest barrier to attendance. 
Due to the rising cost of education, more and more families have come to rely on financial aid to meet tuition costs. In fact, a majority of all college students accept some amount of financial assistance. In 1995, $50 billion in financial aid was available to students from Federal, State, and institutional sources. This was $3 billion higher than the previous year. A majority of this increase has come in the form of loans, which now make up the largest portion of the total Federal aid package at 57 percent. Grants, which a decade ago made up 49 percent of assistance, have been reduced to 42 percent. This shift toward loans further burdens students and families with additional interest costs. 
In response to this trend, the Republican Congress and the President have developed different proposals to address the rising cost of a post-secondary education. S. 1, the Safe and Affordable Schools Act, provides incentives for families to save for their children's college education through education savings accounts and State-sponsored savings plans. For those burdened by student loans, this legislation also makes the interest paid on student loans deductible, The President has offered two tax provisions, the HOPE scholarship, which is a $1,500 tax credit and a $10,000 tax deduction for tuition expenses. 
A provision in S. 1 makes the earnings in State-sponsored tuition savings plans exempt from taxation. Like the legislation I am introducing today, this provision recognizes the leadership States have taken in helping families save for college. In the mid-1980's States identified the difficulty families had in keeping pace with the rising cost of education. States like Michigan, Florida, Ohio, and Kentucky were the first programs to be started in order to help families save for college. Today, there are 15 States with programs in operation. An additional four States will implement their programs this year. According to the College Savings Network every other State, except Georgia, which has implemented the HOPE Scholarship Program, is preparing legislation or is studying a proposal to help their residents save for college. 
Today there are 600,000 participants contributing over $3 billion to education savings nationwide. By year end, the College Savings Plan Network estimates that they will have 1 million participants. By 2006, they estimate that over $6 billion will be invested in State-sponsored programs. 
Kentucky established its plan in 1988 to provide residents with an affordable means of saving for college. Today, 2,602 Kentucky participants have contributed over $5 million toward their childrens' education. 
Many Kentuckians are drawn to this program because it offers a low-cost, disciplined approach to savings. In fact, the average monthly contribution in Kentucky is just $49. This proposal rewards those who are serious about their future and are committed over the long-term to the education of their children by exempting all interest earnings from State taxes. It is also important to note that 58 percent of the participants earn under $60,000 per year. Clearly, this benefits middle-class families. 
Last year, Congress took the first step in providing tax relief to families investing in those programs. The provisions contained in the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 clarified the tax treatment of both the State-sponsored tuition savings plans and the participants' investment. This measure put an end to the tax uncertainty that has hampered the effectiveness of these State-sponsored programs and helped families who are tying to save for their childrens' education. 
Already, we can see the result of the tax reforms in the 104th Congress. Last year, Virginia started its plan and was overwhelmed by the positive response. In its first year, the plan sold 16,111 contracts raising $260 million. This success exceeded all goals for this program. While we made important gains last year, we need to finish what we have started and fully exempt the investment income from taxation. 
The legislation I am introducing today with the support of Senator Graham and others will make the savings in State pre-paid tuition plans exempt from taxation. While the measure is similar to the provision in S. 1, it is a more comprehensive proposal that has been developed in close consultation with the States. In addition to tax exemption, the bill expands the definition of qualified education expense to include room and board costs. This is important since such costs can amount to 50 percent of total college expenses. 
It also allows individuals who invested in series EE savings bonds to contribute these education savings bonds to qualified State tuition programs. 
This is a commonsense provision that will give those who are already saving the flexibility to invest in prepaid plan if available. It also clarifies the law to permit States to establish scholarship programs within the plan. The bill also makes several other minor changes that will help the programs to operate more efficiently, including clarification of the transition rule, permitting the transfer of benefits to cousins and stepchildren, and permitting States to include proprietary schools as eligible institutions. 
This legislation is a serious effort to encourage long-term saving. It is important that we not forget that compound interest cuts both ways. By saving, participants can keep pace with tuition increases while putting a little away at a time. By borrowing, students must bear added interest costs that add thousands to the total cost of tuition. 
During the election the President unveiled his education tax proposals. There are two primary provisions of the President's proposal. The first is the HOPE scholarship, which would allow a parent or student to claim a $1,500 nonrefundable tax credit for tuition expenses. The other is a $10,000 tax deduction to be applied toward tuition expenses. 
The most disturbing aspect of this proposal is its cost. It is my understanding that the President's proposal, if allowed to reach its fullest potential, will exceed $80 billion over the next 10 years as estimated by Joint Tax Committee. This contrasts with the modest tax package included in S. 1, which is estimated to cost $18 billion during the same period. This can be compared with the $1.6 million cost associated with the College Savings Act I have introduced today. 
The administration has been quick to point out that their tax package isn't a budget buster because of the tax credit sunset that will be implemented if the President's budget isn't in balance by 2002. According to the CBO the President's budget will run a $69 billion deficit in 2002. With such uncertainty, how does this help families plan for their childrens' future? Considering the importance of this issue, I am surprised the President is willing to allow this program to expire, shortly after it begins. 
The President's proposal has also been criticized because it will also contribute to increased tuition costs. Mr. Chairman, I would ask that an editorial by Lawrence Gladieux, executive director for the College Board and Robert Reischauer, the former director of the CBO, be included with my testimony. 
Mr. Gladieux and Mr. Reischauer argue that the President's credit would be money in the bank, not only for parents, but the schools as well. This across-the-board tax credit would permit schools to add this subsidy into the cost of tuition. It was also their assumption that the tax benefit would benefit primarily wealthy individuals. Therefore the President's package would be two strikes against low-income families who won't benefit from the tax credit, yet will still bear the burden of higher tuition costs. 
The authors also point out the President's proposal imposes a new regulatory burden on schools by requiring the IRS to verify that a student received a B average in order to be eligible for a second year of this tax credit. Under the President's proposal we will have the IRS grading student papers and publishing tax regulations defining B work. It is simply a mistake to use the Tax Code in this manner. 
It is in our best interest as a nation to maintain a quality and affordable education system for everyone. We need to decide on how we will spend our limited Federal resources to ensure that both access and quality are maintained. It is unrealistic to assume that the Government can afford to provide Federal assistance for everyone. However, at a modest cost, we can help families help themselves by rewarding savings. This reduces the cost of education and will not unnecessarily burden future generations with thousands of dollars in loans. 
I urge my colleagues to support this valuable legislation this year to reward those who save in order to provide a college education for their children.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it does not take an economics professor to figure out that compound interest can either work for or against you. I would think that my colleagues would agree that middle-class Americans deserve to have their hard-earned dollars working for them instead of against them. The College Savings Act allows hard-working Americans to utilize this principle while saving for the college education of their children. 
Option 1 illustrates the average cost of using the Federal loan program to finance the average instate college tuition in the United States which is $10,540. Under the Federal loan program, middle-class Americans end up paying $120 per month after graduation to retire just the cost of higher education tuition and fees, not to mention room and boarding costs. 
These payments will continue for 120 months, or 10 years after receiving a diploma. Students end up repaying $14,400 on these loans. This means that they will end up paying $3,860 in interest to finance a college education. That is figured at a 6.5-percent interest rate. 
Option 2, on the other hand, figures in the same amount of tuition cost, $10,540, but that is where the similarities end. Under the College Savings Act, monthly deposits are half as expensive as loan payments under Federal loan programs. Your monthly deposit over the 120-month, or 10-year period under our legislation would only be $58. 
Mr. President, this is possible because under the College Savings Act total payments are only $6,960. This is simply because you have compound interest of 6.5 percent working in your favor, instead of against you, to the tune of $3,580. That totals a whopping difference of $7,440 from Federal loan programs. That is almost half the cost of financing an education through Federal loans.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation which will correct an oversight in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. This legislation will clarify the treatment under the act of beverage alcohol compounds emitted from aging warehouses. 
Under the current statute, EPA classifies beverage alcohol emissions (ethanol) as a volatile organic compound [VOC]. VOC's react in the atmosphere to form ozone. Ethanol, however, has been proven to play an insignificant role in ozone formation because of its low reactivity. 
Despite scientific evidence proving the minimal value of these controls (at exorbitant cost) the EPA has wrongly refused repeated requests regarding removal of restrictions on beverage distillation. If control technology is implemented, this would mean process changes in the historical aging process that makes each beverage unique. 
Aging is arguably one of the most important components of the production process. For example, Bourbon whisky, which is a distinctive product of the United States, and Kentucky, must be aged at least 2 years in wooden barrels according to Federal regulation. This process involves natural oxidation which requires the passage of air and ethanol vapors into and out of the barrels. Any effort to alter this natural aging process through controls on temperature, ventilation patterns, and humidity, could change the actual physical properties of Bourbon whisky, thus altering the distinguishing taste associated with certain brands. 
Mr. President, I agree that we must protect the environment that we all share. However, when extremist, inflexible regulation threatens an entire industry at minimal, if any, environmental return, we must reevaluate our priorities. I urge my colleagues to join me in restoring a little sanity to our regulatory process.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, volunteer service has become a high risk venture. Our `sue happy' legal culture has ensnared those selfless individuals who help worthy organizations and institutions through volunteer service. And, these lawsuits are proof that no good deed goes unpunished. 
In order to relieve volunteers from this unnecessary and unfair burden of liability, I am pleased to join in the introduction of the Volunteer Protection Act. 
The litigation craze is hurting the spirit of voluntarism that is an integral part of American society. From school chaperones to Girl Scout and Boy Scout troop leaders to unpaid rural doctors and nursing home aides, volunteers perform valuable services. And, these volunteers are being dragged into court and needlessly and unfairly sued. The end result? Too many people pointing fingers and too few offering a helping hand. 
So, this bill creates immunity from lawsuits for those volunteers who act within the scope of their responsibilities, who are properly licensed or certified where necessary, and who do not act in a willful, criminal or grossly negligent fashion. 
The bill recognizes that the States may enact their own form of volunteer protection and provides that State laws may permit the following: 
A requirement that the organization or entity adhere to risk management procedures, including the training of volunteers; 
A requirement that the organization or entity be accountable for the actions of its volunteers in the same way that an employer is liable for the acts of its employees; 
An exemption from the liability protection in the event the volunteer is using a motor vehicle or similar instrument; 
An exemption from the liability protection if the lawsuit is brought by a State or local official; and 
A requirement that the liability protection applies only if the nonprofit organization or government entity provides a financially secure source of recovery, such as an insurance policy for those who suffer harm. 
I look forward to the Senate's prompt consideration of this bill. Our communities are depending upon us to enact this pro-volunteer legislation. The time has come for us to help those who have given so much to all of us.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the re-independence of the Republic of Georgia. 
Georgia has a rich cultural heritage spanning over 2,000 years, and recent history provides a remarkable story in the struggle against communism. First annexed by Russia in 1801, Georgia experienced a brief glimpse of independence in 1918 when Georgia relinquished its ancient monarchy for a democratically elected government. In 1921, however, the iron curtain descended on this small, yet proud country, and over the next 70 years suffered terribly under the heavy hand of Soviet communism and its centrally planned economy. Through it all, the Georgian people never gave up their hope or desire for freedom and independence. 
On April 9, 1989, violence erupted in the Georgian capitol of Tbilisi, as Soviet troops swarmed the city and fell on 10,000 peaceful citizens demonstrating for independence. During the ensuing violence, more than 200 people were injured and 19 killed. Some, including women and children, were tragically beaten to death with shovels. This event marked the beginning of the end of Soviet domination. Exactly 2 years later, on April 9, 1991, Georgia officially declared its independence, a day which is remembered as the anniversary on which Georgia's long fight for freedom was again realized. 
Since then, under the leadership of President Eduard Shevardnadze, Georgia has made remarkable strides toward a free market economy and democratic rule of law. A constitution founded on democratic principles and values has been adopted, and free and fair presidential and parliamentary elections were held. A new generation of young, energetic democratic leaders has emerged, led by 34-year-old Zurab Zhvania, Chairman of the Parliament, who I recently met with. On the economic front, Georgia's new currency, the lari, has remained stable since its introduction in 1995. The International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Department of State have praised Georgia's economic initiatives and their significant progress in developing a free-market economy. Several U.S. corporations have already established a presence in Georgia, spurring jobs and economic growth in both nations. 
Mr. President, I encourage everyone to note this historic day, and congratulate Georgia on its extraordinary progress toward democracy and free-market principles.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the University of Kentucky's basketball program has a rich and storied legacy; more wins than any team in college basketball history, six NCAA titles, more appearances in the NCAA tournament than any other program, and 38 Southeastern Conference titles. But, those statistics only begin to tell the tale. Even with all these successes, the 1996-97 edition of the Wildcats will carry a special place in the hearts of Kentucky fans. For the real story behind the UK basketball team is the love affair the fans have with the Big Blue's program. 
It was not so long ago, Mr. President, that even one loss was enough to launch some in the Commonwealth into a fit of pique. So accustomed to winning, some Wildcat fanatics had grown unable to accept an occasional setback. Even worse, many had forgotten how to enjoy the hard-earned victories that talented Kentucky teams continually produced. 
Today there is a new attitude in the bluegrass, Mr. President. An attitude which exults in victories and championships without believing the end of the world is near if their beloved Cats happen to come up short. An attitude derived from the players and coaches themselves. An attitude borne of hard work and the satisfaction brought by the unparalleled success that hard work has produced. 
Never has this been more true than with this year's Kentucky squad. With the odds stacked against the team all year long, the fans were able to revel in a 35-5 season, a Southeastern Conference tournament title and a national runnerup trophy. Not bad for a squad that lost four players to the NBA draft, two starters to injury and returned only one starter from the previous year's national championship team. At times this year, many would agree that the MVP of the team was trainer `Fast' Eddie Jamiel. 
These young men, Coach Rick Pitino, and Athletic Director C.M. Newton deserve special recognition for reminding us all that how you play the game is as important as the final result. Not once during a roller-coaster season did any player or coach complain about the difficulty of the challenges at hand. Excuses are for losers, and there are no losers associated with this Wildcat team of overachievers. 
The Fabulous Five, the Fiddlin' Five, Rupp's Runts, the Unforgettables, the Untouchables, and now the Unbelievables. Other Kentucky teams had more talent but never has a Wildcat group worked as hard. This team had tremendous pride due to the fact that `KENTUCKY' was stitched in bold blue letters across their chests. They took that pride and used it to achieve more than any fan or so-called expert could have hoped for. I join Wildcat faithful across the Nation in saluting this year s gallant effort.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator Bennett of Utah, Senator Thomas and Senator Enzi of Wyoming, and I have been working on a matter that we wish to discuss with our colleagues in the Senate for the next few moments. Senator Thomas needs to leave so he is going to lead off. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Wyoming for his contribution to the matter that we will now proceed to discuss with our colleagues. 
Mr. President, at a time when the country is swept away by March madness--particularly, I notice the occupant of the chair has a fine team in March madness that will probably, no doubt, come in second to Kentucky in the end--and the excitement of competitive college basketball, we are nevertheless reminded of the fundamental unfairness of college football's pseudo playoffs. Specifically, I am talking about the College Bowl Alliance. 
The alliance is a coalition of top college football conferences and top postseason bowls. Over the past few years, the alliance has entered into a series of restrictive agreements to allocate the market of highly lucrative postseason bowls. By engaging in this market allocation, the coalition bowls and the coalition teams have ensured that they will receive tens of millions of dollars, while the remaining teams and bowls are left to divide a much smaller amount. The alliance agreements have the purpose and effect of making the already-strong alliance teams stronger while relegating the remaining teams to a future of, at best, mediocre, second-class status. 
Mr. President, in college football, there can be no Cinderella stories. There can be no unranked, unknown Coppin State going to the playoffs and beating the SEC regular season champion, South Carolina, and going down to the wire with a Big 12 power like Texas. 
A team like Coppin State could never make it to the lucrative college football postseason. You see, a team like that would be excluded because it's not in the College Bowl Alliance and its fans don't travel well. It doesn't even have its own band. 
College football has no room for a Sweet 16 that includes teams like St. Joseph's and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. The opportunity to be in college football's Elite Eight and Final Four is essentially determined before the season begins. 
The basic message, Mr. President, is that--if David wants to slay Goliath--he'd better do it during basketball season. He won't be allowed to play Goliath when the football postseason rolls around. 
College football has no room for the underdog. In fact, as evidenced by the 1997 New Year's bowls, college football doesn't even have room for top-ranked teams--unless those teams are members of the exclusive Bowl Alliance. 
I first raised this issue in 1993 when my alma mater, the University of Louisville, had a 7-1-0 record and a top ranking, but was automatically excluded from the most lucrative New Year's bowls. I contacted the Justice Department and explained that the alliance agreements constituted a group boycott, and, thus, violated the Sherman Act. 
The Justice Department promised to promptly review the matter. 
Shortly thereafter, the College Bowl Alliance entered into a revised agreement whereby the 1997 New Year's bowls would be open to any team in the country with a minimum 
of eight wins or ranked higher than the lowest ranked--alliance--conference champion. 
Despite this pledge, the alliance continued its apparent boycott of nonalliance teams. During the 1996 season, Brigham Young University and the University of Wyoming, both members of the nonalliance Western Athletic Conference [WAC], met the alliance criteria. Wyoming finished the season 10-2 and ranked 22d in the country, while BYU won 13 games and was ranked the fifth best team in the country. 
Neither team, however, was afforded an opportunity to play in the alliance bowls. In fact, BYU's record and ranking was superior to nearly every alliance team, including four of the six teams who participated in the high-visibility, high-payout alliance bowls. 
Mr. President, this issue is about more than football, apple pie, and alma mater. This is about basic fairness and open competition. This is about a few conferences and a few bowls dividing up a huge multimillion-dollar pie among themselves. 
In 1997, the eight participants in the alliance bowls, including the Rose Bowl participants shared an estimated pot of $68 million while the 28 nonalliance bowl participants were left to divide approximately $34 million. In short, the market has been divided such that eight teams rake in 70 percent of the postseason millions, while 28 teams get nothing more than the leftover 30 percent. 
This chart may have printing that is too small for the camera to pick up, but it illustrates the nature of the problem. 
The Alliance bowls--Fiesta, Sugar, Orange, and Rose--totaled $68.2 million. That is eight teams that benefited from the $68.2 million. The nonalliance bowls--and here is a whole list of them--collectively shared $34 million. Clearly, most of these teams never had an opportunity, no matter how good they were, to participate in the New Years Day payout bowls. Therein lies the antitrust problem, a clear antitrust problem I might say. 
These short-term millions lead to long-term benefits for the alliance conferences. Guaranteed appearances in high-visibility bowls directly translate to: more loyal fans, more generous alumni, and much more willing athletic recruits. 
If you don't believe it's easier for alliance teams to recruit, just pick up the phone and call the coach at an independent school like Central Florida, or the coach at the University of Louisville or BYU. These coaches will tell you time after time that the top high school athletes don't want to play for teams that don't have a shot at the top New Year's bowl games. 
Mr. President, in summary, there is substantial evidence that the most powerful conferences and the most powerful bowls have entered into agreements to allocate the postseason bowl market among themselves and to engage in a group boycott of nonalliance teams and bowls. The effect of these agreements is to ensure that the strong get stronger, while the rest get weaker.

Mr. McCONNELL. In closing, I'd like to point out that this effort is much more than just a few Senators cheering for their home teams. The Supreme Court has said it much more clearly than we ever could. So, I quote the Court, which I seem to be doing quite often these days: 
[O]ne of the classic examples of a per se violation of section 1 is an agreement between competitors at the same level of the market structure to allocate territories in order to minimize competition . . . This Court has reiterated time and time again that `horizontal territorial limitations . . . are naked restraints of trade with no purpose except stifling of competition.' 
This fundamental principle of antitrust law should guide the review of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. In the words of the D.C. Circuit, `the hallmark of the [unlawful] `group boycott' is the effort of competitors to `barricade themselves from competition at their own level.' 
Today, we are calling on all interested parties to break the barricade. We are challenging the NCAA, the Bowl Alliance commissioners, and the Alliance bowl committees to take action to bring about genuine competition to college football and the postseason. 
Postseason playoffs can be a reality for college football. It works for college basketball, college baseball, and it works for college football--at the Division I-AA, Division II, and Division III levels. 
They all have a playoff system, all of them except Division I. 
The opportunity to compete in postseason bowls should be based on merit, not membership in an exclusive coalition. 
So, Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague from Utah, Senator Bennett, for his fine work on this issue. And also Senator Enzi for his great work on this. We are hoping for the best. Obviously, the solution to this problem that we would all prefer is for the organizations themselves to solve the problem. But, if they do not, it seems pretty clear to each of us that this is an antitrust case the Justice Department should pursue. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. I am not sure it is a question, but rather an observation. Also, the BYU Cougars, as a result of the Cotton Bowl appearance probably--I don't have the figure in front of me, maybe staff does--probably got about $2.5 million as opposed to the roughly $8 million that would have been available had they been selected, as they obviously should have been selected, for an alliance bowl. We are talking not just about bragging rights here, we are talking about real money. We are talking about a $6 million differential, Mr. President. So this is not just putting a trophy in the school gym. This is a big business with huge economic implications.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today several colleagues and I are introducing the Precision Agriculture Research, Education, and Information Dissemination Act of 1997. 
Earlier this month the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry began a series of hearings on reforming and reauthorizing agricultural research programs. It is our desire that as we move through this process this legislation will become part of the research reauthorization that is signed into law. 
This legislation emphasizes research on precision agriculture technologies. These technologies are very exciting and will enable the United States to maintain and augment our competitive edge in global agricultural markets. The legislation amends the Competitive, Special and Facilities Research Grant Act of 1965 by modifying the National Research Initiative [NRI] to give the Secretary of Agriculture authority to provide research, extension, and education competitive grants and programs that emphasize precision agriculture technologies and management practices. 
This legislation represents a compromise between various interests. The bill is supported by The Fertilizer Institute, National Center for Resources Innovations, Experiment Station and Extension Service Directors, Lockheed Martin, and a consortium of other high technology companies. 
An identical bill H.R. 725 was introduced by Congressman Lewis and Congressman Crapo on February 12, 1997. 
Precision agriculture technologies are rapidly advancing, and it is crucial that the agricultural research community invest in this field of research so that all farmers will be able to benefit. This bill will not only increase the investment in precision agriculture, but it will also emphasize an educational process that will assist all farmers in adopting precision agriculture technologies and applications. 
Emerging technologies in production agriculture are changing and improving the way farmers produce food and fiber in this country. New technologies such as global positioning satellites field mapping, geo-reference information systems, grid soil sampling, variable rate seeding and input applications, portable electronic pest scouting, on-the-go yield monitoring, and computerized field history and record keeping are just a few of the next generation technological tools in use today. 
Today, these technologies can map these variables and data instantaneously as an applicator or combine drives across the field. In short, each farm field using precision technology becomes a research pilot. And in the down months or winter 
season a farmer can collect the data from the previous growing season and adjust dozens of important agronomic variables to maximize the efficient use of all the farmers inputs: time, fuel, commercial inputs, seed rate, irrigation--the list goes on and on. 
These precision farming tools are already proving to help farmers increase field productivity, improve input efficiency, protect the environment, maximize farm profitability, and create computerized field histories that may help increase land values. Collectively, these and other emerging technologies are being used in an integrated, site-specific systems approach called `Precision Agriculture.' Progressive and production minded farmers are already using these technologies. In a decade they may be as commonplace on the farm as air-conditioned tractor cabs and power steering. 
Precision farming seems to offer great promise for improving production performance. Inherently, it sounds very appealing to be able to evaluate production conditions on an individual square foot, yard, or acre basis rather than that of a whole field. It would seem that we should be able to treat any situation more appropriately the smaller the plot we are considering. There have been great strides in predicting productivity on the basis of smaller and smaller units on the ground than we have ever realistically envisioned in the past, measuring yields as we harvest, being able to collect soil samples on a very small pilot basis and prescribe corrective measures on the go. All of these things are possible. They are being done on an experimental basis in many locations. Some producers have adopted the new technology and are using it. 
Precision farming is, in its simplest form, a management system for crop production that uses site-specific data to maximize yields and more efficiently use inputs. The technology is quickly gaining acceptance and use by producers, farm suppliers, crop consultants, and custom applicators. 
Precision farming links the data-management abilities of computers with sophisticated farm equipment that can vary applications rates and monitor yields throughout a field. 
Mr. President, the capabilities of precision agriculture technologies are rapidly increasing. The economic and environmental benefits of these technologies have not been fully realized. Increasing the use of these technologies and development of complementary new technologies will benefit American agriculture, the U.S. economy and both domestic and global environmental concerns. In Kentucky this type of research can help producers increase their yield while protecting environmental concerns such as water quality. I believe these new high-technology tools can make agriculture better by boosting production, environmental quality and profits.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Utah for his wonderful contribution to this debate we have had. It has been a good debate about the first amendment. I also thank him very much for his kind remarks about my work on this issue. 
The Senator from Utah is right. It hasn't been easy from time to time because, as he pointed out, our friends in the press sometimes think the first amendment only applies to them. The first amendment was not crafted just for the press. It was crafted for all Americans. The free speech provisions of the first amendment apply to individuals, candidates, parties, groups; it applies to all of these people. 
What we have before us today, Mr. President, is an effort to cut a chunk out of the first amendment and say that political discourse in this country is entitled to less freedom than all other kinds of speech, all other kinds of speech. Why, Mr. President, even pornography and flag burning would have more protection--more protection--than political discourse after this amendment. Because this amendment would grant to Congress the power to shut everybody up, Congress being composed of incumbents, it is reasonable to assume that Congress would want to shut up all those people who are criticizing Congress. 
This amendment gives Congress the power to set reasonable limits--whatever that is--on expenditures made, presumably, by the candidates, in support of--by people outside the campaigns--in support of the candidate, or in opposition to the candidate, and the American Civil Liberties Union said it could apply to the press as well. 
In short, this is a complete reversal of the kind of speech the Founding Fathers were the most concerned about. Mr. President, I am confident they were most concerned about political discourse, political discussion, political speech. They were beginning to have experiences with free press at that time. But I am confident that what they were mostly thinking about, when crafting the first amendment, was political discourse in the course of political campaigns. 
So the question is, as the Senator from Utah and others have pointed out, it is not whether you are for reform, but whether you are for the first amendment. That is what is before us here today. This ought to be a no- 
brainer. Even Common Cause is against this proposal. Even the Washington Post is against this proposal. Even Senator McCain and Senator Feingold, I believe, are going to oppose this. 
In short, this proposal doesn't have any constituency. Even the reform groups are not for it. Of course, it has many opponents. There is a coalition--in fact, I had a press conference with a coalition just Friday in opposition not only to this amendment, but also to McCain-Feingold. The coalition spans the American political spectrum. At this press conference Friday, we had the ACLU and the National Education Association on the left, and the Christian Coalition, Right to Life, and the NRA on the right, and all other groups in between. What did they all have in common? These people had never met each other before. They didn't want the Government shutting them up. They didn't want the Government taking them off the playing field in political discussion in this country. That is what they all had in common. They want to be free to criticize us. They think they have a constitutional right to do that. They believe this amendment begins to eliminate that right, and proposals like McCain-Feingold do the same. 
So, Mr. President, this is a very, very important issue. This vote will be about whether you support the first amendment or not, whether you support political free speech in this country, not just by candidates, but by groups, individuals, and parties as well. This is at the core of our democracy, and we are having a legitimate discussion here about whether to carve that out and change that after 210 years. 
Mr. President, this is a very, very significant step in the wrong direction. I hope that it will be defeated later this afternoon overwhelmingly. It deserves to be defeated overwhelmingly. The goal here is to reverse the Buckley decision, a well-thought-out, well-reasoned decision. 
In the Buckley case, the Supreme Court said, `The first amendment denies Government'--that is us in here--`the Government the power to determine that spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, excessive, or unwise.' 
The Court went on, `In a free society ordained by our Constitution, it is not the Government but the people, individually as citizens, candidates, and collectively as associations and political committees, who must retain control over the quantity'--how much we speak--`and the range of debate on public issues in a political campaign.' 
That pretty well says it all, Mr. President. At least Senator Hollings, my good friend from South Carolina, understands that in order to change that ruling you really do have to change the first amendment. That is what is before us--to change the first amendment for the first time in 200 years to give the Government the power to shut up individuals, candidates, associations, and political committees; tell them how much they may speak, and maybe even what they may say. Who is to say how far the Government would go in seeking to quiet the voices of those who may oppose what we are trying to do? 
The Court went on. It said, `A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reach. This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the expenditure of money.' 
The Court was recognizing the obvious, recognizing reality. The Court went on. It said, `Even distribution of the humblest handbill costs money.' Further, the Court stated, `The electorate's increasing dependence on television and radio for news and information makes these `expenditures' of modes of communication indispensable instruments of effective political speech.' 
The Court further said, `There is nothing invidious, improper, or unhealthy in a campaign spending money to communicate.' Further, the Court said, `The mere growth in the cost of Federal election campaigns in and of itself provides no basis'--they didn't equivocate here, Mr. President--`provides no basis for government restrictions on the quantity of campaign spending.' The Court further addressed the old level-playing-field argument that we hear so frequently. The Court said about the level playing field, `The concept that the government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the first amendment.' 
The Buckley case was good in 1976, and it is good in 1997. In fact, the Supreme Court in virtually every case in this field since 1976, since the Buckley case, has moved further in the direction of more and more openness in political discourse in this country. In other words, they have reaffirmed Buckley time and time again over the last 20 years. This is a position the Court isn't going to change. And the Senator from South Carolina, to his credit, understands that. He understands the Court is not going to shut up these individuals, groups, candidates, and parties. He understands the Court realizes that this kind of debate is at the heart of what makes America a great democracy. 
The Senator from South Carolina looks at that and finds it unappetizing. He finds all of this political discourse offensive and says we ought to carve a chunk out of the first amendment for the first time in 210 years and give to us here in the Government the power to control all of this discourse. It makes us uncomfortable. We don't like being criticized. We certainly do not like these campaigns against us by our opponents. But we don't like these outside groups either. It makes us uncomfortable. They sometimes say bad things about us. This is a terrible condition, that anybody other than the press could actually muster the resources to criticize. We had better do something about it. We had better shut those folks up. So we will just amend the first amendment, and we will decide that political speech is somehow less worthy than other kinds of speech, and we will take those people off the playing field, or we will make them report to the Government in advance and salute before they get permission to speak. 
That is what this is about, Mr. President. That is what this is about. This constitutional amendment ought to be defeated resoundingly. It is certainly my hope that it will be. As I said earlier, it has essentially no constituency even among those clamoring the loudest for some form of campaign finance reform. 
So later this afternoon when we vote on amending the first amendment for the first time in 200 years, I hope the Senate will defeat it overwhelmingly.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my good friend from Connecticut acknowledged that there were no groups agitating for a constitutional amendment but the unorganized mass of people were. 
Well, America is a seething cauldron of special interests. We all belong to one group or another, many of which have legitimate issues before the Government. And, of course, we do not think the group we belong to is a special interest. That is the other guy's group that is trying to do something I do not like. But the fact is, the Founders of this country envisioned that we would be a seething cauldron of interest groups all banding together to petition the Government, which is another part of the first amendment. These people do not want to be pushed off the playing field. They do not want to be pushed off the playing field. They think that their involvement in issues is important. They think it helps create a better America. They do not view themselves as pursuing some evil goal. After all, who is it that is going to have the wisdom to sort of sanitize America of all these special interests and who are we to be so arrogant as to preach to these groups that their interests are somehow evil. Who is not suspect? Whose interests are above reproach? 
This amendment says we get to determine that right in here; we, the Government, get to decide what is reasonable speech. And you know what we will do, Mr. President. We will shut up all the people who are criticizing us. We will pull them off the playing field altogether. We will set a spending limit so low that all of us are guaranteed to be reelected. We will control the game all right. 
This is a preposterous suggestion, with all due respect to those who will vote for it. It guts the first amendment. It takes citizens off the playing field and out of the process. This is exactly the wrong thing to do.

Mr. McCONNELL. I referred earlier to a press conference that I happened to have had Friday with various groups opposed to this amendment and also opposed to McCain-Feingold. The press conference was really about both. Among the groups organized in opposition: the National Taxpayers Union, the National Right to Life Committee, the National Rifle Association, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Christian Coalition, the Direct Marketing Association, the National Association of Broadcasters, the National Assocation of Business PAC's, the National Education Association, the National Association of Realtors. 
All of these groups, which represent over 15 million American citizens, are saying in effect to the Congress, do not amend the first amendment for the first time in 200 years. Do not pass a measure like McCain-Feingold. Do not shut us up. We are not part of the problem. We are busily at work expressing our point of view, arguing for the causes that we think are important. This is totally American. This is the essence of America. 
And so those groups came together last Friday in an effort to express themselves about this proposal to amend the first amendment and also McCain-Feingold. I think one of the most interesting speakers was from an organization with which I am seldom aligned, the National Education Association. Don Morabito, who is from the NEA, was at the press conference, and he said, `The fact is,' referring to the groups in the room, `We don't represent the same people, don't contribute to the same candidates and don't believe in the same things,' with one exception. We agree on the first amendment. We agree on the first amendment. 
The ACLU, in referring to the proposal before us, said the constitutional amendment is `truly an abhorrent proposal,' with `breathtaking implications, and McCain-Feingold is draconian regulation.' `And if you want to talk `unseemly,' added ACLU Washington director Laura Murphy, what about the current reform proposal's efforts to `demonize' special interests and political action committees that follow the law?' 
So I think it is important to remember what the current feeding frenzy is all about. We all thought it was about illegal, illegal activity, and there seems to have been a good deal of that particularly at the White House and in the Democratic campaign for President last year, but now the effort is to switch, change the subject and to pass either a constitutional amendment or some legislation to take American citizens out of the game.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I listened with considerable interest to the observations of my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, about the, as he put it, ill-advised Buckley decision. 
Let me say, Mr. President, I think the Buckley decision was an outstanding decision. Obviously, the Supreme Court feels it was because they have had a number of opportunities in the last 20 years to revisit it, refine it, cut it back, restrict it, and in each instance they have expanded it further in the direction of more and more freedom to speak in the political process in this country. 
The essence of the Buckley decision was in several passages that bear repeating as we move here toward the vote on this constitutional amendment to, in effect, overturn the Buckley case. The Court said with regard to spending limits, `The first amendment denies Government the power to determine that spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, excessive, or unwise. In a free society ordained by our Constitution, it is not the Government,' said the Court, `not the Government, but the people individually as citizens and candidates, and collectively as associations and political committees who must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on public issues in a political campaign.' 
Now, Mr. President, that really sums it up here. Who will control the political discourse? The Court had that issue directly before it in the Buckley case, and the Court said the Government is not going to control political speech in this country consistent with the first amendment. 
Now, Senator Hollings understands that, and he is offering this constitutional amendment to allow the Government to control political discourse for the first time in the history of our country. It leads you to ask the question: Who will feel more comfortable if we, the Congress, are in charge of regulating and controlling political speech in this country? Well, I do not think our citizens will feel more comfortable with that. That is clearly the end result of this debate, because this amendment says, in effect, the Buckley case will be overridden so that the amount of expenditures that may be made by, that is, by the campaigns, in support of the campaigns or in opposition to the campaigns shall be regulated by the Government. 
All of us in here will have the last word on just how much speech is allowed, not only the quantity of it but the range of it. 
Now, the Buckley case went on to say that a restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily, Mr. President, reduces the quantity of expression. So what we have after this amendment is the Government with the power to control how much we get to speak. 
The Court said: `* * * reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.' That pretty well says it all. Under the Hollings amendment, the Government will be able to decide how much we get to speak, how big an audience we get to reach. In short, the Government would control political discourse in this country. The Court went on to say that `this is because'--referring to their opposition to spending restrictions--`virtually every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society requires expenditure of money.' It is a fact, whether we like it or not, to the extent that the Government defines what your financial outlays can be, if you are a candidate or if you are a group in support of or in opposition to a candidate, the Government is saying, in effect, you only get so much speech, a rationing of speech. And we here in the Congress get to determine how much everybody talks. 
I don't think it is much of a reach to suggest that we are going to want to shut down those who criticize us. We don't like these independent expenditures in particular. We certainly don't like what our opponents are saying about us. So what we would do in the aftermath of the Hollings amendment is shut those people up. We would probably--in terms of independent groups--shut them entirely up. In terms of our opponents, we would set the spending limit so low they would not have a chance and never will be able to get the message across, because virtually every incumbent starts off ahead, and if the other fellow can't get resources, he is going to stay ahead. 
The Court went on to say, in Buckley, `Even distribution of the humblest handbill costs money.' Further, the Court stated, `The electorate's increasing dependence on television and radio for news and information makes these expensive modes of communication indispensable elements of effective political speech.' Indispensable elements of effective political speech. 
Now, the Buckley case was right on the mark. They understood what it takes to speak in today's modern American society. It is not a question of whether we like it or not. This is a fact. It is as certain as the Sun is going to come up tomorrow. It is as certain as the Sun is going to come up tomorrow. Without the resources to market the message in this society, your speech is quieted--under the Hollings amendment quieted by the Government, which will control your discourse. 
The Court in the Buckley case further said, `There is nothing invidious, improper, or unhealthy in a campaign spending money to communicate.' There is nothing unhealthy about that. Nothing is inherently unhealthy about that. With regard to the growth in campaign spending, which was anticipated in 1976 and certainly has occurred, the Court said, `The mere growth in the cost of Federal election campaigns in and of itself provides no basis for Government restrictions on the quantity of campaign spending.' 
In other words, the Court was saying a lot of speaking is not bad, and an effort to try to restrict the amount of speaking to some Government-prescribed formula is a clear violation of the first amendment, which is why we are now voting on the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina to give the Government the power to control political discourse in this country. 
The Court also addressed the issue of the level playing field. We often hear that. Proponents of bills, for example, like McCain-Feingold, say they want to `level the playing field.' This is what Buckley had to say about leveling the playing field. The Court said, `The concept that Government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the first amendment.' In other 
words, the notion that the Government is wise enough to level the playing field is abhorrent to the first amendment. 
After all, if you think about it, it would be impossible to level the playing field. How is the playing field leveled if you only leveled the amount of money? I would say that in my State of Kentucky, in order to have a remotely level playing field, you would have to get 600,000 people to change their registration and two major newspapers to leave the State. Then you might have, in some ways, a level playing field. Then, of course, what happens when your opponent is famous, maybe a well-known athlete or a war hero, or somebody who has a special place in the hearts of the American people? How is the playing field leveled then? The Government has prescribed how much you can speak in the campaign. Your opponent starts off 5 yards from scoring a touchdown, and you're way back on your own 20, and the Government says this is how much you get to communicate with the constituents. In what way is that a level playing field? In fact, the Court rejected out of hand the level playing field argument. 
So the Buckley decision was a sound decision. The Supreme Court believes it is a sound decision. They have reinforced it time and time again over the last 20 years. This amendment basically has no constituency. Common Cause, the principal group supporting various kinds of campaign finance reform, opposes the Hollings amendment. The American Civil Liberties Union opposes the constitutional amendment. Even our dear colleague, Senator McCain, who differs with me on this issue, opposes this amendment. This is an amendment without a constituency. The Washington Post, who is certainly interested in its version of campaign finance reform, opposes this amendment. 
In short, Mr. President, regardless of how you may feel about which kind of campaign finance reform might be appropriate, amending the first amendment for the first time in 200 years to give the Government the power to control the political discourse in this country by individuals, groups, candidates, and parties is a substantial overreaching and a dangerous step in the wrong direction. I think it could probably be argued persuasively that this is the kind of speech that the Framers of our Constitution had most in mind when they were writing the first amendment. They were just beginning the process of having elections and dealing with the issue of campaigning. Certainly at the heart of what they had in mind when they talked about free speech was free political speech. 
After this amendment, pornography and flag burning would have more protection under the first amendment than political discourse. Political discourse would be singled out among all the other kinds of expression that we are free to engage in in this country under the first amendment; political discourse would be singled out and handed over to Government control. Mr. President, this is clearly a step we should not take. I hope the amendment will be substantially defeated.  
Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, just a couple of observations about the vote just completed. 
The constitutional amendment to strip political speech out of the first amendment and give the Government the power to control said speech was just defeated 61 to 38. We have had previous votes on the Hollings amendment in other years. 
I would just like to mention for the benefit of my colleagues this is the biggest vote against the Hollings amendment yet achieved in the Senate. The opponents of this amendment included all but 4 Republicans and 11 Democrats. So I think it was a very encouraging indication of growing support for protecting the first amendment. 
I want to thank my colleagues for this overwhelming vote against the amendment. Also I thank Tamara Somerville and Lani Gerst for their continuing good work on this issue. They are both members of my staff. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. McCONNELL. There certainly are, I say to my friend from New Mexico. There are periodic meetings in my office with a coalition in defense of the first amendment that includes a set of groups that have never met each other before. On the left, the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Education Association; on the right, Right to Life, Christian Coalition, and all shades of philosophies in between, all of whom have one thing in common--they do not want Congress to push them out, do not want them to push them off the playing field and keep them from participating in American elections. 
So this coalition is very active. You would think, listening to the broadcast media and reading the Washington Post, that there was nobody on the other side of this debate, that Common Cause was the only conscience out there pressing for these kinds of reforms. Ironically, Common Cause is against the Hollings constitutional amendment as well. But there is a broad coalition, I would say to my friend from New Mexico. They are very active, very involved, and do not intend to be taken off the playing field.

Mr. McCONNELL. What they say is they believe the Supreme Court was correct when it said they had a right to support or oppose whomever they choose in the American political system. They know that if Congress is given the power, either through a constitutional amendment or through a measure such as McCain-Feingold, their voices will be quieted, their ability to participate will be capped, limited. They are quite concerned about that and feel that this is not a step in the right direction, that in fact it is the worst possible thing you can do. If you look out at America, we are a seething cauldron of interests. The Founding Fathers envisioned that. The Supreme Court has made it clear that all those interests have an opportunity, a right, a constitutional right to participate in the American political system, and these groups don't want to be pushed out. They think their causes are important. They want to be able to advocate them. They want to be able to support whomever they choose.

Mr. McCONNELL. That is absolutely the case, I say to my friend from New Mexico. They fear that a Congress, that a future Congress, will try to quiet their voices, to push them out of the process, to make it impossible for them to support candidates of their choice. We know that there are schemes around to do that. There is a bill that we will be debating this year absolutely designed to put a limit on how many people can participate. So their fear is well-founded, I say to my friend from New Mexico.

Mr. McCONNELL. There is a bill we will be discussing later this year called McCain-Feingold, which seeks, in this Senator's judgment, to essentially shut down legislative-advocacy-type independent expressions and to make almost impossible the ability of outside groups to engage in independent expenditures. 
My question to my friend from Washington is, given the fact that we have bills that go that far now, given this authority under this constitutional amendment to set `reasonable limits,' is it not possible that Congress might decide such expenditures should be shut down entirely, that there is nothing reasonable about them, and that those voices should be quieted altogether?

Mr. McCONNELL. Since the Congress composed entirely of incumbents has the power to determine what is a reasonable limit directly on campaigns, would it not be entirely conceivable, I ask my friend from Washington, in the very near future, if not in the very same Congress, after this became part of the Constitution, that these incumbents might seek to limit spending in campaigns directly by the candidates themselves standing for reelection and a challenger, quite dramatically? 
Most incumbents start out with a pretty substantial lead unless they are running against a famous athlete, a movie star, or sitting Governor. It has often been described as the incumbent looking at it as a football field, and the incumbent at the beginning of the campaign is at the 40-yard line and sprinting toward the goalline; the challenger is back on the 5-yard line with 95 yards to go. Might not this Congress composed entirely of incumbents decide to set a spending limit of, say, $50,000 per House of Representatives race and declare that reasonable?

Mr. McCONNELL. Before the Senator from Alabama leaves the floor, I want to commend him for his statesmanship when he made the observation that our first inclination after a campaign is to think, boy, I would sure like to have shut up those people who were out there trying to beat me; wouldn't it have been easy if I could have just quieted those voices who were against what I was trying to do? 
But as the Senator from Alabama has pointed out so well, America is a seething cauldron of voices, either individually or in groups who take an interest in the future of this country and try to sway our free elections one way or the other. 
That is exactly what the founders of this country envisioned. And so what the amendment before us seeks to do is to take a big hunk out of the first amendment, which when it was passed over 200 years ago was almost entirely about political speech, and say that the Government now has the power to control how much not only we get to speak in our own campaigns but the Senator from Alabama knows, because he was referring to this amendment, not just the campaign that we are conducting against our opponent but this says in addition Congress may set reasonable limits on those in support of us or in opposition to us. 
Given all the discussion that we have observed here in the last few months about the expressions of outside groups, whether it was through legislative activity or independent expenditures, I would just ask my friend from Alabama, does he not think it is conceivable that Congress might decide that kind of speech is unreasonable and eliminate it entirely in this environment?

Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Alabama. 
The only other point I will make, now that he is an incumbent, like the Senator from Kentucky, and since all of us incumbents would get to decide what is reasonable, is it not, I ask my friend from Alabama, conceivable to think that Congress might decide it was reasonable to shut up all the outside groups and have such a low spending ceiling that a challenger to us could never get off the ground? All in the name of getting that nasty money out of the system; we want to get rid of that, want to control all that spending, stop the money chase. We could all stand up here in a chorus of 100 of us and say we are going to stop the money chase. Each of us here are going to set the spending limit in our respective States exactly where we think it is reasonable. 
The Senators from Alabama would set the spending limit in Alabama, the Senators from Kentucky would set the spending limit in Kentucky, and the Senators from Idaho would set the spending limit in Idaho. I bet you we would all come up with just the right amount to make sure that nobody had a shot at us. I mean nobody. We would make sure the groups could not talk at all. We would make sure our opponent could not talk much. And, of course, under this, you could tell somebody they could not spend their own money to express themselves, the difficulty with which the Senator from Alabama was confronted in the primary. We could shut them all up under this. This in the name of healthy democracy? 
The Democratic leader of the House--I just happened to have it posted. I do not want to detain the Senator from Alabama, but several people have mentioned this. I just wanted those who might be viewing to see it. The Democratic leader in the House, in support of an amendment like this, said, with a straight face, apparently--apparently with a straight face: 
What we have is two important values in direct conflict: Freedom of speech [on the one hand] and our desire for healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy. You cannot have both. 
I am told he did not snicker when he said that. Everyone who heard it broke out laughing. This is one of the most astonishing comments in the history of American politics, made in behalf of a constitutional amendment, similar to the one before us today, to carve a niche out of the first amendment and give the Government, us, the Congress, the power to shut everybody up. That is what is before us today. This is about free speech. It is about political discourse in this country. 
I thank the distinguished Senator from Alabama for a very important contribution to this most important debate.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to express my concern with the Department of Energy's handling of the appliance energy efficiency standards regulations. My concerns regarding this matter are well known. In the last Congress, I authored an amendment to impose a 1-year moratorium on new DOE appliance standards rulemaking activities. That action became necessary because it was clear that DOE's energy efficiency standards program was placing jobs and investment in the manufacturing industry at risk, not just in Kentucky, but in other States around the Nation. 
DOE's response to the moratorium was an interpretive rule that was designed to institutionalize a variety of reforms. While I commend DOE for identifying and correcting their own shortcomings, DOE's first test is before us now in the form of new energy efficiency standards for refrigerators. In my estimation, DOE deserves a failing grade. 
I have raised the refrigerator standards issue with Secretary PenAE6a during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy Committee, but I have not received a satisfactory answer to my questions. While I realize Secretary PenAE6a did not create this controversy, Congress will hold Secretary PenAE6a responsible for the outcome and the consequences of this rulemaking. 
Mr. President, I am disturbed by the fact that DOE has changed its position outlined in the August 1996, notice of proposed rulemaking, which established a 2003 standard as its preferred option. This option was supported by manufacturers. DOE has since changed its position and now supports implementing the new standards for refrigerators in the year 2000. As a result of this flip-flop, manufacturers will be required to make costly investments twice--once to comply with the DOE energy standards in 2000, and again when regulations mandate the elimination of HCFC insulation as required in the year 2003. 
Mr. President, it is important to note that these burdensome and duplicative regulations are not necessary. Once it was determined that DOE was not going to abide by its preferred option, manufacturers offered a good-faith compromise that would set a more stringent level of energy savings than proposed by DOE to be implemented in 2003. This proposal would save more energy while minimizing the reengineering and regulatory burden, which will add unnecessary costs to manufacturers and consumers. 
What is more disturbing is that DOE has ignored its own contractor's analysis in setting these standards. I am informed that the analysis by Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories confirms that the energy savings attributable to the 2003 standard would exceed the benefits of the 2000 standards. Unfortunately, DOE has chosen to ignore this analysis and not include it in establishing these standards. 
Mr. President, this is not the only procedural defect in DOE's proposed rule. The Department has failed to comply with the requirements of law regarding the Department of Justice's role in this rulemaking. DOE has failed to obtain an updated competitive impact determination from the Department of Justice that takes into account new evidence of the potential impact of the proposed rule. I believe such analysis is essential to maintaining a competitive marketplace. 
Mr. President, considering the latest analysis by DOE's own contractor, it has become apparent to me that this battle is no longer about securing the greatest energy savings. Rather, it seems this is about punishing manufacturers more than a legitimate or responsible basis for regulation. The only regulation that makes sense is one that takes effect in 2003. 
This controversy raises fundamental questions about whether DOE will faithfully administer the appliance standards program as currently authorized. I will continue to follow this matter very closely and keep my legislative option open. 
I urge Secretary PenAE6a to assume responsibility for assuring that the law is properly applied and the correct decision reached.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is a very important debate, which I always enjoy with my distinguished colleague from South Carolina, who fully admits that the various campaign finance reform bills we have tried to pass here in the last few years are unconstitutional. He is right, and I commend him for his observation. 
That having been stated, clearly, the only way you can do the kinds of reform bills that have been proposed around here in the last 10 years is to amend the Constitution--amend the first amendment for the first time in history, to give the Government the power to control the speech of individuals, groups, candidates, and parties. The American Civil Liberties Union calls that a recipe for repression. It clearly is, and I am happy today that we are finally having the debate on this amendment, which is indeed a recipe for repression. 
I see my good friend, the Senator from Kansas, here, who is anxious to speak on this. I yield to the Senator from Kansas.

Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Kansas, in looking at the Hollings amendment, in addition to giving to the Government the power to control the speech of candidates, as we just discussed in our earlier colloquy, which could be, presumably, $5,000, which would certainly guarantee the election of every incumbent, I would also ask my good friend how he would interpret the following power given to the Government. It says the Government could limit the amount of expenditures that may be made `by'--I assume that is the candidate--`in support of the candidate, or in opposition to the candidate.' 
Now, let me ask my good friend from Kansas, since we would be making the rules here in Congress, and since we would be given the permission to make these rules since this is an amendment to the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States for the first time in history, I ask my good friend from Kansas, might it not be a shrewd move on the part of all incumbents to say that those in support of or in opposition to a candidate cannot speak at all?

Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Kansas, most of us in the political arena do not like independent expenditures. But the court has made it quite clear that it is constitutionally protected speech. No matter how much we do not like it when people criticize us, these individuals and groups have a constitutional 
right to engage in these independent expenditures. As a result of the Colorado case, parties do as well. 
In looking at the Hollings amendment, it seems to me that Congress would be given the power to completely shut up these groups. They could say, `No longer can you speak at all.' That way, we would be able to silence all of these people who do not like what we stand for, totally--totally--under this. If Congress is given the power to control the amount of expenditures that may be made `by'--I assume that is the candidate--`in support of,' referring to outside groups, or `in opposition to,' referring to outside groups, why, by golly, under this amendment we could shut them up entirely. Our lives would be a lot easier. We could just limit spending in the campaign to about $5,000, eliminate all the speech of these outside groups. Boy, you would never have any turnover here, would you?

Mr. McCONNELL. If I may say to my friend, I often say the FEC would soon be the size of the rest of the administration. There would be battalions of auditors and lawyers crawling all over the books, not just of candidates for public office but every organized group out in America seeking to express itself in the course of the campaign. They would be crawling all over them. Let some little group in Kansas utter a peep in the next race against Senator Roberts, and the FEC could come down on them like a house of bricks saying, `Shut up. Congress has said you don't get to speak. You don't get to say how you feel in the election--or any other time. Shut up.' 
All of that is possible under this amendment, to amend the first amendment for the first time in history, to give this Congress the power to quiet the voices; quiet the voices, not just of Members of Congress and the people who may oppose them, but anybody else who may oppose it, any individual, any group, anybody. We could shut them all up. And in what way would America be better for that?

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, once again I thank the distinguished Senator from Kansas for an outstanding speech. I appreciate his contribution to this debate. 
The question before us, as I have said, as we all know, is whether to amend the first amendment for the first time in history to give to the Government the power to control the political discourse in this country across the board; the political speech of candidates, political speech of individuals, the political speech of groups--all of this, because we have concluded that there is too much political discourse in this country. 
Senator Roberts mentioned, and others are familiar with, some of the statistics. Of all the commercials run in the previous year, 1 percent of them were about politics; 1 percent of them. The notion that we have an excessive amount of political discussion in this country is absurd on its face. It is absurd on its face. 
The good thing about the debate that we are having is it is an honest debate. The Hollings amendment concedes that there is very little you can do, consistent with the first amendment, in the campaign finance reform field that the Supreme Court will not strike down. The measure most commonly referred to by the reformers, the McCain-Feingold proposal, is unconstitutional at least 12 different ways. It would be dead on arrival in the Federal courts. At least this debate helps sum up what is really needed if Senators believe that there is too much political discussion in our country. 
It should not be surprising, Mr. President, that this amendment has almost no constituents. Common Cause, the group most often thought of when you think of the subject of campaign finance reform, opposes this constitutional amendment. The Washington Post, which writes a story on these kinds of issues virtually daily, opposes this amendment. The New York Times opposes this amendment. The American Civil Liberties Union opposes this amendment. 
In short, even the proponents of some kind of effort to restrict the speech of people who are involved in the American political process look at this particular effort to carve a big hunk out of the first amendment for the first time in history as an overreaching and ill-advised step in the wrong direction.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the question before us, the resolution by the junior Senator from South Carolina to amend the Constitution, grounds the campaign finance debate right where it needs to be and where it is, in the first amendment. That is where this debate should be centered. Lest anyone outside of the Senate construe this as an endorsement, I hasten to clarify that I regard this proposal as totally abhorrent. However, this is a debate we needed to have. This is an important discussion which clarifies that the campaign finance issue is really about political speech and about participation in our democracy. That is what this is about. That is the whole discussion. 
In an effort to pave the way for restrictive legislation, such as the McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill, the amendment before us would amend the Constitution to grant Congress and the States the power to `set reasonable limits on the amount of contributions that may be accepted by, and the amount of expenditures that may be made by, or in support of, or in opposition to, a candidate.' 
When Senator Roberts was here a few minutes ago, we talked about just what that means. Clearly, this amendment would give incumbent Members of Congress the ability to make it impossible to lose, short of some commission of a felony or some outrageous act on the part of an incumbent that brought total disfavor upon his or her head in their constituency. It would give to the Congress the power to totally mug, muzzle, shut up critics out in our constituencies who may have organized together. In fact, about the only group it leaves untouched are our friends in the gallery, the press, who would have enhanced power as a result of an effort to shut up everybody else. If you are going to go down this route, some would even advocate telling the press how much they can criticize us. 
While we are messing with the first amendment, if we wanted to make it totally impossible for us to be defeated, why not, in addition to shutting up our challengers in the next election and muzzling all of the groups outside that may or may not like what we do, let's just go on and trash some of the rest of the first amendment. We can get rid of those nasty editorials that all of us despise, put some restrictions on those pesky little reporters who tend to point out our shortcomings, as they see them. 
In short, there is no end to how much of this speech we could contain if we really wanted to do it. I mean, it is a short step, it seems to me, from amending the first amendment to give the Government the power to shut up its critics in a campaign to giving the Congress the power to shut up its critics in the gallery, and pretty soon, of course, the first amendment doesn't have any resemblance whatsoever to what it has today. 
This amendment that we are debating applies to Federal, State, and local elections. Any future Congress would have a free hand to regulate, restrict, or even prohibit any activity which is perceived by the Government--perceived by the Government--to constitute an expenditure by, in support of, or in opposition to a candidate. 
Mr. President, the words are few; their ramifications are simply stunning. Quite simply, this amendment empowers future Congresses to severely restrict--I would argue eliminate--the universe of political spending/speech which is deemed by Congress or some Government bureaucracy to effect an election. Candidate spending, independent expenditures, even issue 
advocacy by private citizens and groups, all of it could be muzzled under this amendment. 
Senate Joint Resolution 18, which is the amendment before us, is a blank check for a Congress 10, 50, 100 years from now, or maybe tomorrow, the day after this is approved, to gag American citizens, candidates, groups, and parties. They could do it with a Constitution altered by this resolution. And some call this reform. 
Mr. President, maybe some people believe that the 105th Congress or the 106th Congress would not do much damage with the power granted by this resolution, but I ask our friends on the left: Are you confident that some Republican-controlled Congress in the future with a 60-plus majority, with a Republican in the White House, will not seize the occasion to limit political activities by liberal-leaning groups, labor unions, the media, and others? Would you not like the Court to be able to stop such an effort on the grounds that it violated the first amendment? 
My conservative friends, I ask you: Are you not relieved the Supreme Court was able to strike down the draconian restrictions on independent expenditures in campaigns in the 1978 campaign finance law? 
I say to my conservative friends: Are you confident that liberal Democrats would never be in a position to enact into law a regulatory scheme on campaign finance that restricts your ability to communicate while leaving the media and labor unions unfettered and even more powerful than they already are? All of that, Mr. President, would be possible under this amendment. 
No campaign finance bill will pass this or any Congress that was not drafted and amended by people fully cognizant of the partisan implications. That is why it is so important to have the impartial reasoning of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is the backstop. It saves the country from legislative excess, ignorance, and mischief. 
Having said that, it doesn't mean I agree with all the Supreme Court's decisions or I will not scrutinize Supreme Court nominees, but I do recognize that the Court, be it of liberal or conservative leaning--it 
is interesting to note in the Buckley case there were many liberals on the Court at that time. The Court was much more liberal than it is now when the Buckley case was rendered, a very sound decision, which the Court has only expanded in the direction of more permissible speech during the years, including the Colorado case last summer. 
The Court is an essential check on legislative and executive branches. This amendment seeks to take the Court out of the picture where campaign finance is concerned so that those who desire campaign spending limits and restrictions on independent expenditures and issue advocacy will not be inconvenienced, will not be inconvenienced by Court action such as the Buckley decision. 
The Supreme Court got in the way. The Supreme Court got in the way and said you cannot do that, that it is impermissible for the Government to dole out political speech to candidates, individuals, or groups. 
Revolting as the Clinton reelection team's fundraising practices were, or anybody else's, they do not justify restricting the rights of law-abiding American citizens in the future to participate in politics and spend as much as they want on their own campaigns for office. American democracy should not be diminished because a 1996 reelection effort violated current laws and flouted commonsense decency out of a ruthless, ruthless desperation to get reelected or some self-righteousness that their success was essential to the country, that the ends justified even illegal and unethical means. 
Freedom should not be negotiable because one political party or other benefits disproportionately at a given point in time from some form of political speech or participation. Nor should freedom, Mr. President, be dialed back--dialed back--because some level of campaign spending violates somebody's notion of what is proper. The future should not be made to suffer so that some may appear to atone for misdeeds in the present or impose on the country their own view of what is an appropriate level of campaign spending. 
Mr. President, God bless their souls, the Founding Fathers had the wisdom and the courage to construct the Constitution of the United States. Though I have much admiration for my colleagues in this Senate, I do not think we have the collective wisdom to improve upon the first amendment ratified by the States in 1791. 
The amendment says:  
Congress shall make no law [no law] respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. 
The critical part is `abridging the freedom of speech.' That is what the Buckley case is about. And that is what this amendment seeks to revise. 
Mr. President, reflecting upon the formulation of the Constitution, De Tocqueville observed in the 19th century that: 
The course of time always gives birth to different interests, and sanctions different principles, among the same people; and when a general constitution is to be established, these interests and principles are so many natural obstacles to the rigorous application of any political system with all its consequences. The early stages of national existence are the only periods at which it is possible to make legislation strictly logical; and when we perceive a nation in the enjoyment of this advantage, we should not hastily conclude that it is wise, but only remember that it is young. 
I would contend that our Nation 200 years ago was both young and its leaders wise. I have also considered the environment in which the Founding Fathers toiled, free of the harsh glare of our modern media, unfettered by the influence of present-day polling, and blissfully unacquainted with grassroots lobbying machines. 
Absent those factors, I suspect much in the legislation in this body, most especially campaign finance reform, would have a different outcome. Then again, we did not have to face down the Red Coats, and I am confident that the confluence of greatness which gave us the Constitution would have done so by candlelight or klieg lights. 
The first amendment has served our Nation well for over 200 years. If this Senate will resist the temptation to scale it back, it can serve our descendants for 200 years more. The first amendment's speech protections are a legacy we are extremely fortunate to have inherited. It is the one we most certainly ought to bequeath, in turn, to generations to come. 
The first amendment is America's premier political reform. It is at the heart of the campaign finance debate. This is not just my view. It is the opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court and the American Civil Liberties Union--America's specialists on the first amendment. As the Court stated in the 1976 Buckley case: 
The first amendment denies government the power to determine that spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, excessive or unwise. 
That gets right to the heart of it. The first amendment prohibits the Government from determining `that spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, excessive or unwise.' In other words, when it comes to our political speech, we can be wasteful, we can be excessive and we can be unwise, and it is none of the Government's business. 
In the free society ordained by our Constitution it is not the government but the people--individually as citizens and candidates and collectively as associations and political committees--who must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on public issues in a political campaign. 
So the proponents of this amendment look at that decision and say we need to cut a niche out of the first amendment and hand over to the Government the power to determine what is reasonable speech. In short, they could determine that no speech was reasonable under this amendment. 
The Court has been clear and consistent on campaign finance, stating further in Buckley:  
A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the expenditure of money. 
It just does. The Court observed that even `distribution of the humblest handbill' costs money. Further, the Court stated that the electorate's increasing dependence on television and radio for news and information makes `these expensive modes of communication indispensable [the Court said `indispensable"] instruments of effective political speech.' 
`Indispensable.' Under this amendment there would be nothing to keep the Congress from saying you do not get to use television at all--at all. 
Quite simply, the Government may no more ration the political speech of an American citizen via campaign spending regulations than it can tell the Washington Post how many newspapers it may distribute or how many hours a day CNN may broadcast. Nor can the Government dictate the content of campaign ads, just as it cannot control the content of television news programs. 
Mr. President, there is no reason sufficient to justify, in the eyes of the Court, campaign spending limits. Not to alleviate the appearance of corruption: The Court held there is `nothing invidious, improper or unhealthy' in campaigns spending money to communicate--nothing. Not to stem the growth in campaign spending. Again, the Court was clear: 
. . . the mere growth in the cost of federal election campaigns in and of itself provides no basis [no basis] for governmental restrictions on the quantity of campaign spending. . . 
And not to level the political playing field, a notion flatly rejected by the Court in Buckley. 
. . . the concept that the government . . . 
This is in response to the level playing field argument, Mr. President. In the Buckley case the Court said: 
. . . the concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment. 
`Wholly foreign.' 
So, Mr. President, the Government cannot, by congressional edict or regulatory fiat, impede or impair the ability of candidates, groups, individuals or parties to communicate with the electorate. Nor can Congress, as the American Civil Liberties Union has observed, coerce what it cannot command. 
In other words, spending limits that are voluntary in name only, such as in the McCain-Feingold bill, would have in the Court a half-life of an ice cube on a sun-baked Constitution Avenue on the 4th of July. That is about how long that would last. 
There is nothing in Buckley, or any subsequent Supreme Court decision, upon this to pin hope that McCain-Feingold or any similarly coercive bills would be upheld. Buckley was not an aberration. In fact, the Court is increasingly of a deregulatory mind on campaign finance, as evidenced by last June's Colorado decision allowing the political parties to make independent expenditures. 
Now, some seek to nullify the Court, and thereby pave the way for bills like McCain-Feingold, by amending the first amendment, and that is the issue before us--amending the first amendment for the first time in two centuries and thus make the unconstitutional, constitutional. They would rewrite the first amendment, a frontal assault on American freedom that the ACLU has characterized as `a recipe for repression.' 
That is what is before the Senate today. What is before us today has no constituency. Common Cause is against it. The New York Times is against it. The Washington Post is against it. The ACLU is against it. Importantly, an overwhelming number of Senators will be against it. 
I personally recoil at the prospect of a Constitution so altered, while I relish the debate itself. This is an honest debate because it shows what you have to do to carve a big hunk out of the first amendment, if you will try to achieve the result that some are trying to achieve. This is an honest debate. It draws a clear line between those like myself who look on last year's record election spending as illustrative of a robust national debate over the future of the Nation, and those who believe you cannot have both freedom of speech and a healthy democracy. 
Looking upon the first amendment as an impediment to reform, rather than reform, itself steers even well-intentioned reformers on a path of Government regulation, restriction, and even prohibition of fundamental political freedoms. A myopic determination to restrict campaign spending can result, as it has today, in an effort to essentially repeal the first amendment's protection of political speech. That is what is before the Senate today. 
The Court stated in the 1937 case Palko versus Connecticut that freedom of speech `is the matrix, the indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of freedom.' 
Whatever one believes about the current state of campaign finance or the validity of the Buckley decision, surely it is not cause to carve out of the first amendment fundamental protection for core political speech by American citizens. The first amendment was borne of extraordinary people in an extraordinary time. Let us not diminish that freedom, 200 years later, out of frustration with Court decisions. 
The campaign finance reform debate is necessarily difficult. It is difficult because the ramifications of any significant change in this area are serious. A ban on soft money, for instance, will have serious repercussions, because--like it or not--the political parties do some good things. For one, they are the only entity in the system that will support challengers without regard to ideology. 
The Democratic Party committees support challengers--pro-choice or pro-life, or pro-gun control or con-gun control, you name the issue and they have supported candidates of their side. In the case of the Democratic committee, because they are Democrats; in the case of the Republicans, because they are Republicans. 
Our criteria is, first and foremost, a candidate's party affiliation. Then we consider their ability and the availability of money to help their candidates. The political party's helping challengers is often all that stands between an incumbent having real competition and not just a coronation on election day. 
Much is said about independent expenditures and issue advocacy. The truth is, politicians hate independent expenditures because by definition they are out of our control. We do not get to control them. A group that thinks your reelection is the most important goal may make independent expenditures that are intended to help you but, in fact, inject into the election an issue you wish was not going to be discussed. In other words, a group can love you to death with independent expenditures. That is why politicians would like to have complete control of elections. That is what they would be given under this amendment--complete control. 
Mr. President, the candidates do not own the elections. They are the people's elections, not the candidates. They are the people's elections to influence through independent expenditures, issues advocacy, and through the support of candidates and political parties of their choosing. These reform bills would take elections away from private citizens, groups, and parties and hand them over, exclusively, to the candidates and to the media. 
Issue advocacy is a recent addition to the reform lexicon. Some reformers profess to be horrified by all the issue advocacy that occurred last year because--news flash--they affected the election. They decry issue advocacy as another loophole that has been blasted through allowing groups to circumvent campaign finance restrictions. 
A funny thing about citizens, groups, and parties who wish to make themselves heard in a democracy: They always seem to find a way around Government speech roadblocks. 
If Congress ever does impose Government regulations on issue advocacy and the courts do not strike them down, the first amendment will be a hollow shell. Soft money limits, independent expenditure limits, issue advocacy regulations, spending limits, PAC limits--these are all euphemisms for speech limits. 
Under this amendment before the Senate--by carving out a huge chunk of the first amendment--Congress could succeed in imposing all of these speech limits. America would then spend less on elections. Elections would be quieter, politics--at least, on the surface--would be more civil because dissent would be tightly regulated by this Congress and incumbents would be less bothered by fundraising. And we will have gutted American democracy. 
Mr. President, I am confident this amendment is not going to be approved. I hope it will be rejected overwhelmingly. It is one of the most frightening proposals we have had before this body in the 13 years I have been here. The first amendment should be the touchstone of reform, and the Buckley case, its guide. 
Within those parameters, we could enact bipartisan reform to strengthen, rather than diminish, our democracy. I hope at some point that is what we will be doing.

Mr. McCONNELL. Given the general anxiety that candidates for public office experience when independent expenditures, constitutionally protected speech, is directed for or against us, could my friend from Utah not envision a situation in which the Congress would conclude that there should be none, no expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, a candidate? Might not the Congress, in its wisdom, conclude that it was reasonable to have no such expressions by outsiders in the course of the campaign under this amendment?

Mr. McCONNELL. One final question for my friend from Utah, following up on the observations he astutely made about the transfer of power to the media when you mandate less speech by the candidates and by groups in support of candidates. Might it not then be the next step for Congress to conclude that since now the press has all the power, that maybe we ought to amend the first amendment a little further and give the Congress the power to maybe say how many hours a day a station may broadcast, because we might conclude that they were engaging in an excessive amount of discussion of our issues, or we might conclude that the circulation of a newspaper might be limited to a certain number, because there was an excessive amount of news out there, an excessive amount of discourse about daily events? 
That is also part of the first amendment, is it not, and that is also part of the discourse that goes on in this free society. That would be potentially the next step, might it not?

Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator, and think the Senator from Texas would be interested in this as well. 
The ACLU, in a letter to me dated March 6, says that this language before us may well give the Congress the power to interfere with editorializing in newspapers. Let me just read this observation for my colleagues and for those who are interested. 
Senate Joint Resolution 18 [referring to the resolution before us] would also give Congress and every state legislature the power, heretofore denied by the First Amendment, to regulate the most protected function of the press--editorializing. Print outlets such as newspapers and magazines, broadcasters, Internet publishers and cable operators would be vulnerable to severe regulation of editorial content by the government. A candidate-centered editorial, as well as op-ed articles or commentary printed at the publisher's expense are most certainly expenditures in support of or in opposition to particular political candidates. The amendment, as its words make apparent, would authorize Congress to set reasonable limits on the expenditures by the media during campaigns, when not strictly reporting the news. Such a result would be intolerable in a society that cherishes the free press. 
So what we have here, America's experts on the first amendment--sometimes we agree with them; sometimes we do not--but clearly America's experts on the first amendment, the ACLU, say that this amendment before us gives the Congress, us, the power to control editorial comment in this country.

He is, indeed, correct: What we have before us is an effort to amend the first amendment for the first time in the history of this country to give to the Government the power to control the speech of individuals, groups, candidates and parties. In short, a complete takeover of political discourse in this country by the Government. 
I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his important contribution to this debate. This amendment needs to be defeated, and defeated soundly, in the name of protecting the first amendment. I am sure the Senator from Nebraska is as pleased as I am that even the reform group, Common Cause, is against this. Even the Washington Post is against this. Even the New York Times is against this. I mean, even the reformers think this is a bad idea. So this should be rejected and rejected firmly.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to lend my voice to the chorus of support for adding a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
For a generation, this Government has spent billions more than it has received, all the while talking, always talking, about the urgent need to balance the Federal budget. History has borne out the facts: No matter how well-intentioned the debate, Congress has failed for the past 28 years to balance the budget. 
Since coming to the Senate 12 years ago, I have listened to those who oppose a balanced budget tell the American people that all we need is courage to get our fiscal house in order. Yet, year after year, Congress runs up billions upon billions on the public credit card that must be paid for by future generations. What right do we have to ask our children and grandchildren to pay for today's excesses? 
Mr. President, the time for talk has passed. Now is the time for action. 
Like most Americans, I am outraged that interest on the debt has become the third largest item in the Federal budget. According to the President's budget for fiscal year 1998, the U.S. Government will spend $250 billion in net interest costs, which makes up nearly 15 percent of the total budget. That means, we spend four times more on interest than we do on education, training, and employment combined. We spend 10 times more on interest than we spend on the administration of justice. 
We are the greatest Nation on earth, and yet we spend more retiring debt than we do on educating our children? This is madness and it must stop. 
Mr. President, it does not have to be this bad. If we pass a balanced budget we can give families relief by reducing interest rates on borrowing for items like home mortgages and school loans. A typical family would save $1,500 per year in interest payments. Think of how that money could be put to better use: saving for a college education, investing in a secure retirement, or maybe enjoying a long anticipated vacation. 
Sadly, the path to a balanced budget is now being blocked by determined and enthusiastic partisan gamesmanship. Opponents of a balanced budget have decided to play on the fears of seniors. In words which recall last year's shameless mediscare campaign, the balanced budget amendment is attacked and misrepresented--all while the national debt whirs wildly out of control. 
Mr. President, I will spend exactly one sentence answering this Social Security red herring. The best way to ensure the solvency of the Social Security Program is to balance the budget now. Clever legislative shell games will not add a single day to the life of Social Security, only a balanced budget will do that. 
So the decision is ours. Do we want to balance the budget or not. And if not now, when? Our children want to know. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the balanced budget amendment. 
Mr. President, the American people are rightfully skeptical that this Congress will balance the budget, not only in 7 years but for every year thereafter. Why are they skeptical? For a generation, for a generation we have failed our children and grandchildren by piling up a mountain of debt to the tune of over $5 trillion. So the American people are saying, `If you need some assistance in doing the job, why don't you mandate--so that you have no discretion--mandate that we have a balanced budget in the future?' It is the only way to protect our country. It is the only way to have a country fit to live in for our children and their children. 
We all know what has happened. The debt is the third largest item in the Federal budget. We are spending more on retiring the debt than we are on educating our children. It is time to call it to a halt, to get our fiscal affairs in order. 
Mr. President, a constitutional amendment to require us to do the job each year, for the future, is the only way to achieve this goal.

Ms. Smith-Pointer held the positions of claims development clerk, data review technician, and claims representative--the position she held upon retiring.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a truly outstanding young man on the realization of his dream. J.P. Blevins, son of John P. and Martha Blevins, of Edmonton, KY, has been awarded a scholarship to play basketball for the national champion University of Kentucky Wildcats. 
To date, this 17-year-old junior at Metcalfe County High School has had an outstanding basketball career. It all began in kindergarten when he was selected to play with third-graders during gym class. As a seventh grader he played point guard for the varsity team in the district final. And as a high school freshman he scored his 1,000th point. When he was 5 years old he disciplined himself to dribble with both hands by wearing cutoff jean shorts and then shoving his right hand into his right pocket. The result? This season a 26 point scoring average. These achievements were the result of many hours of discipline and hard work and--most of all--an intense passion for the game. Remarkably, his zeal for basketball did not cause him to neglect his studies; he is a straight A student. 
Perhaps what is most remarkable of all is that J.P. Blevins has remained modest throughout the attention and praise lavished on him. This is especially refreshing and encouraging in an age where many of our athletic stars demonstrate a profound disregard for others, an appalling arrogance, and gross self-indulgence. In a Courier-Journal article, Blevin's father was quoted as saying: `I really believe he has continued to stay humble, even though this is the greatest thing that has happened in his life.' 
In Metcalfe County, and indeed, throughout the State, basketball occupies a special place in the lives of Kentuckians. It is not just entertainment, but rather a source of pride and glory. The community which helped to raise Mr. Blevins is justifiably proud of their native son. Despite numerous offers from out-of-State universities, some having sent 4 or 5 letters a day, Blevins has decided there's just no place like home. 
According to a recent article, each night, as J.P. is falling asleep, the last thing he sees is a blue flag emblazoned with a white `K' which hangs on his bedroom wall. On the white `K' is an autograph from the Wildcats' coach, Rick Pitino. In his scrapbook, according to the Courier-Journal, Blevins wrote `Pitino's autograph to me is more important than the President's.' 
You may recall the University of Kentucky's recent NCAA championship victory. I am sure that this fine young man will help them to secure many further triumphs. Mr. President, I ask that a recent article from the Courier-Journal be included in the Congressional Record.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, very briefly, I urge my colleagues to vote against the President's request for early release of population funds. Significant concessions have already been made by those of us who support the pro-life position. We agreed to raise the overall level of funding from $356 million in 1996 to $385 million, and the disbursal rate from 6 percent to 8 percent a month. Now the President wants to move up the date when disbursal begins. This would make $123 million more available for organizations that either support or lobby for the legalization of abortion. 
The administration claims that 17 projects will be forced to close down if we delay funding until July. Yet, virtually every one of these programs could be funded because they are willing to abide by Mexico City conditions not to support abortion or lobby to legalize it. To protect a few groups who support abortion, the administration is withholding support from many organizations willing to provide family planning services consistent with the Mexico City guidelines. They complain about a lack of funds, yet are willing to forgo an increase if it is linked to Mexico City. 
I support family planning, but I cannot and will not vote to provide funds to organizations which, in the name of family planning, take the lives of innocent unborn children. I hope the resolution will be opposed.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, American families turn on the news every night and get bombarded by the reality that the war against crime and drugs is escalating. No one understands the dangers of this domestic war better than the men and women who serve on the front lines. I'm talking about our Nation's police officers. 
These dedicated individuals offer up their lives as an act of service every day. They know the stress and the strain of walking the daily beat, of being caught in the crossfire in a world of gangs and drugs. These officers experience first-hand the casualties of our national epidemic. 
As the Washington Post reported this Sunday, seven law enforcement officers right here in the Nation's Capital have been killed--in little more than 2 years. Moreover, the ambush of these `men and women wearing badges [occurred]--even though the officers posed no immediate threat to their attackers.' 
Our Nation's police officers endure unfathomable pressure every day as they fight to take back our streets. In the words of one officer, `the ultimate sacrifice could occur at any time. * * * [The gangs and criminals] have rewritten the rule book.' 
To make matters worse, the pressure of crime and drugs--of gangs and thugs--is multiplied by the fear of unjust disciplinary actions. Our law enforcement officers face intrusive investigations into their professional and personal lives--oftentimes at the behest of some recently arrested criminal looking for a payback. 
Our officers live in the fear of: being investigated without notice; being interrogated without an attorney; and being dismissed without a hearing. 
We must act now to address this situation by guaranteeing our police officers their basic and fundamental rights. So, today, along with Mr. Biden and Mr. Leahy, I proudly introduce the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights. 
This bill protects rights that most of us take for granted. For example, it allows police officers to be involved in, or refrain from, political activity. 
The bill also gives significant due process rights to every police officer subject to investigation for noncriminal disciplinary action. Some of these rights include: 
The right to be informed of the administrative charges prior to being questioned; the right to be advised of the results of an investigation; the right to a hearing and an opportunity to respond; and the right to be represented by counsel or other representative. 
We owe our law enforcement officers a national debt of gratitude for their valiant fight in a battle that must be won. I ask my colleagues to show their appreciation and understanding of the plight of our police force. We must act boldly to equip every officer with basic and fundamental rights. 
Finally, I must conclude by explaining that this bill is a product of years of input from the men and women who have experienced these daily pressures, and continue to endure them. This legislation has benefited from the thoughtful ideas and past support of many law enforcement groups, including the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, and the International Brotherhood of Police Officers. 
In particular, I am grateful to the contribution made by the Fraternal Order of Police. Over the past 6 years, I have worked closely with the Kentucky FOP to develop and promote this legislation. Seasoned and well-informed officers like Ray Franklin and Mike Hettich, both of whom are National FOP officers from my home State, have worked with me in refining the language of this bill and developing grassroots momentum. I would also like to say a personal word of thanks to Verlin Flaherty, Rick McCubbin, and Martin Scott. 
The time has come to protect those who protect us. We must give our law enforcement officers the basic and fundamental rights that they desperately need and deserve.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the resolution that the President has submitted requesting the early release of population planning funds. 
Last fall, in the waning hours of Congress, an agreement was reached by the White House and the leadership to make $385 million available for family planning at a rate of 8 percent a month beginning in July. That date was agreed to so there would be no overlap of 1996 and 1997 funds. 
The effect of the resolution before the Senate would be to virtually double the amount made available for population planning for 4 months this year. If the Senate passes the President's resolution, $123 million more in funding will be available for organizations that support abortions and lobby to undermine laws which protect the unborn. 
There are those who would like to suggest that this is merely a question of shifting dates. We are not arguing over whether money becomes available but when, so the argument goes. In fact, this debate centers on how much will be available, to which groups, and under what circumstances. 
I believe those of us who support the pro-life position made significant concessions during the negotiations over the omnibus resolution. Not only did we agree to raise the overall level of funding from $356 million in 1996 to $385 million, the disbursal rate was increased from roughly 6 percent to 8 percent a month. Now the President wants to move up the date when disbursal begins. 
Very few of us actually oppose making family planning funds available. There is general consensus that a responsible family planning policy has a positive impact on a nation's development. Everyone appreciates the consequences exploding population rates have on every aspect of a nation's well-being, from the availability of education, food and jobs, to the condition of the environment. 
So let us all agree that there is no question that U.S. family planning funds are extremely helpful in the developing world. But there is also absolutely no question that when the United States decided to provide resources only to organizations that agreed not--not--to perform abortions and agreed not to lobby to legalize abortions, we were still the single largest global donor of family planning funds. This understanding is the heart of the so-called Mexico City policy, a policy that resulted in steady increases in responsible U.S. family planning support, a policy that at the end of the Bush administration meant the United States contributed 45 percent of all family planning funds made available around the world. 
There is a deep irony to this debate. On the one hand, the administration argues that the population program is in dire straits and beginning the funding in July will cause the closeout or reduction of at least 17 projects. Virtually all of those programs could be fully funded because they are carried out by organizations which meet the criteria of not supporting abortion or efforts to legalize abortion. In the misguided interest of protecting a few organizations, the administration is withholding support for the many willing to provide family planning services consistent with the Mexico City guidelines. They complain about the negative impact of cuts on funding yet are willing to forego an increase if it is linked to Mexico City. It does not make sense. 
I support family planning, but I cannot and will not vote to provide funds to organizations which in the name of family planning take the lives of innocent, unborn children. I urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution. 
Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to speak about S. 307, the Federal Surplus Property Donations Act introduced earlier in the week by Senators Lugar, Harkin, Leahy, and myself. 
This legislation will enable food banks and other charities, which primarily serve low-income persons, to receive surplus Federal property such as computers, office furniture, copiers, warehouse equipment, and trucks. Items like these are often not available because of their expense. Such equipment can contribute to efficient and effective food bank operations. 
I want to thank Second Harvest, Habitat for Humanity, and other major charities which serve needy families and children every day for their support of this legislation and their commitment in responding to hunger in our communities. 
Mr. President, Second Harvest and Habitat for Humanity work with food banks serving all 50 States and Puerto Rico. In my home State of Kentucky, this legislation will assist Dare to Care Food Bank in Louisville, God's Pantry Food Bank in Lexington, and Kentucky Food Bank in Elizabethtown in accessing Federal surplus property. 
This is a modest but important bill. It can make a real difference in the lives of those who are served by these valuable programs. 
I urge my colleagues to support both this legislation and the food banks across the country that serve needy families and children.

 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, each fall, Senators and Congressmen turn to the enjoyable task of submitting nominations to the U.S. Service Academies. This year, like every other, my office was flooded with applications from qualified young men and women--students with excellent academic records, students whose extracurricular activities would drive the most patient parent crazy, students who donate endless hours to community service projects. However, rarely do I see a young person possessing all of this and more. 
This year I proudly nominated Erica Michelle Pitts, of Louisville, KY, to the U.S. Military Academy, as did Senator Wendell Ford and then-Congressman Mike Ward. There are many adjectives that can be used to describe Erica--poised, accomplished, brave, athletic, energetic, but even combined they do not adequately portray her. A senior at Saint Francis High School, Erica's headmaster Thomas Pike describes her as `a delightfully different young person.' Counselor Kit Llewellyn sees her as a `risk-taker' and admires her integrity. 
Erica's military career dreams began at the age of 6 when her stepfather took her for a tank ride. At the tender young age of 8 she began working for her mother's boss formatting computer disks for $5 an hour. Entering as a seventh-grader at the respected Saint Francis, she was immediately placed in the freshman class, where, lacking a girls basketball team, Erica played on the boy's team. She has participated in a Russian exchange program, the Duke University Talent Identification Program, and served on the Courier-Journal High School Round Table. And, amidst her participation on the academic team and the yearbook staff, Erica works part-time at the Louisville Science Center yearround. 
As you can see, Erica's childhood has been far from average. Notwithstanding, she has grown into a graceful young woman whose lofty dreams have been realized. Hoping to enter the Judge Advocate General's Corps after her years at West Point, Erica aspires to serve on the Supreme Court or be elected President. Both goals are well within her grasp.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on February 5, I introduced the Bear Protection Act, S. 263. This measure is aimed at controlling poaching of bears such as the American black bear which is found in Kentucky. It addresses several enforcement and jurisdictional loopholes that are caused by a patchwork of State laws. The current inconsistencies enable a wildly profitable underground black market for bear parts to flourish in the United States. 
Mr. President, my bill would in no way affect legal hunting of bears. Hunters would still be allowed to keep trophies and furs of bears killed during legal hunts. This measure would only prohibit the sale or barter of the internal organs of the bear which are referred to as bear viscera. 
This bill is made necessary because of the booming illegal trade in bear viscera. At least 18 Asian countries are known to participate in the illegal trade in bear parts. Bear viscera are also illegally sold and traded in large urban areas in the United States such as San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, and New York City. These cities serve as primary ports for export shipments of these goods. 
Bear parts, such as gall bladders, are used in traditional Asian medicine to treat everything from diabetes to heart disease. Due to the increasing demand for bear viscera, the population of Asian black bears has been totally annihilated over the last few years. This has led poachers to turn to American bears to fill the increasing demand. I, for one, will not stand by and allow our own bear populations to be decimated by poachers. 
Mr. President, it is estimated that Kentucky has only 50 to 100 black bears remaining in the wild. Black bears once roamed free across the Appalachian Mountains, through the rolling hills of the bluegrass, all the way to the Mississippi River. Although we cannot restore the numbers we once had, we can ensure that the remaining bears are not sold for profit to the highest bidder. 
Poaching has become an astoundingly profitable enterprise. It is estimated that over 40,000 bears are poached in the United States every year. That equals the number that are taken by legal hunting. 
Mr. President, the main reason behind these astounding numbers is greed. In South Korea, bear gall bladders are worth their weight in gold, and an average bear gall bladder can bring as high as $10,000 on the black market. 
Currently, U.S. law enforcement officials have little power to address the poaching of bears and the sale of their parts in an effective manner. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has neither the manpower nor the budget to test all bear parts sold legally in the United States. Without extensive testing, law enforcement officials cannot determine if gall bladders or other parts have come from threatened or endangered species. This problem perpetuates the poaching of endangered or threatened bears. 
The Lacey Act currently regulates the interstate commerce of wildlife possessed or transported in violation of State law. Inconsistencies in State law, however, make convictions under this statute difficult. Under the current legal situation, it is impossible to determine whether a gall bladder being sold in Idaho comes from a legally taken local bear or an endangered Louisiana black bear without expensive testing. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Special Agent Corky Roberts illustrates this point in a recent Humane Society publication, 
If somebody kills a bear in the state of Washington all they have to do is get it to Idaho. Technically * * *, it's against the law but all it does is make it more difficult to prove that the bear was taken in Washington and traded illegally in interstate commerce. That's where the Lacey Act has problems. 
The Bear Protection Act will establish national guidelines for trade in bear parts, but it will not weaken any existing State laws that have been instituted to deal with this issue. My bill will also instruct the Secretary of the Interior and the U.S. Trade Representative to establish a dialog with the appropriate countries to coordinate efforts aimed at curtailing the international bear trade. 
Mr. President, this measure is crafted narrowly enough to deal with the poaching of the American black bear for profit, while still ensuring the rights of American sportsmen. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this much-needed legislation. Mr. President, I ask that the full text of the bill be printed in the Congressional Record.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1, the Safe and Affordable Schools Act. I am pleased Senator Coverdell has introduced this important legislation which will provide our children with an affordable, quality education. By making this bill the first bill of the 105th Congress, it demonstrates to the American people the importance this Senate has placed on the education of our children. 
I would like to comment on a very important provision contained in this bill which will make higher education more affordable. For the past several years, I have worked to allow the earnings invested in State-sponsored tuition savings accounts to grow tax-free when used for higher education expenses. This bill also will cover room and board cost. These changes will help families offset the rising cost of education by rewarding those who save. 
For the past several years, I have worked to eliminate the tax on education savings. In 1994, I first introduced S. 1787, to make a family's investment earnings tax-free when invested in a State tuition savings plan. Again, in the 104th Congress, I introduced a similar bill, S. 386. Both bills were endorsed by the National Association of State Treasurers and their College Savings Plan Network, which represents the individual State programs. 
On July 9, 1996, Congress passed many of the reforms proposed in S. 386, as part of the Small Business Tax Relief Act of 1996. This legislation was signed into law by the President on August 20, 1996. 
While we made important gains last year, we need to finish what we started and fully exempt investment income from taxation. This legislation does that. It also expands the definition of qualified education expense to include room and board. Such costs make up nearly 50 percent of annual college expenses. 
The facts are clear; education costs are outpacing wage growth and have created a barrier for students wanting to attend college. According to the General Accounting Office, tuition costs at a 4-year public university rose 234 percent between 1980-94. During this same period, median household income rose only 84 percent. It is no wonder fewer families can afford to send their children to college without financial assistance. 
As tuition costs continue to increase, so does the need for assistance. In 1990, over 56 percent of all students accepted some form of financial assistance. 
Today, it is increasingly common for students to study now, and pay later. In fact, more students than ever are forced to bear additional loan costs in order to receive an education. In 1994, Federal education loan volume rose by 57 percent from the previous year. On top of that, students have increased the size of their loan burden by an average of 28 percent. 
So, not only are more students taking out more loans, they are taking out bigger loans as well. This year, nearly half of college graduates hit the pavement with their diplomas in one hand and a stack of loan repayment books in the other. 
I believe we need to reverse this trend by boosting savings and helping families meet the education needs of their children before they enter college. If we continue to ignore this problem, more and more children will be forced to burden themselves with an increasing debt load when they go in search of their first job. This can be avoided with passage of S. 1. 
Mr. President, in an effort to build on the accomplishments of last year, I look forward to working with Senator Coverdell, the sponsor of this legislation, and the Senate Labor and Finance Committees to help families meet the rising cost of higher education.

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of Ambassador Albright's nomination as Secretary of State. I am confident she will serve our national security interests with distinction. 
While she has managed a broad portfolio in her capacity as our Ambassador to the United Nations, there are two issues where I have had occasion to work closely with her and have been particularly impressed with her views and commitment. 
On Burma, Ambassador Albright has consistently delivered a tough message to the ruling junta: We expect improvements on human rights, we expect a serious effort to be made to combat the scourge of narcotics trafficking. 
She has recognized that the key to progress in both areas is to restore democracy to Burma. 
To the supporters of Aung San Suu Kyi and her legitimately elected Government of Burma, robbed of their victory in 1991, Albright has been the sole voice of support and hope in this administration. 
Following the International Conference on Women in Beijing, she traveled to Rangoon and met with Aung San Suu Kyi. 
This may not seem to be exceptional, but Ambassador Albright is the only senior official in the administration to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi and has been alone yet unfailing in her outspoken support for the advancement of Burma's freedom from the thugs who currently rule. 
A few weeks ago, after several hundred students and citizens were arrested for calling for political change, Ambassador Albright spoke out forcefully and in clear terms at the United Nations that this oppression must come to an end. 
Last year, during consideration of the foreign operations bill, we included language which established criteria for imposing economic sanctions against SLORC. 
Specifically, we required sanctions be applied if there was large scale repression against the opposition or if any action was taken to harm or rearrest Aung San Suu Kyi. 
Since the bill passed, the administration continues to be in a holding pattern claiming our policy is under review, a review which has been going on for several years. 
In the meantime, more than 500 people have been arrested when Aung San Suu Kyi ventured from her compound several weeks ago, her car was stoned and smashed by thugs as SLORC police looked on. Since then she has been under undeclared house arrest. 
Given her past support I am hopeful Ambassador Albright will finally take the necessary steps to position this administration squarely in support of democracy and its most eloquent, dignified advocate Aung San Suu Kyi. 
Let me comment briefly on one other area where I believe Ambassador Albright has already made a difference. 
During the administration's recent consideration of the level of support for the foreign affairs account she has been unflinching and unapologetic about the need to provide adequate resources to administer American foreign policy and assistance programs. 
I share her view that we have reached a crisis point--we cannot afford to compromise our financial support for our embassies and programs abroad based on a misguided notion that further reductions will actually make a difference in balancing the budget. 
The 150 account is already less than 1 percent of Federal spending--further cuts will not make any meaningful contribution to controlling our budget deficit and, in fact may actually make it worse. 
Cutting back on America's presence overseas has a direct impact on American commercial interests--without export promotion programs to launch and support them in critical but risky new markets, American business men will lose long term access and share--and as we all know, exports are the key to both American income and 11 million jobs. 
It's not just our economy that is affected, our presence abroad has a direct affect on protecting our interests in combating terrorism and narcotics trafficking, direct threats to our communities and families. 
American leadership has paid a premium in peace and prosperity but it comes at a price. Madeleine Albright has courageously and clearly defended the importance of making that down payment. 
I am confident that she will bring the same frank, smart, and tough approach to her new responsibilities that we have seen her exercise in her current position.
