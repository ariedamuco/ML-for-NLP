Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today is passing the Hatch-Biden-Lautenberg substitute amendment to H.R. 4164, and I am hopeful that the other body will take up and pass the measure before Congress adjourns for the year. 
What this legislation does is simple. Under current federal law, states must give full faith and credit to the child custody orders of another state. A custody order is defined as including a visitation order. However, as evidence from around the country has shown, state courts often do not automatically recognize visitation orders, particularly when it is a visitation order for someone other than the child's parent, such as a grandparent. State courts are supposed to honor such orders, but it is often an arduous process getting them to do so. 
This legislation simply clarifies that the full faith and credit law includes visitation orders. We want it to be absolutely clear to state courts that a state visitation order entered consistently with the provisions of the federal full faith and credit statute must be given full faith and credit by all other states. In a narrow legal sense, it does nothing different than current federal law. But, by making that law more explicit, it hopefully will eliminate the hassles, obstacles, and delays that too often confront those who have valid visitation orders and are asking only that federal law be followed. 
Mr. President, the author of this idea was Representative Rob Andrews of New Jersey, who deserves credit for bringing this issue to our attention. From the day in 1997 when he introduced his bill on visitation orders, he has been tireless in pushing for its passage. I commend him and congratulate him. 
Finally, I want to thank Senator Hatch for his willingness to move this bill in the final days of the session. There is a lot of pressing work to be done, and this issue could have got lost in the final crunch. But, the chairman and his staff were very gracious in working with me to pass this bill.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, included within this omnibus appropriations bill are two important pieces of legislation related to foreign policy. The first, produced on a bipartisan basis in the Foreign Relations Committee, is the `Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act,' which involves the institutional structure of, and funding for, the foreign affairs agencies of the U.S. government. The second bill is legislation necessary to implement the Chemical Weapons Convention, a treaty approved by the Senate in April 1997. 
The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act is not perfect, and unfortunately it differs in one critical respect from the original bill approved by the Senate 16 months ago. I say `unfortunately' because this bill does not contain a single dime for our UN arrears. Last year, Chairman Helms and I agreed on a proposal to authorize the payment of $926 million in arrears to the United Nations, conditioned on a series of reforms in that body. The Senate approved the Helms-Biden legislation twice in 1997, first by a vote of 90-5 in June, then by a voice vote in November. 
The obstacle to making good on our commitments to the United Nations? A small minority of members in the other body, who have insisted that our arrears payments to the United Nations should be held hostage to an unrelated issue regarding family planning. The specific provision--the so-called Mexico City amendment --would require the withholding of funds from foreign, non-governmental organizations which use their own funds to perform abortions or discuss the issue with foreign governments. The President has indicated on several occasions that he will veto any bill presented to him that contains the Mexico City language. Nonetheless, a handful of obstructionists in the other body march steadily ahead, determined to undermine U.S. foreign policy interests in order to advance their unrelated cause. 
I deeply regret such irresponsible action by the other body, but it is emblematic of the reckless disregard that many in that body have for the important responsibilities the United States has as the world s leading superpower. 
In the past few weeks, the Chairman and I attempted to include a $200 million down payment on our UN arrears, which would have been linked to certain of the conditions in the Helms-Biden legislation. But even this limited payment of our arrears proved to be too much for the members in the other body who have taken American foreign policy hostage. 
It is essential that we find a way to repay our arrears next year. For better or for worse, the United Nations is a valuable means to advance our foreign policy and security interests around the world, by providing a forum for improved cooperation with other states and by allowing us, in some instances, to share the burdens and costs of world leadership. 
Our status as a deadbeat is unquestionably hurting our interests, not only at the UN but with our leading allies--many of whom are owed money by the UN for peacekeeping operations they undertook, but for which we have not yet paid. The cost to our interests cannot be measured with precision, but the resentment against the United States for its failure to pay its back dues is having a corrosive effect on our agenda at the UN and elsewhere. It is bordering on scandalous that a big nation like ours, blessed with abundant wealth, has failed to pay its bills on time. 
Next year, the President is expected to nominate Richard Holbrooke to be our representative to the United Nations. Ambassador Holbrooke's nomination offers us a chance for a fresh start in the negotiations on UN arrears and reforms. Mr. Holbrooke is one of the most creative diplomats and negotiators of our time, and I am confident he will bring fresh insights and endless energy to this important issue. I am also hopeful that the Chairman remains committed to trying to move legislation in the next Congress to repay the full amount agreed to last year in our negotiations. 
Let me turn now to the provisions of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act that are contained in the omnibus bill. Much of the legislative history of bill is set forth in the conference report to H.R. 1757, which was approved by both houses last spring. But I would like to take a few minutes to summarize the bill and highlight several issues. 
First, the legislation before us establishes a framework for the reorganization of the U.S. foreign policy agencies which is consistent with the plan announced by the President in April 1997. After several years of debate, last year the President agreed to the abolishment of two foreign affairs agencies, and their merger into the State Department. The first agency to be abolished will be the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), which will be merged into the State Department no later than April 1, 1999; the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) will follow no later than October 1, 1999. As with the President s plan, the Agency for International Development (AID) will remain a separate agency, but it will be placed under the direct authority of the Secretary of State. And, consistent with the President s proposal to seek improved coordination between the regional bureaus in the State Department and AID, the Secretary of State will have the authority to provide overall coordination of assistance policy. 
The integration of ACDA and USIA into the State Department is not intended to signal the demise of the important functions now performed by these agencies. On the contrary, their merger into the Department is designed to ensure that the arms control and public diplomacy functions are key elements of American diplomacy. 
In that regard, the bill establishes in law two new positions in the State Department, an Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, and an Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy. These senior officers will have primary responsibility for assisting the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of State in the formation and implementation of U.S. policy on these matters. 
It is expected that the officials who will be named to these positions will be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent. The conference committee on H.R. 1757 rejected a proposal by the Executive Branch to seek authority to place officials who are now in analogous positions in these newly-created positions. 
One issue of particular concern regarding ACDA in the reorganization is the need to maintain the highest standards of competence and objectivity in the analysis of compliance with arms control and non-proliferation agreements. As the Foreign Relations Committee stated in its report last year, it is vital `that the Under Secretary be able to call upon expert personnel in these areas who will not feel obligated to downplay verification or compliance issues because of any potential impact of such issues upon overall U.S. relations with another country.' Chairman Helms and I have urged the Secretary of State to find a way to make the official for compliance a Senate-confirmed, Presidential appointee. 
The bill puts flesh on the bones of the President's plan with regard to international broadcasting. The President's proposal was virtually silent on this question, stating only that the `distinctiveness and editorial integrity of the Voice of America and the broadcasting agencies would be preserved.' The bill upholds and protects that principle by maintaining the existing government structure established by Congress in 1994 in consolidating all U.S. government-sponsored broadcasting--the Voice of America, Radio and TV Marti, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and Worldnet TV--under the supervision of one oversight board known as the Broadcasting Board of Governors. Importantly, however, the Board and the broadcasters below them will not be merged into the State Department, where their journalistic integrity would be greatly at risk. Instead, the Broadcasting Board will be an independent federal entity within the Executive Branch. The Secretary of State will have a seat on the board, just as the Director of the USIA does now. 
Second, the bill authorizes important funding for our diplomatic readiness, which has been severely hampered in recent years by deep reductions in the foreign affairs budget. This Congress has stopped the hemorrhaging in the foreign affairs budget, but I believe that funding for international programs remains inadequate, given our responsibilities as a great power. 
Although the Cold War has ended, the need for American leadership in world affairs has not. Our diplomats represent the front line of our national defense; with the downsizing of the U.S. military presence overseas, the maintenance of a robust and effective diplomatic capability has become all the more important. Despite the reduction in our military readiness abroad, the increased importance of diplomatic readiness to our nation s security has not been reflected in the federal budget. 
Significantly, this omnibus appropriations bill contains the emergency funding requested by the Administration for embassy security. The bombings of the U.S. embassies in East Africa in August demonstrate that many of our missions overseas remain highly vulnerable to terrorist attack; it is imperative that we provide the State Department the resources necessary to protect our employees serving overseas. We should understand, however, that the urgent funding in this bill is just the beginning of a long-term program to enhance security at embassies around the globe. 
I am especially pleased that the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act is also incorporated in the omnibus spending bill. The Senate passed this legislation unanimously in May of 1997, and we have waited since then for the leadership of the other body to accept that complying with our international commitments is a requirement, rather than a political football. The enactment of this measure will enable the United States to file the comprehensive data declarations required by the Convention, and therefore to demand that other countries' declarations be complete. The United States will now be able to accept inspections of private facilities, and therefore to request challenge inspections of suspected illegal facilities in foreign countries. The United States will finally be able also to protect confidential business information, acquired in declarations or on-site inspections, from release under the Freedom of Information Act. After nearly 17 months of waiting, it is about time. 
In closing, I want to pay tribute to Chairman Helms for his continued good faith and cooperation throughout the last two years on these and other issues. He has been the driving force behind the legislation to reorganize the foreign affairs agencies, and I congratulate him for his achievement. I also want to thank our colleagues in the other body, particularly the ranking member of the Committee on International Relations, Lee Hamilton, who is retiring this year after over three decades of noble service to his district in Indiana and to the American people. We wish him well as he moves on to new challenges. 
Mr. President, I want to reiterate that we are leaving important unfinished business--the payment of our back dues to the United Nations. It must be at the top of our agenda in the next Congress. I look forward to working with the Chairman and the Secretary of State to find a way to finish the job.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for allowing me to go first. Mr. President, the reason I didn't say anything initially is because I hoped to be able to still make my commitment in Delaware and hear the Senator from West Virginia. I mean that sincerely. It is rare for the Senator from West Virginia ever to take the floor if he does not have a serious piece of business to conduct. He is going to speak on the same subject I am speaking to. I will not get to hear his speech, but I am sure I will read it in the Record. 
Mr. President, I had originally intended today to introduce a resolution authorizing United States airstrikes against Yugoslavia in connection with the Kosovo crisis because I believe our Constitution requires the President to come to us for that authority. I have decided, however, not to offer the resolution because of recent developments, not on the constitutional front, but recent developments on the ground. The reality is that we are about to go out of session, and my ability to get a vote on this issue is problematic, at best. 
Instead, I rise to discuss the implications for U.S. policy regarding the agreement on Kosovo worked out 2 days ago by Ambassador Richard Holbrooke with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, after more than a week of intensive negotiations. 
I might note that it seems at every important point in our history we have diplomats and elected officials who rise to the occasion to meet the needs of the Nation. I would like to suggest that Richard Holbrooke is the right man, at the right time, at the right spot. I compliment him. We are fortunate to have his diplomatic skills available to this Nation at this moment. 
On Monday, NATO's 16 member nations voted unanimously for what they call an ACTORD. That is military terminology for an activation order, which allowed the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, U.S. General Wes Clark, to order airstrikes, which reportedly would begin with cruise missiles and escalate to a phased bombing campaign that would move beyond Kosovo. 
Because this action order was taken, I believe, and only because of this, our negotiator, Mr. Holbrooke, was able to get an agreement from Mr. Milosevic, the criminal President of the Republic of Yugoslavia, to agree to certain of NATO's demands. In response, the alliance has postponed launching the airstrikes, which have been authorized for 4 days, in order to assess whether or not he, Mr. Milosevic, will comply. I assure you that he will not comply if he believes we are not serious about using significant force. The cruise missiles are now on immediate standby; B-52s stand ready on the runway equipped with cruise missiles to move if Milosevic fails to meet his commitments. The cruise missiles are now in immediate standby until Friday evening, U.S. eastern daylight time. 
In addition, more than 400 allied aircraft, the majority of them American, remain available for a phased air campaign, should that later become necessary. 
Mr. President, let me give my assessment right up front. As I said, I believe that Ambassador Holbrooke has done a good job. The agreement he negotiated in Belgrade is a good one, as long as we can be sure that if Milosevic does not keep his word, NATO air power will be used against the Yugoslav military and security forces. 
I must tell you, as the senior member in the minority on the Foreign Relations Committee, I have mixed emotions about Milosevic's having agreed. I believe he only understands force. I believe that he is the problem. I believe that, ultimately, force will have to be used. And, quite frankly, I wish we had just used this force. 
Mr. President, this agreement has, at least temporarily, averted NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia, which, as I indicated, I strongly support. I support them recognizing that they would have endangered the lives of American military personnel, which I do not take lightly. But we must honestly and forthrightly point out to the American people that although the risk was low for high casualties, it was high for some casualties. No one wants war, and this agreement may, in fact, begin to lay the foundation for a political settlement of the crisis in Kosovo. We must understand, though, that war has not been permanently averted in Kosovo. 
I would like to review the substance of the agreement negotiated, whose broad outlines are clear, but whose details understandably remain to be hammered out over the next several days. Milosevic, according to the agreement, must take several steps: 
First, he must maintain a cease-fire and scale back the presence of both the special police, the so-called MUP, and of the Yugoslav Army, or VJ, to February 1998 levels, dropping the regular army presence from 18,000 to 12,500 and the MUP from 11,000 to 6,500. I, and others, I am sure, including Ambassador Holbrooke, would have liked to have seen it taken back further. But I acknowledge that this was what was possible. 
Second, Milosevic must sign an agreement with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe--the so-called OSCE--to allow up to 2,000 `compliance verifiers' full access on the ground in Kosovo to make sure that Milosevic is keeping his promises. 
Third, Milosevic must sign an agreement with NATO to allow unarmed aircraft to fly over Kosovo to verify compliance with the cease-fire. 
Fourth, he must begin serious negotiations with the Kosovars by November 2, with a goal of giving Kosovo at least autonomy within Serbia. 
Fifth, he must allow complete access for humanitarian organizations to deliver assistance to the hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons within Kosovo. These are the people you see on television, huddled in tents in the middle of fields and out in the forests. 
I believe it is unrealistic to think that Milosevic can draw down the special police and the Army units in Kosovo to February levels by the time the Serb-Kosovar negotiations begin on November 2, but he will have to have shown substantial movement in that direction by that time. 
Within a day or two, we can expect a statement by Milosevic proposing a timetable for negotiations with the Kosovars. These negotiations are supposed to be without preconditions. But the United States has made it clear that it expects Kosovo to regain a substantial part of the autonomy within Serbia that it lost in 1989. Although we do not presume to negotiate for the Kosovo Liberation Army, the KLA, or for Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate Kosovar leader, that is the minimum we expect. 
Yesterday, Serbia's President, a Milosevic puppet, announced support for elections to a Kosovo parliament, a general amnesty, and the formation of a Kosovar police force to maintain order over the ethnic Albanian community that comprises more than 90 percent of Kosovo's population. 
President Clinton has described the verification regime that Milosevic has agreed to as intrusive. It gives the OSCE verifiers a broad mandate, including the authority to establish a permanent presence in locations of their choosing in Kosovo, to accompany remaining Serb military units on patrol, and to coordinate humanitarian relief efforts. These verifiers would be backed up by American U2 spy planes and lower altitude P3 Orions and British Canberra photo reconnaissance planes to verify that compliance was underway. The verifiers will be unarmed, but NATO is putting together what we refer to as an over-the-horizon Quick Reaction Force, which will be ready to intervene on short notice if problems arise. 
Let me explain what was meant by that. There will be armed NATO military on the ground--not in Kosovo, not in Serbia--ready to react and cross the border if, in fact, Milosevic goes back to his ways of ethnic cleansing. 
Although the basing of this Quick Reaction Force has not yet been announced, I am told that there is an increasing likelihood that Macedonia, rather than Hungary or Italy, will be chosen as the location. Obviously, military requirements must dictate the basing decision, but in my view the choice of Macedonia would provide a needed political and psychological boost for that small country, which itself has a restive ethnic Albanian minority. 
I feel our European allies should take the lead on this Quick Reaction Force. I have reason to believe that the United Kingdom, which is in the best position of our allies to play such a role, may step up to the plate and take on this responsibility. 
Meanwhile, Milosevic has, as expected, orchestrated the crisis to move against domestic opposition within Serbia. Democratic politicians in Serbia--and there are some--have been threatened. Many independent radio stations have been forced off the air, and dozens of university professors who find Milosevic's conduct abhorrent, have been dismissed. 
Diplomacy is not an easy art. Ambassador Holbrooke, as I said earlier, is to be congratulated for his persistence and stamina in crafting this agreement. As yet, no text has been released, and many of the details remain to be worked out in the coming days. 
Although all Kosovar politicians, from the nonviolent leader Dr. Rugova to the KLA, vociferously maintain their insistence on independence for Kosovo, I believe most are prepared to accept the return of the pre-1989 autonomy, with the decision on the final status to be deferred for several years. 
My supposition is that between now and November 2, U.S. diplomats will work on a fresh draft that will be accepted by Milosevic and the Kosovars as the basis for negotiations. This will not be an easy task. 
Assuming that the Belgrade agreement holds, where are we, and what are the implications for U.S. policy? 
In the short term, the Belgrade agreement will be seen by some in the Balkans as a victory for Milosevic, since Kosovo will remain part of Serbia and the KLA, temporarily at least, will be denied its goal of independence. I might add, though, that in the short term, a NATO air campaign, most likely would also have redounded to Milosevic's credit, since the Serbs' first reaction would have been to rally round their flag. 
It is important to note, however, that if the Belgrade agreement is implemented, Serbian sovereignty will be undermined by the large international presence with wide powers and, eventually, I believe, by some sort of stipulation regarding a decision on final political status for Kosovo after a period of several years. 
As I have said many times on this floor, I do not favor independence for Kosovo. It would send the message in the region that state boundaries should be determined by ethnicity. The first casualty of independence of Kosovo at this moment would be the multiethnic, multireligious, democratic Bosnia-Herzegovina that underpins Dayton and is the goal of American policy. I believe it would also seriously destabilize neighboring Macedonia. 
Instead of independence, I have argued for a status in Kosovo between that of autonomy within Serbia and independence. But that is for the parties to work out. This could possibly take the form of republic status within Yugoslavia, but within a democratic Yugoslavia, not the current plaything of the thug named Milosevic. 
That brings me to the fundamental Balkan policy point that we should cease regarding Milosevic as part of the solution rather than as the problem incarnate. There is simply no chance for peace in the long term in the region until Milosevic is replaced by a democratic government in Belgrade that is willing to grant cultural and political rights to all of its citizens, Serbs and non-Serbs alike, and to respect the sovereignty of its neighbors. 
I have no illusions that Belgrade is full of politicians who read Jefferson and Madison in their spare time. Nonetheless, I do not think we have paid adequate attention to the democratic opposition that does exist. Let's not forget that a democratic coalition did win control of 17 major city councils, including that of Belgrade, in the elections of November 1996. Even now, despite many divisions within the democratic ranks, there are significant elements in Serbian politics, in the Serbian Orthodox Church, among journalists, and in academe that could and should be assisted in a major way by the United States of America. 
For now, Milosevic has strengthened his grip on power by suppressing much of the opposition and spinning the news to emphasize his defiance of the West and NATO's supposed backing down, but that will be short lived. As Serbia's already pathetic economy worsens, opportunities will reemerge for a broad-based democratic opposition to challenge Milosevic. 
We should be patient while protecting life. 
We should lay the groundwork for that day by continuing to insist that the Serbian authorities lift the onerous restrictions under which the independent media chafe, by funding those independent media, and by encouraging intensive contact between democratic Western political parties and trade unions and their Serbian counterparts. 
In my first visit to Serbia, when I had a long meeting in Belgrade in 1993 with Milosevic, I indicated to him then as forthrightly as I could when he asked what I thought of him, I said to him in the privacy of his office, `Mr. President, I think you are a war criminal and should be tried as such.' 
I then met with over 100 people in opposition to Milosevic of all stripes, some extreme nationalists in opposition and some Democrats. 
The only point I wish to make is that there are roots for democratic growth in Serbia, and we should seek them out. 
In the coming days, NATO must watch Milosevic like a hawk and not be afraid to act militarily if he fails to fulfill the terms of the Belgrade agreement, particularly the movement toward reducing the numbers of his special police in Kosovo and sending the army back to its barracks and its heavy weaponry into cantonments. 
One must not forget, Mr. President, who have been the big losers in the tragedy of the last eight months. They are the approximately one-third of the Kosovar population whose ranks include perhaps one thousand killed, over three hundred thousand driven from their homes, and over four hundred villages destroyed. 
All this in order for Milosevic, whose legacy already includes hundreds of thousands of Bosnian and Croatian dead, to cling to power by once again diverting the attention of the Serbian people from the failure of his ignorant and hopelessly inept domestic policies. 
At least we can be thankful that if the Belgrade agreement is implemented, international relief supplies should reach the hundreds of thousands of displaced Kosovars, including many living in the open, thereby preventing massive fatalities this winter. 
On the wider stage, NATO has set the important precedent that in certain circumstances it has the right to intervene in the internal affairs of a European state, without an explicit U.N. Security Council authorization. 
This is a big deal. 
NATO has also made clear to Russia that, in accordance with the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act, 
negotiated by NATO Secretary General Solana and the President of the United States, Moscow has `a voice, not a veto' over NATO policy. That has been reemphasized here as well. 
Nevertheless, partly because of Russian objections and partly because of the congenital Western European aversion to using force to achieve political ends, NATO waited several months too long to create the credible threat necessary to compel Milosevic to stop his brutal repression notwithstanding U.S. urging. 
In effect, the delay enabled Milosevic to complete the short-term destruction of the KLA and the ethnic cleansing in western and central Kosovo that he desired. 
If similar crises arise in the future, we should give ad hoc bodies like the Contact Group one chance to get its act together. 
If it doesn't, then we should, without delay, go to NATO and call for resolute action. 
The kind of ethnic conflict we have seen in Bosnia and Kosovo was specifically mentioned in NATO's so-called Strategic Concept nearly seven years ago as the prototype for threats to the alliance in the post-Cold War era. 
So this is not a surprise to NATO. For that reason--not to mention the thousands of lives that can be spared--we must never again allow racist thugs like Milosevic to carry out their outrages while the alliance dawdles. 
The Belgrade agreement on Kosovo is a first step in the right direction. And President Clinton should be complimented. Its details need to be fleshed out. 
After they are we must brook no more opposition from Milosevic on its implementation. To use a domestic American term, we must adopt a policy of `zero tolerance' with the Yugoslav bully. 
Many of us had hoped that the mistakes that enabled the Bosnian horrors to take place would teach us a lesson. 
Unfortunately, we have repeated many of those errors and have thereby allowed Milosevic and his storm troopers to repeat their atrocities in Kosovo. 
Twice is enough. There must not be a third time. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
I particularly thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, my leader.  
Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of Delaware's, indeed this nation's, legal legends. 
Louis L. Redding was the first African-American admitted to the Delaware Bar in 1929. As one of the preeminent civil rights advocates in the country, Redding was sought after to participate in the argument before the U.S. Supreme Court in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), which led to the end of legal segregation in our nation's public schools. Brown included a Delaware case Redding had won in the State Chancery Court holding that nine black children had the right to attend white public schools. 
Louis L. Redding died Monday, September 28, 1998, at the age of 96. His death is obviously a time of sadness, but also a time to celebrate his truly pioneering life and spirit. 
Time and time again, Redding not only overcame adversity--he excelled in the face of it. He pursued justice persistently and passionately--standing up for equal rights in education, public accommodations and criminal law. 
Redding, a 1928 Harvard University Law School graduate, broke the color barrier in the Delaware Bar after 253 years of this all-Caucasian group. When he took the Delaware Bar Examination with eight other white law school graduates, he was given a different, harder test. He passed with the top grades. After he was admitted to the Delaware Bar in 1929, he remained the only minority attorney in Delaware for another twenty-seven years. 
It even took twenty years for the Delaware State Bar Association to allow him to become a member--and again he excelled in the face of adversity--becoming Vice President of this once all-white Association. 
Redding earned national respect with a series of sweeping civil rights victories in the Delaware courts. In 1950, he successfully argued Parker v. University of Delaware, Del. Ch., 75 A.2d 225 (1950), which held that the University of Delaware's refusal to admit blacks was unconstitutional because the State's black institution, Delaware State College, was woefully inferior. 
He next filed the public school racial segregation case, Belton v. Gebhardt, Del. Ch., 87 A.2d 862 (1952), aff'd, Del. Supr., 91 A.2d 137 (1952). This was the only case ultimately affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Brown. Most Americans associate the name of Redding's distinguished fellow NAACP attorney, Thurgood Marshall, with this school desegregation case, since he achieved greatness as a U.S. Supreme Court Justice. And that's just how Redding preferred it. He preferred a lower profile, using his great skills to get the job done. 
After the U.S. Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision, Redding dedicated his practice to implementing the desegregation order. In 1956, he filed a class action suit in the federal District Court in Delaware seeking to compel a school district to establish a desegregation plan. It took another twenty years for a court order forcing the implementation of this plan. Again, Redding persistently plodded along in the pursuit of justice. 
Redding also set precedent in ending discrimination in public accommodations. In 1961, he won another U.S. Supreme Court case, representing former Wilmington City Councilman William `Dutch' Burton, allowing blacks to eat at the same counter with whites at the Eagle Coffee Shoppe owned by the Wilmington Parking Authority. 
It is worth noting that Redding did not consider the U.S. Supreme Court victories to be his greatest legal achievements. Instead, he said his most significant accomplishment was desegregating Delaware's courtrooms. In an interview in 1990, Redding said:  
I suppose that really what I am most proud of . . . is my undertaking years back to break up segregation in seating in the courtrooms (of Delaware) . . . It was pretty horrible to go into a courtroom and see blacks seated in one place and whites in another. That's the way I found it when I came in. 
Ironically, Redding was not particularly proud of his distinction as the first African-American attorney in Delaware. In a characteristically, blunt, honest statement, Redding once said. `How can you boast about being the first when you realize it was the result of racism and antipathy?' 
And Redding downplayed his role as a civil rights and civil liberties pioneer. In a 1974 speech at Notre Dame University, he said: `I am just a pedestrian, journeyman lawyer who happens to have been practicing in a state where the necessities of the situation made me participate in civil rights activities.' 
The trails Redding blazed, however, set the course for those of us who are humbled to follow in his footsteps. 
On a very personal note, Louis Redding was one of my heroes. His leadership in the civil rights movement got me interested in politics. I first met him in 1969 when I was working as a young, public defender representing many in the black community in civil and criminal cases. 
And make no mistake about it--he commanded respect in the community and in the courtroom. In the black community, he respectfully was known as `Lawyer Redding.' Of course to me, it was never `Lou,' I always said `Mr. Redding, Sir.' Indeed, he was quite a presence in the courtroom, with his tailored, conservative suits and button-down shirts. His standard was excellence, as he fought for the poorest and most discriminated among us. 
Fortunately for us, Louis Redding's legacy and spirit live on in our community, and in his three daughters and five grandchildren. His name also appropriately graces a middle school and the New Castle County/City of Wilmington public building. His bronze statute stands erect surrounded by young children in the pubic square as well. 
Louis L. Redding, noted civil rights attorney, teacher, loyal son, father, and grandfather--we will miss you greatly, and vow to keep your legacy alive.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I support the International Religious Freedom Act presented by the Assistant Majority Leader, the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from Connecticut. 
We have discussed this legislation at some length over the last couple of weeks, and my colleagues have been very gracious in trying to accommodate some of my concerns with the bill. 
Although it is not a perfect bill, it is a compromise that I support. 
The persecution of individuals for their faith, like persecution for political beliefs or ethnicity, is abhorrent to all Americans. Unfortunately, too many nations around the world fail to protect the basic human rights of their citizens. The reasons for this are often complex and varied--but they are never justified. 
What justification can there be, for example, for the jailing by the Chinese government of thousands of dissidents--not to mention a few Catholic leaders who choose to remain loyal to the Vatican, rather than bow to the dictates of the so-called `official' church in Beijing? 
What justification can there be for a law in Russia which appears to discriminate between `established' religious organizations and those whose roots in Russia are not long-standing? 
As a nation founded on the premise that `all men are created equal. . .endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights', Americans have long been committed to promoting and protecting human rights. Existing law, in place since the 1970s, prohibits U.S. assistance to nations which engage in a `consistent pattern of gross violations' of human rights--including the right to religious freedom. Since the 1970s, we have also had an Assistant Secretary of State specifically devoted to the task of advancing human rights. 
In recent years, the Clinton Administration has taken important steps to promote religious freedom. In 1996, Secretary of State Christopher established an Advisory Committee on Religious Persecution Abroad, a 20-member panel which is broadly representative of many religious faiths, and has provided practical guidance to the Secretary and the State Department about this important subject. 
More recently, Secretary of State Albright has appointed a Senior Adviser to take the lead on religious freedom in the State Department. 
This legislation is designed to further elevate religious freedom on our foreign policy agenda. It does so by creating a new Office on International Religious Freedom at the Department of State, to be headed by an Ambassador-at-Large. 
Under this legislation, the State Department will produce a new annual report on religious freedom, which will assess the state of religious freedom around the world. This report, which will expand on the information available in the annual human rights report already produced by the State Department, should prove an invaluable resource to Americans concerned about religious freedom. 
Additionally, a new Commission will be established, for a period of four years, which will serve in an advisory capacity, producing a report of its own on an annual basis which will include recommendations for U.S. policy. 
The bill also contains new provisions of law requiring that the President impose sanctions against the most severe violators of the right to religious freedom. 
I must confess to some skepticism that new sanctions legislation is necessary, for two reasons. First, as I stated, current law already prohibits U.S. assistance to countries which engage in serious human rights violations. 
Second, in recent months I have reconsidered my own view on sanctions policy--and have come to the conclusion that, even though Congress is well within its constitutional power to apply sanctions, it is not always wise, as a matter of sound foreign policy, for Congress to do so. 
But I am willing to go along with this sanctions law because it includes many aspects that I believe must be present in any sanctions law that Congress enacts. Indeed, the sanctions provision in this bill offers considerable flexibility to the President. 
First, the bill provides the President with a `menu' of options--seven different types of sanctions from which the President must choose just one sanction. If the President doesn't like the choices on the menu, he is free to take `commensurate action'--that is, action commensurate to the items on the menu of options. 
Second, the bill provides a broad waiver authority. 
The President may waive the application of the sanction if the foreign government has ceased the violations; if using the waiver would `further the purposes' of the Act; or if important national interests of the United States justified the exercise of the waiver. 
Third, the bill provides that any sanctions sunset two years after they are imposed unless they are specifically reauthorized. 
The President may also terminate the sanctions if the foreign government has `ceased or taken substantial and verifiable steps to cease' the violations that gave rise to the sanctions. 
Fourth, there is an exemption from the sanctions for the provision of food, medicine, medical equipment or supplies, as well as other humanitarian assistance. 
In sum, although I am not eager to enact a new sanctions law, I believe we are setting an important precedent with this bill in terms of what should be contained in any sanctions law. 
We must make every effort to ensure that the steps we take under this law will help those who are suffering from persecution--and not increase the dangers they face. During the hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee on this legislation, several witnesses representing religious communities that operate overseas expressed this concern. 
I know the sponsors of this bill share this concern--and so I hope that both Congress and the Executive Branch will be attentive to it in the coming years. 
This bill takes several steps which I hope will lead to the advancement of religious freedom--one of the fundamental human rights--around the world. 
We must be certain that in implementing this law, it is not to the detriment of other fundamental human rights that are recognized internationally. 
As the columnist Stephen Rosenfeld has written, religious freedom deserves a seat at the human rights table, but it should not overturn the table. 
Mr. President, I see my friend from Pennsylvania on the floor, Senator Specter. I compliment him--he is the one who got me into this, quite frankly--and my colleagues from Oklahoma and from Connecticut. I can claim no credit for starting this initiative. I can only claim that I have attempted to play a role here to make sure that the desire we all have to extend religious freedom around the world becomes a reality. I have tried to make sure that our sanctions meet a realistic test of promoting an actual change in the behavior of other nations. It was toward that end that I worked on a small part of this bill. I attempted to rationalize the sanctions legislation on this issue with what we are attempting to do on all the other sanctions legislation we have around here. 
The thing we have all learned is, unilateral sanctions on any subject seldom ever work. Sometimes, and promoting religious freedom is one of those times, we may have to act even if it is not efficacious, just to state our principled commitment to religious freedom. I recommend my colleagues take a look at this legislation though because I think we have produced a sound sanctions bill. 
For that, I have to thank the authors, Senator Specter and Senator Nickles and Senator Lieberman, for accommodating some of the changes I suggested in the functional way in which these sanctions would be employed. 
I thank them for their consideration. They were very gracious to me and very patient with me. And I am very satisfied with the way the bill has turned out--not only the principle but the efficacy of the legislation. 
I thank my colleague for the extra time, and I yield the floor.  
Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to talk very briefly about the International Monetary Fund and the meeting that took place in Washington yesterday and today and will be taking place this week. 
The eyes of the world are on Washington this week where the major international financial institutions search for answers to the most serious international economic crisis in years. As the world's most successful economy at the moment, the United States bears, in my view, an unavoidable responsibility, and that responsibility is to lead--lead in a search for answers to this crisis. 
But as last year's Asian financial turmoil has evolved into a global financial crisis, to my great disappointment, the House of Representatives persists in what I must say--and I realize it is a strong word--in its irresponsible refusal to approve funding for the International Monetary Fund. 
Twice this year the U.S. Senate has overwhelmingly supported the so-called U.S. quota, our share of a larger capital reserve for the IMF to pull threatened countries back from the brink of economic collapse. And twice this year, the House of Representatives has refused to provide the resources--at no cost to the American taxpayer--that the IMF needs to contain this widening crisis. 
As President Clinton, Secretary Rubin, and our representatives to the international financial institutions in Washington this week urge their counterparts from the rest of the world to join us in controlling the crisis, the response that we are hearing is: `Show us the money.' 
There was a movie out that won an Academy Award, and in that movie, they said, `Show me the money.' We have our Secretary of the Treasury and our President constituting an American plea for the rest of the world to act responsibly, and they are being told, `Show us the money.' I want to point out that even if these other countries ante up their share, the IMF cannot take any action, absent us putting in our share, because you need an 85-percent vote. 
Try as they might, how can we expect our leadership to lead the rest of the world with the albatross of the House's irresponsibility hung squarely around their necks? By failing to provide full funding of our participation in the IMF, we undercut our credibility and our authority, the credibility and the authority of the world's indispensable economic leader, in the most serious international economic crisis, at least of my generation and the Presiding Officer's. 
Go down to these meetings, Mr. President--and I suggest this to all my colleagues--and the first thing you will hear from both our representatives and their counterparts from around the world is the complaint that the U.S. Congress is holding up one of the key elements they need to construct a response to the current crisis: the funds to protect vulnerable economies from financial collapse. 
Every State in the Union--from States as far away as Washington and Delaware--every State in the Union has been hit by the decline in our agricultural and manufacturing exports because of the collapse of major markets for American goods around the world. 
In my own State of Delaware, exports to Asia are down 20 percent compared to last year. That translates into jobs--Delaware jobs. The crisis that began last year in Asia has spiraled around the planet to Russia, a nuclear power facing economic and political collapse, and on to our closest trading partners in Latin America. 
Mr. President, I do not believe it is an exaggeration to say that without the resources to support Brazil and other countries threatened by the wild swings of international capital flows, countries as important to us as Mexico, our third largest trading partner, could be the next to fall. And yet, in my view--and I realize some may disagree, even those who voted with me on funding of IMF in the Senate--in my view, the House continues to play politics with our obligation to the only international institution in the position to attempt to control the spread of economic meltdown. 
Once again, I urge my colleagues in the House to come to their senses, to match the Senate in action and provide the U.S. share for the IMF quota increase. Time is running out, Mr. President. I hope what I read in the papers--what we all read in the papers--that the leadership in the House is about to release this money, about to vote for it, is true, because time is running out and there will be a price to pay for inaction. 
I thank my colleagues. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President. Today I address an issue of extreme importance to both citizens of the United States, and people around the globe. 
It is not often that we have the opportunity to help those in other countries and Americans at the same time. I believe that one of these occasions presents itself now. 
In every area of the world, there are men, women and children in desperate need of food. Some of them are refugees from wars and other forms of political violence. Some of them are displaced because droughts or floods have interfered with their ability to grow food and destroyed their homes. Others are simply too poor to be able to afford the tools and seeds necessary to plant crops. 
This year has been particularly difficult in a variety of places. Most recently, hurricane Georges has ravaged the Caribbean. Nations such as Haiti, where the population is barely able to feed itself, and the Dominican Republic have been heavily damaged by the storm's onslaught. 
Countries in Eastern Europe are experiencing food shortages. Winter is coming to Kosovo, where the Serbian Special Police and Yugoslavian army continue a terrorist policy that has destroyed more that three hundred villages, and driven more than 300,000 ethnic Albanians from their homes, with an estimated 50,000 forced into forests and mountains. With good reason, these people are afraid to return to the villages which have been destroyed and vandalized by the Serbian army. They have left the only means they have of supporting themselves behind. As a result, if we in the international community do not help them, they will not be able to feed themselves. 
Russia faces a sharp decrease in agricultural production, due to drought and other poor weather conditions. Approximately twenty-five percent of farmland was damaged. Consequently, this year's harvest will be Russia's worst in four decades. Collective farms have harvested only a little over half the amount of grain in this year's harvest as they did in 1997. The potato crop, one of Russia's staples, is down significantly due to potato blight. 
The Asian economic crisis is having a significant impact on the ability of those states to feed themselves. Indonesia, with its current financial turmoil is in need of food. Asian countries which normally import American commodities are unable to do so this year, exacerbating our farmers' woes. 
The situation in North Korea remains grave. Floods, droughts and other natural disasters in the past four years have left many without the ability to feed themselves. Malnutrition and related diseases are common throughout the land. One million people have died in North Korea over the past two years. 
Due to climactic conditions and political unrest, there are many in need in Africa. In Sudan alone, experts have indicated that as many as 2.6 million people may go hungry. Mozambique is facing a food crisis which will affect 300,000 people until April of next year. In the northern portions of Sierra Leone, thousands of internally displaced people will face hunger, if not starvation, unless they are provided with aid. 
Here in the United States we face a challenge of a different sort. Far from suffering from a lack of food, American farmers are producing an abundance. Unfortunately, U.S. agricultural exports are expected to decline 4.6 percent from projected 1998 levels, mainly because of the collapse of global markets. 
One third of the family farmers in this country may go out of business in the next several years, with net farm income projected to decrease by $7.5 billion in 1998. We have the food. All we are lacking is strong markets to buy what we are producing. 
Common sense tells us that it is time to bring together our oversupply of domestic agricultural products and the growing international need for food aid. One way to do that is to increase shipments of U.S. agricultural products to countries in need. 
In July of this year, the President took steps to do just that, creating the Food Aid Initiative. This initiative directs the Department of Agriculture to purchase 80 million bushels of grain for distribution to poor countries overseas. The Secretary of Agriculture announced the first disbursement of wheat and wheat flour under the Initiative to the World Food Program on September 15th. I applaud the Administration's creation of this Initiative. The potential of this program in combination with other U.S. food assistance programs to provide relief to hungry people is great, and I support the President's efforts. 
However, we can and should do more. To begin with, the list of countries that the administration has targeted through the Initiative should be expanded. Last week I wrote to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman and Brian Atwood, the Administrator of the Agency of International Development. In those letters, I indicated among other things, that threatened food shortages in Kosovo and Russia must not go unaddressed. 
Not only must we be sure that more countries are being given much needed food, we must be assured that those who are hungry are actually receiving the food. Unfortunately, in some instances, access to food donations is prevented by people in needy nations who either want the food themselves, wish to profit from victims of famine or wish to control the needy population by denying them life's most basic necessities. 
In addition to donating to more countries, we should donate more food. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, in the United States today there is a surplus of 6.3 million metric tons or 233 million bushels of wheat. There are several programs through which we can help solve both our domestic and our international problems. 
The first is the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, commonly referred to as P.L. 480, Food for Peace. This legislation contains three food aid titles. Title One's objective is to make it easier for lesser developed countries to buy American commodities. To this end, commodities are sold to certain countries for US dollars on concessional credit terms. 
Title Two is the Emergency and Private Assistance Programs. This is where the bulk of our humanitarian donations in the form of food aid come from. This year Title Two was funded at the level that the president requested. Unfortunately, given the number of humanitarian disasters that we are currently facing, this may not be enough. It is my hope that the President will ask for more money for this program. 
Title Three is the Food for Development Program, under which government to government grants are provided to support the long-term development efforts of those countries that are attempting improve their economic outlooks. 
The second program through which we can help address the domestic and overseas challenges we are facing is Section 416(b) of the Agricultural Act of 1949. Through Section 416(b), commodities held by the Commodities Credit Corporation can be donated overseas. This is the program through which the President ordered the purchase of $250 million of wheat in July. 
The Food for Progress Act of 1985 is the third program the United States can utilize to address both the American farm crises and dire international need. Food for Progress provides commodities either purchased with funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation, or through P.L. 480 or Section 416(b), as donations to countries that are committing to the increase of free enterprise practices in their agricultural sectors. 
I strongly support an aggressive funding of these programs, and have urged the administration to be aggressive in its requests to the Congress as it evaluates the increasing needs overseas and the opportunity to assist our farmers here at home. If we diligently pursue all of our options through current law, I believe that we can help alleviate two very significant and pressing problems. The overabundance of agricultural commodities plaguing American farmers, and the lack of food for starving millions abroad. 
I urge my colleagues in Congress consider the full range of resources and programs at our disposal to help end the dilemma facing the farmers of our nation. Implementing a solution to this problem will require that we use all of the creativity and energy that we have. Every day brings us closer to real crises not only in our farm economy, but also in countries important to our national interest. 
Such aid is not only clearly in our interest. It would reflect our highest values by preventing the widespread hunger and suffering of men, women and children who had no hand in the tragedies that have befallen their countries. 
Again, I urge my colleagues to give this issue prompt and serious attention. I thank the chair and yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, during the past 26 years as a U.S. Senator, I, like all who sit here, have been confronted with some of the most significant issues that have faced our Nation in the last quarter century--issues ranging from who sits on the highest court of the land, the Supreme Court, to whether or not we should go to war. These and others are, obviously, weighty issues. But none of the decisions has been more awesome, or more daunting, or more compelling than the issue of whether to impeach a sitting President of the United States of America, a responsibility that no Senator will take lightly. 
As imposing as this undertaking is, I am sad to say that I have had to contemplate this issue twice during my service as a U.S. Senator--once during the term of President Richard Milhous Nixon, and now. 
While the circumstances surrounding these two events are starkly different, the consequences are starkly the same. The gravity of removing a sitting President from office is the same today as it was 26 years ago. And 26 years ago as a much younger U.S. Senator, I took to the floor on April 10, 1974, and said the following: 
In the case of an impeachment trial, the emotions of the American people would be strummed, as a guitar, with every newscast and each edition of the daily paper in communities throughout the country. The incessant demand for news or rumors of news--whatever its basis of legitimacy--would be overwhelming. The consequential impact on the Federal institutions of government would be intense--and not necessarily beneficial. This is why my plea today [that was 1974] is for restraint on the part of all parties involved in the affair. 
It is somewhat presumptuous for any Senator to quote himself. But I cite it to point out that my views then with a Republican President are the same as my views today with the Democratic U.S. President. It is time for all parties involved in this affair to show restraint. 
I rise today because I believe that we are not exercising the restraint as we should. Those words that I said 24 years ago have an uncanny ring to them. Furthermore, in 1974, I urged my colleagues in the U.S. Senate during the Watergate period to learn from the story of Alice in Wonderland. I cautioned then that they remember Alice's plight when the Queen declared, `Sentence first and verdict afterwards.' But the need for restraint then is even greater now than it was in 1974. 
The impeachment question then was not as politically charged as it is today. In 1974, we were willing to hear all the evidence before we made any decision. We had men like Howard Baker and Sam Ervin. We had men like Chairman Peter Rodino. We had Democrats and Republicans. I remember a brilliant young Senator from Maine, who was then a Congressman named William Cohen, a Republican, and now our Secretary of Defense. He was a Congressman from Maine. I remember how serious they took the process, how much restraint they showed, and how bipartisan their actions were. 
Today, I hope for our Nation's sake--not the President's, but for our Nation's sake--that we don't follow the Queen's directive in Alice in Wonderland to `sentence first and verdict afterwards,' and that we will make a wise judgment about the fate of the President after deliberate consideration. 
My legal training combined with more than a quarter of century of experience in the U.S. Senate, a significant part of that as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has taught me several important lessons. Two of these are lessons that I believe are appropriate now. First is that an orderly society must first care about justice; and, second, all that is constitutionally permissible may not be just or wise. 
Let me repeat the latter. All that is constitutionally permissible to do may be not wise to do, or may not be just in the doing. 
It is with these two very important lessons guiding me that I embark upon a very important decision involving our country, our Constitution and our President. The power to overturn and undo a popular election by the people for the first time in our Nation's history must be exercised with great care and with sober deliberation. 
We should not forget that 47.4 million Americans voted for our President in 1996, and 8.2 million voted for the President's opponent. We should also not forget, as I tell my students in the constitutional law class I teach on separation of powers, that the entire essence of our constitutional system is built upon the notion of the consent of the governed, and when we deign to overturn a decision of the governed, we are on very thin ice. 
I believe Members of Congress should begin their deliberation with a thorough understanding of the impeachment process. They should understand what the framers of the Constitution intended the standard of impeachment to be. I have heard no discussion of that issue thus far. And, further, how the framers of the Constitution intended the process to work; again, I have heard no discussion of that thus far. 
Let me say at the outset that what President Clinton did and acknowledged to have done is reprehensible. It was, at a minimum, a horrible lapse in judgment, and it has brought shame upon him personally. It has brought shame upon the Office of the Presidency, and his actions have hurt his family, his friends, his supporters, the causes for which he fights, and the country as a whole. I am confident that he fully understands the gravity of what he has done now. 
Let me also say that I have made no judgment. I have not made any decision on what I think should happen. I have not come to any conclusion as to consequences the President should face for his shameful behavior, because I believe the oath of office that I have taken on five solemn occasions--four which were right here in the well, and one which was in a hospital in Wilmington, DE--on those five occasions, the oath that I took I believe precludes me, and I will respectfully suggest any other Senator, from prejudging, as I and all other Senators may be required to serve as the Constitution dictates, as judge and juror in what may become the trial of this century. 
I can only make--and I would respectfully suggest all of us can only make--an assessment after hearing all the evidence, evidence against the President and evidence in support of the President. No one knows, to the best of my knowledge, but the Lord Almighty, how all this will turn out. However, because this is the second time in my career I have had to face this awesome responsibility, I have given this topic a great deal of thought and consideration and would like to explore, with the indulgence of the Presiding Officer, some of the issues that I believe will surely confront responsible Members of Congress and all Americans as we enter this difficult period in our history. 
Mr. President, the framers of the Constitution who met in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787 considered--and this is a fact little known, at least little spoken to--offering this country a Constitution that did not include the power to impeach the President. Let me reemphasize that. The founders considered not including in our Constitution the power to remove the President from office. After all, they reasoned, any wrongs against the public would be dealt with by turning the President out in the next election. To overturn an election, which I will speak to in a moment, would lend itself to political chicanery. 
One delegate to the Constitutional Convention, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina, worried that the threat of impeachment would place the President under the thumb of a hostile Congress, thereby weakening the independence of the office and threatening the doctrine upon which our Constitution was built--the separation of powers. According to James Madison's notes, Pinckney called impeachment a `rod' that Congress would hold over the President. 
In being reluctant to include any impeachment power, the framers were not trying to create an imperial Presidency. In fact, what they were worried about was protecting all American citizens against the tyranny of a select group. In their view, the separation of powers constituted one of the most powerful means for protecting individual liberty, because it prevented Government power from being concentrated in any single branch of Government. To make the separation of powers work properly, they reasoned, each branch must be sufficiently strong and independent from the other so that the power of one branch could not be encroached upon by the other. 
The framers were concerned that any process whereby the legislative branch, the branch they deemed `the most dangerous,' could sit in judgment of a President who would be vulnerable to the abuse of partisan faction which, as my friend and Presiding Officer and gifted lawyer knows, was one of the overwhelming, recurring concerns of the founders--partisan politics. They feared that this most dangerous branch could sit in judgment of a President who would be vulnerable to abuse by partisan factions. 
Federalist No. 65 begins its defense of the impeachment process which ultimately was included by warning of the dangers of the abuse--of the abuse--of the power. It argues, Federalist 65, that is, that impeachment:  
. . . will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide them into parties, more or less friendly or inimical, to the accused. In many cases, it will connect itself with the preexisting factions, and will enlist all their animosities, particularities, influence and interest on one side, or on the other; and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of the parties than by the real demonstration of guilt or innocence. 
Don't you find it kind of fascinating that the Federalist Papers, which were the 1787-1788-1789 version of advertising to sell the Constitution, don't you think it fascinating, instead of them writing about, warning about the abuse of power by the President requiring impeachment, they wrote about and were concerned about and more debate was conducted about the abuse of power by political factions in the legislative branch to overturn the will of the American people? 
So the framers were fully aware that the impeachment process could become partisan attacks on the President--charged with animosities generated by all manner of trials, prior struggles and disagreements over executive branch decisions, over policy disputes, over resentment at losing the prior election, and God only knows what else. 
Federalist No. 65 expresses the view that the use of impeachment to vindicate any of these animosities would actually be an abuse of power. So the power that they were at least equally in part worried about being abused was the partisan power of a legislative body to overturn a decision of the American people--giving too much power to the legislative branch at the expense of the executive branch, thereby diluting the separation of powers doctrine, concentrating it too much in one place and thereby jeopardizing the liberty and freedom of individual Americans. 
This sentiment that I referred to about the abuse of power by this body and the House is as true today as it was when the Constitution was being written. It was also true when Richard Nixon faced impeachment in 1974. In fact, it would have been wrong for Richard Nixon to have been removed from office based upon a purely partisan vote. No President should be removed from office merely because one party enjoys a commanding lead in either House of Congress. And I would remind my colleagues that when I arrived here in 1973, and when the Nixon hearings were going on in 1974, the Democratic Party--and he was obviously a Republican--enjoyed an overwhelming, commanding plurality of votes. My recollection is there were roughly 64 Democratic Members of the Senate at the time, and a prohibitively large plurality of Democrats in the House of Representatives. 
In fact, it would have been wrong then, as it would be wrong now, to have removed him based upon the power that was in the hands of one party. No President should be removed merely because one party enjoys a commanding lead in either House of Congress. 
Yet, while the framers knew that the impeachment process could become partisan, they needed to deal with the strong anti-Federalist factions that jeopardized the possibility of the Constitution being ratified by the requisite number of States. The anti-Federalists strenuously argued that the Federal Government would quickly get out of step with the sentiments of the people and become vulnerable to corruption and intrigue, arrogance and tyranny. These charges proved close to fatal as the ratifying conventions in the States took up the proposed Constitution. 
It was with this looming danger in mind, of losing the ratification fight, that the Federalists decided to include the impeachment provision in the Constitution. The framers of the Constitution knew that the Constitution would have been even more vulnerable to charges of establishing a government remote from the people if the President were not subject to removal except at the next election. 
James Madison's notes, again, of the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention, record his observations of the debate, where he said he: 
. . . thought it indispensable that some provision should be made for defending the community against the incapacity, negligence or perfidy of the chief magistrate, [that is, the President]. The limitation of the period of his service was not a sufficient security. He might lose his capacity after his appointment. He might pervert his administration into a scheme of speculation or oppression. He might betray his trust to foreign powers. 
So, those concerns, those concerns expressed by Madison about whether or not the President might lose his ability to lead, might `pervert his administration to a scheme of speculation or oppression, might betray his trust to a foreign power'--they were thought to be sufficient reason to include the power of impeachment in the Constitution. So, in the end, the framers of the Constitution risked the abuse of power by the Congress to gain the advantages of impeachment. 
Once the decision to include the power of impeachment had been made, the remainder of the debate on the impeachment clause focused on two issues. The first debate, which we do not even talk about, was whether or not to give the power to the Congress to impeach, and weighed the advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantage was, it would lead to partisan bickering and abuse of power by the Congress. But that was outweighed, ultimately, in their minds, by the process that a President could and might subvert the interests of this country to a foreign power or subvert the office to oppress the people or to take advantage of the office in a way that was inappropriate in the minds of the American people. 
Once that decision was made, though, they then focused on, OK, we are going to include it, but--but--what was supposed to constitute an impeachable offense? Put another way, what was the standard going to be that they expected the Congress to use? And then they said: After we decide that, we have to decide how is impeachment to work? How is the process to be undertaken? And what were the procedures that should be set down as to how to approach such an awesome undertaking? 
As we shall see, the framers proved unable to separate these two issues entirely. Understanding how they are entwined, however--that is, the question of what constitutes an impeachable offense and how is the mechanism to work--understanding how these two issues are intertwined, I believe, will help us to understand the full implications of the power that the Constitution gives those of us who serve in the Congress. The Constitution provides that the House of Representatives shall have the power to impeach--article I, section 2, clause 5. 
The framers' decision that the House of Representatives would initiate the charges of impeachment follows the pattern of the English Parliament, where the House of Lords initiates charges of impeachment. Beyond this, the choice--the choice of the House being given this power--must have seemed fairly compelled by two related considerations. 
The first, already mentioned, was the need to provide the people as a whole with assurances that the Government they were being asked to create would be responsive to the interests and concerns of the people themselves. So what better place to go than the people's house, the House of Representatives? 
The second reason for the House being given this power to initiate was the framers' substantive understanding of the impeachment power. It was a power to hold accountable Government officers who had, in Hamilton's terms, committed `an abuse or violation of some public trust,' thereby committing an injury `done immediately to the society itself.' 
Keep in mind what they are talking about here--at least what Hamilton was talking about--as to what constituted the kind of offense that was contemplated to be impeachable: Something that was an abuse or violation of the public trust and done immediately to the society itself. 
If the gravamen of an impeachment is the breach of public trust, no branch of the Federal Government could have seemed more appropriate to initiate such a proceeding than the House of Representatives, which was conceived and defended as the Chamber most in tune with the people's sympathies and hence most appropriate to reflect the people's views as to whether the society itself was done immediate harm. 
The Constitution further provides that the President shall be `removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.' Article 2, section 4 of the U.S. Constitution. 
The Constitution provides that `the House of Representatives shall . . . have the . . . Power of Impeachment.' Article I, section 2, clause 5. And the Senate shall remove from office on `Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.' 
This language, the language about what he should be removed for, went through several changes during the summer of 1787. In the initial drafts, the grounds for impeachment--once the debate was over as to whether or not to include impeachment as a power--the initial drafts, the grounds for impeachment, were restricted to treason and bribery alone, period; nothing else--not another single thing. 
I remind my friends who call themselves strict constructionists--I have run into them over my 26-year career and, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, have had numerous debates with now Supreme Court Justices, and some who are not Supreme Court Justices, on what is the proper methodology for interpreting the Constitution. Those who view themselves as strict constructionists say the words, if their plain meaning is clear, control. 
Initially this debate, once impeachment was decided upon as a power that would be granted to the Congress, included impeachable offenses for only two purposes: Treason or bribery. 
When the matter was brought up on September 8, 1787, George Mason, of Virginia, inquired as to why the grounds should be restricted only to those two provisions. He reasoned that there are other ways the public trust in government can be abused, so why only these two? He argued:  
Attempts to subvert the Constitution may not be treason as above defined. 
So, accordingly, he moved to add the word `maladministration' as a third ground for impeachment. 
James Madison objected to Mason's motion, contending that to add `so vague a term'--the term being maladministration--to add `so vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure during the pleasure of the Senate.' 
Or put another way, if you said `maladministration,' the majority party in the House and the Senate could at any time overturn an election by alleging maladministration. So Madison came along and said, `I understand what you are trying to do, old George, to Mason'--my words, not theirs--`I understand what you are trying to do here; we acknowledge that you can violate the public trust and abuse the office to do injury to the American people other than by treason and bribery.' But if you read Madison's notes, if you read the debate, as I have, I challenge you to find an interpretation other than essentially what I am giving you here, which is this: `But, George, if you put maladministration on, it will be subject to too much--too much--abuse. And, George, I acknowledge that something beyond treason and bribery can do harm. But, George, let's be careful what we add.' 
They debated it. James Madison objected to the motion, as I said, because it was vague and here, again, we see the worry that impeachment would be misused by the Congress to reduce the independence of the President, allowing partisan factions to interfere at the expense of the larger public good and overturning the election or the consent of the governed being attacked because separation of powers had been reduced. 
The objection on the part of Madison proved effective, because Mason subsequently withdrew the motion and came up with another phrase, and you know what the phrase was. It said: '. . .or other high crimes and misdemeanors.' 
Obviously, the context in which `high crimes and misdemeanors' was entered was to be something a heck of a lot more than maladministration and less than treason or bribery, or at least equal to. 
What does this phrase mean? It is clear the framers thought it to be limited in scope, but beyond this, constitutional scholars of whom I have inquired and read have been debating the meaning of this phrase from the very early days of the Republic, and there is not a clear consensus. Despite this ongoing dialog and disagreement, though, I believe there are two important points of agreement in the minds of almost all constitutional scholars as to the original understanding of the phrase.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, despite this dialog, as I indicated, scholars agree on two important points and a third issue where the weight of history suggests subtle practice. Let me speak to that. 
As we already have seen, the framers did not intend that the President could be impeached for maladministration alone. Second, a great deal of evidence from outside the convention shows that both the framers and the ratifiers saw `high crimes and misdemeanors' as pointing to offenses that are serious, not petty, offenses that are public or political, not private or personal. 
In 1829, William Rawle authored one of the early commentaries on the Constitution of the United States. In it, Rawle states that `the legitimate causes of impeachment . . . can only have reference to public character and official duty. 
He went on to say:  
In general, those offences which may be committed equally by a private person as a public officer are not-- 
Emphasis, not-- 
the subjects of impeachment. 
In addition, more than 150 years ago, Joseph Story, as my learned colleague who is presiding knows was a lawyer, Joseph Story and his influential commentaries on the Constitution stated that impeachment is `ordinarily' a remedy for offenses `of a political character,' `growing out of personal misconduct, or gross neglect, or usurpation, or habitual disregard of the public interests, in the discharge of the duties of political office.' 
The public character of the impeachment offense is further reinforced by the limited nature of the remedy for the offense. In the English tradition, which we rejected, impeachments were punishable by fines, imprisonment or even death. 
In contrast, the American Constitution completely separates the issue of criminal sanctions from the issue of removal from office. 
Our Constitution states that, `Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or Profit under the United States. * * * ' Article I, section 3, clause 7. 
The remedy for violations of the public's trust in the performance of one's official duties, in other words, is limited to removal from that office and disqualification from holding further office; remedies that, I might add, correspond nicely to the public nature of the offenses in the first instance. 
Additional support comes from another commentator, James Wilson, a delegate to the Convention from Pennsylvania. In his lectures on the Constitution, Wilson wrote: 
In the United States and Pennsylvania, impeachments are confined to political characters, to political crimes and misdemeanors, and to political punishments. 
All in all, the evidence is quite strong that impeachment was understood as a remedy for abuse of official power, breaches of public trust, or other derelictions of the duties of office. 
The third point to make about the scope of the impeachment power is this: To be impeachable, an offense does not have to be a breach of the criminal law. 
The renowned constitutional scholar and personal friend and adviser, the late Phillip Kurland, the leading constitutional scholar of this century, I argue, wrote that: 
At both the convention that framed the Constitution and at the conventions that ratified it, the essence of an impeachable offense was thought to be breach of trust and not violation of criminal law. And this was in keeping with the primary function of impeachment, removal from office. 
If you put the notion that an impeachable offense must be a serious breach of an official trust or duty, together with the point that it does not have to be a criminal violation, you reach the conclusion that not all crimes are impeachable, and not every impeachable offense need be a crime. 
These points provide important anchors for any impeachment inquiry, but they do not resolve all the questions of scope that may arise. Much remains to be worked out, and only to be worked out, in the context of particular circumstances and allegations. As Hamilton explained in Federalist 65 impeachment `can never be tied down by * * * strict rules, either in the delineation of the offense by the prosecutors or in the construction of it by the judges. * * *' 
After all the legal research, we are still left with the realization that the power to convict for impeachment constitutes an `awful discretion.' 
This brings us directly to the Senate's role. To state it bluntly, I believe the role of the U.S. Senate is to resolve all the remaining questions. Let me elaborate. 
The Senate's role as final interpreter of impeachments was recognized from the beginning of the Republic. For example, to refer again to Joseph Story, after he devoted almost 50 sections of his commentaries to various disputed questions about the impeachment power, he concluded that the final decision on the unresolved issues relating to impeachment `may be reasonably left to the high tribunal, constituting the court of impeachment.' 
I.e., the U.S. Senate, the floor upon which I stand. 
The court of impeachment, the Senate, similarly was viewed in the Federalist Papers and referred to Senators as the judges of impeachment. Speaking of the Senate as the jury in impeachment trials is perhaps a more common analogy these days as you turn on your television and hear many of us speak. But the judge analogy is a more accurate analogy than the juror analogy. 
In impeachment trials, the Senate certainly does sit as a finder of fact, as a jury does. But it also sits as a definer of the acceptable standards upon which the President is being judged, as a judge would do. The Senate, in other words, determines not only whether the accused has performed the acts that form the basis for the House of Representatives' articles of impeachment but also whether those actions justify removal from office. 
So let's lay to rest this idea that if the President--any President--is impeached by the House of Representatives, and specific articles are alleged of violations, and we find the President violated the very charge that the House has made--that does not mean we must vote for impeachment, for we can reject the grounds upon which the House impeached in the first instance as being not sufficiently sound to meet `high crimes and misdemeanors.' There is no question about that, and yet it seems to be a question in the minds of the press. There is no question about that. 
Once again, we find support for this view from our country's history. In two of the first three impeachments brought forward from the House to the U.S. Senate, the Senate acquitted the accused. In each of the two acquittals, however, the Senate did not disagree with the House on the facts. 
One case involved a Senator, William Blount, the other an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, Samuel Chase. In neither one was there any question that the individual had done the deeds that formed the basis of the House's articles of impeachment. Yet in each case the Senate concluded that the deeds were not sufficient to constitute valid grounds for impeachment, and so they acquitted. 
Eventually then, if the current impeachment proceeds, it will fall to the Senate to decide not only the facts but the law and to evaluate whether or not the specific actions of the President are sufficiently serious to warrant being thrown out of office--being convicted. 
The framers intended that the Senate have as its objective doing what was best for the country, taking context and circumstances fully into account. 
I should try to be as clear as I can about this point because the media discussions have come close to missing it. It seems to be widely assumed that if the President committed perjury, for example, then he must be impeached, and he must be convicted if the Senate concludes he perjured himself. Conversely, you may think that unless it can be proven that the President committed perjury, or violated some other criminal statute, that impeachment cannot occur. Both sentiments and statements are wrong. 
Recall what I said earlier: Not all crimes are impeachable offenses and not every impeachable offense need be a crime to throw a President out of office. 
The Senate, for example, could decline to convict, even if the President had committed perjury, if it concluded that under the circumstances this perjury did not constitute a sufficiently serious breach of duty toward removal of the President. There is no question about that either. 
On the other hand, the Senate could convict a President of an impeachable offense even if it were not a violation of the criminal law. For instance, if the Senate concluded that the President had committed abuses of power sufficiently grave, it need not find any action to amount to a violation of some criminal statute. 
Let me give you an example. If there was overwhelming proof that every day the President came to his office, the Oval Office, drunk, that is not a crime, but it is impeachable--it is impeachable--committing no crime, but is impeachable. Conversely, if the Senate can conclude that the President lied about whether or not he had an affair, they could conclude that did not constitute an impeachable offense warranting expulsion. Now, again I am not prejudging what we should decide, but I think it is very important we understand what latitude and obligations we have. 
Let me now stand back from the issue of substance and procedure and look at the impeachment mechanism as it has actually functioned in our country's history. The proof of the framers' design, after all, will be in how the mechanism has worked in practice. 
I am almost finished, Mr. President. 
As we have seen, the framers worried that impeaching a sitting President would most likely be highly charged with partisan politics and preexisting factions, enlisting, as they said, all of the `animosities, partialities, and influence and interest' that inevitably swirl around a sitting President. History shows, Mr. President, they had it right from the get-go. They had it right. And they were right to worry about it. 
Prior to the case of President Nixon, Presidential impeachment had only been used for partisan purposes. History tells us that John Tyler was an enormously unpopular President, facing a hostile Congress dominated by his arch political enemy, Henry Clay--one of the several people younger than me when he got here. He was an amazing guy. Here he was, a leader in the House of Representatives before he was 25, and he became a U.S. Senator before he was 30. 
During the impeachment effort of John Tyler, what he was facing, Tyler, was a hostile Congress dominated by the young Henry Clay. After several years of continual clashes, numerous Presidential vetoes, and divisive conflicts with the Senate over appointments, a select committee of the House issued a report recommending a formal impeachment inquiry. 
President Tyler, not being as dumb as everyone thought, reached out to his political enemies. How did he do that? He signed an important bill raising tariffs, which had been one of the reasons that there was such animosity between him and Henry Clay and his friends. He raised tariffs which he had formerly opposed. And he found other means of cooperation with Congress. 
In the end, even Henry Clay, speaking from the floor of the U.S. Senate, urged the slowdown on the impeachment proceedings that he had moved to initiate, suggesting instead a lesser action of a `want of confidence.' `Want of confidence'--does it sound familiar? Does it sound at all like the idea of having the President sanctioned in some way other than impeachment? Does it sound like censuring the President? `Want of confidence.' 
So Clay suggested that a `want of confidence' vote, rather than a formal impeachment proceeding, might be better. So in early 1843, the resolution to proceed with an impeachment--whether to proceed with the impeachment inquiry, was defeated on the House floor, 127-83. They had already begun the process of inquiry, and along came Tyler, and he said, `I'll make peace with you.' 
In 1868, Andrew Johnson came much closer to conviction on charges of serious misconduct. No southerner will be unaware of--I ask unanimous consent that I be able to proceed for another 10 minutes.

Mr. BIDEN. As every southern Senator knows, Andrew Johnson came much closer to conviction on the charges of serious misconduct. Although Johnson's impeachment proceedings ostensibly focused on his disregarding the Tenure in Office Act, historians--and not a single southerner does not understand--but historians uniformly agree that the true sources of opposition to President Johnson were policy disagreements and personal animosity. 
The conflict this time was between Johnson's moderate post-Civil War policies toward the Southern States and the overwhelming Republican majorities in both Chambers. The Republicans feared dilution of their voting strength if the southerners were seated. 
Johnson's defenders in the Senate were eventually able to hold on to barely enough votes to prevent his conviction. In Professor Raoul Berger's view, `Johnson's trial serves as a frightening reminder that in the hands of a passion-driven Congress, the process may bring down the very pillars of our constitutional system.' 
Yet, if the cases of Tyler and Johnson substantiate the framers' fears, the Nixon situation vindicates the utility of the impeachment procedures. Notice how different the Nixon proceedings were from Tyler's and Johnson's. As the Nixon impeachment process unfolded, there was broad bipartisan consensus each step of the way. I was there at the time. 
While it would have been foolish to believe that Members of Congress did not worry about the partisan political repercussions of their actions, such factional considerations did not dominate decision making. 
Political friends and foes of the President agreed that the charges against the President were serious, that they warranted further inquiry and, once there was definitive evidence of serious complicity and wrongdoing, a consensus emerged that impeachment should be invoked. The President resigned after the House Judiciary Committee voted out articles of impeachment by a 28-10 vote. 
For me, several lessons stand out from our constitutional understanding of the impeachment process and our historical experience with it. Furthermore, I believe that a consensus has developed on several important points. 
While the founders included impeachment powers in the Constitution, they were concerned by the potential partisan abuse. We should be no less aware of the dangers of partisanship. As we have seen, the process functions best when there is a broad bipartisan consensus behind moving ahead. The country is never well served when either policy disagreements or personal animosities drive the process. 
Many scholars who have studied the Constitution have concluded that it should be reserved for offenses that are abuses of the public trust or abuses that relate to the public nature of the President's duties. Remember, what is impeachable is not necessarily criminal and what is criminal is not necessarily impeachable. 
The Senate in particular has wide latitude in determining the outcome of this constitutional process. Just because the House may initiate an impeachment process does not mean that the Senate will conclude that the process with a vote on articles of impeachment was a correct process. It is well within our constitutional responsibilities to consider alternatives to impeachment if we find that circumstances warrant these alternatives. 
I don't know that they will and I don't know that we will get there, but again, the debate is being waged as to whether or not it is in our constitutional power to consider alternatives. Remember Senator Henry Clay's `want of confidence.' 
There is no one-size-fits-all definition of impeachable offenses, divorced from such practical considerations. The Senate in particular, has an obligation to consider the full range of consequences of removing the President from Office. 
In recent days, some have suggested that because the Starr Report provides a prima facie case and prima facie evidence of what are arguably impeachable offenses, the House and the Senate have a constitutional responsibility to see the impeachment process through to its conclusion. 
In my view, the constitutional history that I have sketched here and more shows this position is entirely mistaken. Indeed, if anything, history shows a thoroughly understandable reluctance to have the procedure invoked in the first place. 
Stopping short of impeachment would not be reaching a solution `outside the Constitution.' It would be entirely compatible and consistent with what the Founders contemplated, if that is what we decide. Again, I am not prejudging what we should decide. 
The 28th Congress hardly violated its constitutional duty when the House decided that, all things considered, terminating impeachment proceedings after cooperation between the Congress and the President improved was a better course of action than proceeding with impeachment based on his past actions, even though it apparently did so for reasons no more laudable than those that initiated the process in the first place. 
Impeachment was and remains an inherently political process, with all the pitfalls and promises that are thus put into play by politics. Nothing in the document precludes the Congress from seeking means to resolve this or any other putative breach of duty short of removing him from office. In fact, the risky and potentially divisive nature of the impeachment process may counsel in favor of utilizing it only as an absolute last resort where there is no shadow of a doubt that it meets, the criteria of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdeameanors. 
Of course, impeachment ought to be used if the breach of duty is serious enough--what the Congress was prepared to do in the case of Richard Nixon was the correct course of action. However, nothing in the constitution precludes the Congress from resolving this conflict in a manner short of impeachment. 
The critical question--the question with which the country is currently struggling--is whether the President's breaches of conduct and shameful activity, which are now well known and which have been universally condemned, warrant the ultimate political sanction. Are they serious enough to warrant removal from office? 
In answering that, we need to ask ourselves, What is in the best interests of the United States of America? That is something that the founders contemplated us asking ourselves if and when faced with this question. 
While I have not decided ultimately what should happen, I do want to suggest that it certainly is constitutionally permissible to consider a middle ground as a resolution of this matter. Such an approach might bring together those of the President's detractors who believe there is a need for some sanction, but are willing to stop short of impeachment, as well as those of the President's supporters who reject impeachment, but are willing to consider that some sanction ought to be implemented. 
As a country, Mr. President, we have not often faced decisions as stark and potentially momentous as the impeachment of a President of the United States. On the other hand, we would be wise not to overstate such claims. Surely we have faced some moments as stark and serious as this one. We have survived those moments and we will survive this one no matter how we handle it. As my dad always says, and he is going on 85 years of age, I remember over the last 26 years going home and saying, `Dad, this is a catastrophe,' and he would look at me and say, `Joe, this country is so good, it is so strong, it is so solid, that it can stand 4 or 8 years of anybody or 
anything.' And he is right. He is right. So I don't want to exaggerate this. 
Whatever the outcome of the present situation, I'm confident that our form of government and the strength of our country present us not with a constitutional crisis but rather with a constitutional framework and flexibility to deal responsibly with the decisions we face in the coming months. My purpose in rising today is to remind all of us of what that constitutional framework and flexibility mean, what they are. 
In my closing plea I begin where I started, as a young Senator in April of 1974. This is a time for us to be cautious. This is a time for Members of this body to hold our fire. This is the time to be prepared to exercise our responsibility to be judge and jury after, and only after, all of the facts are presented to us. This is not a constitutional crisis but it is a serious, serious business. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I support the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999. Naming this bill after my good friend Strom Thurmond is a fitting tribute to one of the Senate's greatest defenders of America's military interests. I urge everyone to take a minute to read Section 1, which highlights Senator Thurmond's distinguished record of service and leadership. 
As always, finding the right compromises to protect our national security while still living within our budget caps has been hard. Recent events in Iraq and Kosovo, and the attack on our embassies in Tanzania and Kenya are stark reminders of why our diplomatic efforts must be supported by a robust military. 
I compliment the Committee on Armed Services, under the leadership of Chairman Thurmond and Senator Levin, for its dedicated effort to address some of our nation's critical national security needs. While I do not agree with everything in the conference report, on balance I believe this bill does a great deal of good. 
On the personnel front, I know that all of us are pleased with the 3.6 percent pay raise. We know that our patriotic men and women in uniform do not serve in order to make money, but that doesn't change the needs of their families and themselves for adequate recompense. This is a solid step in the right direction. 
Along the same lines, I thank the conferees for joining me in supporting an increase in hazardous duty incentive pay for mid- and senior level enlisted aircrew personnel. This necessary increase reflects our commitment to the experienced aircrew personnel without whom our planes could not fly vital missions in Bosnia and Iraq. 
I was also pleased to see that this bill recognized the increasingly vital role of our Guard and Reserve personnel in the new Total Force. As that old Oldsmobile commercial said, `this is not your father's' military. Guard and Reserve personnel are absolutely vital to meeting America's leadership commitments around the world, to protecting communities here at home, and to defending national security. Among other things, this bill authorizes the payment of selective reenlistment bonuses, increased funding for Guard and Reserve training, the restoration of up to 800 military technicians (dual-status), and funds for the Guard's Youth ChalleNGe program and STARBASE program. 
The conference report continues Congress's effort to address the strains on our ability to provide high quality health care to our military retirees. Both houses of Congress are agreed that more work needs to be done in this area and the demonstration projects included in this year's bill are part of that process. 
In looking at some of the provisions in this bill that address foreign relations issues, I am less sanguine. As I said when the Senate dealt with this bill, I do not support the Sense of Congress provision that endorses NATO missions with ground forces that would not include any American troops. This is a dangerous precedent that encourages the erosion of American leadership in NATO. 
This bill also addressed satellite transfers. While we do not want to handicap America's satellite manufacturers and telecommunications firms, the most important consideration must always be to safeguard national security. The changes made in the licensing system appear to make sense, despite their being adopted on the basis of a very incomplete analysis of a complex issue. Transferring licensing authority back to the State Department--the same agency that licensed the controversial Loral satellite launch in February 1996--may help, so long as the State Department is given the resources to do the job right. This conference report permits the Department of State to keep all the fees it collects for registration by the Office of Defense Trade Controls--the office which administers licenses for military exports--a sensible approach that is also contained in the Department of State authorization bill. Now the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations conference must adopt a similar provision; otherwise we will be giving the State Department an unfunded mandate that it will be unable to fulfill. We run the risk of exacerbating the problem of perpetually under funding of our foreign policy tools. 
One provision addressing foreign policy that I was very pleased to see retained is the amendment that I authored calling for a report on the peaceful employment of former Soviet experts on weapons of mass destruction. The slightly revised provision is now found at section 1309. Section 1309 requires detailed reporting on the former Soviet experts who are at risk of recruitment by a rogue state or terrorist group. I am confident that this language will not require the Department of Defense to produce an impossibly detailed analysis. I am pleased to note that the revised provision will permit the Secretary of Defense to inform Congress of ways to increase the number of former Soviet arms experts whom we assist in their transitions into new occupations. That is a vital national security objective, and it will become even more vital in the coming years as Russia's nuclear establishment is substantially downsized and more of their nuclear weapons experts are left to find new ways to earn a living. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act is a comprehensive bill that addresses many of our military needs. As I have said, there are some provisions that concern me. But, overall, I believe this bill provides some of the bricks that make up the foundation of our national security policy. It takes important steps to improve the quality of life for our most critical national security asset--our military personnel. My overall concern continues to be that it should not take terrorist attacks to realize that spending more on our first line of defense--our foreign policy--is an equally vital part of our national security policy.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to take just a minute of the Senate's time to let my colleagues know of an honor that Senator Roth received from the Delaware Chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society. 
In a gala event last night in Wilmington, Delaware, Senator Roth was honored for his achievements as a legislator and for his outstanding contributions to Delaware and to the nation. This was the Multiple Sclerosis Society's first-ever Dinner of Champions, and it is quite an honor for Senator Roth to be one of the first two individuals recognized by the organization. 
The other individual recognized last evening was Richard Christopher, the President of Patterson-Schwartz Real Estate. He and his company have been sponsors of and participants in the Bike-to-the-Bay fundraising event. The DuPont Company also received an award for its decade-long support of the popular Read-a-thon program. Senator Roth was in excellent company last night. 
And, fortunately, he was able to be there and accept the award in person. That is, Mr. President, one of the advantages of representing a State that is close to Washington. Senator Roth could both vote here in the Senate and still get back to Wilmington in time to receive the award. I know that was important to him. 
I thank my colleagues for allowing me to take this brief time. And, I congratulate Senator Roth on his award.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, after this week, someone very special will be missing from my morning commute from Wilmington. Jon Broscious, one of the Amtrak conductors who has been riding the trains with me for the past 25 years, is beginning a well-earned retirement. The mornings will not be the same without him. 
Jon is one of those individuals--like so many of the conductors, baggage handlers, flagmen, and attendants I have known who have worked so hard to maintain Amtrak's excellent reputation as an efficient and user-friendly service--who takes a great deal of pride in his work, making the care and comfort of his passengers always his first priority. These are men and women who have long understood that Amtrak's greatest assets are neither its miles of track nor its extensive rolling stock, but the good will of the thousands of Americans who depend upon rail transportation to get to work, to visit their loved ones, and to expand their horizons. For many years, Jon Broscious has earned the good will of countless passengers, some of whom--like myself--see him every day, and others for whom his conscientious service is their one and only contact with America's rail system. He has treated each and every one--whether in club car or in coach--as a first-class passenger. His example is one which all of us would do well to follow. 
During the twenty-five years that I have been sharing my mornings with Jon, we have learned a great deal about one another's lives and families. He has heard all about my children as they grew up, began to face the challenges of adulthood, embarked on their own careers, and gave me the joy of being a grandfather. And I shared Jon's pride as his son passed the bar and set up his practice in Virginia; anguished with him throughout his son's battle with cancer; and shared his joy when the disease was finally conquered. I'll never forget the time that Jon and his whole family, including his grandchildren, visited with me in my office here in Washington. Though it was my first meeting with many of them, I felt like I knew each one well because Jon had spoken of them so often. 
Jon and his family have a great many plans for his well-deserved retirement. He has earned the comfort and happiness that he brought to so many others over the years. Along with his colleagues and the many others who ride the trains each morning, I wish him all the best. 
But the mornings will never be the same. I'll miss you, Jon.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I support the defense appropriations conference report, but I would like to briefly comment on one issue - strategic airlift. 
As we have learned in places like Kenya, Tanzania, Iraq, and Bosnia, the end of the Cold War has not brought stability to the world. That instability continually threatens our national security interests and has placed a high demand on our military assets. 
Primary among those assets is strategic airlift. Using our military requires getting troops and equipment and weapons to strategic locations. I am very concerned that we are taking some short-cuts in this bill that directly impact that vital national security capability. In particular, I am concerned that the Senate did not fully fund the President's request for C-5 avionics modernization. Instead, this Conference Report provides only $33.7 million of $47.9 million dollars necessary to increase C-5 safety and reliability. While $33.7 million is a lot of money, we need to do more. 
The $14.2 million cut delays installation of the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) by a full-year. Other important modifications are also delayed, including the following: Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System, Global Air Traffic Management, Flight Instrument and Engine Display System, and Automatic Flight Controls. These are the systems that navigate the plane and protect it against various forms of collision. As the skies continue to become more crowded, and as we rely on C-5s to provide airlift in all types of weather and over all kinds of terrain up-to-date avionics are critical. 
The C-5 has served the nation well in all of our military actions overseas from the Yom Kippur War to current operations in Bosnia and Iraq. In Desert Storm, the C-5 delivered over 38 percent of all America's airlift. It is an absolutely essential part of the Air Force's airlift capacity. A capacity that is more critical than ever as we move to an Expeditionary Aerospace Force. 
I want to point out here that it is not just me who believes the C-5 is a critical national defense priority. It is one of the Air Force's top priorities. Even now, I know that the Air Force is attempting to cobble together the needed $14.2 million from other accounts. The Air Force should not be put in this position. We should give them the money. 
We have known for some time that the C-5 needs some modernization work. The Air Force is undertaking a study to determine how best to preserve and protect our strategic airlift. That larger study will look at many things--re-engining the C-5, buying more C-17s, refitting existing commercial airframes, exploring spare parts shortages and maintenance delays--but it will not change the need to modernize the avionics in the short-term. The Air Force is committed to this modernization and deserves our support. 
Quite simply, the airlift of the United States military rests in the back of the C-5. In a world where threats appear in every corner of the globe, we cannot afford to shortchange the strategic airlift that protects our national security. 
When we look at addressing readiness shortfalls in the military in a supplemental appropriations bill this year, I hope my colleagues will consider the need to restore $14.2 million to the C-5 Avionics Modernization accounts. The Air Force should know that we share its committment to strategic airlift.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support Montreal Protocol No. 4, which will simplify the rules for cargo and baggage liability in international air traffic. It is important for the Senate to act now, because Protocol No. 4 has already entered into force. Consequently, U.S. carriers and cargo companies are unable to take advantage of these simplified rules, at a significant economic cost. U.S. industry estimates that Protocol No. 4 will save them $1 billion annually. 
The treaty has been pending in the Senate for over 20 years. It failed to gain support not because it is controversial, but because it has been the victim of misfortune--having been paired, in its submission to the Senate, with Montreal Protocol No. 3, a treaty placing unreasonably low limits on personal liability in international air traffic. I oppose Protocol No. 3, because I believe strongly that limits on personal liability contained in the treaty are an anachronism. Such limits may have been warranted when the underlying Warsaw Convention was drafted in 1929, a time when the airline industry was in its infancy. Now, however, when international air carriers are large corporations with significant financial resources--and thus fully capable of purchasing adequate insurance--there is no justification for such limits. 
For the past two decades, the aviation industry and the Executive Branch unsuccessfully sought ratification of Protocol No. 3 and No. 4. Only once did the Protocols reach the full Senate floor. In 1983, the Senate voted 50-42 to approve them, far short of the two-thirds necessary for advice and consent to ratification. 
Recognizing that Protocol No. 3 cannot be approved by the Senate, the industry and the Executive have effectively abandoned the effort, and have requested the Senate to proceed with consideration of Protocol No. 4. The resolution of ratification of Protocol No. 4 will bring a formal end to the misguided effort to approve No. 3: the resolution directs the Secretary of the Senate to return Protocol No. 3 to the President. 
More importantly, the industry, acting through its association, the International Air Transport Association, has taken steps to waive these personal liability limits. Consequently, most of the leading air carriers have agreed in their contracts with passengers to waive all personal liability limits, and agreed to strict liability up to 100,000 Special Drawing Rights, or about $130,000. 
These are positive developments, and I commend the airlines for taking these steps. Although not all carriers have waived the liability limits, all of the major U.S. carriers have, as have many of the leading foreign carriers which fly to the United States. I urge the Department of Transportation to make every effort to ensure that all carriers involved in international air traffic which fly within or to or from the United States do so as soon as possible. 
I hope that these measures, which are based on contract, not on any domestic law or international treaty, will eventually be codified in a new international instrument--an instrument that would firmly establish international norms and provide certainty for carriers and passengers alike. Negotiations toward that end are ongoing under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). 
One sticking point in these negotiations has been the question of a `fifth jurisdiction.' Under the current Warsaw Convention, a suit may be brought in any one of four places: the place of incorporation of the carrier, the carrier's principal place of business, the place where the ticket was sold, and the place of the ultimate destination of the passenger. Notably missing from this list is the place where the passenger lives, or, in legal terms, his `domicile.' As a practical matter, most Americans will be able to sue in U.S. court under the existing four jurisdictions; but there will be cases in which a passenger buys a ticket overseas on a foreign carrier--which would probably preclude that passenger from bringing a suit in a U.S. court. 
The Clinton Administration is pressing for inclusion of the fifth jurisdiction in any new international instrument. I commend the Administration for taking this position. Including a fifth jurisdiction should be considered an essential element of any new international agreement on passenger liability. 
At this point, I would like to call the attention of my colleagues and the Executive Branch to a speech delivered earlier this year by Lee Kreindler regarding these negotiations. Mr. Kreindler, an aviation attorney with over four decades of experience, has provided a helpful guide to the current legal situation in this area and to the ICAO negotiations.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today is the second anniversary of the signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. It is also nearly a year since the President submitted that treaty to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification. 
Much has happened since then. For example, Congress funded the Department of Energy's Stockpile Stewardship program to ensure that U.S. nuclear weapons remain safe and reliable in the absence of nuclear testing. 
We are building new state-of-the-art facilities that will enable scientists to replicate processes that occur in nuclear explosions. We are developing new computers to permit the complex modeling that is necessary to understand nuclear explosions and to test new component materials or designs. We are conducting sub-critical experiments that are permitted under the Test-Ban Treaty. 
We are also inspecting annually each type of nuclear weapon in our arsenal, so that problems associated with the aging of those weapons can be identified and corrected without a need for nuclear weapons tests. These inspections and corrective actions enable our nuclear weapons establishment to certify on an annual basis that there are no problems that require renewed nuclear testing. 
In short, then, the United States is showing the world that it is, indeed, possible to maintain nuclear deterrence under a test-ban regime. 
We are also showing the world that it is possible to verify compliance with the Test-Ban Treaty. Verification is never perfect, but the nascent International Monitoring System has functioned well enough to severely limit what a nuclear power can learn from undetected testing. 
Last May, India and Pakistan conducted nuclear weapons tests. Critics of the Test-Ban Treaty note that the International Monitoring System--some of which is already in place--did not predict those tests. Of course, the verification system was never intended to predict nuclear weapons tests, only to detect them and to identify the country responsible. 
The International Monitoring System and other cooperating seismic stations did a fine job, in fact, of locating the Indian and Pakistani tests and estimating their yield. By comparing this year's data to those from India's 1974 nuclear test and from earthquakes in the region, seismologists have shown that this year's tests were probably much smaller--and less significant in military terms--than India and Pakistan claimed. 
Most recently, the Senate voted to fund continued development of the International Monitoring System. The national interest requires that we learn all we can on possible nuclear weapons tests. I am confident that the Senate made the right choice in voting to restore these funds. 
When it comes to the Test-Ban Treaty itself, however, the Senate has yet to speak. The Committee on Foreign Relations has yet to hold a hearing, let alone vote on a resolution of ratification. 
In the great Sherlock Holmes mystery `The Hound of the Baskervilles' the crucial clue was the dog that did not bark. On this treaty, the Senate has been such a hound. 
Now, why won't this dog bark? I think it's because the Senators who keep this body from acting on the Test-Ban Treaty know that it would pass. A good three-quarters of the American people support this treaty. In fact, support for the treaty has increased since the Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests, despite disparaging comments by some treaty opponents. 
Worse yet, as far as some treaty opponents are concerned, India and Pakistan are talking about signing the Test-Ban Treaty. That would chip away mightily at the claim that this treaty will never enter into force, even if we ratify it. The fact is that with U.S. leadership, we can get the world to sign up to a ban on nuclear explosions. I am confident that we will do precisely that. 
Treaty opponents have it within their power to stifle America's role in the world and diminish our ability to lead. They also have it within their power, however, to help foster continued American leadership in the coming year and the coming century. I believe that, in the end, their better instincts--and a sober recognition of where the American people stand--will prevail. 
The Senate will give its advice and consent to ratification of this treaty--not this year, but next year. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban may be two years old today, but it is also the wave of the future.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this is a time of serious political turmoil in the United States. 
The House of Representatives is currently considering impeachment proceedings. The President of the United States has admitted to serious moral indiscretions. 
The public is divided on what punishment should be meted out to a President who has performed such despicable and indefensible actions. 
While the House of Representatives is considering impeachment the Senate is waiting to determine whether it may have to sit in judgment with respect to these actions. 
Clearly this is a difficult time for the nation domestically. 
It is a perilous time for the nation internationally. 
We have four weeks left in this Congress and to date we have failed to address some critical foreign policy issues. 
Notwithstanding that failure and the political disarray on the domestic front, there should be no disagreement as to the need to face up to these issues. 
This challenge, and our unfinished business, is the subject of my remarks today. 
Throughout our nation's history, Americans have understood that no matter what was happening in this country's internal political life, America's survival depends on presenting a strong, united front to the world. Now, in the middle of a domestic political crisis, we must overcome partisan differences to focus on urgent matters in United States foreign policy. 
Especially now, in the face of major world crises, we must not allow ourselves to be distracted from our task of protecting America's security, leadership, and credibility abroad. 
With time running short in the Congressional session, the ability to reach out to find the necessary consensus which could permit our country to speak in one voice is threatened by the entire debate over the future of this President. 
No matter how we feel about the actions of President Clinton and whether impeachment proceedings should begin in the House of Representatives, Bill Clinton is still President of the United States with constitutional responsibilities for the conduct of our foreign policy and national security. 
We in the Congress share that constitutional responsibility and I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together and work closely with the President and his national security team to address these issues together. 
The security threats facing us are urgent and complex: international terrorism; weapons of mass destruction in Iraq; nuclear weapons programs in India, Pakistan, and North Korea; a fragile Middle East peace; drug trafficking and international crime; the financial crises in Russia and Asia; and impending humanitarian disasters in Kosovo and the Horn of Africa.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern about our country's ability to lead at this crucial moment for the international economy. 
Yesterday, the House of Representatives refused to provide the resources that the International Monetary Fund needs to deal with the most serious international financial crisis in years. What makes this failure even more inexcusable is that our participation in a stronger IMF would not cost American taxpayers a dime. 
As the President reminded us earlier this week, this is a time when we alone--with the most important economy in the world--are in a position to lead. And two days ago, Treasury Secretary Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told us just how dangerous the current situation really is. 
At this critical juncture, those who weaken our standing in key international financial institutions are playing a reckless game. By failing to provide the $14.5 billion U.S. `quota' increase--our share in an expanded capital reserve for the IMF--the House has increased the threat to our economy from the current international financial turmoil. 
This is just the kind of situation that can get out of control if no one steps in to steer a course through these troubled times. Right now, the Europeans are turned inward, concerned with the next stage in their economic integration--the introduction of a common currency that puts strict limits on its members' budget and interest rate policies. 
Japan remains in the grip of a political paralysis that has allowed its financial problems--centered in a banking system that is crumbling from the weight of bad loans--to fester for almost a decade. 
The Tigers of the Asian financial miracle have been declawed, and with their collapse the world has lost a major engine for growth. 
And our increasingly important trading partners in Latin America are catching their own version of the Asian flu. They face the threat of a chain of devaluations, budget crunches, and slower growth. 
Quite literally, Mr. President, we are in a world of hurt. 
The robust American economy of recent years--with strong job growth, rising incomes, healthy profits, high levels of investment in new technologies--has been the wonder and the envy of the rest of the world. And the fundamentals here, as Treasury Secretary Rubin and Fed Chairman Greenspan have stressed, remain strong. 
But in recent weeks, we have watched as wild swings in our stock market reveal profound anxiety and uncertainty about the effects of international events on our own country. 
Those international events have their ultimate origins in the particular circumstances of many different nations as they have entered today's global economy. But they have common threads--chief among them, a trend in those emerging economies toward excessive borrowing from other countries, debt denominated in dollars and other strong currencies. A lot of this international cash flowed into economies whose banking systems lacked fundamental rules for safety, soundness, and just plain honest bookkeeping. 
As those debt burdens reached unsustainable levels for many important emerging economies, investors were convinced that assets they held in the currencies of those countries were no longer as valuable, and that those countries were no longer in a position to prop up their currencies with shrinking reserves of hard currencies. Once that idea took hold, the flight from those currencies was as swift as it was inevitable. 
As the agonizing reappraisal of international lending grew to encompass other emerging economies, the currencies of countries as widely dispersed--and as different--as Russia, Venezuela, Brazil, and Argentina have come under increasing pressure. In the case of Russia, that pressure has resulted in the virtual collapse of the ruble and the evaporation of the nascent Russian stock market. 
What does this all have to do with us, Mr. President? A lot. 
First, as these emerging markets lose steam, they buy fewer finished goods from us and from other advanced economies, taking a bite out of our export sector, a major component of our recent growth. Facing shrinking markets and low-cost competition from the weakened emerging economies, American firms will no longer enjoy the kind of corporate earnings--or the kind of stock prices--that until just recently lifted Wall Street indexes into the stratosphere. 
Without those profits and those stock values, our companies will not be able to sustain the level of investment that has been a cornerstone of our recent booming economy. Ultimately, this must lead to lower job growth and thinner pay checks. And the decline in our stock market will affect many individual investors' willingness to continue the level of spending that has been the real backbone of our economy. 
Another key feature of this global slump is depressed prices for basic commodities like grain and oil. There is no need for me to remind my colleagues here that our farmers now face a serious crisis because of the loss of important export markets. I know I hear from my poultry farmers in Delaware, for whom Russia is a key export market, about their concerns. 
The latest numbers show that our trade deficit soared by more than 20 percent in the second quarter of this year, and its gives every sign of getting worse before it gets better. Some projections show our exports declining in ways we haven't seen in more than a decade, while we continue to pull in cheap imports from the weakened economies around the world. 
We are in the middle of a major global economic transformation, Mr. President, and there is much we don't know about the workings of the evolving system of increased trade and increased international investment. But we can see from here that international financial problems--particularly foreign exchange crises--have a strong potential to spread, and that our economy, for all its fundamental strengths, will be hurt more the longer those problems persist. 
As we survey the wreckage from this global crisis, and consider the very real potential for deeper trouble, we cannot hesitate to use every tool at our disposal to restore confidence to financial markets. The International Monetary Fund is the institution that we created, along with the other major economies, at the end of World War II to inject a measure of stability into the management of international currency markets. 
Time and events have overtaken the problems for which the IMF was originally created. And while there are important and useful reforms of the IMF included in both House and Senate legislation this session, I am concerned that we are demanding too much of the IMF--expanding its responsibilities instead of focusing its energies where they can do the most good--and too little from such forums as the G-7 and others where the major economies of the world should be seeking a sense of common concern and a coordinated response. 
But that is a topic for another day, Mr. President. 
Today, we need look no farther than today's front page to see that the need for an international lender of last resort is essential to the stability of today's financial markets. Only such a lender can step in to keep a country from complete financial and political meltdown when private investment retreats. Only such a lender can work to limit the contagion of a currency collapse to more and more countries. 
But the vastly increased size of international financial markets now dwarfs the resources of the IMF relative to the problems it confronts. 
Last year, even before the meltdown in Asia, the IMF--with our agreement--concluded that the size and repercussions of foreign exchange crises in today's world justify an increase in the basic reserves of the IMF, the `quota' paid in by each of its 182 members. And we have also agreed, with the other senior members of the IMF, to make available a larger emergency fund, the New Arrangements to Borrow, for use when the quota funds get too low. 
Today, with the funds already committed to Asia and Russia, the IMF's resources are now dangerously low--so low that they call into question its ability to meet the next major run on an emerging economy's currency. So the rest of the world is looking to us to take the lead in providing those resources to the IMF. Our share of the quota increase would be $14.5 billion; our share of the New Arrangements to Borrow would be $3.5 billion. 
But while we must go through the appropriations process to make those funds available to the IMF, we get in return an interest bearing asset, so the overall budget effect is a wash. Let me repeat that--there is no budget outlay involved when we meet our commitment to increase the capacity of the IMF to meet international financial crises. 
And yet, Mr. President, we face the very real threat that the United States will simply flub this chance to maintain its leadership. With the failure of the House to act on the quota, providing only the $3.5 billion for the New Arrangements to borrow, we leave the rest of the world to wonder about our commitment to deal with the very serious problems that afflict our global economy. 
Here in the Senate, we have been fortunate to have the benefit of real leadership on the issue of IMF funding. Senator Stevens has made use of two opportunities to put the Senate on record in support of full funding for our participation in the IMF. My colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Hagel and Senator Sarbanes, have lent their considerable energies and reputations to this effort. 
There are few opportunities left in this session for us to put this right, Mr. President. The Congress is already seen by the rest of the world as reluctant to take an easy--and, I repeat, costless--step to increase the resources of the one institution we have that is in a position to intervene in this crisis. This can only add to the uncertainty that is at the bottom of the current market unrest. 
Mr. President, there is every indication that we have a long, hard road between us and the end of the current financial turmoil. I hope that in the few weeks remaining to us this session we will take this one small step to start that journey.

Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the political and economic crisis in Russia, which poses, to state the obvious, a grave threat to the security of the United States and the entire international order. The situation in Moscow is rapidly changing, so by the time I finish these statements today, Lord only knows, something may have happened in the meantime. Things are that fluid. 
Although the situation is rapidly changing, in the wake of last week's summit, five basic trends seem to be clear. First, the Yeltsin era is about to end. Second, because of structural problems in Russia's political and economic system, there is no short-term fix to Russia's economic crisis. Third, an even greater danger than an economic meltdown is the total collapse of the Russian political system, which would have catastrophic ramifications for the international security system. Fourth, in order to forestall such a collapse, the Yeltsin administration--or perhaps even a transition regime--will almost certainly take some immediate economic measures that will, at least temporarily, set back Russia's progress toward a free market economy. And, fifth, there is very little that the United States can do to affect this grim situation. It is fundamentally a Russian problem with deep cultural roots. 
Madam President, President Clinton, in my view, was correct in going through with last week's Moscow summit. If he had canceled or postponed the meeting, I think it would have sent signals to the world that the United States had written off the reform effort in Russia which, despite the very serious recent setbacks, has nonetheless achieved a great deal over the past 6 1/2 years. I might note, parenthetically, that it may have achieved enough to prevent a total reversion to despotism in Russia. 
But that remains to be seen. 
Moreover, for all its built-in problems, the summit did produce a few modest agreements. Most important among them, as mentioned by others, was the agreement whereby the United States and Russia will each convert approximately 50 tons of plutonium withdrawn in stages from nuclear military programs into forms unusable for nuclear weapons. 
The plutonium management and disposition effort will require several billion dollars, but I can think of no joint effort between our two countries that is more worthy of support. 
As you know, Madam President, because you are well schooled in international relations and have spent a career in the House and the Senate dealing with these issues, the reason that an economy only the size of Holland is having such a profound impact on the rest of the world is because of the military danger that its collapse would cause. If the Russian economy collapses and causes societal and political instability, there are 15,000 nuclear weapons there that could fall into the hands of unreliable and perhaps unstable leaders in a fractured country. So the effort to deal with, for example, taking 50 tons of nuclear-grade material and rendering it incapable of being used in a military context seems to me to be well worth the buy, well worth the effort along the lines of the Nunn-Lugar bill in the destruction of nuclear capacity. 
Despite this and a few other achievements, though, the summit could not, I regret to say, conceal the terminal condition of the Yeltsin Presidency. Watching film of the summit press conference was a painful exercise, for the Russian President clearly showed his infirmity. This medical condition, together with the nearly total absence of popular support for President Yeltsin and his government, makes a change in the near future seem inevitable. 
Boris Berezovsky, the most prominent leader of Russia's new industrial tycoons--the power behind the throne--has already indicated in an interview that President Yeltsin's days in office may be numbered. 
The structural problems in Russia's economy are simply too serious to lend themselves to an easy solution. Many factors have contributed to the sorry state in which the economy now finds itself. 
The Asian financial crisis forced a general reappraisal of international lending in emerging economies. As investors retreated to safety, doubts about Russia's ability to protect the ruble became a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
The 50-percent drop in worldwide crude oil prices within the last 18 months severely harmed Russia's hard currency earning capacity, weakening an important support for its currency and its ability to pay international debts. 
But more fundamentally, Russia has been hamstrung by an inability to create the necessary preconditions for being a player in the international economic system. President Clinton outlined them in his usual lucid way in a speech to students in Moscow. 
Russia must create a full-fledged rule of law with fair enforcement mechanisms. It must put into place modern taxation and banking systems. Investors, domestic and foreign, must have confidence that they will not have the rules changed in the middle of the game. 
In return, Russians, especially the large Russian corporations, must pay their taxes so that the Government can get its fiscal house in order and will not have to resort to the printing press to cover its deficits. The Russian `kleptocracy' must end. 
Madam President, I was speaking by telephone with one of the more prominent businessmen in my State about an hour before I came over to the floor. He is in the poultry business. He called to ask me what I thought about the current situation in Russia. He has several million dollars' worth of product in Kaliningrad. They have a rule there that if, in fact, it is not purchased within 90 days, it can be confiscated. So he has to decide whether to keep it there and run the risk of confiscation or get it out of there and try to market it someplace else. In his factory in Delaware he has an equal amount of product with Russian labels, which is poultry to be sent to Russia. He wanted to know what I thought was likely to happen, and so on and so forth. 
As I talked to him--he is a very bright guy who has been doing business in Russia in earnest now for the last 4 or 5 years--I asked, `What do they need most?' 
He replied, `I never thought I would say this as a conservative businessman. What they need most is the IRS over there.' 
I said, `Say that again?' 
He repeated, `What they need is the IRS over there.' 
The truth of the matter is, one of the reasons their economy is in such horrible shape is that no one is paying their taxes. These are precisely the measures the International Monetary Fund has been urging on the Yeltsin government, but they remain largely unfulfilled. 
The only thing worse than the Yeltsin government paralyzed by an economic meltdown would be a coup d'etat that installed an authoritarian government. It takes little imagination to contemplate the horrible dangers of a resentful, extremist regime that still possesses thousands of missiles armed with nuclear warheads. 
Such a scenario, while still unlikely, is not beyond the realm of possibility, especially if Yeltsin's new candidate for Prime Minister, Yevgenii Primakov--who is almost certain to be confirmed by the Duma--is unable to rapidly stabilize the situation. 
By tomorrow afternoon, I think Primakov will be confirmed by the Duma. In order to forestall a political catastrophe, I believe the Russian Government in the coming days will take economic steps that may, in the short run, avoid a revolutionary situation but in the long run will make it a heck of a lot harder for them to ever get their economic house in order. 
These steps will probably include putting an infusion of currency into the economy through a large-scale increase in Government spending to pay the back wages of state employees, including the military, a process which, in fact, seems already to have begun. 
Moreover, there will likely be some form of wage and price controls, foreign currency restrictions, and renationalization of some industries--all the wrong things to do. But in fairness to the Russians, I wonder if any of us were taking over that Government at this point, we would do anything short of that to avert a civil catastrophe. Such moves, we must realize, would likely doom Russia's chances of receiving the next payment of the $22 billion of the international support package negotiated just a month ago. 
I believe in the long run Russia's march toward a free-market economy is inevitable, notwithstanding what I said, but some emergency measures may be a necessary short-term detour to avoid the kind of complete calamity that a coup d'etat or popular uprising would bring. I am not predicting either a coup or an uprising, but I believe that the Russian leadership will conclude that is a risk they wish not to take. 
Unfortunately, there is very little the United States can do right now to influence events in Russia. 
Despite the deteriorating international economic enviroment and the inevitable mistakes that have occurred as part of well-intentioned assistance efforts, I do not believe that the United States or the West in general should feel that they are responsible for the Russian collapse. 
As I said on the floor last spring in the course of the Senate debate on NATO enlargement, we have wisely not repeated the mistakes made after World War I with respect to Germany. There is no parallel with Weimar. 
Rather than imposing staggering reparations on a defeated enemy, the capitalist world has pumped $100 billion in aid, loans, and investments into Russia. 
Rather than isolating Russia internationally as the victorious allies did with Germany well into the 1920s, we encouraged Moscow and welcomed her into a variety of international organizations. 
We must confront the inescapable fact that the root causes of Russia's stunning descent into chaos lie in her own history and culture. 
Centuries of serfdom and submission to foreign conquerors and autocratic tsars hampered the development of political democracy and a civic culture in Russia. 
Then at the beginning of the 20th century, just when both--that is, a civic culture and a political democracy--were nonetheless beginning to emerge Russia was hit first by World War I and then by the Bolshevik Revolution and civil war. 
I believe the 7 decades of communism that followed offer the best explanation of the current disarray in Russia. 
The tangible devastating legacies of communism are well known: millions killed by Stalin's mad collectivization and purges, environmental degradation, and a massive deterioration in public health and life expectancy. 
There is also a philosophical legacy that bears directly upon today's impasse. Marxism's basic tenet, the class struggle. Some scholars may disagree with me, and I am sure I will hear from them when I say this. 
The entire political class now vying for power in Russia was taught to believe that economic class determines one's interest, that life is, in essence, a zero-sum game. If you, my opponent, win, that must mean that I lose. 
Such a mindset stifles mutual trust and makes compromise in the political arena extremely difficult. The result is that democratic Russia has developed relatively few individuals who in the West would be called or could be called a `loyal opposition.' 
Last year on a visit to Moscow, I held lengthy discussions with several of the leaders who have been in the forefront of the opposition to Chernomyrdin. 
The Communist Party leader Gennadii Zyuganov and the nationalist leader, former general Aleksandr Lebed, both struck me as intelligent, thoughtful men, but distrustful and conniving ones who put self before country. 
Only Grigorii Yavlinsky, the leader of the Yabloko Party, seemed to be one who might fit into our category of the `loyal opposition.' I am told that he may be named First Deputy Prime Minister if Primakov is confirmed as Prime Minister by the Duma. That would be an encouraging sign. We will know by tomorrow or the next day whether that is true. 
One can argue endlessly about what the United States might or might not have done to avert the current catastrophe. 
But before we indulge in `who lost Russia?' finger-pointing, it is well to look at Poland, where western-style economic shock-therapy was applied, the population suffered but endured, and the country emerged immeasurably strengthened. 
Lest one thinks this is a communist-era comparison of a giant and a midget, I would point out that Poland's nearly 40 million population is now in the same general league as Russia's, which is down to 147 million from the Soviet Union's 270 million. 
More importantly, Poland's gross domestic product is approximately one-third of Russia's, so a fair contrast, I believe, can be drawn. 
Poland's political culture and sense of nationhood were solid enough to support the wrenching, but necessary, economic reforms. Neither was present in Russia. 
Perhaps the shorter period of communist rule in Poland than in Russia and the sense that communism had been an alien creed imposed upon the country were factors that mitigated the corrosive ideological effects of Marxism. 
Whatever the ultimate explanation, the sad fact is that Russia's political culture, unlike Poland's, proved unable to provide the underpinning for successful economic reform thus far. 
The fundamental problem, is not that Russia carried out too many democratic and capitalistic reforms too soon, but rather that it did not carry them out fully. 
The Russians now bear the principal responsibility for sorting out their colossal problems. The United States should continue to offer encouragement and support. 
Most importantly, we must keep our eye on the first priority of preventing the collapse of Russian democracy along with their economy.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, whatever our views on a nationwide ballistic missile defense, it seems to me that we should reject S. 1873. 
Were that bill to pass, deploying a national missile defense system could, in my view, break the back of the economy at a moment when we finally have gotten a handle on things. 
A week ago, General Lyles warned that our current programs are over budget and `may not be all affordable.' 
We spent years getting some budget discipline. We have finally achieved that. We must not throw that all away. 
This bill would require deployment even without a threat of new strategic missiles; and it would throw taxpayers' money at the first available technology, rather than the best technology. 
As Dr. Richard L. Garwin warns, the first technology will be vulnerable to missiles with penetration aids, which Russia surely has and others can easily develop. Missile defense is expensive; penetration aids are cheap. 
This bill will also guarantee what General Welch calls a `rush to failure.' Five test failures with the THAAD theater defense system are a reminder of how difficult it is to develop any missile defense. A policy of deploying the first `technologically possible' system is almost bound to fail. 
Finally, this bill does not even permit consideration of the negative consequences of deployment. S. 1873 would destroy the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, and thus end any hope of implementing START Two or of achieving START Three. 
`Star Wars' may seem easier than the hard, patient work of reducing great power armaments and stabilizing our forces. But the `easier' path can also be the dangerous path. 
Last week, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to share real-time data on third-country missile launches, to reduce the risk of accidental nuclear war. That is a good, sensible initiative. 
But what happens if we say we will deploy a national missile defense? We may call it just a defense, but others will see it as a second-strike defense that enables us to mount first-strike nuclear attacks. Russia and China will adopt a hair-trigger, `launch on warning' posture to overwhelm that defense, and the risk of nuclear war will rise. 
Now, some day we may need a nation-wide ballistic missile defense. That is why the Defense Department has the `3+3' policy of developing technology that would permit deployment within three years of finding an actual threat on the horizon. 
Some of my colleagues believe we cannot wait for that. But Iran's missiles will hit the Middle East and parts of Europe. North Korea's missiles will hit Japan and Okinawa. Despite recent missile tests, these countries are several years away from threatening even the far western portions of Alaska and Hawaii, as General Shelton made clear in his letter of August 24. 
And should a real threat materialize, there are far cheaper alternatives to fielding a national missile defense. So, while sensible policy on ballistic missile defense is perfectly feasible, S. 1873 is not such a sensible policy. 
Mr. President, the Senate has real work to do. Americans deserve a Patient's Bill of Rights; we can enact campaign finance reform that even the House of Representatives had enough sense to pass; and we must stop the slaughter of our teenagers by Big Tobacco. 
Let us get back to legislation that meets real, current needs and that will not destroy the balanced budget. Let us reject cloture on the motion to debate S. 1873, and get this Senate back to work.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to commend to my colleagues the exceptionally thoughtful lead editorial in yesterday morning's Washington Post. It is entitled `The Test Ban and Arms Control,' and it makes some cogent points about the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty and a Senate where few objections are raised to the Treaty itself, but most Republicans still cast symbolic votes against it. 
The Post notes correctly that leading Senate Republicans seem to assume that a national missile defense is the only answer to the problems of nuclear proliferation and the risk of nuclear war. 
As the Post concludes, however, treaties like the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty `are capable of serving American requirements well.' Whatever one's views on national missile defense, those treaties `would strengthen the American position in the world.' 
I would note two areas in which I disagree with the Post editorial. First of all, the Test-Ban Treaty was signed 2 years ago, rather than `earlier this year.' The Treaty was submitted to the Senate nearly a full year ago, and has languished because the Republican leadership is afraid to let it come up. 
I do not accept the Post's pessimistic view, moreover, of the Test-Ban Treaty's chances on the floor. In last week's vote, moderate Republicans could support their Leader without doing any tangible harm. 
When the Test-Ban Treaty finally comes up for a vote on ratification, however, I am confident that at least 67 members will support it, just as they supported the Chemical Weapons Convention last year.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution to designate October 16, 1998 as `National Mammography Day.' Since 1993, I have introduced similar measures, and each year the Senate has gone on record in support of the value of mammography by approving this resolution. 
The American Cancer Society estimates that 178,700 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998, while 43,500 women will eventually succumb to the disease this year. However, despite these horrifying numbers, the cure for breast cancer continues to allude us. 
Experts therefore agree that early detection and treatment are a woman's best defenses in the fight against this killer. Mammograms can reveal the presence of small cancers up to 2 years before regular clinical breast examinations or breast self-examinations [BSE], reducing mortality by more than 30 percent. 
Mr. President, the resolution I am submitting sets aside one day in the midst of `National Breast Cancer Awareness Month' to encourage women to receive or sign up for a mammogram. In doing so, we can educate our nation's mothers, sisters, and friends on the importance of early detection through mammography and prevent more women from dying from this disease. I sincerely hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing mammograms as a key element in the fight against breast cancer.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Senate has already spoken on the important question of U.S. support for a stronger International Monetary Fund. 
Following the essential leadership of Senator Stevens, along with my colleague on the foreign relations committee, Senator Hagel, we went on record in March, by vote of 84 to 16, to provide full funding for U.S. participation in the IMF. 
At that time, we also declined to place unworkable conditions on that funding. 
As international lender of last resort, the IMF is right now part of our last line of defense against an economic chain reaction that could turn the financial turmoil on the front pages of today's newspapers into a real global crisis. 
Mr. President, as I have said before, the IMF is certainly not a perfect institution. But I have not stopped going to my doctor because I think the health care system needs reform. 
The Kyl amendment guarantees indefinite delay in the availability of the U.S. contribution to the basic reserves of the IMF, and in turn throws into doubt the participation of other nations who look to us for leadership. 
This amendment would require that the IMF change its basic rules for providing emergency financial support--essentially a change in its bylaws--before the U.S. contribution can go forward. 
Those rule changes themselves may well make sense--in fact, the IMF already makes such conditions part of the requirements for its loans. 
But the requirement that the IMF must first formally adopt reforms in the conditions on countries that receive its funds--conditions, I might add, that we here in the United States could not meet in every case outselves--is a formula for deadlock and indefinite delay. 
This is the opposite what is required of us at this crucial period. 
As the leading economy in the world, we have a special obligation to support this international instutution--that we created, I might add--charged with maintaining stability in international financial markets. 
The amendment now before us is a formula for delay, at the very time when we must act to restore confidence so lacking those markets. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against the Kyl amendment. 
Mr. President, one of the most able Senators in terms of his willingness to reason on this floor is the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl. 
I listened to what he just said about his amendment. He says: Look, all we are doing is going to require the IMF to do what the President says they should have to do anyway before we lend money. By implication, don't throw good money after bad, and so on and so forth. 
What we are doing here is, if we adopt the Kyl amendment, it guarantees, in my view, an indefinite delay in the ability of the U.S. contribution to the basic reserve of the IMF and throws in doubt the participation of other nations who look to us for leadership. Right now it is a really simple deal. If we come up with our $18 billion commitment in total, roughly, what happens is, we control the outcome. No loan can be made. It needs an 85 percent vote. I think we have 18 percent control. 
Why go ahead and throw sand in the gears here now knowing that we are going to, by fiat, in the minds of other nations, amend the way in which the IMF runs now without consultation or agreement by the other participants who make up 82 percent of the Fund, guaranteeing that this thing comes to a screeching halt? 
If in fact the Senator believes the President is right, then he has to assume the President is not going to instruct the U.S. representative at the IMF to vote for releasing dollars without the commitments being met. But what you do now if you adopt the Kyl amendment is as good as not coming up with the $18 billion, because the other nations say: Hey, look, you once again are unilaterally changing the basic rule for providing emergency support, essentially a change in the bylaws of the IMF. Where I come from, that is not how you usually get cooperation. You don't unilaterally tell the French and the Brits and everyone else this is the way it is going to be. You already have that power. You have the power. Without the U.S. vote, nothing goes. Bingo. Nothing goes. 
It seems to me the way to do this is, let's deal, as my friend from Nebraska has been often the lone voice in pointing out with this international financial crisis, and still have a little bit of confidence. This isn't going to fix the thing. This is just going to do in a shot--like a shot of adrenaline, a shot of confidence, we are stepping up to the plate. We are not backing away from an international obligation, as we see it, for our own safety's sake. 
Then, if we want to sit down with our partners in the IMF and say, `Look, it is time to change the bylaws,' that is a different deal. But let's not do unilaterally what is going to, in my view, in my opinion, get a response from the other 82 percent of the voting block out there saying, `Hey, U.S., you don't call it. You don't unilaterally change the rules.' You can in effect unilaterally change the rules by voting no. You can sit in those meetings and say, `Look, we ain't voting for this deal unless the following conditions are met.' 
I respectfully suggest--and I realize my time is probably up--that we should oppose the Kyl amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, as we say in this body, I would like to associate myself with the remarks of all those who have spoken and make a slightly different point--not as well as my colleagues have spoken. 
You know, I don't think a Senator can be measured merely in terms of the number of votes he or she has cast. It is a reflection of their sense of responsibility and the exercise of their duty. But there is something special about that fellow sitting over there from South Carolina. I have been here 26 years with the Senator from South Carolina, and for 16 of those I got to sit as either the ranking member or chairman of the Judiciary Committee right next to Strom. 
I think it is fair to say that a lot of people thought we were strange bedfellows because everybody could tell that we truly liked one another. People would ask me, `Why do you like Strom Thurmond so much? You disagree with him on so many things.' I would say, `I'll tell you why.' There are two reasons, and it is a measure, in my view, of what makes him a great Senator. No. 1, he is here to get things done. He is not here to stop things. He is here to get things done. He is a legislator. 
I remember when I first took over as the chairman of the committee, I went to Strom and said, `Strom, I would like to make a deal with you. There is a lot we disagree on and some we agree on. Let's put aside what we disagree on and focus on the things we agree on.' He looked at me, and he finally said, `OK.' He stood up and put his hand out, and from that point on, as much as we may disagree, there wasn't anything we have ever had a cross word on. 
One of my most memorable occasions was when he and I went down to the White House to try to convince President Reagan to sign a crime bill. President Reagan was in the beginning of his second term. We sat in that Cabinet room. We were on one side of the table and William French Smith, Ed Meese, and someone else was on the other side. The President walked in and sat down between Strom and me. We made our pitch as to why he should sign onto the Thurmond-Biden crime bill back then. The President looked like he was getting convinced, like maybe he was going to come our way. This is absolutely a true story. With that, Ed Meese stood up and said, `Mr. President, it's time to go.' The President wanted to hear what Strom had to say a little longer, but Ed Meese said, `Mr. President, it's time to go.' 
The President was sitting down and then decided it was time to go. He had his arms like this, and he went to get up, and Strom reached over and put his hand on the President's arm and pulled him back down in the seat and he said, `Mr. President, the one thing you got to know about Washington is that when you get as old as I am, you want to get things done, you have to compromise.' 
Who in the Lord's name could have possibly told Ronald Reagan that--he was almost as old as Strom and had been around as long--and smile and make the President laugh? He not only got away with it, he talked the President into his position. That is a remarkable ability. This man can say and do things that if any of the rest of us ever did them, we would be long 
gone. But do you know why it works? It is because people know where his heart is. People know what his objective is. People know that he is doing what he is doing not for political purposes but because he really believes it. 
If you will allow another point of personal privilege here. I remember a very tough time in my career. I was chairman of a committee and there were wild accusations being made about me. I was foolish enough to be trying to run for President of the United States. It was before a very contentious hearing on a Supreme Court Justice. He and I disagreed on whether the justice should be a Justice. I called a meeting of the entire committee off of the committee room in the back and I said, `Gentlemen'--there were all men on the committee at the time--I said, `Gentlemen, if these accusations relevant to me are getting in the way of the ability to conduct this committee, I am willing to step down as chairman.' Before the last syllable got out of my mouth, Strom Thurmond stood up in that meeting and said, `That's ridiculous. You stay as chairman. We all have confidence in you.' I said, `Don't you want me to explain?' He said, `There is no need to explain. I know you.' 
I will never forget that. I can't think of many other men or women who would, having a significant political advantage at that moment, not only not take advantage, but stand by me--stand by me. 
And so I think the thing that makes his 15,000 votes matter so much is that everybody knows they matter to him. They matter to him. 
I will close by saying--and I apologize for being so personal, but I think it is the measure of this man, at least in my view. My daughter is 17 years old. She has, like all of us in here who have served in the U.S. Senate for a long time, had the great honor and opportunity to meet kings and princes and presidents and significant political figures. She, like all of our children, pays the price for having a father or mother who is a Senator or who holds high public office. But they also have the advantage of meeting these people as well. She has had scores of pictures taken. 
To this day, my beautiful 17-year-old daughter has one picture of a public figure in her bedroom on her dresser that has been there for 9 years, and it is a picture of Senator Strom Thurmond handing her a key chain behind his desk in his office. I didn't ask her to keep that. I kind of wish she would put a Democrat's picture in there. I didn't even make the bureau. But Strom Thurmond is there. I think the reason is because all the time my wife Jill was carrying her, Strom would, every third day, ask me during a hearing what was going on and give me all kinds of advice about what I should and should not do. 
My wife and I were in the delivery room and were just handed our beautiful baby girl, and a doctor walked around the corner with a cell phone and said, `There's a call for you, Senator.' We were literally in the delivery room. I thought, my God, war must have been declared. I grabbed the phone, thinking it was the most incredible and unusual thing to hand me a phone in the delivery room. I say to my friend from West Virginia that he is not going to be surprised to hear this. `Joe, Strom. Congratulations.' How in the Lord's name he knew at that moment is beyond me. But everything with him is personal. It is personal in that he gives. It is personal in that he gives. It is not personal that he holds a grudge. It is not personal that he takes advantage. It is personal. Politics is personal. 
Those votes meant something, and the way he has conducted himself in this body makes me very, very, very proud to say I serve with him and very proud to think that he likes me. 
It has been a pleasure serving with you. I just hope you do what you did for me on your 90th birthday. I had the great honor to be one of the four speakers at your 90th birthday. But, you old devil, you never told me Richard Nixon was going to be the other speaker when I showed up. It was me, President Nixon, Bob Dole, and a Presbyterian minister, whom I don't remember; he used to work in the Nixon White House. 
I just ask for one favor. On your 100th birthday, as you are running for your next term of office, I volunteer to be one of the 500 people, assuming I am still around, who will be happy to stand up and speak for you on your 100th birthday, because I want to be around on your 110th after you finish your next term and a half. I congratulate you, Senator, not on the 15,000 votes, but it is the way you cast them, the way you talked about them, the way you dared about them that makes you unique among all of us in this Chamber. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will not take much of the Senate's time. I think this debate is about the easiest debate the Senate can face. There is one simple reason to support the Specter amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, and the U.S. contribution to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Preparatory Commission. 
It is real simple. It is in the national security interest of the United States. I reiterate what the Senator from Pennsylvania said. This is true whether or not you favor the test ban treaty or oppose it. 
Most of the funding requested for the Preparatory Commission is to be devoted to capital expenditures on the international monitoring system, the ability to monitor. Improving our nuclear test monitoring capabilities is clearly of benefit to the United States--again, whether you are for or against this treaty--as well as to the benefit of the world community. 
The recent nuclear weapons tests in India and Pakistan are a stark reminder of the importance of monitoring. The international monitoring system should improve the seismic monitoring of nuclear tests in India and Pakistan by nearly a full order of magnitude. That will lower the threshold of detectable yields by a factor between 5 and 10, depending on the test-site geology. 
So if the detection threshold is a yield of 200 tons today, it would be 20 to 40 tons a few years from now. Let me say that again. If the threshold at which we can detect today is 200 tons, if this monitoring system is improved, as we fully expect it would be assuming we fund our part, it would reduce that to be able to detect 20 to 40 tons--but only if we pay our contribution. 
The international monitoring system will also provide these improved monitoring capabilities in a more cost-effective manner than we can achieve them unilaterally. Countries other than the United States will bear roughly 75 percent of the costs. Where I come from, that is a pretty good deal. We pay three-quarters less than we would have to pay in order to be able to get 5 times the accuracy in terms of information, as much as 10 times the resolution we need to know if anybody has set off a nuclear test. 
In addition, some of the improvement is literally unattainable through U.S.-sponsored monitoring alone, as some of the international monitoring sites will be in countries that refuse to contribute to a U.S. unilateral monitoring system. 
The Preparatory Commission, Mr. President, is investing--is investing--now in an international monitoring system, even though the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty might not come into force for some years. 
There are two important reasons to support this. First, if we do consent to U.S. ratification of the treaty, we will want to be able to verify compliance as soon as the treaty enters into force. Any delay in funding the international monitoring system would translate into a delay in achieving the needed verification capabilities. Second, the improved monitoring achieved through new or upgraded sensor sites will contribute to U.S: and world--monitoring capabilities as soon as they are in place, not just after the treaty enters into force. 
U.S. agencies need to monitor possible nuclear weapons tests worldwide whether or not we ratify the treaty. Even so, opponents of ratification should support this funding. What would we do if we were here on the floor and said, `You know, there's going to be no test ban treaty. We just want to know what's going on in the rest of the world. We want to know. And guess what? A whole bunch of nations will join in with us to increase the capability of monitoring a test by roughly tenfold, a minimum of fivefold. And all we have to do is contribute, in this case, one-quarter of the cost'? 
Would we conclude not to do that? Would we sit here and say, `No, no, no, we don't want to know; we don't want to pay 25 percent of the cost to increase our ability to detect testing that is up to 10 times more sensitive than what our capability now is'? 
What are we talking about here? I mean, what rationale can there possibly be? I suspect my friends will say, `Well, you know, if we go ahead and do this, then we're on a slippery slope to ratifying that God awful treaty.' I think it is a good treaty, but that is the best argument you can come up with unless you say, `We don't want to know. We don't want to know whether or not a nation is detonating a nuclear device that is in the 20 to 40 ton range. We're satisfied knowing all they can do is under 200 tons. Once they get above that, that is when we'll pay attention to it.' 
Mr. President, in sum, the international monitoring system will make a real contribution to U.S. monitoring capabilities. That contribution will be much less expensive than sustaining those sites unilaterally. And it will come on line as soon as the equipment is installed. 
Lest anybody have to be reminded, we live in a very dangerous world. The proliferation of nuclear weapons is occurring and it is a real risk. It seems to me, Mr. President, again, whether or not you are for the test ban treaty, the national interests requires these monitoring investments. So I strongly urge--strongly urge--all of my colleagues to support this amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will not take any more of the Senate's time. I learned a long time ago from a former chairman named Russell Long that when you are about to accept something, let it be accepted. 
I rise to cosponsor an amendment that codifies the so-called outer wall of sanctions on the government of Serbia-Montenegro. 
Mr. President, as we know, for the last decade Slobodan Milosevic has pursued his mad dream of a Greater Serbia. The result has been hundreds of thousands dead, millions made homeless, and centuries-old Serbian culture eradicated from sections of the former Yugoslavia. 
And Milosevic is continuing his murderous policies in Kosovo, while playing games with us in Bosnia and frustrating democratic reforms in Serbia. 
The amendment that Senator Smith, Senator D'Amato, Senator Johnson, and I are proposing codifies five categories of sanctions. 
First, the Secretary of the Treasury is to instruct the U.S. executive directors of the international financial institutions to work in opposition to and vote against, any extension by these institutions of any financial or technical assistance or grants of any kind to the government of Serbia. Montenegro's reformist government is exempted from these sanctions. 
Second, the Secretary of State is to instruct the U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE--the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe--not to join any consensus to allow the participation of Serbia-Montenegro in the OSCE. 
Third, the Secretary of State is to instruct the Representative to the United Nations to vote against any resolution in the U.N. Security Council to admit Serbia-Montenegro to the U.N. 
Fourth, the U.S. is to oppose the extension of the Partnership for Peace program to Serbia-Montenegro. 
Fifth, the U.S. is to oppose the extension of membership in the Southeast European Cooperative Initiative to Serbia-Montenegro. 
How might Milosevic avoid these sanctions? 
The amendment would drop these sanctions if the President certifies that Serbia-Montenegro has taken five steps. 
First, Serbian representatives must be negotiating in good faith with the other successor states of the former Yugoslavia on the division of assets and liabilities and other succession issues. 
Second, the government of Serbia-Montenegro must be complying fully with its obligations as a signatory to the Dayton Accords. 
Third, the government of Serbia-Montenegro must be cooperating fully with, and providing unrestricted access to, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. 
Fourth, the government of Serbia-Montenegro must be implementing internal democratic reforms, including progress in the rule of law and independent media. In this regard it is worth noting that the government of the Republic of Montenegro is already in compliance. 
Fifth, the government of Serbia-Montenegro must meet the requirements on Kosovo enumerated elsewhere in this Act. 
Mr. President, Slobodan Milosevic has jerked this country around long enough. This amendment makes clear to him what he has to do in order to have the outer wall of sanctions removed. 
The ball is squarely in his court. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I compliment my friend from Oregon in leading the way on this. I think the balance here is real. I think it is very important. I think it is totally consistent with the direction we have been going in the way the Senate should act relevant to the sanctions and the exceptions we grant the President for other reasons relating to other than that very high bar of the national security test. 
I compliment him. I thank him for the modification. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, tomorrow is an important day for all who honor the valor and sacrifice Americans made in World War II. Tomorrow, the history of America's war in the Pacific is brought full circle. The U.S.S. Missouri, the ship on which the United States formally accepted Japan's surrender, will be permanently berthed at Pearl Harbor, the site of America's entry into the war against Japan following a devastating surprise attack. 
It is appropriate that in this same week I, along with my colleagues, Senators Roth, Thurmond, Inouye, Stevens, Hollings, Ford, Durbin, Specter, Helms, Cochran, and Faircloth, seek to close the circle for the two commanders at Pearl Harbor fifty-seven years ago, Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short. Today, we are introducing a resolution that seeks long overdue justice for these two fine officers. 
Now some of you will ask `why now?' The answer is not just because we are honoring the service and sacrifice of Americans who served in the Pacific campaign by permanently berthing the Missouri at Pearl Harbor. It is more basic than that--there can be no statute of limitations for restoring honor and dignity to men who spent their lives devoted to America's service and yet were unfairly treated. When it comes to serving truth and justice, the time must always be `now'. 
I hope that most of you will read this resolution. The majority of the text details the historic case on behalf of Admiral Kimmel and General Short and expresses Congress's opinion that both officers performed their duty competently. Most importantly, it requests that the President submit the names of Kimmel and Short to the Senate for posthumous advancements on the retirement lists to their highest held wartime rank. 
Mr. President, this action would not require any form of compensation. Instead, it would acknowledge, once and for all, that these two officers were not treated fairly by the U.S. government and it would uphold the military tradition that responsible officers take the blame for their failures. 
I will address these points in more detail and will review some of the evidence regarding the soundness of Kimmel and Short's military decisions. 
First, I want to discuss the treatment of Kimmel and Short and who bore responsibility. Like most Americans, Admiral Kimmel and General Short requested a fair and open hearing of their case, a court martial. They were denied their request. After lifetimes of honorable service to this nation and the defense of its values, they were denied the most basic form of justice--a hearing. 
Let me review some of the facts. On December 18, 1941, a mere 11 days after Pearl Harbor, the Roberts Commission was formed to determine whether derelictions of duty or errors of judgment by Kimmel and Short contributed to the success of the Japanese attack. This Commission concluded that both commanders had been derelict in their duty and the President ordered the immediate public release of these findings. 
Several facts about the Roberts Commission force us to question its conclusions. First, Kimmel and Short were denied the right to counsel and were not allowed to be present when witnesses were questioned. They were then explicitly told that the Commission was a fact-finding body and would not be passing judgment on their performance. When the findings accusing them of a serious offense were released, they immediately requested a court-martial. That request was refused. It is difficult to imagine a fair review of the evidence given the rules of procedure followed by the Commission. 
I also think that it is important to note the timing here. It would be difficult to provide a fair hearing in the charged atmosphere immediately following America's entry into the war in the Pacific. In fact, Kimmel and Short were the objects of public vilification. The Commission was not immune to this pressure. One Commission member, for example, Admiral Standley, expressed strong reservations about the Commission's findings, later characterizing them as a `travesty of justice'. He did sign the 
Report, however, because of concerns that doing otherwise might adversely affect the war effort. As you will see, the war effort played an important role in how Kimmel and Short were treated. 
The Roberts Commission was the only investigative body that found these two officers derelict in their duty. 
In 1944 an Army Board investigated General Short's actions at Pearl Harbor. The conclusions of that investigation placed blame on General Marshall, the Chief of Staff of the Army at the time of Pearl Harbor and in 1944. This report was sequestered and kept secret from the public on the grounds that it would be detrimental to the war effort. 
That same year, a Naval Court of Inquiry investigated Admiral Kimmel's actions at Pearl Harbor. The Naval Court's conclusions were divided into two sections in order to protect information indicating that America had the ability to decode and intercept Japanese messages. The first and longer section, therefore, was classified `top secret.' The second section was written to be unclassified and completely exonerated Admiral Kimmel and recognized that Admiral Stark bore some of the blame for Pearl Harbor because of his failure to provide Kimmel with critical information available in Washington. Then Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal instructed the Court that it had to classify both sections `secret' and not release any findings to the public. 
I won't go any further with this discussion of history, again I urge my colleagues to read the resolution. I hope that I have made my point that these officers were not treated fairly and that there is good reason to question where the blame for Pearl Harbor should lie. 
The whole story was re-evaluated in 1995 at the request of Senator Thurmond by Under Secretary for Defense Edwin Dorn. In his report, Dorn concluded that responsibility for the disaster at Pearl Harbor should be broadly shared. I agree. Where Dorn's conclusions differ from mine and my cosponsors, is that he also found that `the official treatment of Admiral Kimmel and General Short was substantively temperate and procedurally proper.' I disagree. 
These officers were publicly vilified and never given a chance to clear their names. If we lived in a closed society, fearful of the truth, then there would be no need for the President to take any action today. But we don't. We live in an open society. Eventually, we are able to declassify documents and evaluate our past based on at least a good portion of the whole story. One of our greatest strengths as a nation comes from our ability to honor truth and the lessons of our past. 
Like most people, I can accept that there was a good case for the need to protect our intelligence capabilities during the war. I cannot accept that there is a reason for continuing to deny the culpability of others in Washington at the expense of these two officers' reputations 57 years later. Continuing to falsely scapegoat two dedicated and competent officers dishonors the military tradition of taking responsibility for failure. The historic message sent is that the truth will be suppressed to protect some responsible parties and distorted to sacrifice others. 
One point I want to make here is that we are not seeking to place blame. This is not a witch-hunt aimed at those superior officers who were advanced in rank and continued to serve, despite being implicated in the losses at Pearl Harbor. I think the historic record has become quite clear that blame should be shared. 
The unfortunate reality is that Admiral Kimmel and General Short were blamed entirely and forced into early retirement. 
After the war, in 1947, they were singled out as the only eligible officers from World War II not advanced to their highest held wartime ranks on the retirement lists, under the Officer Personnel Act of 1947. By failing to advance them, the government and the Departments of the Navy and Army perpetuate the myth that these two officers bear a unique and disproportionate part of the blame. 
The government that denied these officers a fair hearing and suppressed 
findings favorable to their case while releasing hostile information owes them an official apology. That's what this resolution calls for. 
The last point that I want to make deals with the military situation at Pearl Harbor. It is legitimate to ask whether Admiral Kimmel and General Short, as commanding officers, properly deployed their forces. I think reasonable people may disagree on this point. I have been struck by the number of qualified individuals who believe the commanders properly deployed based on the intelligence available to them. I will ask to enter this partial list of flag officers into the Record. Among those listed is Vice Admiral Richardson, a distinguished naval commander, who wrote an entire report refuting the conclusions of the Dorn Report. My colleagues will also see the names of four Chiefs of Naval Operations and the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas Moorer. It was Admiral Moorer who observed that, `If Nelson and Napoleon had been in command at Pearl Harbor, the results would have been the same.' 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe this case is unique and demands our attention. As we honor those who served in World War II by permanently berthing the U.S.S. Missouri in Pearl Harbor, we must also honor the ideals for which they fought. High among those American ideals is upholding truth and justice. Those ideals give us the strength to admit and, where possible, correct our errors. 
I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and move one step closer to justice for Admiral Kimmel and General Short.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Bosnia amendment introduced by the junior Senator from Texas. Before I discuss the reasons for my opposition, I would like to commend the Senator for her continuing interest and involvement in U.S. foreign policy. The Senator is one of this body's most active Members, and while I have often opposed her legislative initiatives, which seemed to me unnecessarily to limit American involvement abroad, I value her enthusiasm and engagement. 
The amendment that Senator Hutchison has proposed today sets arbitrary caps on our troop strength in Bosnia and micromanages their duties from the vantage point of Washington, D.C: 4,000 miles from Bosnia and Herzegovina! The amendment is fatally flawed. 
Mr. President, the Hutchison amendment is predicated upon a false assertion: that the U.S. contribution to SFOR is inequitable and disproportionately large. I will return to that inaccurate claim in a moment. 
Moreover, the amendment makes several incorrect claims about the current situation in Bosnia, for example that NATO forces participate in law enforcement activities there. 
In circumscribing future activities, it also incorrectly implies that NATO forces are transferring refugees or that refugees are relocating in order to control the territory of the other Bosnian entity. 
But, Mr. President, the core of my opposition to the Hutchison amendment is the same as was my opposition last month to the Thurmond amendment to the Defense authorization bill. 
Put quite simply, if the United States wishes to remain the leader of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, then it must continue to lead! 
Mr. President, leadership means being present in all aspects of NATO operations and sharing in the risks. 
The Hutchison amendment is a prescription for `NATO a la carte.' 
By February 1999 it would allow exceptions in Bosnia to the arbitrary troop limits in Bosnia only for self-protection as we withdraw our forces, to protect U.S. diplomatic facilities, or in advisory support roles. 
That might work for a junior member of the Alliance, but not for the United States of America. Not for the leader of NATO. 
Let me return to the false assumption that underlies the Hutchison amendment--that our participation in SFOR is disproportionately large. 
As a matter of fact, Mr. President, while the U.S. contribution to SFOR remains the largest single national contribution, the proportion of U.S. forces within NATO forces in Bosnia has declined dramatically since initial deployment in December 1995. 
At the outset, U.S. troops made up fully one-third of IFOR. As a result of steady, measured reductions, U.S. participation has dropped to one-fifth of SFOR. 
In other words, our allies and other SFOR partners have agreed to the U.S. taking disproportionate cuts in force numbers at each milestone, while continuing to accept U.S. command of the overall force. 
At the current time, our European allies alone contribute more than three-and-one-half times the number of troops in SFOR than we do. 
Attempting to lower the U.S. proportion to equal or below that of any single European ally would almost certainly cost us our command position. Some Members of the Senate might welcome such a development. I would not. 
I want the United States to retain command of SFOR in order to ensure that the pace of implementing the Dayton Accords holds steady or accelerates. 
I want the United States to retain command of SFOR in order to maximize the effectiveness and protection of the U.S. forces in Bosnia. 
We are in Bosnia because helping to resolve the Bosnian problem is in our national interest. 
As was repeatedly pointed out by this Senator and many others during the debate on NATO enlargement last spring, that is the reason we are in Europe at all. 
In political, security, and economic terms, we are a European power. Our engagement in Europe, including Bosnia, is not a charity operation. Stability in Europe benefits us. 
The European allies of the United States are playing a major role in Bosnia. 
Because of our leadership role in NATO, and because of our superior logistical capabilities, we have maintained command of SFOR. This is how it should be. 
Like my colleagues, I am in favor of the speediest fulfillment of the Dayton Accords so that Bosnia and Herzegovina will have a self-sustaining democracy and all foreign troops may be withdrawn. American command of SFOR is the best guarantee that we can rapidly achieve this goal. 
The Hutchison amendment would, I submit, gravely undermine that American command in Bosnia and would set in motion a process that could ultimately result in loss of the position of SACEUR, the command of NATO land forces in Europe. 
For all these reasons, I oppose the Hutchison amendment, and I urge my colleagues to join me in defeating it. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I will take no more time. I know my friend from Arizona is about to make some comments. 
Last spring this was a bad idea. Nothing has caused it to become a good idea in the summer. It was a bad idea then; it is a bad idea now. I hope it will be tabled. 
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, a lot of us withheld speaking against this amendment, and I hope that maybe just the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, would speak and then all those who already spoke refrain from speaking again so people such as me don't feel compelled to stand up and respond. We are trying to get this done. Because the Senator from Arizona was kind enough to withhold his motion to table, I hope we could agree that after the Senator from West Virginia speaks, and maybe the Senator from Texas takes a couple minutes to close out, we then let the Senator move. It would be helpful.

<TEXT>
Mr. BIDEN. Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, I am going to support the Durbin amendment, and I admire what he is attempting to do and respect his effort. I am not, quite frankly, certain it will have its intended effect. 
I strongly agree with the views expressed by my friend from Illinois, that what I call the `monarchist' view of the war power has become the prevalent view at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, and it does not matter whether it is a Democratic President or a Republican President. And the original framework of the war power clause envisioned by the Founding Fathers, I think, has been greatly undermined over the last several decades. 
On the question of war power, I believe the Constitution is as clear as it is plain. Article I, section 8, provides that the Congress has the power `to declare War, [and] grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal . . . .' Article II, section 2, provides, `The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States.' 
To be sure, the Commander in Chief ensures that the President has the sole power to direct U.S. military forces in combat. But that power--except in very few limited instances--derives totally from congressional authority. It is not the power to move from a state of peace to a state of war. It is a power, once the state of war is in play, to command the forces, but not to change the state. 
Until that authority is granted, the President has no inherent power to send forces to war--except, as I said, in certain very limited circumstances, such as to repel sudden attacks or to protect the safety and security of Americans abroad. 
On this point, the writings of Alexander Hamilton, a very strong defender, as the Presiding Officer knows, of Presidential power, is very instructive. In Federalist No. 69, Hamilton emphasized that the President's power as Commander in Chief would be `much inferior' to that of the British King, amounting to `nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces.' 
During the cold war, and during the nuclear age, the thesis arose that, at a time when the fate of the planet itself appeared to rest on two men thousands of miles apart, Congress had little choice, or so it was claimed, but to cede tremendous authority to the Executive. 
Unfortunately, despite the end of the cold war, the view that the President had this authority has continued to survive--and flourish--under Presidents of both political parties. 
On the eve of the gulf war, President Bush insisted that he did not need congressional authorization to send half a million men and women into combat with Iraq. I insisted at that time we hold hearings on that subject and there be a resolution concluding whether or not he had that power. 
More recently, President Clinton asserted sweeping theories about his power to deploy forces to Haiti and to begin offensive military action against Iraq. 
I believe we need to remedy this constitutional imbalance. Accordingly, I have offered in the past, and I have drafted, comprehensive legislation called the Use of Force Act, which is designed to replace the War Powers Resolution. 
The Durbin amendment is far shorter and more direct in its approach. And although I support it, as I said, I am skeptical that it will achieve its total desired effect. The Durbin amendment would bar the use of appropriated funds for `offensive military operations' by Armed Forces `except in accordance with Article I, section 8 of the Constitution.' 
I believe the Constitution already says that, that we need not redeclare that. But I think it is valuable to do it if it sends a message that we are going to be looking a whole lot closer. 
In my view, the President may not use force, except in certain limited circumstances, without the authorization of the Congress, period. The war power is not limited to a formal declaration of war--of which we have had only five in our history. The Founding Fathers had little interest, it seems, in the ceremonial aspects of war. The real issue was congressional authorization of war. 
As Hamilton noted in Federalist 25, the `ceremony of a formal denunciation of war has of late fallen into disuse.' Obviously, the founders were not talking about a circumstance where the only circumstance that the Congress could impact on whether we use force or not is with a formal declaration of war. Even in 1789--to quote Hamilton--ceremonial declarations of war had fallen into disuse, so obviously that is not what they were talking about alone. 
The conclusion that Congress has the power to authorize all uses of force is buttressed by the inclusion in the war clause of the power to grant letters of marque and reprisal. An anachronism today, I acknowledge, letters of marque and reprisal were, though, in the 18th century, their version of limited war. Even back then, for a President to engage in limited war, he needed the authorization of the U.S. Congress. The vehicle was issuing letters of marque and reprisal. 
I understand that the administration has expressed its strong opposition to this provision and is threatening to veto it. I have called the administration and indicated they are being foolish in even making that threat, with all due respect. It is merely an institutional instinct that does not surprise me, but I am somewhat surprised by the volume of the objection. 
The Durbin amendment, if enacted, may have one salutary effect: It could force the President and his advisors to pause before continuing to make broad assertions of Presidential war power. 
If even that result is achieved, the enactment of the Durbin amendment will be a positive development in restoring the constitutional imbalance. 
Mr. President, I will not take the time now, but I will, at the appropriate time, reintroduce the Use of Force Act that I have in previously attempted to have passed, working with a number of constitutional scholars who have written extensively in this area. 
Let me conclude in the 30 seconds I have left to again compliment the Senator from Illinois. It is time the Congress, with the changed world, reassert its rightful role in the conduct of the use of force, and, now that the world has changed, the old saw about the need for this emergency power--the Congress being less relevant in that regard--should be put to bed once and for all. 
I thank him for his effort and I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
It is a truism that despite the end of the Cold War, we live in a dangerous world. The ultimate danger we face, perhaps, is that nuclear weapons will be obtained--or even used--by unstable countries or terrorist groups. 
We must undertake a range of activities to reduce that danger. There is no magic bullet. No single program or initiative will rid the world of the threat of nuclear cataclysm at the hands of a new or unstable nuclear power. 
Rather, we need a coherent strategy with many elements--a strategy designed to reduce both the supply of nuclear weapons technology to would-be nuclear powers and the regional tensions that fuel their demand for those weapons. 
I would like to spend a few minutes today talking about one piece of that strategy that this body can implement: We can and should give our advice and consent to ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. And we should do that promptly. 
In her speech on the 35th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's American University speech, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called for U.S. ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. Noting the recent Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests, she said that ratification was needed `now, more than ever.' 
Senator Specter and I have also called for ratification now, both in floor statements and by drafting a resolution calling for expeditious Senate consideration of the Test-Ban Treaty. 
Why is the Test-Ban so crucial? Because it is directly related to the global bargain that is the heart of the global nonproliferation regime. Other countries will give up their ambition to acquire nuclear weapons, but only if the declared nuclear powers honestly seek to end their nuclear advantage. We have to keep up our side of the bargain--and that means ratifying and adhering to the comprehensive test ban--or the non-nuclear weapons states will not feel bound to theirs. 
One lesson of this decade's nuclear developments in India, Pakistan, Iraq and North Korea is that very basic nuclear weapon design information is no longer a tightly held secret. The technology required to produce nuclear weapons remains expensive and complex, but it is well within the reach of literally scores of countries. 
To keep countries from producing what scores of them could produce, you need more than pressure or sanctions. You must constantly maintain their consent to remain non-nuclear weapons states. 
Ideally, we would maintain that consent by removing the security concerns that propel countries to seek nuclear weapons. But that is terribly difficult, be it in Kashmir or the Middle East, in the Balkans or the Korean Peninsula or the Taiwan Straits. 
In the world of today and of the foreseeable future, peace does not reign. Nuclear non-proliferation will not prevail in this world either, unless we convince states that nuclear weapons are not the key to survival, to status or to power. 
The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty is not merely emblematic of the nuclear powers' commitment to the non-nuclear weapons states. It also will put a cap on the development of new classes of nuclear weapons by the nuclear powers. 
The test-ban treaty will also limit the ability of any non-nuclear weapons state to develop sophisticated nuclear weapons or to gain confidence in more primitive nuclear weapons if it were to illegally acquire or produce them. If you can't test your weapon, you are very unlikely to rely upon it as an instrument of war. 
These are important reassurances to the non-nuclear nations of the world. They are why those countries agreed to foreswear all nuclear tests and to accept intrusive on-site inspection if a suspicion arose that they might have tested a nuclear device. 
Will the Test-Ban Treaty also gradually reduce a country's confidence in the reliability of its nuclear weapons over the next 30 or 50 years, as some of its opponents assert? If so, that is actually reassuring to the non-nuclear weapons states, for it gives them hope of the eventual realization of that `cessation of the nuclear arms race' encouraged by Article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. So even the cloud that most frightens test-ban opponents has a silver lining: it helps keep the rest of the world on board the non-proliferation bandwagon. 
Now it is true, Mr. President, that some countries have never accepted the world non-proliferation bargain. The so-called `threshold states' of India, Pakistan and Israel all viewed nuclear weapons as essential to their national security, and India denounced the Non-Proliferation Treaty because it did not require immediate nuclear disarmament. 
Still other countries, like Iran, Iraq and North Korea, signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty but maintained covert nuclear weapons programs. 
But the vast majority of the world's states, including many prospective nuclear powers, have gone along with this bargain. And it is vital to our national security that we maintain their adherence to the world non-proliferation regime. They must not become `threshold states,' let alone actually test nuclear weapons. 
So, how will we maintain the adherence of the world's non-nuclear weapons states to the nuclear proliferation regime? The Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests are a direct challenge to that regime. The regime--and the countries who support it--can only meet that challenge if the United States leads the way. 
On one level, we are already doing that. We have imposed severe sanctions on both India and Pakistan, and both of their economies are at risk. We have adjusted our sanctions to limit their effect upon innocent populations, and we are working to give the President the flexibility to lift them in return for serious steps by India and Pakistan toward capping their arms race and addressing their differences. 
On the world-wide level, however, our record is mixed. Some countries have joined us in imposing sanctions on India and Pakistan. We have also been joined in strong statements by countries ranging from Japan to Russia and China. 
Statements and resolutions by the G-8, the Organization of American States, the Conference on Disarmament, and the United Nations Security Council have rightly condemned India and Pakistan's nuclear tests and called upon them to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to refrain from actual deployment of their weapons, to ratify 
the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty and to move toward a peaceful settlement of the Kashmir dispute. 
But the world is acutely aware of our failure to persuade more countries to impose sanctions, and also of our own failure, so far, to ratify the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty. Until we ratify this Treaty, the nuclear hard-liners in India and Pakistan will be able to cite U.S. hypocrisy as one more reason to reject the nuclear non-proliferation regime. And until we ratify the Treaty, the rest of the world will find it easier to reject U.S. calls for diplomatic and economic measures to pressure India and Pakistan. 
We must keep our part of that non-proliferation bargain, if we are to maintain U.S. leadership on non-proliferation, keep the rest of the world on board, and influence India and Pakistan. The truth is that we have little choice. 
If we fail to keep faith with the non-nuclear states because we cannot even ratify the Test-Ban Treaty, then we will also fail to keep them from developing nuclear weapons of their own. And in that case, Mr. President, we might as well prepare for a world of at least 15 or 20 nuclear weapon states, rather than the 5 or 7 or 8 we have today. That is the stark reality we face.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, no less an authority than Alan Greenspan recently pronounced our economy in the best shape he has seen in his professional life. 
Unemployment, inflation, and interest rates are low; incomes, investment, and optimism remain high. 
Clearly, Mr. President, now is the time to worry. 
Now is the time to worry, Mr. President, because these are exactly the circumstances that breed overconfidence and complacency. Pride, Mr. President, goeth before the fall. 
Mr. President, we enjoy this excellent economic performance because we have got our own house in order--we have gone through a painful period of restructuring that has made our economy more efficient, and we have taken the tough steps to balance our federal budget. 
So our factories and businesses are operating efficiently, our workers are earning more, and our sound government finances are helping to keep interest rates down. What could go wrong? 
Well, what if the markets for this new, more productive economy were not there? What if international investors pull their money out of some of our major trading partners? What if those countries stop buying our products and services? What if they can't pay back their loans, and American investments there lose money instead of sending profits back home? 
Unfortunately, that is just what is happening now, and instead of acting quickly to limit the threat of these developments, the majority in the House of Representatives has chosen to play a dangerous game of chicken with international financial markets. 
Mr. President, the Senate went on record in March, by an overwhelming vote of 84 to 16, in favor of full funding of U.S. participation in the International Monetary Fund. But those funds were dropped by the House in Conference. 
I am pleased to see that Chairman Stevens, who, along with my colleague Senator Hagel on the Foreign Relations Committee has shown real leadership on this issue, has taken a second crack at the problem by including this funding on the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. Unfortunately, we will not act on that bill until after the August recess. 
But just last week, the House pulled its version of the Foreign Ops bill from further consideration because of their internal squabbling over funding for the IMF. 
I fear that those squabbles may mask an even more cynical motive--to hold the IMF, and by extension global financial stability, hostage to increase their bargaining leverage 
on unrelated issues at the end of the legislative session this fall. 
Mr. President, I want to stress what is at stake while the majority in the House dithers. The financial crisis that began a year ago in Asia has not gone away--it continues to fester, and threatens to spread. Indeed, with the resources of the IMF already stretched thin, we may be entering the most critical phase of this threat to the global economy. 
If the worst case happens, Mr. President, we will have no place to hide, no matter how well things have been going for us lately. Just look at the risks. 
Japan is the keystone of the Asian economy--it could pull that already fragile region into a real depression if current trends are not quickly and dramatically reversed. That's why the recent elections there were so important, and why international investors are watching closely to see if Japan has the political muscle to overhaul its financial system and restore growth at the same time. That is a lot to ask, and much hangs on the outcome, including the health of important markets for American exports throughout Asia. 
Mr. President, in May our trade deficit soared to $15.8 billion, as exports to Asia dropped by 21 percent compared to a year ago. Still, our friends in the House suggest that we wait until the fall to see if things get worse. 
Russia presents an additional threat to our economic and security interests. Despite the announcement of a new IMF package, the Moscow stock market index has dropped 24 percent. An economically foundering Russia, facing political collapse, opens a Pandora's box of issues for stability in Europe and around the world. 
On top of all this, other countries, including South Africa, Ukraine, and Malaysia, are lined up in the IMF's waiting room. 
But because of the severity of the Asian crisis, the IMF's resources are so low that international investors must now have real fear that it will not be able to provide further support to its current clients, or support any additional countries now on the brink. This will add uncertainty to an already shaky situation, and can only make further panic more likely. 
Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, recently warned those who think we can do without the IMF that they are `playing with fire.' He's right. 
They have decided, for short-term political reasons--some as small as their own fight over the Speaker's job--that they are willing to fiddle while the international economy burns. The IMF is not a perfect institution, Mr. President, but right now it is the only fire insurance we have got. 
By delaying indefinitely the funding for the IMF, these gamblers are taking deadly risks with our own economy, an economy that has taken years of sacrifice to restore to health. They are squandering our ability to lead economically and politically in a time of international crisis in exchange for some short-term political gains. 
It is time to cease this recklessness, Mr. President. It's time to provide the IMF with the funds it needs, and remove short-sighted bickering and self-serving calculations in the U.S. Congress from the list of threats to our own economy.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation designed to provide a framework for joint congressional-executive decision-making about the most solemn decision that a nation can make: to send men and women to fight and die for their country. 
Entitled the `Use of Force Act,' the legislation would replace the war powers resolution of 1973 with a new mechanism that, I hope, will be more effective than the existing statute. 
Enacted nearly a quarter century ago, over the veto of President Nixon, the war powers resolution has enjoyed an unhappy fate--scorned by Presidents who questioned its constitutionality, and ignored by a Congress too timid to exercise its constitutional duty. 
That was not, of course, the intent of its framers, who sought to improve executive-congressional cooperation on questions involving the use of force--and to remedy a dangerous constitutional imbalance. 
This imbalance resulted from what I call the `monarchist' view of the war power--the thesis that the President holds nearly unlimited power to direct American forces into action. 
The thesis is largely a product of the cold war and the nuclear age: the view that, at a time when the fate of the planet itself appeared to rest with two men thousands of miles apart, Congress had little choice, or so it was claimed but to cede tremendous authority to the executive. 
This thesis first emerged in 1950, when President Truman sent forces to Korea without congressional authorization. It peaked twenty years later, in 1970, when President Nixon sent U.S. forces into Cambodia--also without congressional authorization, but this time accompanied by sweeping assertions of autonomous Presidential power. 
President Nixon's theory was so extreme that it prompted the Senate to begin a search--a search led by Republican Jacob Javits and strongly supported by a conservative Democrat, John Stennis of Mississippi--for some means of rectifying the constitutional imbalance. That search culminated in the war powers resolution. 
Unfortunately, the war powers resolution has failed to fulfill its objective. If anything, the monarchist view has become more deeply ingrained with the passage of time. 
This trend was been on display throughout this decade. Before the gulf war, for example, with half a million American forces standing ready in Saudi Arabia--a situation clearly requiring congressional authorization--President Bush still refused to concede that he required an act of Congress before using force. Only at the last minute, and only grudgingly, did President Bush seek congressional support. Even then, he continued to assert that he sought only support, refusing to concede that congressional authorization was a legal necessity. 
Several years ago, the notion of broad executive power was claimed on the eve of a proposed invasion of Haiti--an invasion that, thankfully, was averted by a last-minute diplomatic initiative. 
In 1994, officials of the Clinton administration characterized the Haiti operation as a mere `police action'--a semantic dodge designed to avoid congressional authorization--and a demonstration that the monarchist view prevails in the White 
House, without regard to political party. 
And, most recently, the Clinton administration asserted that it had all the authority it needed to initiate a military attack against Iraq--though it never publicly elaborated on this supposed authority. 
In this case, the question was not clear-cut--as it was in 1991. But two things emerged in the debate that reinforce the need for this legislation. First, it demonstrated that the executive instinct to find `sufficient legal authority' to use force is undiluted. 
Second, it demonstrated that Congress often lacks the institutional will to carry out its responsibilities under the war power. Although there was strong consensus that a strong response was required to Saddam Hussein's resistance to U.N. inspections, there was no consensus in this body about whether Congress itself should authorize military action. Lacking such a consensus, Congress did nothing. 
Congress' responsibilities could not be clearer. Article one, section eight, clause eleven of the Constitution grants to Congress the power `to declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal and to make rules concerning captures on land and water.' 
To the President, the Constitution provides in article two, section two the role of `Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States.' 
It may fairly be said that, with regard to many constitutional provisions, the Framers' intent was ambiguous. But on the war power, both the contemporaneous evidence and the early construction of these clauses do not leave much room for doubt. 
The original draft of the Constitution would have given to Congress the power to `make war.' At the Constitutional Convention, a motion was made to change this to `declare war.' The reason for the change is instructive. 
At the Convention, James Madison and Elbridge Gerry argued for the amendment solely in order to permit the President the power `to repel sudden attacks.' Just one delegate, Pierce Butler of South Carolina, suggested that the President should be given the power to initiate war. 
The rationale for vesting the power to launch war in Congress was simple. The Framers' views were dominated by their experience with the British King, who had unfettered power to start wars. Such powers the Framers were determined to deny the President. 
Even Alexander Hamilton, a staunch advocate of Presidential power, emphasized that the President's power as Commander in Chief would be `much inferior' to the British King, amounting to `nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces,' while that of the British King `extends to declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies--all which, by [the U.S.] Constitution, would appertain to the legislature.' 
It is frequently contended by those who favor vast Presidential powers that Congress was granted only the ceremonial power to declare war. But the Framers had little interest, it seems, in the ceremonial aspects of war. The real issue was congressional authorization of war. As Hamilton noted in Federalist twenty-five, the `ceremony of a formal denunciation of war has of late fallen into disuse.' 
The conclusion that Congress was given the 
power to initiate all wars, except to repel attacks on the United States, is also strengthened in view of the second part of the war clause: the power to `grant letters of marque and reprisal.' 
An anachronism today, letters of marque and reprisal were licenses issued by governments empowering agents to seize enemy ships or take action on land short of all-out war. In essence, it was an eighteenth century version of what we now regarded as `limited war' or `police actions.' 
The framers undoubtedly knew that reprisals, or `imperfect war,' could lead to an all-out war. England, for example, had fought five wars between 1652 and 1756 which were preceded by public naval reprisals. 
Surely, those who met at Philadelphia--all learned men--knew and understood this history. Given this, the only logical conclusion is that the framers intended to grant to Congress the power to initiate all hostilities, even limited wars. 
In sum, to accept the proposition that the war power is merely ceremonial, or applies only to `big wars,' is to read much of the war clause out of the Constitution. Such a reading is supported neither by the plain language of the text, or the original intent of the framers. 
Any doubt about the wisdom of relying on this interpretation of the intent of the framers is dispelled in view of the actions of early Presidents, early Congresses, and early Supreme Court decisions. 
Our earliest Presidents were extremely cautious about encroaching on Congress' power under the war clause. 
For example, in 1793, the first President, George Washington, stated that offensive operations against an indian tribe, the Creek Nation, depended on congressional action: `The Constitution vests the power of declaring war with Congress; therefore no offensive expedition of importance can be undertaken until after they have deliberated upon the subject, and authorized such a measure.' 
During the Presidency of John Adams, the United States engaged in an undeclared naval war with France. But it bears emphasis that these military engagements were clearly authorized by Congress by a series of incremental statutes. 
The naval war with France also yielded three important Supreme Court decisions regarding the scope of the war power. 
In 1799, Congress authorized the President to intercept any U.S. vessels headed to France. President Adams subsequently ordered the Navy to seize any ships traveling to or from France. 
The Supreme Court declared the seizure of a U.S. vessel traveling from France to be illegal--thus ruling that Congress had the power not only to authorize limited war, and but also to limit Presidential power to take military action. 
The court ruled in two other cases bearing on the question of limited war. Wars, the Court said, even if `imperfect,' are nonetheless wars. In still another case, Chief Justice Marshall opined that `the whole powers of war [are] by the Constitution . . . vested in Congress . . . [which] may authorize general hostilities . . . or partial war.' 
These precedents, and the historical record of actions taken by other early Presidents, have significantly more bearing on the meaning of the war clause than the modern era. 
As Chief Justice Warren once wrote, `The precedential value of [prior practice] tends to increase in proportion to the proximity' to the constitutional convention. 
Unfortunately, this constitutional history seems largely forgotten, and the doctrine of Presidential power that arose during the cold war remains in vogue. 
To accept the status quo requires us to believe that the constitutional imbalance serves our nation well. But it can hardly be said that it does. 
As matters now stand, Congress is denied its proper role in sharing in the decision to commit American troops, and the President is deprived of the consensus to help carry this policy through. 
I believe that only by establishing an effective war powers mechanism can we ensure that both of these goals are met. The question then is this: How to revise the war powers resolution in a manner that gains bipartisan support--and support of the executive? 
In the past two decades, a premise has gained wide acceptance that the war powers resolution is fatally flawed. Indeed, there are flaws in the resolution but they need not have been fatal. 
In 1988, determining that a review of the war powers resolution was in order, the Foreign Relations Committee established a special subcommittee to assume the task. 
As chairman of the subcommittee, I conducted extensive hearings. Over the course of two months, the subcommittee heard from many distinguished witnesses: former President Ford, former Secretaries of State and Defense, former Joint Chiefs of Staff, former Members of Congress who drafted the war powers resolution, and many constitutional scholars. 
At the end of that process, I wrote a law review article describing how the war powers resolution might be thoroughly rewritten to overcome its actual and perceived liabilities. 
That effort provided the foundation for the legislation I introduced in the 104th Congress, and that I reintroduce today. The bill has many elements; I will briefly summarize it. 
First, the bill replaces the war powers resolution with a new version. But I should make clear that I retain its central element: a time-clock mechanism that limits the President's power to use force abroad. That mechanism, it bears emphasis, was found to be unambiguously constitutional in a 1980 opinion issued by the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice. 
It is often asserted that the time-clock provisions is `unworkable,' or that it invites our adversaries to make a conflict so painful in the short run so as to induce timidity in the Congress. 
But with or without a war powers law, American willingness to undertake sustained hostilities will always be subject to democratic pressures. A statutory mechanism is simply a means of delineating procedure. 
And the procedure set forth in this legislation assures that if the President wants an early congressional vote on a use of force abroad, his congressional supporters can produce it. 
Recent history tells us, of course, that the American people, as well as Congress, rally around the flag--and the Commander-in-Chief--in the early moments of a military deployment. 
Second, my bill defuses the specter that a `timid Congress' can simply sit on its hands and permit the authority for a deployment to expire. 
First, it establishes elaborate expedited procedures designed to ensure that a vote will occur. And it explicitly defeats the `timid Congress' specter by granting to the President the authority he has sought if these procedures nonetheless fail to produce a vote. 
Thus, if the President requests authority for a sustained use of force--one outside the realm of emergency--and Congress fails to vote, the President's authority is extended indefinitely. 
Third, the legislation delineates what I call the `going in' authorities for the President to use force. One fundamental weakness of the war powers resolution is that it fails to acknowledge powers that most scholars agree are inherent Presidential powers: to repel an armed attack upon the United States or its Armed Forces, or to rescue Americans abroad. 
My legislation corrects this deficiency by enumerating five instances where the President may use force:

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment with Senator Hatch to reauthorize the Drug Director's Office. Senator Hatch and I have been assisted by several other Senators in this effort, and I would just note that the reauthorization bill reported by the Judiciary Committee last year was cosponsored by Senators Thurmond, DeWine, Coverdell, and Feinstein. 
I would also note that since then, we have worked closely with Senator McCain to meet some concerns that he had raised relating to the Drug Director's budget certification powers. And, the language we have negotiated with Senator McCain  is incorporated into the text offered in this amendment. 
This bipartisan legislation will, I hope, result in speedy action to keep the Drug Director's Office in place--no matter what perspective any of us have on any specific drug policy, this legislation is about whether we will have a Drug Director and Drug Office to be responsible for--and accountable to--a national drug policy. 
In 1987, before my legislation creating the Drug Office finally became law, There was no official in charge of the administration's drug effort; and, because there was no Cabinet official in charge, every Cabinet official could duck responsibility to talk about tough drug policy issues--and, guess what, that meant no administration talked about drugs and no administration was accountable on drugs. 
Just as with my original drug czar legislation, the Hatch-Biden amendment retains its central goal--holding every administration and every President accountable on the drug issue. 
The Hatch-Biden amendment does so in several ways: 
First, and this was one of Chairman Hatch's top priorities, Hatch-Biden requires the Clinton administration to identify measurable objectives for the National Drug Strategy, and provide on February 1, 1999, specific answers about whether these objectives have been met; 
Second, Hatch-Biden retains the current law about the administration submitting a detailed annual drug budget--every line of which is reviewed and changed in the annual congressional appropriations process. 
To this, Hatch-Biden adds a requirement--called for by General McCaffrey--for budget projections covering the next 4 years. In other words, this prevents any `pie-in-the-sky' promises, which are not backed up by specific budget projections. 
Third, and this is the major change proposed by General McCaffrey and included in Hatch-Biden, instead of the overall drug strategy, it requires a detailed annual report which will focus the administration and the Congress on the `nuts and bolts' of implementing the strategy. 
As Senator Hatch points out--instead of a strategy in which an administration tells us what it is going to do about drugs; this report will force any administration to tell us what they have accomplished against drugs. 
Hatch-Biden includes specific language requiring: 
That the annual report include any necessary modifications of the drug strategy; 
A whole new strategy if the current strategy proves ineffective; 
An annual assessment of the progress on the specific, measurable goals identified in the drug strategy; 
Goals that are required by law to address--current drug use; availability of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana; drug prices, and purity among many others; and 
That any new President or new Drug Director submit a new drug strategy. 
Finally, the key addition of the annual report included in Hatch-Biden is the `performance measurement system'--which would add nearly 100 detailed measures, each with a definite timetable. 
These measures are all about holding the 50 drug agencies and offices accountable to the drug policy goals of the administration--the one task that all Drug Directors have found exceedingly difficult to actually implement. 
Just to identify a few of these specific measures: 
Increase asset seized from drug traffickers by 15 percent; increase drug trafficking organizations dismantled by 20 percent in high intensity drug trafficking areas; and reduce worldwide coca cultivation by at least 40 percent. 
Of course, we would all like each of these measures to be achieved immediately--but, even if we could do this efficiently, the costs would be staggering--an additional $60-$90 billion over just the next 3 years. So, achieving these goals will take time. 
One final point on the general's performance measurement system--if we are to give him a fighting chance to increase the accountability of all the drug agencies, we have to put this system in law. For, if we do not, mark my words, the general will be defeated by all the career officials in all the drug agencies who want to stop this increased accountability. 
Another element of General McCaffrey's proposal which has been included in Hatch-Biden is to require that the No. 2 official in the office--the Deputy Director--have to come before the Senator for confirmation just like the demand deputy, supply deputy and State and local deputy. 
I favor this because the hearing, committee, and floor votes on the Deputy Director would give the Senate another important opportunity to hold any administration accountable on drugs. 
In addition, the key mission of the Drug Office--holding the nearly 50 agencies and offices with drug policy responsibilities accountable--requires having officials with the credentials of Senate confirmation. 
The Hatch-Biden amendment also includes specific language calling for `scientific, educational, or professional' credentials for whomever is nominated for the demand deputy job. 
This is an issue that Senators Grassley and Moynihan have really been the leaders on--and I just acknowledge their key role in this aspect of Hatch-Biden. 
I also note that, at the chairman's insistence, the length of time of this reauthorization has been drastically shortened. 
While the general initially proposed to authorize the office for 12 years, Hatch-Biden reauthorizes for 4 years through September 30, 2002. 
In closing, I would point out that this legislation has been through a long process here in the Senate and that this process has resulted in a strong, bipartisan bill. 
I understand that the two managers of the bill, Senators Campbell and Kohl, are willing to accept this amendment. I appreciate their support, and the support of the full Senate for the reauthorization of the Drug Director.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it is with some reluctance that I rise this afternoon to speak of the tragic occurrence, where two fine officers were gunned down here in the Capitol. The reason I say it is with reluctance is because, like many of us in this Chamber, I know from personal experience that when a wife or husband or son or daughter is taken from a family as a consequence of a totally unexpected violent event, that there is little that anyone can say or do, no matter how well intended we may be, that can in any way ease the pain of the family members who survive--the children, the spouses, parents. 
So I debated with myself today whether or not to say anything at all. Much has been said about the heroism displayed in the performance of duty, and much more will be said about the lives that these two men, in giving theirs, probably saved. All that need be said, but none of that in any way is likely to produce any sense of relief on the part of the children of the officers, on the part of their spouses, on the part of their families. As a matter of fact, it is likely to produce, initially, a sense of anger; a feeling of `Why my father?' a feeling of `Why did it have to be my husband?' 
So, in a few moments each of us in our own ways will, as we attend the memorial service, demonstrate our high regard for and pay respects to the families as well as the deceased officers. But I also note one other thing from personal experience. Notwithstanding the fact nothing that we say today can ease that horrible void that seems to occupy the chest of the family members who can't fathom why this occurred to their father or to their husband--nothing we do will make them feel any better today--but, as time goes on, they will find a sense of comfort knowing that so many people held their father, their spouse, in such high regard. It will not occur for months, but it will occur. It will occur. And when it does, it will at that time help ease, ever so slightly, that sense of loss. The pain will never go away. The sense of loss will never be completely abated. But it will become easier to live with. So, as I said, although a lot of us in this Chamber know from similar experiences the feeling, it is hard when you are going through it to know one other thing that occurs and that is that time, time will not erase the pain, but time will make it livable. 
At this moment, I expect, family members feel that nothing--nothing--nothing that will happen to them from this point on will make life as worth living as it has been for them. But, again from personal experiences, all of us know, who have gone through similar things, that the time will come when the memory of J.J. or John, the memory of their father or husband, will bring a smile to their lips rather than a tear to their eyes. My only prayer, on behalf of my wife Jill and me--we talked a lot about this morning before I came down--my prayer for the family members is that moment will come sooner than later. It will come. It will come. But that it will come sooner than later. 
We ask a lot of those who serve this Nation. But few of us, few of us ever have to give what these two officers gave. Even fewer family members have to live with the sacrifice they have made, the void that is created and the pain that will endure for some time, like the families of the two fallen officers. So, again, I have no illusions that my words, as inadequate as they are, or the words of any of us, will at this moment give much comfort. But in time, in time I hope they will find some refuge in what has been said, in the outpouring of respect, the outpouring of emotion, the outpouring of just simple, plain gratitude on the part of the staff, the Senators, and all Americans for what these two men did. 
They did their duty. They did their duty. And, in doing so, they clearly saved the lives of other innocent people. That is no comfort now, but it will, in time, be some comfort. 
Let me close by saying, once again, in time the pain will ease. In time, when they think of their father, when they think of their husband, they will, in fact, smile rather than cry. All that we can hope is that time will come sooner than later. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let's get it straight what this does. All of you came to me and said, `I can't vote for the Craig amendment because it expands gambling on the Internet.' What the Kyl amendment does is expands gambling. 
Right now it is illegal to use the wire to place a bet. U.S. Code 18, section 1084, Transmission of Wagering Information Penalties. Read it. I don't have a minute. It is illegal now. 
What the Kyl amendment does is make what is now illegal legal for certain carved-out exceptions which benefit--and there is nothing wrong with this, depending on your interests--which benefit certain segments of the gambling industry. That is what this does. 
If I had more than a minute, I would explain in more detail. This expands gambling. It does not cut back on gambling. It expands it. What is now illegal in certain areas becomes legal.

Exceptions--Otherwise lawful bets or wagers that are placed, received or otherwise made wholly interstate for State lotteries, racing or parimutuel activity. 
Exceptions. 
Let me point out one other thing. Under current Federal law, it is illegal to take a bet using a telephone wire, which means that under current law, basically all Internet gambling is illegal because you use a wire. 
Under the Kyl amendment, it would become legal to take a bet on the Internet if the States where the bettor placed and received authorized the bet and the bettor is a subscriber of a gambling company's network. This is an expansion. Expansion. 
If you want to do something about the Internet, strike exceptions, and I promise you, the sponsors will vote against this. Strike exceptions. If you don't want any betting using the wire, strike `exceptions.'

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 included vital provisions to protect abused immigrant women--so they wouldn't have to choose to stay in an abusive marriage or be deported from America 
This has helped a relatively small number of battered women--a few thousand each year--but it was important that we--on a bipartisan basis--took this moral step. 
Since 1994, we have found other ways in which we in effect force women to remain in abusive marriages and rely on their abusive husbands for their immigration status. 
This amendment restores the protections of the original Violence Against Women Act in four key ways: 
By ensuring that battered women are included in the narrow immigration provision already included in this bill. 
By preventing the roughly 1500 women per year who complete the full process of proving that they are in fact battered from being deported solely because of some arbitrary limits. 
By allowing the Immigration and Naturalization Service to permit a battered woman to remain in the U.S. even though she has left the country for a brief period--provided that she has an understandable reason (such as in the case of a woman who was literally taken to Mexico against her will). 
And by requiring the Immigration and Naturalization Service to give a battered woman an opportunity to prove that she was battered and eligible for Violence Against Women Act relief before deporting her under an order issued without her notice. 
This is an important amendment--even though it will affect a modest number of battered women. I am pleased that this amendment is cosponsored by Senators Abraham, Kennedy, Leahy, Wellstone and others. I am also pleased that this amendment has been accepted and will be adopted by the full Senate unanimously.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to briefly discuss the funding levels for international broadcasting in this legislation. I am disappointed by the considerable reductions in the Senate bill in this account. We have important priorities in this account. Radio Free Asia, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), and the Voice of America are critical instruments of American foreign policy. For a relatively modest cost, these broadcasting agencies project American values and promote American ideals. RFE/RL was of critical importance during the Cold War in undermining the tight control on information imposed by the communist states in Eastern Europe and Eurasia. Although the Cold War is over, RFE/RL still have an important function in a region where independent media are not yet firmly established, and, in many countries, is barely adequate. I authored the legislation in 1994 which created Radio Free Asia--which broadcasts news about local events to China and the other dictatorships in the region--and I want to ensure that it has the necessary resources so that it can perform its function. 
It is my understanding that Committee has assumed that the bill fully funds Radio Free Asia at the requested level of $19.4 million. Is that the understanding of the Chairman?

That is true, but the Senator from New Hampshire should understand that, in my view, it is quite likely that Radio Free Asia will be reauthorized next year. I plan to introduce such legislation early in the next Congress, and I would expect that it would be included as part of next year's Foreign Relations Authorization Act.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as we close debate on the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill, I would like to make a few comments on the funding for the foreign affairs agencies. 
I want to express my appreciation to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee for their efforts to provide adequate funding for the foreign policy agencies within the tight allocation they have. The United States is a great military and economic power, with extensive interests overseas. To protect those interests, we need both a strong military and a strong diplomatic corps. `Diplomatic readiness' is more than a slogan; it represents a commitment to ensure that our diplomats, who stand on the front lines of our national defense, have the resources to perform the many tasks we entrust to them. 
I commend the Committee for providing, in particular, the necessary funding to modernize the Department of State's information technology. The Department made some bad choices in previous years, and is now saddled with antiquated computer and telecommunications technology. Information is central to the task of diplomacy, and we are undermining our interests substantially unless we properly equip the Department with modern technology. 
I'd like to say a few words about the Bureau of Export Administration in the Department of Commerce, which performs several functions that are vital to the national security of the United States. The managers of the bill before us were unable to find $2.5 million for three of those vital functions. I appeal to the managers to make every effort to find those funds in conference, so that we can continue to safeguard the national security as the American people expect us to do.

Mr. BIDEN. I know the Senator knows a great deal about this, but I watched the press conference our Republican colleagues held hailing their Patients' Bill of Rights. You just went through and will continue to go through all the things they left out. I find it very curious the things they say are in their bill, which, in fact, are not in their bill. 
One, they say that a woman can pick as a primary care physician an ob/gyn. Second, they advertise that this means you have access to the emergency room. Third, they talk about continuity of doctors so they say you can choose your doctor. And fourth, they say no gag rule. This is the party of gag rule, and now they say no gag rule. I kind of respected them when they were just flat out saying they were just against any of this. 
Does the Senator have an explanation as to why they would pick the four most often stated complaints of the American public and suggest that their bill covers those things? It just seems strange to me that the party of the gag rule says they want an antigag rule, and yet there still is no antigag rule; that the party that said when they were going after Clinton's health plan, you should be able to choose your own doctor, will not allow you to choose a specialist or choose the doctor you need; that the party that suggested the costs of the Clinton plan were too high and everyone could just go to the emergency room are not, in fact, providing access to emergency room care the way in which the American public is looking at it. Why did they pick these four things to say they were for and not any of the rest? Is there some strategy here I am missing?

Mr. BIDEN. Well, let me say to the Senator that I, quite frankly, admired--disagreed, but admired--my Republican colleagues when they made no bones about the fact that they did not want any interference in any way by the Government to do anything about HMOs. At least theirs was a principled stand. They said, `Look, the insurance companies, in driving down costs, are more important than all these other factors. We're not going to do anything.' 
What bothers me--and this is me; you are not saying this, I know it, but I am saying it--what bothers me is the apparent cynicism of picking four items which most often my constituency speaks to, to say they are covered, and nothing else. And even when you look into those four items, they are not really covered. 
They are going to be going around--and the insurance companies are spending tens of millions of dollars in ads--saying, `We want you to have the right to choose a doctor.' 
Wait a minute. That is what they said before. But under the Republican bill, the American people can't choose their doctor, if the doctor they happen to need is a specialist, if the doctor they happen to need is in an emergency room and they don't meet the standard that the HMO sets. 
I have not been nearly as involved in this debate as my friend from Massachusetts. And as the old joke goes: He has forgotten more about health care than I am going to learn. But I would feel better about what is going on here if the Republicans said what they truly believe, `Hey, look, we're not changing our position. We don't think you should be able to choose your own doctor. We don't think there should be an antigag rule. We don't think you should change the requirements to get emergency room access. We don't think that a woman should be able to choose her gynecologist as her primary physician.' 
Let me tell you what I think they figured out. I know of no wrath like that of the wrath of a woman who says, `I can't go to the doctor that I need and trust the most.' And so they seem to be yielding only in places--and only in part--where the loudest cries are coming from. But, there are so many, many, many, many loopholes in what they say they are doing, and so much they leave out. 
I kind of yearn for the day when they just stood up on the floor like they do on guns and say, `Hey, look, guns are not bad. You know, guns don't kill people. People kill people.' I kind of like that. I admire it. But this, I don't know. 
There will be a multimillion-dollar campaign we are all going to endure, and you do not have to be a rocket scientist to figure out where this is going before this is all over. And I expect I am going to hear your name mentioned a couple hundred thousand times before this is over, too. But at any rate, I thank you for answering my question.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise this evening on behalf of myself and my distinguished colleague from Delaware, Senator Bill Roth, to note the importance of a project at the New Castle County Airport in Delaware that involves the Federal Aviation Administration, and to ask the help of the managers of this bill. 
In an extraordinary--and what is believed to be the first-of-its-kind offer--the owners of the New Castle County Airport--a bi-state compact known as the Delaware River and Bay Authority--has agreed to pay the approximately $5 million it will cost to construct and equip a new control tower. This facility will replace the 43-year old existing tower which does not meet federally-mandated safety and environmental standards. 
The FAA, however, has now taken the position that not only should the Delaware River and Bay Authority finance the cost to design and construct a new control tower, but also pay $2.3 million for the FAA's overhead, equipment and administrative costs to oversee the project. 
In addition, the FAA wants the sponsor to reimburse the agency $1 million for costs related to the relocation of the FAA's Very High Frequency radar system (VOR) at the Airport--even though the FAA's current lease indicates the FAA should bear such costs. 
With the Airport sponsor willing to finance the significant cost of constructing a new control tower for the FAA, the agency should not impose additional overhead costs on that sponsor. 
The owners of the Airport have worked diligently and cooperatively with the FAA for the past three years on this project, but continue to encounter further financial demands and bureaucratic delays. 
Clearly, this new control tower will help the FAA. Not only will the FAA get a new, state-of-the-art tower at no cost, if the New Castle County Airport is able to expand, it will help the FAA solve the growing problem of air traffic congestion at major commercial airports in Philadelphia, Baltimore and New York. 
We believe it is in the best safety interests of all parties--the FAA, the Delaware River and Bay Authority, and most importantly the flying public--that this critical airport in Delaware be allowed to construct a new control tower facility for the FAA, without additional financial demands and delays. 
It's our understanding that the House Appropriations Committee Report accompanying the FY'99 Transportation Appropriations bill specifically directs the FAA to assume the approximate $3.3 million in overhead costs. I rise today to bring this important issue to the attention of the Chairman and Ranking Member and to seek your help in working to include this House language in the Conference Report.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on the Bumpers amendment, I voted against the position of Senator Bumpers, not because I disagree with the substance of it. For the last 25 years and for the years I was chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I have adhered to the notion that the Judicial Conference, a system that we set up in the Congress years ago, is the appropriate vehicle to make recommendations for changes in the Federal rules. The reason I voted against the Bumpers amendment is not because I don't think prosecutors are out of hand, not because I don't think there is abuse of the grand jury system, which, by the way, for hundreds of years has relied upon the proposition that good judgment, sound judgment would be exercised by prosecutors and not be abused. Obviously, it is being abused. 
My hope is, regardless of what the outcome of this is legislatively, I am going to propose at a future time that the Senate ask the Judicial Conference to consider changes in the Federal rules relative to the conduct of grand juries and make recommendations to the Senate. That is the way we have done it since the Judicial Conference has been set up. That is the more appropriate way to deal with the Federal rules. 
I conclude by complimenting Senator Bumpers for pointing out an abuse of the system and the need for change. I think the appropriate way to do it is through the Federal rules.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I admire and applaud the interest of my friend from Alabama in the criminal justice system. He is a former prosecutor and is dedicated to law enforcement. I stand not to disagree with his concern; I disagree with his solution. There is on old expression where I come from--I think the Senator is `in the right church, but he is in the wrong pew.' 
I will explain what I mean by that. My friend has not misrepresented any facts, but it is a matter of presentation here. I want to make sure that I deal with 3 major issues. I want to lay out to my colleagues what I am going to do. First of all, I want to applaud the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee here. I think they did one heck of a job on this legislation. I start off by rising to defend--not that they need any defense--what the appropriations bill does in this area. So I am going to first make sure we all understand, and our colleagues' staffs who are listening understand, what the amendment of my friend from Alabama actually does, in specific terms. Then I want to speak to the issue he has raised, which is that there are already a sufficient number of programs dealing with prevention. He cites the GAO study. I want to go into some detail, quite frankly, for the first time. These figures keep being offered and this assertion keeps being stated. I think, although it accurately says what the GAO report says, it does not accurately reflect what is actually being done relative to prevention. Lastly, I am going to conclude by laying out what I believe to be the larger prescription to putting into context what I think we should be doing to deal with the problem the Senator from Alabama and I--and I suspect every Senator--agrees that we have to attend to now. 
I respectfully suggest that, at the outset, about 5 years ago when the crime bill passed--the comprehensive crime bill--it was called the Biden crime bill. That is when it didn't look like it was going to work, so the President liked it that way. Well, it started to work, and then it was the Clinton crime bill. So it started out as the Biden crime bill. The point is that it's working, so it is the Clinton crime bill. And it is now the bipartisan crime bill, which everybody supported. 
That was the first time in the 25 years I have been here that, on a large scale, we learned to walk and chew gum at the same time when we dealt with crime. We had a very heavy dose of enforcement, a very heavy dose of prevention, and a very heavy dose of medicine relating to incarceration after the conviction. And I think that is the way we have to approach the issue of juvenile justice. It is the last unattended-to criminal justice issue of consequence that we have not come up with a comprehensive plan on. 
The Senator from Alabama and I have been cooperating, debating, disagreeing, and working with one another in the Judiciary Committee for the last year and a half, with differing points of view on how to deal with a comprehensive juvenile justice approach. He indicates this is not that comprehensive approach. He is doing what is within his rights and what he is limited to be able to do on this appropriations bill, and that is deal specifically with what is in the bill. 
So the committee reported a bill that now includes $95 million for title V grants under the juvenile justice office. The way the committee broke it down, wisely, was $20 million for prevention efforts, aimed at tribal youth--that is in the Indian nations; $25 million for the enforcement of under-age drinking laws and efforts, championed particularly by Senator Byrd of West Virginia; $50 million for the remainder, which supports a variety of community-based locally developed crime prevention programs, targeted to school violence, drug abuse, and truancy, which I think is the first thing the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from Delaware agree on. If you look at all the data, the single most significant, predictable precursor of youth violence is truancy. If you give me a list of all the truants and a list of all the other attributes relating to activities and conduct of students in American schools, I will bet you I will be able to pick any school district, any school, and identify for you 85 to 95 percent of the troubled youth, 
violent youth, just by being able to identify truancy. So we all know that, like the Senator from South Carolina who has spent a great deal of time dealing in this area, as has the Senator from New Hampshire. We all know that. They made a very wise allocation. 
What would my friend from Alabama do with his amendment? He would cut the $95 million for prevention by $50 million. Then he would take that $50 million for so-called youth block grants. I am not opposed to youth block grants. In the Biden juvenile justice bill, which is the alternative on our side of the aisle to S. 10 by my friend from Alabama and others, what we do--we believe we have to have enforcement as well. The Senator from Alabama takes $50 million out, which is basically the $50 million dealing with after-school, community-based programs and puts it into enforcement efforts. Last year, $45 million was appropriated for this, and the Senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions, is cutting the program back to last year's level--that is, $45 million--for all of the nonenforcement provisions relating to prevention. 
Now, I note parenthetically that the Democratic youth violence bill has $100 million for after-school prevention, $400 million for youth violence block grants, which is enforcement, and $250 million relating to existing programs, about one-half enforcement and one-half prevention, and $150 million for juvenile prosecutors in courts. So I want to put this into context. I don't speak for either of the managers of the bill, but my guess is that this is not a case where they attempted to write an entire juvenile justice bill. They were dealing with provisions within that. So I don't disagree with the proposition of my friend from Alabama that we have to do more on the enforcement side as well. 
The bill I have written, in concert with my Democratic colleagues--and many Republicans as well support it--relates to both prevention and enforcement. When I say enforcement, I mean prosecution and the courts, and we have already taken care of provisions and have more provisions relating to juvenile justice detention and the facilities relating to that. 
So let's get this straight as this debate is underway here. I am not suggesting, in taking on what I am about to do regarding the specifics of the present specific amendment of my friend from Alabama, that we don't need more for enforcement. Again, I go back to my opening statement. I said it is nice when we have learned--and it works--to walk and chew gum at the same time. That is what we did on the master crime bill, the major crime bill. I don't know of anybody saying that crime bill is a bad bill now. What we did there is we committed, over a 5-year period, billions of dollars--$30 billion. It did not break down a third, a third, and a third, but it was not far off that. I am overstating it in the interest of time. Roughly 30 percent was for prisons, 30 percent was for cops, and 30 percent for related programs that keep people from going into prison. That makes sense. 
Now, we should do that on a wholesale basis for juvenile justice with a different focus. Let me specifically respond and again make the point--and I realize I am being somewhat pedantic here. But this is not about whether you are for enforcement or for prevention. We should do both, and we do both. It is about whether or not the skewed alteration of the allocation of prevention and enforcement proposed by the Senator from Alabama is the right way to go. Obviously, I think it is the wrong way to go. Let me explain why. First, in explaining why, let me respond to the specific underlying, and on its face compelling rationale my friend from Alabama offers with his blue charts. 
Let me explain what I mean by that. 
The Senator makes the statement that has been made many, many times--not just by him but by others--that we don't need to go anymore into the prevention side. In large part, the basic premise rests upon the notion that we don't need to provide them with safe havens, et cetera, because we already have out there 131 programs for at-risk youth with an annual appropriations of $4 billion. 
The Senator from Illinois actually knows about this subject. But if I am the Senator from Illinois and I come on the floor and listen to the debate, and I say, `Look, the Senator from Illinois is one of these guys who is always talking about cutting wastes from programs that we don't need'--overlapping programs--I stand up, and I say, `By the way, we don't need to spend more money, we just need to spend the money better.' 
The GAO report says there are 131 Federal programs and $4 billion. So I ask the Senator from Illinois why he would agree with Senator Biden--or, in this case, with the committee--in putting $50 million of the $95 million they have in the prevention program. That is kind of compelling. Then I say the GAO said that, not me--the GAO. But the GAO does say that. 
I am going to take a few moments to bore you with some of the data underlying the GAO report. Maybe we can get an agreement here as to what the facts are underscoring the basis upon which the GAO report was filed. My colleagues on the other side--some, and a few on this side--have been saying we don't need to do more to steer our children away from gangs and drugs; we don't need to provide more safe havens from the streets; we are already doing enough. I am supportive of the argument. GAO identifies 131 programs for at-risk youth with annual appropriations of $4 billion. And the claim is that after-school prevention programs that have been proposed by me and others included in the youth violence bill but included in this case in the appropriations bill are just more of the same. 
Let's take a closer look at the 131 programs being criticized over and over again and see what we are really talking about. 
I apologize to my colleagues. The ranking member of the Judiciary Committee has been kind enough to allow me to continue to be the ranking member of the Crime Subcommittee, and I feel like I let him down a little bit, because he has been doing about 500 other things out there in that committee, and I should have been calling what I am about to say to the attention of our colleagues 6 months ago, to be honest with you. And I didn't. I didn't. Let's take a look at it. 
The GAO report says that based on fiscal year 1995--to start with, many of the 131 programs have already been eliminated since then. In fact, 15 of the programs listed didn't even receive any funds in 1995. The report doesn't indicate whether any funds were expended on 22 others. What you had to start with is that a total of 37 of the 131 programs either didn't receive funds or weren't listed. The number of 131 is already inflated, No. 1. You are talking about maybe around 100--less than 100 programs. 
According to the GAO report, the Federal Government was spending about $4 billion per year on programs for delinquent and at-risk youth, a target that all of us on the floor are concerned about, from the Senator from Alabama to the Senator from New York to the Senators from New Hampshire and South 
Carolina. But when you take a close look at the actual programs, only a portion of these funds and programs are targeted specifically at preventing violence and drug abuse for young people. 
Let me give you two examples: $1.2 billion of the $4 billion--let's get this straight. 
You can tell I have been here 25 years because I am not a chart guy. I was kidding one of my Democratic colleagues saying that he does this so well when he debates. But guys like Bumpers, I, and Hollings are not so big on charts. We haven't learned the chart deal yet. I guess I should learn it to get into the mainstream, because if I had a chart, it would be clear. What I do is just talk longer and probably confuse things. But I am going to give it a shot without charts. 
Let's start off with 131 programs being offered saying we have $34 billion spent on at-risk youth. The truth is, it is 97 programs, and that is 1995. The truth is, in 1995 you really only had, at most, about 97 programs that got funded at all. OK? 
Then you have a second piece. Of those 97 programs that allegedly are targeted at at-risk youth--roughly 97--what you have is, $1.2 billion out of the $4 billion that is spent on those programs goes to the Job Training and Partnership Act. That was a program championed by a lead contender for the Presidential nomination of the Republican side, Dan Quayle, and the leading Democrat on the Senate side, Ted Kennedy. That is their program. When they introduced the program--and most of us were here--I don't remember any Member standing up saying this is for at-risk youth, designed to prevent crime. Hopefully, it has the spinoff benefit of providing jobs for kids and they don't go into crime. But this is not to deal with 36 million latchkey children who walk home after school without a mother or father there because both have to work and have from 2 in the afternoon or 3 in the afternoon until dinnertime with no supervision. That is not what the Job Training and Partnership Act was. But GAO counts $1.2 billion of that against the $4 billion they say we are spending on at-risk youth, violent youth. 
I am sure I don't have to remind anybody that the so-called JTPA is a program, as I said, championed by Dan Quayle and Ted Kennedy, that while job training is important, it is not what most of us think of as targeting at-risk, violent juveniles. 
Now we are down from $4 billion to $3.8 billion on 97 programs. There is another quarter of a billion dollars--not quite. To be precise, $245 million goes for vocational education programs. Most of the kids my friend from Alabama and I are concerned about are not signing up for vocational education, an important program. I strongly support it, as I do the job training program. But, again, no 13-year old with a key hanging around his neck after the school bell rings, walking through a bad neighborhood and by 12 junkies to get home, says, `My way out of this is job training; my way out of this is vocational education.' It is an important program, but it is not what we are talking about. 
Now we are down to about $2.75 billion and 97 programs. Actually, if you take vocational education, job training, and the related programs, it is about $1.5 billion the Federal Government spends. We are really down to about $2.35 billion and 97. 
Let's talk about some of the other programs. They go to very worthy activities. I am not in any way criticizing them. I voted for them, and I would vote for them again. I think they make sense. But they are not targeted programs for violent youth or at-risk youth. 
Let me go on. 
If we are going to talk about focus--that is what I am talking about here--7 of the programs listed are assistance for homeless youth, 9 of the programs--now we are down to about 90--9 others are very important, but they are for a variety of activities directed at Indian youth, for mental health and physical health programs. Now we are down to about 80 programs. 
Three other programs are dedicated specifically to mental health services for the general population. Now we are heading down into the mid seventies. Four programs deal with child abuse. Still we are in the seventies--below 70. And one of the programs is for migrant health services. So now you are down to around 70 programs from the 131.  
I will give you one example. The GAO list includes the HHS Child Welfare Grant Program which provides one-third of a billion dollars, $292 million, for foster care and services for abused and neglected children--very important services but not what we are talking about. 
So now we are getting down to the $2 billion area with about 70 programs. Other programs have little or nothing to do with crime and drug prevention. While any line drawing that I am making here--and I am doing that--is somewhat arbitrary, at least I hope this puts it in context for my colleagues. 
Let me give a couple other examples of programs that I don't think any of us--if we had a list of all the programs that I want, all the programs any of us want here to deal with youth prevention, if we listed them all on a board and I said, `Pick the top 50 that deal with violent youth and preventing crime,' I doubt whether you would add the Foster Parent Grant Program, the Food Stamp Employment Program, the Youth Impaired Driving Project, four programs for promoting art with youth--all important programs, all important, none of which I disagree with, but they do not have a darned thing to do with the center of the debate the Senator from Alabama and I have. 
I want programs. I want the States to be able to say, `We will keep the school open until 5 o'clock. We are going to have baseball teams for ninth graders and football teams and basketball teams for the girls.' None of the school districts you all live in do that, unless you send your kid to a private school. These kids have nothing to do. Kids need an excuse to tell that junkie they have to walk by on the corner to get to their home; they need an excuse to stay out of trouble. 
Let's go back home to your own school districts, many of which are strapped, and ask yourself, `Why is it there is Little League in the summer but no baseball teams after school for boys and girls in sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth grades?' Well, the school districts don't want to spend the money. 
I am the guy who came to this floor 8 years ago and said, `The majority of the violent crime committed by young people is not when you all think it is.' Everybody thought it was done in the heat of the night. It is done in broad daylight, in the sunlight between the hours of 2:30 and 6. 
I remember when I brought that report from the Judiciary Committee--actually, the credit goes to the joint staff then of the Judiciary Committee--when I brought it to the floor. `Oh, there goes those liberal guys again, talking about this coddling stuff.' Now there is not a cop in America, there is not a criminal justice person in America who doesn't say that is the problem. 
My mom has an expression, as she would say, God love her--my mother is an Irish Catholic woman with 6,000 expressions. I went to Catholic grade school with the nuns. I think my mother, when she wasn't having children, was a nun. She remembers all the expressions. And one of her favorite expressions is, `An idle mind is the devil's workshop.' 
An idle mind is the devil's workshop. You get a ninth grade kid living in a tough neighborhood without supervision of any adult in a school, in a family, for 4 hours every day after school, and good kids, good kids do bad things; it is called maturation. What the heck do we expect these kids to do? They lack good judgment. Even when they know and care about right and wrong, they have bad judgment because they are 14 years old; they are not 24 or 54. 
I ask all of you--you may be, and probably all are, a better person than I am, but I wonder how I would have been if every day after school for 4 hours a day I was on my own, on my own. I was a pretty good athlete, and I was a pretty good student, and I never got myself in trouble with the law. But I want to tell you something. I will bet you, if I was on my own, with all of the values my family instilled in me, I am not so sure I would have had the courage to say no to the guy who was 17 who says, `Hey, jump in the car and take a ride with me. It's only Charlie's car. We borrowed it.' I would like to think I would have said, `No problem. That's wrong. You guys are doing the wrong thing. I am not going to participate.' 
Let me tell you something, Jack. You are a better person than I am if you are certain how you would have done it. And that is how this incrementally starts. It doesn't start with a 13-year-old kid waking up saying, `You know, I am going out and get a MAC-9, walk into the 7-Eleven, blow away the guy behind the counter, and get $17 in cash so I can go buy myself some dope.' That is not how it works. 
And so what are we doing here? Well, once you winnow out the programs for problems like child abuse and mental illness, once you exclude the programs directed at narrow populations, I believe that only 41 of the 131 programs in the GAO list, spending out at about $1.1 billion in appropriations a year, are targeted specifically at juvenile crime and drug prevention. And of that total of $1.1 billion, $639 million, over half, went to just two programs, one of which I am responsible for coauthoring, so I obviously support it, and the other which I support as well--over half went to just two programs; $467 million went to the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act and community programs. 
Now, the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act is the act we passed here, got funded. Then 1 day I guess the Speaker woke up and said, `We think that's a bad idea,' and they cut it. The public went bananas, and they put it back in; it is OK. Of the $1.1 billion for at-risk youth, $467 million goes to the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act, and my Republican colleagues boosted that appropriation last year to $556 million, a move I fully support and compliment the Republican leadership for doing, particularly since the House wanted to eliminate it. 
So now you are talking, of the $1.1 billion, $639 million of it, over half of it, is going for programs that, again, are not about after school. Then $172 million of the remaining roughly $400 million went to the Upward Bound Program--important. It provides mentoring, tutoring, and life skill training. If my friend does not understand what work awareness is, work awareness is a lot of these kids grow up in a family with no sense, no notion, no responsibility, no image, no example of what work means. 
Unless something has happened, birds learn to fly by watching their parents, ducks learn to paddle in my pond watching their parents, snakes learn to slither, turtles learn to swim. Where the heck do you think we learn? Where do you think our kids learn? It is a good program, but it is directed at disadvantaged high school students, this $172 million in the Upward Bound Program, to encourage children--targeted at economically disadvantaged children--to continue their education. That is very important. It indirectly has an impact on crime. But, again, it certainly is not a targeted crime prevention program. 
Then, of course, the GAO attributes about $146 million to 11 programs in the juvenile justice office, only a few of which are proposed to be consolidated in the Republican crime bill. 
That is roughly $400 million for about 27 crime and drug prevention programs, some of which are tiny demonstration or pilot projects that cover no more than a handful of sites across the country and are designed to study what works and what does not. For example, in the list of that $400 million, $200,000 is for a demonstration grant program for residential drug treatment for women with young children--important, but, again, not what we are talking about. 
So the impression given here that there are more than 130 Federal prevention programs designed to target at-risk youth is simply not an accurate reflection. In all of the cities and towns across America, and serving every child we can help, there are fewer than 40 programs for about $400 million. And what my friend from Alabama is saying, relying on the GAO report, is: You know, that is about as much as we can do. Government is already doing all it can and should do to stop kids from turning to gangs, crime, and drugs. But we have just seen many of the programs that are listed as targeted that, in fact, do not do that at all.

Mr. BIDEN. The answer is, I absolutely do. I thank my friend for calling that to my attention. 
Let me not just mention the sheriffs. I am going to quote, now, from a few of the leading police officers of America. 
By the way, let's put this in context again. When the overall crime bill was drafted by me years ago, the way it got drafted was, I did not sit down with any sociologists or academics or welfare workers or, you know, liberal think tanks. I literally called in the presidents of the seven leading police organizations in America, from NAPO to NOBLE, FOP, et cetera. They sat around my conference table for the better part of 4 months. 
I said: You tell me what you need. What do you think you need to fight crime? 
In the overall crime bill, they said they needed about a third of it going to prevention. 
When I sat down to draft the juvenile justice bill for our side of the aisle, with my colleagues, as a follow-on, I called the same people back in. Some of the presidents were changed. They were not all the same officers, the same people. To a person, they reinforced what the Senator from Vermont just said. 
Let me give an example. Mr. President, 170 police chiefs, sheriffs, prosecutors, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police, the International Union of Police Associations, and the leaders of the Crime Victims Organization, came out with a call for action. They title it `A Call For Action From America's Front Line Against Crime,' made up of those organizations I just named. On February 5, 1998, here is what they said: 
As police, prosecutors, crime survivors, we struggle every day against crime and its devastating impact. We are determined to see that dangerous criminals are arrested and put behind bars. But anyone who thinks that jailing the criminal is enough to undo the agony that crime leaves in its wake hasn't seen crime up close. That is why no one knows better than we that the most important weapons against crime are investments that keep kids from becoming criminals, investments which enable all children to get the right start they need to become contributing citizens, and would show them that as adults they would be able to meet their families' basic needs through hard work.

<TEXT>
Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator for his question. He is absolutely accurate. I am not suggesting in any way that any of the 131 programs listed by GAO would fall to his amendment in any way. 
What I am suggesting is, the very compelling argument he makes, when examined, is not as compelling as it appears. And that is, I believe he offered those charts as evidence that we were already doing a great deal on the prevention side. 
He is not against prevention. I am not suggesting that either. But he is basically suggesting, as many others have, that we are already doing this massive effort, totaling about $4 billion and 131 programs, to deal with prevention. He believes that what my friends from South Carolina and New Hampshire did by adding $50 million for more prevention is misplaced and it should be placed on the enforcement side of the equation. 
The reason I went through in great detail why it is really only about 40 programs and really only about $400 million is to make the point that we are not doing nearly enough on prevention, and to take this paltry sum of $50 million out of prevention, as proposed by my friends on the Appropriations Committee, and put it into enforcement would be a misallocation of a limited number of resources. That is the overall point. 
Secondly, I should point out, which I didn't, to put together this little syllogism, that my friend from South Carolina and the chairman of the committee, in fact, allocate $3.5 billion to enforcement just in the Justice Department. Our friends who are the managers of this bill are not--if one listened only to this debate, one would think this debate were about $400 million in youth prevention Federal Government-wide, all the programs I just said. It is not. 
My friends are putting $50 million into prevention and $3.5 billion in this bill, in their appropriations bill, into enforcement. It breaks down: On Byrne grants, 1/2 billion dollars; local law enforcement grants, $460 million; prison grants, $711 million; reimbursement of prison costs for aliens, $350 million; juvenile block grants--that is all enforcement money--$100 million; and $1.4 billion for cops who don't make a distinction between enforcing the law against juveniles and adults. 
Again, what the Senator from Alabama and I are really debating about, when you put it all aside, is not whether we should spend money on prevention and not whether we should spend money on enforcement, but the allocation: Are the limited dollars we have being appropriately allocated? 
My argument is, my friends from the Appropriations Committee have appropriately allocated the limited number of dollars and that the amendment my friend from Alabama is proposing would misallocate that money by taking $50 million out of prevention and putting it into enforcement, which already has, as it should, the lion's share of the money. 
Let me get back to this prevention issue. The vast majority of the police in America not only do not disagree with the notion that we should be spending money on prevention, not only do not want us to cut existing prevention programs, but want us to spend more money on prevention. They are not in here asking that prevention money be taken and spent on enforcement. 
Let me give you one anecdotal piece of evidence before I go to the major organizations. In Seaford, DE, a relatively small community, I asked a question that was--and in Dover, DE, 20,000 people, my State capital, I went to the police officers. I am going to be very blunt about this. I have a great relationship with the law enforcement community. They have always supported me. They have supported me overwhelmingly as long as I have been in the Senate. I pay attention to their concerns. I suppose that is why they support me so strongly. 
I went down and met with a very conservative former chief of police in Delaware. He raises steers on the side, and he is a cowboy. I think he thinks my view on a lot of things may be too liberal. We had a debate on how we should treat gays in America, and I think we should treat them no differently than others. I am not so sure he and others would think my view is so good and makes sense, et cetera. This is not a guy who is a liberal law enforcement officer. 
I said to him, `If I can do anything for you--get you more cops, get you more equipment--what would you have me do?' Do you know what he said to me? No malarkey. He said to me, `Build me another Boys & Girls Club.' This is a hardnosed cop in the southern part of my State. My friend from South Carolina knows the southern part of my State well, and I think he would tell you, it is not a lot different from Virginia or North Carolina or South Carolina. They view themselves as southern, they view themselves as conservative, and they are. 
Do you know what he asked me for? He asked me for no more cops, no more money for squad cars, equipment, radios. He said, `Build me a Boys & Girls Club.' That is what he said, I say to my friend from South Carolina. 
Seaford, DE, had a serious problem with drugs. I said, `What do you want me to do? What do you need?' They said, `We need a Boys & Girls Club. Build us one.' 
Well, we did. I didn't. We didn't. The local community, with some Federal help, did. 
Let me give you a few statistics. This is a letter from the executive director of the Boys & Girls Club in Delaware. He said:  
I would like to share with you some recent statistics -- 
This dated April 30, 1998. It is not about this debate. 
I would like to share with you some recent statistics compiled by the Seaford Police Department on juvenile complaints from the period February through March of the last three years. 
The statistics revealed: 
In 1996, seventy-eight (78) juvenile complaints were logged. 
In 1997, eighty-eight (88). . .. 
In 1998, only thirty-five (35) juvenile complaints were logged. 
The statistics show a 151 percent drop in complaints in 1998 as compared to . . . 1997. 
It is no coincidence that the drop in complaints directly corresponds to the opening of the western Sussex Club for Boys and Girls on February 1, 1998. 
I say to my colleagues, this `ain't' rocket science. This is not rocket science. There was a study done in the mid-eighties involving three cities, I believe it was New York, Pittsburgh, and Denver. Which took some Boys & Girls Clubs. First of all, there were housing projects in the same demographic areas, same number of people. They put a Boys & Girls Club in the basement of these mostly high-rise public housing projects. 
Guess what? Over a period of 2 years, all the indices of crime--rearrests, initial arrest rate, drug use, et cetera--dropped about 30 percent.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, prevention works. Giving kids an option works. It works in my State of Delaware, and it works nationwide. The people who recognize it most are the law enforcement community. 
Let me give you a quote from William Bratton, former New York and now Boston Police Commissioner. Boston has had a phenomenal--phenomenal--success in controlling murder rates, handguns with youth, and violent crime. Here is what he said: 
Those of us who have been on the front lines know that, in the long run, winning the war on crime also will require cutting the enemy's key supply line: its ability to turn kids into criminals. Each day gangs and drug dealers assiduously recruit our children for their army. To fight back, we have to utilize other powerful crimefighting weapons--the proven `right-start' programs and strategies that give kids the armor of values, skills, and positive experiences to ward off crime and violence. 
This is one of the toughest cops in the Nation. He is saying the way we keep this from happening is to go out there and engage in prevention activities. 
The Buffalo Police Commissioner--I will not go through it --eight juvenile justice directors, the National Association of Counties, say: 
Be it resolved that not less than 25 percent of block grant funds be set aside for prevention programs. 
Prevention programs. 
Police Executive Research Forum; the Catholic Charities of the United States of America; Mark Klaas of the Klaas Foundation for Kids; Patrick Murphy, former police commissioner of New York, Detroit, Washington DC, and Syracuse; the national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, who is a tough crime-fighting guy --he says: 
It's time to invest in the programs proven to cut the enemy's most important supply line--its ability to turn kids into criminals. 
Prevention.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I realize I have kept us here a long time, but I can think of nothing from my perspective that is more important. 
By the way, parenthetically, with this surplus we are all arguing about--whether or not we save Social Security, give tax cuts, spend it on things--I still think we should take a significant portion of that surplus over the years that is projected and invest it in the crime trust fund, moving from 100,000 cops to 125,000 cops, writing a juvenile justice bill, doing the violence against women II legislation, and making sure--making sure--that we give local communities more flexibility in maintaining their Federal ability to keep the national 125,000--I hope it will be--cops program alive. That is what we should be spending our money on, in my view. I will get to that at another time. 
Let me conclude with the last important overall point. Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been saying, as I said, that we do not really need to do more. In a report that I offered in December of 1995, I detailed the demographic time bomb which lies ahead. And that demographic time bomb is this: 39 million children now younger than the age of 10, all of these 39 million children are the children of the baby boomers. 
Each of them stands on the edge of their teen years, exactly those years that are most at risk of turning children to drugs and crime. There are 39 million children about to enter the crime-committing, drug-consuming years. And the implication of this baby `boomerang' as the demographers call it, even if we do everything right, and at the rate which kids commit crimes--assuming we do everything right and the rate at which kids now commit crimes does not go up one one-hundredth of 1 percent--even if those things occurred, that there is absolutely no change in the rate of crime, we will have a 20-percent increase in juvenile murders by the year 2005, which will mean an increase of the overall murder toll by 5 percent, even if we do every single thing right and there is not one one-hundredth of 1 percent increase in the rate in which juveniles commit crime. 
Why? Thirty-nine million children, the largest cadre of youth since my parents were busy in World War II, about to enter their crime-committing years. 
I see my friend standing. I have another 10 minutes or so. I will yield to him, but not yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. BIDEN. I will be happy to yield the floor in a moment. 
Clearly, most of the 39 million children in this baby boomerang will never turn to crime and never turn to drugs. But equally clear, we will have a rising number of at-risk children, at-risk children who are at risk to turning to drugs, at risk of being the victims of violence, and at risk of turning to crime. 
Let me offer two more figures to indicate the size of the problem we face in the next 10 years. Seventy-seven percent of women with high-school-age children are working moms--77 percent. And all told, about 14 million school-age children have working moms. In all likelihood, this means that these 14 million children will be leaving school after school, unless they come from affluent families, with no supervision after school until mom gets home. 
That is not a criticism of moms working, it is a criticism of our failure to recognize the demographic change as well as the social change that has taken place in America. 
For the rising number of at-risk children, I believe we have to discuss what has become a dirty word among Washington politicians, even though it is a word I hear over and over again from prosecutors and police chiefs and people in the juvenile justice system and what their solution to the violent problem is. It is prevention--prevention. 
We must keep as many of these at-risk children as possible away from drugs and crime in the first place. In the most practical terms, that means keeping kids busy and supervised from 3 o'clock in the afternoon until the dinner hour. Those 3 hours represent about 12 percent of the day, about 20 percent of the hours that our kids are awake; and 40 percent of all juvenile crime that is committed in America is in those 3 hours. 
That is why I strongly oppose--strongly oppose--the effort by my friend from Alabama to undo the good work that our friends on the Appropriations Committee have done. And I just want to warn my colleagues, as I was kidding one of the staff here, I do not speak often on the floor, but when I do, I guess I speak long. 
But the truth of the matter is, there is nothing--nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing--more important to the economy, to the security, to the safety of this country than what we are going to do to prevent those at-risk youth who find themselves among those 39 million young people under the age of 10; that nothing--nothing--will affect our standard of living, our quality of life, more than how we deal with that issue. 
I will be back on this floor at a later date and, over the next couple years, arguing that portions of that surplus that we are predicting will occur as a consequence of the policies of this administration and Congress--balancing our budget and moving to surplus--should be spent--should be spent--on crime prevention, crime enforcement, and on the prison system. 
I thank my friend from Vermont for being so patient. And I thank my colleagues. I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I think local authorities should make that judgment. They should decide. I don't think you should discriminate, whether it is at risk or not at risk. It should be after-school programs in which everyone is entitled to participate. Let the States make those decisions, not us; but let's spend the money. 
My point is, spend money on after-school programs. All of the other programs the Senator listed do impact indirectly on youth violence. The problem is, 14 million kids with nothing to do for 3 hours, where 40 percent of the crime is committed. None of those programs are directed at that. We don't deal with that. We don't deal with the problem, in my opinion.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I want to associate myself, as we say, with the remarks of the Senator from Hawaii. I am probably only the second person who is going to rise today who opposes gambling. My State has decided to go that route. I have taken an unpopular position in my State. Fortunately, I am not Governor, I am a Senator, and everybody knows we don't pay attention to Senators back in the State--at least in my case. 
I do support the Craig amendment on the grounds stated by the Senator from Hawaii. It seems to me that what the Craig amendment does is exactly what the Senator from Hawaii has stated, which is that it makes it clear that the intention stated by my friend from Arizona is in fact met, that it does not in fact directly, or indirectly, by inference or otherwise, 
amend IGRA. 
It seems to me that, on a larger principle, we are always all too ready, in the 25 years I have been here, to say we believe in the sovereignty of the Indian nations. And we are very ready, whenever they do anything we don't like, to conclude that we in fact do not recognize and should not recognize their sovereignty. Further, we add insult to injury and the only time we treat them as sovereign nations is when we are handing out money, when we have programs. One of the exceptions in the crime bill is that Indian nations can apply for police officers directly, just like the State of Delaware, or the town of Wilmington, or the county of Columbus could do so. 
So I find it somewhat interesting when, in fact, we find it in our interest--meaning we are not going to spend money--to recognize the sovereignty of Indian nations--we are ready to do that. But when Indian nations want to do something that somehow is viewed as impinging upon another interest in a State in which the Indian nation happens to be located, we are all ready to say, no, no, no, let's hold up. 
I will not take any more time, in light of the hour. We are about to vote. I agree fully with the Senator from Hawaii. I share his view about gambling generally, and I share his view about the Craig amendment specifically. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Isn't it true that there are a number of background checks. Years ago I drafted a law which became law that requires certain background checks, for example, for people who wish to work in day-care centers with young children, to try to figure out and ferret out child predators. 
Now, the way it works now is if, in fact, you are going to be hired at a boys' club, a girls' club or a day care center, and they--the day care center--say they want a background check, and you have to go through the FBI, the FBI now charges the person seeking employment the cost to run the background check. 
I don't understand why, if we are going to say on a background check for an employee--where the employee is seeking a job but is required by that agency to have a background check to prove, in effect, they are not a child predator or do not have any sex crime history--why it is appropriate to charge the prospective employee and it is not appropriate to charge a person purchasing a gun. There is nothing exceptional about this. 
My question to my friend is, Isn't this all about reneging on a commitment everyone said they are for, which was to have an instant background check, so there is no 7-day, 5-day or 1-day waiting period, so every single gun seller in America, when they go to sell you a gun, can push a button, tap into a computer, and have the computer say you can or cannot sell it? It seems to me this is about doing away with the instant check.

Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I rise today as a co-sponsor in support of S. Con. Res. 105, which expresses the sense of the Congress regarding the culpability of Slobodan Milosevic for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in the former Yugoslavia. 
Yugoslav President Milosevic is the walking definition of an unscrupulous politician. I have come to understand the stark truth that the only thing that matters to Milosevic is his own political survival. The only thing. 
Since his rise to power in Serbia in the late 1980's, he has been a failure at everything he has attempted--except, I regret to say, in staying in power. 
Slobodan Milosevic has been an unmitigated disaster for the Serbian people. 
As a result of his insane attempt at creating a `Greater Serbia,' the centuries-old Serbian culture in the Krajina and Western Slavonia in Croatia has been extinguished, the Bosnian Serb community has been decimated and impoverished, and Serbian life in Kosovo seems on the verge of eradication. 
Of course, that is only half of the story, for Slobodan Milosevic has also been a curse for many of the neighboring peoples of the Serbs. His vile `ethnic cleansing' led to a quarter-million deaths and more than two million refugees and displaced persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnian Muslims, Bosnian Croats, and Croats in Croatia were brutalized and murdered. 
Most recently, Milosevic's special police storm troopers have moved their grisly activities to Kosovo where they are visiting upon the ethnic Albanian population the same horrors suffered by the Bosnians and Croats. 
I would like to add a personal note. I believe that I am one of only a very few Senators who have met Milosevic, and I am certain that I am the only one who ever called him a war criminal to his face. 
In April 1993, on the first of my many trips to Bosnia, I also stopped off in Belgrade to see Milosevic. In the course of a lengthy meeting that went on late into the evening, I went through the entire litany of the horrors that his Serbian troops had perpetrated and were continuing to perpetrate. Of course, Milosevic protested that he had no control over any of this. 
Nonetheless, he later asked if I wanted to meet Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader who has subsequently been indicted as a war criminal. I said yes, and twenty minutes later Karadzic came running up the steps of Milosevic's palace, totally out of breath. Rather interesting for a guy who supposedly had no influence in Bosnia! 
After all this, Milosevic looked across the table and asked, `What do you think of me?' 
I answered, `I think you're a damn war criminal!' 
Milosevic's reaction was like water off a duck's back. He just resumed talking as if nothing had happened. He might as well have said, `lots of luck in your sophomore year!' This is one brazen guy. 
Mr. President, I said earlier that the only thing Milosevic cares about is his political survival. I believe that for the first time there is a reasonable chance that he may be failing in this arena too. 
In the person of Milo Djukanovic, the dynamic, young reformist President of Montenegro, the junior partner of Serbia in the Yugoslav Federation, the democratic opposition to Milosevic has both a new leader and a constitutional means of expressing its opposition. We must continue to support Djukanovic and Montenegro in their struggle. 
In the meantime, as S. Con. Res. 105 urges, the international community should speedily bring Milosevic to trial before the International Tribunal in the Hague for his criminal behavior. 
There is no possibility for lasting peace in the Balkans until Serbia has a democratic government, willing to live in peace and equality with its non-Serb citizens and non-Serb neighbors. Removing Milosevic from power is the sine qua non for this to happen, and S. Con. Res. 105 charts the path. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendments at the desk, the resolution, and the preamble be agreed to, that the resolution, as amended, be agreed to, that the preamble be agreed to, as amended, and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the resolution appear at this point in the Record.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will vote against tabling the Lugar amendment. It is a useful starting point in bringing some rationalization to our sanctions policy. 
I have been in the Senate for over 25 years. Over that time, I have supported many sanctions laws, and even authored a few. But I am now re-examining my approach to sanctions policy. I do so not because I oppose sanctions--sanctions are an important part of our foreign policy arsenal. 
But I believe we need to rethink our overall approach. Statutory sanctions, once imposed, are difficult to repeal, and they therefore do not provide the President the flexibility that I believe he needs to conduct foreign policy. As we all know, it is easier to block legislation than to pass it; accordingly, lifting a sanction to meet changed circumstances is difficult, and sometimes impossible. I believe, therefore, that we have to start building into our sanctions policy the necessary flexibility for the President to waive, modify, or terminate sanctions with the ability of the Congress to respond to his actions. 
The Lugar bill is not perfect. It has a few provisions that I believe should be changed or modified. For example, I do not believe it is wise to provide, as the amendment does in Section 806(c), for a point of order against legislation in cases where the Senate has not received required reports from the Executive Branch. This provision would conceivably permit the President to prevent consideration of a bill simply by withholding the required report. In addition, I believe the bill should clearly exclude from the definition of `sanction' those measures taken to enforce criminal laws and those measures taken pursuant to the authority of the Federal Aviation Administration to ban foreign airlines from flying to the United States which do not satisfy our safety standards. Finally, I believe the contract sanctity provision is too broad, for two reasons. First, there may be cases where a multi-year option contract would render the sanction--at least as to that contract--a nullity. Second, there may be cases--a proliferation sanction comes to mind--where it may be in our national security interest to stop the flow of technology immediately. 
Despite these concerns about the Lugar amendment, I will vote against the tabling motion. The bill is a good framework upon which we can begin to construct a more rational sanctions policy, and I believe the Senate should continue to consider it further on this bill. I did not offer amendments to perfect the amendment because it was obvious that it was not going to be adopted and if it was it could be perfected in conference. We will surely revisit this issue at which time I'll have more to say.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I join with my friend, the distinguished senior Senator from Indiana, to urge my colleagues to support the Tropical Forest Protection Act of 1998. 
Mr. President, this bill marks a real victory for sensible, bipartisan action on an issue of global importance. Just looking at the list of our cosponsors--thirty-one of our colleagues, evenly divided between our two parties--shows me that good policy is good politics. 
Right now, as we speak today, fires are burning in tropical forests around the world, the result of a combustible mix of unusually dry weather with unsustainable human activity. Slash-and-burn agriculture, logging, and the road cuts to support those activities, have exposed one of our planet's most important resources to a deadly threat. 
Rainforests have a profound effect on our planet's weather, through their ability to absorb the most important greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. They influence rainfall, and are therefore the sources of many of our most important rivers, that in turn support the farms and fisheries that feed us. 
They are home to rich biological diversity--both flora and fauna--that we are just now realizing hold the secret to disease-resistant crops and new medicines. 
But as the nations that contain our most significant rainforests enter the world economy, they are under increasing pressure to turn these irreplaceable assets into cash, for both their own short-term domestic needs and to service debts owed to the industrial nations, including the United States. 
That's why this bill is so important. It allows the reduction of the debt those nations owe us, if they use the savings to protect those rainforests. This will help to break the tie between debt and the destruction of rainforests, to the benefit of everyone. It won't put out those fires, but it will remove some of the financial arrangements that fuel them. 
I am particularly pleased to join again with my friend, Senator Lugar, to expand on earlier Lugar-Biden legislation that has been on the books since 1989, and that is part of the 1990 Enterprise for the Americas Initiative. 
And I am honored to be joined in this effort by the distinguished Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the distinguished Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and so many other of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. BIDEN. I yield myself 2 minutes. 
Mr. President, I have not spoken. I am not going to take much time because Senators whose States which have very, very important interests in passage of this bill should be given time. 
I would like to begin by thanking Senator Murray. She has been the spearhead of this effort. I, quite frankly, wish we had done something broader. The Senator from Kentucky and I thought we had worked out something more along the lines that my friend from Nebraska was just talking about, a broader approach to dealing with not just merely agriculture, which is obviously very important, but I just say to my colleagues, hopefully the Senator from Kentucky and I will be back on the floor in the not-too-distant future with a proposal for a more rational policy relating to sanctions generally, not just as they relate to Pakistan and not just as they relate to agriculture. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from Kentucky in presenting this legislation. 
As our colleagues know, just before the Fourth of July recess, the majority and minority leaders formed a bipartisan Task Force on Sanctions Policy. The Senator from Kentucky was named the chairman, the Senator from Delaware the co-chairman. 
The task force was given two tasks; first, to make recommendations to the Senate leadership, by July 15, related to the existing sanctions against India and Pakistan. And second, to make recommendations, by September 1, on sanctions policy generally. 
These are tight deadlines, but with the support of the leadership, the chairman and I are determined to try to meet them. 
The situation with regard to Pakistan and India is our first challenge. 
Two months ago, the security situation in South Asia changed, and changed utterly, to borrow a phrase from Yeats. The explosion of nuclear devices, first by India, then by Pakistan, brought two nations into the so-called club of countries which acknowledge that the possess nuclear weapons. 
The testing by both countries was promptly--and properly--condemned by the United States and the international community. But the United States went further than most countries, because under the Glenn amendment, enacted in 1994, the President was required to impose sanctions on both governments. 
The sanctions imposed by the Glenn amendment are as severe as they are sweeping. 
They require the termination of all assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act--with certain exceptions such as narcotics assistance and humanitarian aid--the termination of all military sales and financing, the termination of all licenses for the exports of items on the U.S. Munitions List, and the termination of all credits or credit guarantees provided by the U.S. government. 
Additionally, the law requires the United States to oppose the extension of loans by international financial institutions like the World Bank, and requires the U.S. government to prohibit private U.S. banks from making loans or credits for the purpose of purchasing food or other agricultural commodities. 
The Glenn amendment provides little flexibility. Once imposed, there is no authority for the President to waive the law. His hands are completely tied. 
I voted for the Glenn amendment in 1994, which was part of the State Department Authorization Act that year. But when viewed in the context of Pakistan's and India's decision to test, I have to conclude that while our approach worked for many years, it is no longer working. It didn't stop them from testing, and the lack of flexibility in the law provides little incentive for India and Pakistan to take positive steps now. 
All this is not to suggest that sanctions should never be applied. I have voted for many sanctions laws in the past, and even authored a few. In this instance, sanctions were clearly appropriate, both as a strong condemnation of the governments in Delhi and Islamabad and to deter other countries which might seek a nuclear weapon. 
What I am second-guessing is the decision of Congress not to provide more flexibility to the President. 
I am a strong defender of congressional power, and I believe Congress is well within its constitutional authority to impose sanctions for foreign policy reasons. But the President is charged with the conduct of diplomacy. And any statute which provides little or no discretion for the President necessarily interferes with his ability to perform that task. 
The task in this case is already difficult enough: the President faces the considerable challenge of convincing the two governments to constrain their nuclear weapons programs and avoid further escalation of tensions in the region. The inflexibility in the Glenn amendment deprives the President of tools that he might use to advance these objectives. 
In imposing sanctions, we must also pause before applying sanctions unilaterally. 
The weight of the historical evidence suggests that we are more likely to advance our objectives if we can gain the cooperation of our major allies. Moreover, unilateral sanctions may impose a greater cost on our economic interests than they do on the targeted country. 
In the case of India and Pakistan, we are therefore faced with two questions: should we reconsider some of the unilateral sanctions set forth in the Glenn amendment? 
And should we give the President some flexibility in order to advance his diplomatic objectives in the region? 
I answer both questions in the affirmative and, I believe, so does the chairman. 
However, the bill we are now considering is limited only to removing one unilateral sanction: 
The bill before us would provide a permanent exemption under the Glenn amendment for U.S. government credits to support the purchase of food or other agriculture commodities. 
This provision is identical to the provision sponsored by Senators Murray and Gorton which was added to the Agriculture appropriations bill during its consideration by the Committee on Appropriations. 
The exemption for Commodity Credit Corporation--or CCC credits--is consistent with the approach of the Glenn amendment, which permits loans by private banks for the purchase of food and other agricultural commodities. 
This matter is of some urgency, because there is an important sale offer to be made by Pakistan in the coming days. 
Wheat farmers in the Pacific Northwest provide a significant portion of Parkistan's wheat market, and they rightly fear that they could lose that market if the CCC credits are not available. 
I have long believed that we should not force U.S. farmers to bear the burden of foreign policy sanctions, so I am pleased to support this measure. 
But I remain hopeful that in the coming weeks, we can devise a means to provide the President flexibility with the remaining sanctions now in place against india and Pakistan. 
I do not mean to suggest that we should repeal these sanctions. 
At this stage, just a few weeks after the nuclear tests in the region, and with the President's diplomatic efforts still at an early stage, it is premature to contemplate a complete repeal or blanket waiver of the provisions in the Glenn amendment. 
But we should attempt, before we adjourn for the year, to give the President some latitude in order to assist his efforts to negotiate with the two countries. 
We should not underestimate the enormity of the task before the President. 
Helping to construct a new security framework in South Asia may take considerable time, given the complexity of the situation and the deep-seated antagonism between the countries of the region. I hope that our colleagues will give the administration the support that it needs in the months ahead. 
In closing, I would like to thank the chairman of the task force, Senator McConnell, for his gracious acceptance of the job and for helping point us in this direction. I would also like to thank the majority and minority leaders for their confidence in selecting us to lead the task force, and for their support for this initial legislation. 
I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. President, with the permission of my friend, may I yield now, even though it will be two Democrats in a row, to my friend from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, for 10 minutes.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, what we are doing here today at the urging of Senator Murray and Senator Roberts is necessary and important. But I want to make it clear we didn't start this off as an ag bill. This is about foreign policy. This is about sanctions. It does affect us. It is important. 
My only regret here today is we are only exempting agriculture. I hear my colleagues from the agricultural States stand up and talk about how farmers are put at risk. I point out, people who work in a factory at Boeing are put at risk. People who work in the Du Pont Company are put at risk. People who work in every other industry are put at the same risk farmers are put at when we impose these sanctions. So we should go further than we are going today. 
That is the task that has been assigned to the task force that is chaired by Senator McConnell and myself. I am hopeful and I am encouraged by the fact that we have been nonpartisan in our approach so far, to try to deal with this. There is going to be a tendency on the part of Democrats to say, `Gosh, if there is a Republican President next, maybe we should not do this.' There is a tendency on the part of Republicans to say, `We have a Democratic President for the next 2 years, maybe we should not do this.' I hope we continue to rise above that and do what needs to be done and have a rationalized sanctions policy that is fundamentally different than what we have here today. 
But that is easier said than done. That is our task. We will attempt to do it. I am just sorry we weren't able to go forward with what was, even the broader version of this, was a modest version of what we had to do. We weren't able to get that done today, but with the leadership of the Senator from Kentucky and the help of our colleagues who have engaged in this, maybe we can come up with something before this session is over that rationalizes our sanctions policy. 
I thank my friend from Kentucky.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, included in the manager's package of amendments to the higher education bill is a resolution I introduced last March on binge drinking on college campuses. 
This was the same resolution that was introduced in the other body by Representative Joe Kennedy--and virtually the same as what was adopted by the other body in its version of the Higher Education Act. 
I want to take a few minutes to talk about my resolution--and why this issue is so important. But, first, let me thank Senators Kennedy, Dodd, Jeffords, and Coats for accepting the resolution. 
Let me also thank Representative Joe Kennedy, who came up with the idea for this resolution and has long been trying to bring alcohol-related problems to the attention of Members of Congress. 
And, finally, let me thank the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which endorsed the resolution early on and has worked tirelessly to get it passed. 
Mr. President, I think every one of my colleagues has heard or read about college students across the country--from Louisiana to Massachusetts to Virginia--who fell drunk out of dorm room windows or consumed so much alcohol, so fast that it literally poisoned them. 
There were at least 18 such deaths this last academic year. 
And, Mr. President, I think every one of my colleagues saw the news reports from this past spring on the riots--yes, riots--on several college campuses across the country--from Washington to Michigan to Ohio. 
We saw police wearing riot gear; carrying shields; and firing tear gas into throngs of drunk college students. 
These riots were either alcohol-induced--parties that got out of control--or were based on a peculiar notion--that underage college students should have a right to get drunk. 
That's what binge drinking is. There is a technical definition for the academics who study this problem--and I'll talk about that in a minute. But, in layman's terms, binge drinking is simply the idea that you drink to get drunk, or, as a recent article in the Washington Post magazine put it, it is where `drinking isn't part of the party; it is the party.' 
And, binge drinking is, according to many university presidents, the biggest problem facing America's colleges today. 
Let me repeat that. The biggest issue facing America's colleges--according to many college president's themselves--is not raising money for the university. Not ensuring high academic standards. Not finding top quality faculty. No, it's binge drinking. 
There is a reason for that. And, it has to do with more than just the 18 college students who died this last year--tragic as that is. 
According to a study by Harvard University, 44 percent of college students are binge drinkers--that is, technically, for men, consuming five drinks in one sitting during a 2-week period, and for women, consuming four drinks in one sitting. 
Again, 44 percent of college students are binge drinkers. 
Nearly one in every five college students is a frequent binge drinker--that is, binge drinking three or more times in a 2-week period. 
And, almost half of all freshmen--18 year olds--binge in their first week at school. 
But, it even goes deeper than that--deeper than the 18 deaths; deeper than the 44 percent of students who are binge drinkers. 
The reason that binge drinking is the most important issue facing colleges today is because binge drinking affects everyone on campus--even those college students who do not during--and even the majority of college students who are not binge drinkers. They are all affected by those who are. 
Talk to a student who lives in a dorm room next to someone who drinks a lot, and I can guarantee you that he or she does not get many peaceful nights of sleep--and does not get many peaceful moments to study. 
The greater the number of binge drinkers at a school, the greater the chances are that a student will be hit, pushed, insulted, assaulted--and of being the recipient of an unwanted sexual advance. 
And, alcohol is involved in most campus rapes, violent crimes, student suicides, and fraternity hazing incidents. Many of the victims of these crimes are not the ones doing the drinking. 
You know, we have heard a lot in the last decade or more about the connection between alcohol and car accidents, where those who die or are injured are often innocent victims who were not drinking. 
And, there has been a great effort--led by Mothers Against Drunk Driving, a group for which I have the highest respect--to educate the public and prevent the tragedy. 
But, there is also a growing body of evidence showing a link between alcohol and other crimes and irresponsible behaviors. 
There is a link between alcohol and unsafe sex; between alcohol and suicide; between alcohol and rape; between alcohol and violence. 
And, nowhere is this link more prevalent than on college campuses. 
Unfortunately, there are many people out there--including many officials on college campuses--who look at binge drinking by college students as just part of the `campus experience'--as just some `rite of passage' to adulthood. 
Well, I make no apologies for saying that drinking yourself to death is no `rite.' It's just plan stupid. 
And, I make no apologies for saying that those who overlook the problem are contributing to it. 
It is time for the culture on college campuses to change--before someone else's son or daughter becomes another statistic. 
We need to bring the problem of binge drinking among college students to the attention of the American people--to educate them and to prevent the tragedies associated with it--just as we have done with drunk driving. 
So, Mr. President, my resolution would call on all college and university presidents to recognize and acknowledge the problem--and then to find solutions. 
Specifically, my resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that every college and university president should carry out six specific activities to reduce alcohol consumption on college campuses.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I must object. I object because what the majority leader proposes is to add a very significant piece of substantive drug legislation relating to the crack-powder cocaine sentencing issues. 
I note that the Judiciary Committee has not reported this legislation. This legislation is subject to significant debate. For example, the costs of the most recent proposal offered by Senators Abraham and Allard are very significant. 
According to the Justice Department--the 5-year cost estimate to our federal prison budget is more than $790 million. The 10-year estimate--more than $1.9 billion. 
This is just one example of the significant policy implications of this proposal. Frankly, the Judiciary Committee must be given the opportunity to report this legislation before we debate this on the floor. 
In contrast, we have fully debated the drug director legislation introduced last summer. The Judiciary Committee has debated it, the committee held hearings, the committee developed a bipartisan re-authorization bill, the committee reported the bill last November, since then we have worked with Senator McCain and the Armed Services Committee to work out their issues with this bill. 
The bottom lines--we have a bipartisan, fully debated, bill; and we need to get the drug director's office re-authorized. 
There are many particular, specific drug policy issues to debate. Crack-cocaine is just one of them. Youth drug abuse, youth violence, drug interdiction, and many more all need to be debated. 
But, let's keep our eye on the ball, and let's re-authorize General McCaffrey's office. The General needs our support.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about the admirable work of the Senate Armed Services Committee. For the past two years, we have had budget agreements that have forced the Committee to make tough choices with shrinking resources. Under the able leadership of Chairman Thurmond and the Ranking Member, Senator Levin, the Committee has once again enhanced the quality of life for our brave men and women in uniform and have invested in programs vital to our future fighting forces. As the Ranking Member on the Foreign Relations Committee, I am constantly reminded of how vital a strong military is to protecting American interests and security around the world. I have said it before and I'll say it again, for diplomacy to be effective, not only must it be adequately funded, it must also be backed by a strong military and superior intelligence activities. 
But, Mr. President, before I say any more about this bill, I want to say a word or two about Chairman Thurmond. His service to this nation has been truly remarkable. From the beaches of Normandy to the halls of the U.S. Senate, he has shown an outstanding dedication and commitment to doing the work of this nation. He and I worked together on the Judiciary Committee for 12 years--he was Chairman for the first 6 years and I was Chairman for the last 6. Then, as now, he has been a leader by example. He is one of the most remarkable individuals I have ever had the privilege of working with. We are not merely colleagues, we are friends. 
He has served on the Armed Services Committee for 40 years, the last 4 of which he has been its Chairman. This is his last year as Chairman, so I want to say now what deep respect I have for the Senior Senator from South Carolina's military expertise and for the able manner in which he has worked with Senator Levin to keep our military strong. The Committee, the Senate, and the American people have gained from Senator Thurmond's leadership and his willingness to work with Senators from both parties to put America's national security interests ahead of partisan interests. 
This bill is an example of that. It includes a 3.1 percent pay raise for military personnel. It also includes an important increase in hazardous duty incentive pay for mid- and senior level air crew personnel. I thank my colleagues for joining me in addressing that concern and showing these experienced personnel that we value their unique and vital contribution to America's national interest. 
In addition, there is an important $12 million increase in C-5 airlift squadrons research and development. This money is critically needed by the Air Force to examine the needs of these crucial aircraft as new technology becomes available to improve their performance. As many already know, the C-5 is capable of carrying more cargo than any other aircraft in our military. It has supported military operations from Vietnam to Desert Storm to the current operations in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf. I applaud the Committee's foresight in providing the money necessary to maintain these planes at peak performance levels. 
Mr. President, I also want to take a minute to talk about the health care demonstration programs in this bill. With the growth in the number of retired military personnel, the rising costs of health care in general, and the closing of military bases, great strains have been placed on military medical facilities. This, in turn, has placed in some jeopardy the idea of guaranteeing high quality health care to our military retirees. 
Last year, Congress recognized this growing problem, and we took a step in fixing it. Last year's Defense Authorization bill included a demonstration project on Medicare subvention--where Medicare reimburses military medical facilities for the treatment of retirees who are also eligible for Medicare. I am pleased that the Dover Air Force Base in Delaware has been selected as one of the six sites for this national demonstration project. 
Again, this was a first step. But, there are other ways that might help us to fulfil our commitment to military retirees. And, so I strongly support the three additional health care demonstration projects in this bill--one to allow military retirees to participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program once they reach age 65; one to allow retirees to continue their eligibility for TRICARE and not have to switch to Medicare when they turn 65; and one to allow military retirees who are also eligible for Medicare to continue to participate in the Department of Defense's mail order pharmacy program. 
Providing health care is an obligation we owe to our military retirees. It is a promise we made--but a promise that is now in jeopardy. The health care demonstration projects in this bill will not solve the problem we face. They are, after all, only demonstrations. But, hopefully, they--along with last year's Medicare subvention demonstration project--will help point the way to a solution so we can ensure that the federal government upholds its commitment to the men and women who so bravely served our country. 
Mr. President, this bill includes an amendment that I joined with four colleagues in voting against yesterday. It was a compromise Sense of Congress resolution offered by Senator Levin, Senator Coats, and Senator Thurmond, regarding budgeting for continued participation of United States forces in NATO operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
The three cosponsors deserve credit for their hard work in having crafted what was, in the main, a very well thought out amendment. It contained several positive elements. And their compromise amendment was far preferable, in my opinion, to another amendment on U.S. forces in Bosnia, which Senator Hutchison and Senator Byrd were considering introducing. 
Nonetheless, I voted against the compromise amendment, and I would like briefly to explain the reasoning behind my vote. 
First, I agree with the amendment's intent to keep the pressure on our European allies to constitute the bulk of ground forces in the Stabilization Force, known popularly as SFOR. I want to clarify, however, that non-American forces already make up approximately three-quarters of the SFOR total. 
Second, I am in complete agreement with the amendment's not giving a date-certain for the withdrawal of United States ground combat forces from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Such a date-certain would constitute the worst kind of micro-management of military affairs by the Congress, and would quite likely endanger the lives of American troops on the ground. 
My principal reason for voting against the compromise amendment is that I do not agree that our goal should be a withdrawal of all United States ground combat forces from Bosnia and Herzegovina as long as a NATO-led stabilization force remains in that country. 
To be perfectly candid, Mr. President, I believe that such a move would serve to undermine American leadership in NATO. Even Combined Joint Task Forces, commonly known by their CJTF acronym, should, unless there are exceptional circumstances, have a U.S. ground combat force component. While American air, naval, command and control, logistical, and intelligence support, and even a ready reserve over-the-horizon force in the region would be vital to any future mission, the participation of some American combat ground forces will remain a vital bona fide of U.S. commitment to Alliance operations. 
In other words, for the United States to retain control of NATO-led operations, we must be present in all components of missions, including on the ground. This would apply to any follow-on force in Bosnia, whether it is NATO-led or is a CJTF with the Western European Union. 
Let me pose a question to my colleagues. If the Bosnia ground operation becomes a purely European affair, do they not think that pretty soon some of our European allies will begin to question whether an American should continue to serve as Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR)? 
I for one think the answer is yes. The compromise amendment, against which I voted, may, I fear, begin to set in motion a process that will severely erode American leadership in NATO. 
Lest anyone thinks that my fears are far-fetched, I would remind my colleagues that France has already called for a European to take over command of Allied Forces Southern Europe (AFSOUTH) in Naples and that initially the French were supported by several other European allies. 
Keeping a contingent of U.S. ground combat troops in all NATO and NATO-led missions is a powerful symbol of American leadership and is recognized as such by allies and potential foes alike. We should think long and hard before advocating a change in that policy. 
Mr. President, I will conclude where I began. I compliment the managers of this bill and the Armed Services Committee for providing a bill that continues to strengthen our nation's national security. It enhances the quality of life of our loyal and dedicated men and women in uniform. It addresses important weapons systems needs and takes steps toward finding the best way to meet our health care obligations. While I disagree with the Bosnia provision added for the reasons I've already mentioned, I think this bill gives America the strong military it needs to support our diplomatic work and to promote our national security interests.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I support the amendment by the Senator from Arkansas regarding Radio Free Asia. The amendment is virtually identical to the text of H.R. 2232 as reported by the Committee on Foreign Relations on May 19. 
As the author of the legislation which created Radio Free Asia (RFA) in 1994, I strongly support its efforts to broadcast truth and information to the people living under dictatorial rule in China and elsewhere in Asia. 
RFA began broadcasts in 1996 on a shoestring budget of roughly $10 million a year. This bill authorizes, in Fiscal Years 1998 and 1999, a significant increase in funding for Radio Free Asia, and provides additional funds for the transmission capability needed to broadcast the programming. It is consistent with the funding levels in S. 903, the State Department authorization bill approved by the Senate over a year ago. 
Modeled on Radio Free Europe, this organization was conceived in order to broadcast news and information about internal events in China and the other non-democratic states of East Asia. Radio Free Asia thus acts as a `surrogate' service, acting as a local media--making available information to the Chinese people which is otherwise unavailable because of the tight control that the dictatorship in Beijing retains on the media in China. As the State Department's Annual Human Rights report noted, the Chinese government and the Communist Party `continue to control tightly print and broadcast media and use them to propagate the current ideological line.' 
Radio Free Asia is designed to overcome these restrictions on press freedom. The leaders of the new democracies in Eastern Europe have all testified to the importance of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty during the Cold War. No tribute has been more eloquent than that of Lech Walesa, former President of Poland, who said `How fortunate that the Iron Curtain could not be raised so high as to block radio transmission. The truth seeped in, unseen by border guards . . . . between the barbed wire. It provided impossible to stop, impossible to silence.' 
Radio Free Asia is not, as some cynics have asserted, a propaganda service. Although funding by the U.S. government, it is a private corporation. Its funding is provided by the Broadcasting Board of Governors, a government entity which has considerable autonomy in its role of supervising U.S. government-sponsored broadcasting. 
In short, Radio Free Asia is a legitimate news organization, staffed by legitimate journalists. Its President is Richard Richter, a former network news executive, who has insisted on the highest journalistic standards. The Vice-President for Programming, Daniel Southerland, is also an experience reporter who formerly served as the Beijing bureau chief for the Washington Post. In the short time that Radio Free Asia has been on the air, they have assembled a very talented and dedicated staff which is committed to honest journalism. 
The exiling of prominent dissidents by the Beijing government has been a boon to Radio Free Asia. Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan, both recently exiled by China, have signed on to provide regular commentary. Radio Free Asia thus provides a platform for voices of democracy--a platform that is, unfortunately, unavailable to these men inside China. 
China and the other nations to which RFA broadcasts have not been thrilled with the honor. Since last year, the Chinese have attempted to jam Radio Free Asia broadcasts. And this week, the Beijing government rescinded visas it had previously issued for three RFA reporters who had sought to accompany President Clinton on his trip to China. 
The decision by China to rescind the visas is deeply regrettable. Had it admitted the journalists, the Chinese government would have provided a manifest demonstration that it had turned a corner--that it is willing to open up its system to greater pluralism and scrutiny. China wants to be a great power. But Great Powers do not obstruct the flow of information into and out of the country. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that everyone has the right to `seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.' If China is to be a modern nation, it should adhere to this universal standard. 
There is, however, some good news lurking in the decision of the Chinese government to block the visas for RFA reporters: China must be worried about the effect of RFA's broadcasts. In other words, the broadcasts are getting through--despite the efforts to jam it--and people are listening. Information is subversive of tyranny, as are western investment and exchanges, and the Communist government in China apparently recognizes that Radio Free Asia threatened its attempts to control news and information. 
Mr. President, Radio Free Asia is an important instrument to advance U.S. policy of promoting democratic values in China and elsewhere in Asia. This amendment is a modest, but important, step to ensure that it has the tools to do the job.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of this bill, the senior Senators from South Carolina and Michigan, for their willingness to work with me on non-proliferation issues and to accept two amendments that I proposed in this regard. There is a critical need to guard against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or related technology from the former Soviet Union, and I am very pleased that my colleagues share that concern. 
There is no more critical national security issue than how well we handle the threat of holocaust posed by weapons of mass destruction. The potential for such horrific destruction may well have been increased by the end of the Cold War and the breakdown of superpower control over other countries. And a failure to contain the risk of such holocausts would dwarf any other foreign policy successes or failures. 
War between the United States and Russia is no longer a realistic threat, despite the size of our nuclear arsenals. The use of weapons of mass destruction by other countries, or even by terrorist groups, is a real threat, however, and there is a real risk that former Soviet materials or technology will be the engine of proliferation to other countries or groups. 
No great power is as active as the United States in trying to prevent proliferation. Nobody has as many programs as we do to detect proliferation activities, to stop them, to pressure illegal buyers and sellers, to develop military weapons and tactics for operations against sites with weapons of mass destruction, and to assist the former Soviet states, in particular, in safeguarding and destroying dangerous material and in reorienting their military industry to the civilian economy. 
But the fact is, Mr. President, that we are failing to do all that we can to stop proliferation. In particular, we are failing to reach most of the highly-trained scientists and technicians who developed weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles for the former Soviet Union. Well over a hundred thousand such skilled personnel served the Soviet death machine at its peak. Anywhere from ten to fifty thousand personnel still have skills that a rogue state or terrorist group would like to obtain, and are underpaid or unemployed today. 
How can we remedy these failings? One way is to support and fully fund our existing programs of non-proliferation assistance to the former Soviet Union. I am pleased to say that the managers of this bill agree with that judgment. Thus, they have accepted a Bingaman amendment that I co-sponsored, to restore the few cuts in these programs that had been adopted in committee mark-up. 
The managers of this bill have also accepted an amendment that I sponsored, to make available an additional $15 million for the Energy Department's Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention program and $30 million for the new `nuclear cities' initiative endorsed at the last meeting of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission three months ago. This amendment parallels one to the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act that Senator Domenici and I sponsored last week. I am confident that it will result in these two important programs being able to move forward effectively, rather than being a threat to each other's existence. 
As I noted on the floor last week, Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (or IPP) is a program that creates employment opportunities for former Soviet arms specialists by helping them develop their ideas for commercially viable goods and services. As an idea reaches fruition, IPP brings the arms specialists into joint ventures with outside investors, who gradually take over the funding. For example, thanks to IPP, a U.S. firm is working with Ukrainian scientists to develop and market a device for decontaminating liquids. This device will enable the Ukrainian dairy industry to produce fresh milk despite the lingering effects of the Chernobyl reactor meltdown. 
IPP had a slow start. It's hard to come up with really viable commercial ventures, to find investors, and to make sure they can invest safely. But IPP has begun to take off. As of this April 15, projects had achieved completely commercial funding and 77 had found major private co-funding. We all have chosen wisely today, to maintain IPP's funding stream and to encourage the many weapons specialists in the former Soviet Union who are searching for new careers in the civilian economy. 
The `nuclear cities' initiative is a more specialized effort to improve employment opportunities for Russian personnel from their nuclear weapons labs and manufacturing facilities. This initiative, too, will focus on finding commercially viable projects and bringing in outside investors. The challenge is to find projects that can work at these somewhat isolated cities, which are more or less the Russian equivalent of Los Alamos. 
When the United States funds the `nuclear cities' initiative, it gets two benefits. First, Russia's Minister of Atomic Energy has announced that he will downsize their nuclear weapons establishment. And second, by providing civilian job opportunities for some of the personnel who are let go, we will help protect against Russian weapons specialists accepting offers from states like Iran, Iraq, or Libya. 
One problem in any program that depends upon developing commercially viable products and services is that foreign investors are wary of putting their funds in ventures that may fail because of confiscatory taxes, local corruption or the difficulty of enforcing contracts. As a result, many otherwise marketable ideas may go without the funding they need to get off the ground and become engines of employment. 
The senior Senator from Indiana and I sent a letter to the Vice President recently to suggest that a high-level commission or advisory committee be formed, with senior U.S. industrialists among its members, to survey investment opportunities in the `nuclear cities' and similar areas. This commission would also work with Russian officials on improving the climate for international investment, so that an enlarging civilian economy in Russia can provide new careers for more former arms experts. Fifty years ago, a commission to set up the Marshall Plan--led by an industrialist, the CEO of Studebaker--was able to convince Western Europe to take bold steps in economic coordination. In a similar manner, perhaps practical help from U.S. industrialists today can galvanize Russian officials to take the steps that are needed for international investment to jump-start their economic engines. 
Even with such a commission, however, even if we maintain the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention program, and even if we add the `nuclear cities' initiative, there is no way that commercially viable ventures can employ all the tens of thousands of Russian personnel who have worked on weapons of mass destruction. At some point, Mr. President, we have to ask whether it is not in our national security interest to provide broader assistance. 
That is why I proposed the other amendment that the managers of this bill have accepted, to require the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress on this issue. Specifically, that report will tell us: (1) how many former Soviet personnel are at risk of being candidates for recruitment by rogue states; (2) how many can be employed in commercially viable enterprises; (3) how many additional personnel could be employed if we were to subsidize socially useful employment that could not attract outside investment; and (4) what the costs and benefits would be of a 10-year program of such subsidized employment. 
I am confident that the Department of Defense will find a significant gap between the number of Russian arms experts who are at risk and the number who can be reached by programs that focus upon commercially viable ventures. We have much less information, however, regarding either the potential or the costs of a program that would provide broader assistance. The Department of Defense report required by this amendment, which would be prepared in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Energy, will thus make a significant contribution to the ability of Congress to make sensible policy decisions in this field. 
The task of assisting the transition of the former Soviet Union from totalitarianism to democracy, from a command economy to a market economy, and from militarism to more peaceful pursuits is indeed daunting. We need many programs, for no single effort will achieve all of this. There will be disappointments along with successes. But the stakes are so high that we dare not flinch from the challenge to assist that transition. 
Likewise, we dare not cease our efforts to ensure that former Soviet arms experts refrain from selling their expertise to those who would misuse it. Today's actions are not the end of this demand upon our attention and our resources. But we can take heart from the fact that they are measured steps in the right direction. With luck, we will come up with the needed programs and resources in time to prevent weapons of mass destruction from becoming a larger factor in the next century than they have been in our own.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend from Connecticut, as well as Senators Hagel and Roberts, in introducing the `Sanctions Rationalization Act of 1998.' 
The bill establishes a means for the President to delay, suspend, or terminate certain unilateral economic sanctions, or a portion thereof, if doing so is important to U.S. national interests. The bill also provides a means for Congress to overturn any such decision, and provides for expedited procedures within the House and Senate for consideration of a resolution to reverse a Presidential decision. 
I have become increasingly concerned that Congress' efforts to impose sanctions is unduly hampering the President's ability to conduct U.S. foreign policy. To say this is not to suggest that Congress has exceeded its authority in the foreign affairs area. Under the Constitution, both Congress and the President have considerable foreign policy powers. As Professor Edward Corwin, a noted authority on the Presidency, once wrote, the Constitutional design on foreign policy tenders an `invitation to struggle.' 
Indeed, Congress has several powers under the Constitution in the foreign affairs area. 
It has, among other things, the power of the purse, the power to declare war, the power to raise and support the military, and the power to regulate foreign commerce. 
Congress is well within its power to impose sanctions against foreign governments. And in many instances, sanctions--or the embarrassment to the foreign government which flows from their imposition--have had a positive effect in advancing U.S. policy. 
But what Congress cannot do is to conduct the daily business of diplomacy. Only the President can undertake negotiations with foreign governments and leaders. And any law which limits the ability of the United States to engage with foreign nations necessarily limits the options available to the President as he seeks diplomatic solutions to foreign policy problems. 
Foreign policy, however, usually involves a complex mosaic of interests, and requires use of a wide range of diplomatic instruments. Moreover, foreign policy is not static--constantly changing circumstances often require calibrations in policy. 
The imposition of statutory sanctions, in many cases, serves to undermine the ability of the President to balance the competing interests and to respond to changes on the ground overseas. 
In sum, statutory sanctions are often a blunt instrument, when the situation at hand may call for an instrument which the President can fine-tune. 
The most significant part of this legislation, in my view, is that it gives the President the power to calibrate sanctions once imposed--that is, to adjust or modify the application of a sanction as the situation may warrant. Accordingly, he can use the authority in this bill to try to induce the desired action by the foreign government by lifting or modifying a sanction progressively. 
The bill does not allow the President to terminate those measures that are imposed on a multilateral basis, including obligations under resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, nonproliferation and export control arrangements like the Australia Group, the Nuclear Supplier's Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, and the Wassenaar Arrangement. 
The bill also does not allow the President to terminate those measures taken under treaty obligations, such as those under the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Biological Weapons Convention. 
Further, the bill does not apply to several types of measures, including foreign military financing, export controls and restrictions under the Arms Export Control Act, any measure taken pursuant to section 307 of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, any measure to restrict imports of products and services in order to protect domestic health or safety, any measure to enforce a federal criminal law, and any retaliatory trade measure authorized under our trade statutes or international trade agreements. 
In proposing this legislation, I do not envisage that the authority granted to the President would be employed casually. Instead, like analogous waiver authority in the Foreign Assistance Act--section 614 of that Act--I expect that this power would be used only when absolutely necessary, only after careful consideration in the Executive Branch, and only after careful consultation with the appropriate committees of Congress. 
And in cases where the President does abuse the authority this bill grants him, Congress would still have the power to reverse the President's decision, and resolutions to do so will be entitled to expedited procedures which would ensure their prompt consideration. 
I wish to emphasize that I do not regard this bill as a final product. Rather, it is a work in progress. This is a complicated subject; defining what constitutes a `sanction' is a difficult undertaking, as is drafting the necessary exclusions. 
Accordingly, I welcome contributions from our colleagues, the Executive Branch, and non-governmental organizations. 
Of course, this is not the only legislation on this subject. Our colleagues, Senator Lugar, and Representative Hamilton, have made an important contribution in promoting the debate on this subject in introducing their sanctions reform legislation. The Majority and Minority Leaders plan to appoint a special task force to review the issue, and I am certain that legislative proposals will emerge from those discussions. 
In closing, I should state that I am under no illusion that passing this legislation will be easy. It may be that we cannot reach a consensus on acceptable legislation in the remaining months of the 105th Congress. 
What is important now is that the Executive and the Congress have initiated a dialog, on a bipartisan basis, on a subject of considerable importance to our national interests. I look forward to engaging in that debate in the weeks and months ahead.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will, believe it or not, take only 1 minute. 
I compliment the Senator from Georgia. I am going to vote with him. I told him when he first introduced this legislation I would support it. In the meantime, it picked up some other amendments, Gorton and Ashcroft, and I announced at the time I voted against it with Ashcroft and Gorton as part of it, that if it came out of conference as it was originally constructed, I could support it. 
I thank him for his fairness, the way he has dealt with this, the openness in the way he has dealt with this, and I compliment him on bringing back to this body a piece of legislation that I and I believe probably another half dozen or more Democrats will be able to support. 
So I thank him very much for his courtesy.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an indispensable group of people in our military. Mid- and senior level enlisted air crew men and women are critical to America's military and need to be properly compensated for their valuable service. Last year's Defense Authorization bill included a provision to adjust hazardous duty incentive pay upward by $50 for E-1 to E-3 enlisted air crew personnel and upward by $25 for E-4 air crew personnel. All other enlisted personnel and officers eligible for hazardous duty incentive pay also received an upward adjustment. Unfortunately, E-5 to E-9 air crew personnel were not included in this adjustment. 
My amendment provides that $40 increase in hazardous duty incentive pay for the E-5 to E-9 air crew personnel and adds $15 to the increase given to E-4 air crew personnel as of this year. 
I thank the managers of this bill, Senator Thurmond and Senator Levin, for their support of this important amendment and for their unflagging efforts every year to help the dedicated men and women in our armed services. 
It is crucial that we show our appreciation for America's dedicated mid- and senior level enlisted personnel. They provide vital experience in all of the military's flying missions. They are also in demand in the private sector. Commercial airlines are willing to pay for well-trained and experienced flight crews. One look at the missions being flown by U.S. armed forces, from Bosnia to the Persian Gulf to the Korean Peninsula, shows how indispensable experienced air crews are to the defense of U.S. national interests. We cannot afford to keep losing these seasoned professionals. 
My amendment is one step toward addressing the problem now--letting these experienced aircrew personnel know that as our armed forces continue to work at a high operations tempo we value their unique and indispensable contribution to America's national interests. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senators from New Mexico and Nevada for including an idea that I proposed in the managers' amendment to the energy and water appropriations bill. I am confident that together we will lessen the risk that former Soviet scientists will help any rogue state to build nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. 
This amendment does two things. First, it earmarks an additional $15 million for the Department of Energy's Initiative for Proliferation Prevention, or IPP, program which was unfairly cut from the President's budget request. And second, it earmarks start-up funds for the `nuclear cities' initiative that was endorsed by both Vice President Al Gore and Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. 
Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention, or IPP, is a program that creates employment opportunities for former Soviet arms specialists by helping them develop their ideas for commercially viable goods and services. As an idea reaches fruition, IPP brings the arms specialists into joint ventures with outside investors, who gradually take over the funding. For example, thanks to IPP, a U.S. firm is working with Ukrainian scientists to develop and market a device for decontaminating liquids. This device will enable the Ukrainian dairy industry to produce fresh milk despite the lingering effects of the Chernobyl reactor meltdown. 
IPP had a slow start. It is hard to come up with really viable commercial ventures, to find investors, and to make sure they can invest safely. 
The executive branch thought that IPP had unspent funds from past years. So they cut its budget by 50 percent--down from $30 million to $15 million. 
But IPP has begun to take off. As of this April, 15 projects had achieved completely commercial funding and 77 had found major private cofunding. As a result, IPP does not have unobligated funds lying around. 
Now is not the time to cut the IPP program. Rather, we should encourage IPP and the many weapons specialists in the former Soviet Union who are searching for new careers in the civilian economy, by maintaining IPP's funding stream. 
The `nuclear cities' initiative is an effort to improve employment opportunities for Russian personnel from their nuclear weapons labs and manufacturing facilities. This initiative, too, will focus on finding commercially viable projects and bringing in outside investors. The challenge is to find projects that can work at these somewhat isolated cities, which are more or less the Russian equivalent of Los Alamos. 
When we fun the `nuclear cities' initiative, we get two benefits. First, Russia's Minister of Atomic Energy has announced that they will downsize their nuclear weapons establishment. And second, by providing civilian job opportunities for the personnel who are let go, we will help protect against Russian weapons specialists going off to work for programs in states like Iran, Iraq or Libya. 
The `nuclear cities' initiative was developed by a group of U.S. and Russian specialists, and was endorsed at the last meeting of the Gore-Chernomyrdin commission. Later this spring, Energy Secretary PenAE6a and Russian Atomic Energy Minister Adamov also endorsed it. 
According to the group that developed this new initiative, it can usefully spend up to $30 million in fiscal year 1999. I don't know how much the executive branch will want to devote to `nuclear cities,' but my amendment gives them the opportunity to fund a realistic program. 
 By earmarking funds both for the 'nuclear cities' initiative and for the IPP program, moreover, we make sure that the price of the new initiative will not be the death an existing program. If there is clear overlap between the IPP program and the `nuclear cities' initiative, such overlap should be eliminated. But I have the distinct impression that there are excellent IPP projects that will have nothing to do with Russia's `nuclear cities,' and such projects should not be sacrificed. 
Once again, I thank and congratulate the senior Senator from New Mexico and the senior Senator from Nevada. They have given us a fine example of bipartisan cooperation and effectiveness.

Mr. BIDEN. I thank my friend. Mr. President, recently in the newly passed highway bill, TEA-21, the Secretary of the Army was directed to transfer the right, title and interest of the St. Georges Bridge in Delaware, to the State of Delaware. The transfer is necessary to facilitate a retransfer of the bridge to a private entity for the purposes of demonstrating the effectiveness of large-scale composites technology. If the transfer is completed within 180 days the Secretary is directed to provide $10,000,000 to the State for rehabilitating the bridge. 
I rise to ask the Senator from Nevada, in his capacity as Ranking member of the Subcommittee, to seek his commitment in working with me and the Army Corps of Engineers to ensure that this transfer and the $10 million payment occurs as authorized.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, President Clinton, as he prepares to depart for China, carries with him an obligation, which I am sure he will fulfill, to do his best to advance U.S. core interests with Beijing and to communicate the values of the American people directly to the Chinese people. 
But what is also at stake, I think, is that there is a concomitant responsibility on the part of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Congress to adhere to a practice that has been in place for the 25 years that I have been in the U.S. Senate; that is, when a President is abroad, for the Congress to refrain, if only temporarily, from acting on matters that would affect the country which the President is visiting. 
There were a number of times when President Reagan was President, when President Nixon was President, when President Ford was President, and when President Bush was President that I had sharp disagreements with their foreign policy initiatives. But never once did I, nor can I remember any of us in either the Republican or the Democratic Party, vote on legislation that would directly affect and impact upon the relationship of the United States and the country which the President was visiting. 
So I ask my Republican friends, in the spirit of bipartisanship in the conduct of American foreign policy, to refrain from offering amendments to the DOD bill, if it comes up, that are designed to sanction and/or publicly criticize China at the very moment the President of the United States will be in China. I hope that we could return to that period in our relationship when both parties adhered to that practice. 
There is a list of at least 12--maybe as many as 20--China sanction amendments, some of which may very well be justified, that would be attached to, or attempted to be attached to, the defense bill, which I am told is likely to come up on Tuesday of next week. 
I make a personal plea to my colleagues to return to the practice that has been honored here on the floor of the U.S. Senate of not engaging in legislative action that impacts upon, or can impact upon, the relationship with the country where the President of the United States, be he a Republican or Democrat, is presently in place. I will be sending a letter to all of my colleagues asking that they do that. 
But to continue, Mr. President, the President's mission is not going to be an easy one any more than the first time President Nixon went to China, or President Bush, or any other President who has engaged China. 
It comes amid a sometimes rancorous debate over China policy in this country, and the debate is totally appropriate, I might add. I am not suggesting there should not be a very serious debate, and I have no doubt, because of the consequences of the actions we will take as a Nation, it will likely get rancorous at some point. 
I have myself asked this Congress to move into special secret session, a rare occurrence, not so many years ago to debate the extension of most-favored-nation status to China. I did so because of my concerns about Chinese proliferation activities, proliferation of missile and/or nuclear technology. And so I am not suggesting the debate will not be heated, and I am not suggesting it should not be thorough. I am not suggesting that it will not have political ramifications. That is all appropriate, normal and reasonable. But the President's mission is going to be made more difficult as a consequence of the debate that is underway. 
There is no clear consensus in America, nor, in my view, no clear consensus in the Senate, on how to best advance American interests in the Far East. The Governments of China and the United States will not always see eye to eye, and while the people of the United States and the people of China have much in common--a love of family, a thirst for knowledge, and perhaps most importantly, a desire to see our children and grandchildren live in a world more peaceful and prosperous than our own--we also have profound differences that cannot be overlooked. 
In his incisive history, entitled, `The Search for Modern China,' Yale historian and prominent Chinese scholar Jonathan Spence writes that China is not yet truly a modern nation.' 
Spence defines a modern country as `one that is both integrated and receptive, fairly sure of its own identity, yet able to join others on equal terms in a quest for new markets, new technologies and new ideas.' He concludes that the `search' for modern China is an ongoing act. 
I think Spence is right, and the United States cannot afford to be a spectator in this drama. We need to be active on the world's stage, engaging China as it undergoes a period of extraordinary change. 
What do we want? What is in our national interest? Good China policy begins with a clear articulation of U.S. interests, beamed directly to the highest levels of the Chinese Government. 
There is virtually no debate in this country over our long-term objectives. Our interests are plain. We seek a more prosperous, open and democratic China, at peace with its neighbors, and respectful of international norms in the area of nonproliferation, human rights and trade. 
There is considerable debate, however, about how best to achieve those objectives and whether they can all be achieved simultaneously or whether we will put one ahead of the other during this transition period. 
There are some who are convinced that the best way to persuade China's leaders to bring their domestic and foreign policies in line with U.S. expectations is to punish them for each and every misdeed--as perceived by us. This punitive approach, one which I think occasionally is appropriate, is well represented by a raft of Chinese bills passed by the House of Representatives last fall, many of which have been introduced as amendments that I have referenced earlier to the Defense Authorization Act. 
Let me say that I share many of the concerns of my colleagues about the administration's handling of China policy. As I said on the Senate floor at this time last year, engagement is not a policy. Engagement is a means to an end. It is the substance of the engagement that matters. 
But a `big stick' approach to China can hardly be called engagement any more than yielding to China on every issue can be called engagement. 
This confrontational approach, or the `big stick' approach, flows from the absurd notion that China is unchanging and it will 
only behave responsibly when it is forced to do so. 
I respectfully suggest and favor a more balanced approach. Obviously, I am being subjective in characterizing my approach as more balanced. And it is not really my approach; many share the same view I am about to articulate--a balanced approach that relies upon spelling out the rules of the road to China, inviting them to abide by them, and then monitoring their compliance with their pledges to us and the rest of the international community. 
China aspires to be a great power. I welcome that aspiration because great powers live up to the great power obligation in the areas of nonproliferation, human rights and trade. 
China has undergone an extraordinary change over the past 25 years, opening to the outside world and dramatically transforming its economic institutions and the tenor of its political discourse. China has evidenced increasing accommodation to international norms. 
They have done so, for the most part, because they recognize their own interests dictate greater integration with the global economic markets and security regimes. We should encourage this trend, but we should not hesitate to communicate our concerns both publicly and privately when we think they deviate. 
For instance, we should not hesitate to criticize China for its human rights violations. We should publicly encourage China to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and to incorporate its spirit directly into Chinese law. 
I was very disappointed when the President decided not to condemn China for human rights violations before the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva. If we are not going to criticize China's human rights violations in front of an international body specifically created to safeguard human rights standards, where are we willing to voice our concerns? 
I am also disappointed that China continues to jam Radio Free Asia. With the support of my colleagues in the Senate and the House, I introduced legislation several years ago which created Radio Free Asia. RFA broadcasts reliable news directly to the people of China and Tibet, empowering them to hold their government accountable for its actions. But RFA is being jammed by the Chinese Government. I hope that President Clinton, when he travels to China, will tune in RFA, and if he can't find it on the radio, he should explain to his Chinese hosts that great powers do not restrict access of their people to information. 
We can also do more to promote the rule of law in China, bringing the Chinese to this country to see how a truly independent judiciary functions and sending Americans to China to teach them how to create similar institutions there. The administration has requested $5 million for the Asia Foundation to launch a rule of law initiative in China. I support this initiative. 
When all else fails, the United States should not hesitate to punish China by using carefully targeted multilateral sanctions. But this should be a last resort, not a reflex. 
A wise man on the Foreign Relations Committee, the Senator from Indiana, has pointed out the dangers of an over reliance on ill-defined unilateral sanctions as an instrument of foreign policy. 
We have an important role to play in the search for modern China. We can help it to its destination of modernization, or we can throw obstacles in its path. The upcoming summit presents an opportunity for the United States and China to try to bridge some of our differences, a chance to transform the issues from points of contention to examples of cooperation. 
We should not expect the world from a single summit. But we can make some progress. 
Perhaps no issue at the summit will be more important than that of nonproliferation. I said at the outset that we know clearly what our objectives should be for our policy, where we want a modern China to go. We don't have any misunderstanding of what we would like to see: China at peace with its neighbors, respecting international norms in the areas of nonproliferation, open trade, and human rights. 
But at some point, as my dad would say, if everything is equally a high priority, then nothing is a priority. I believe that there is no more important issue at this moment in the history and our relationship with China than nonproliferation. The spread of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them represents a clear and present danger to the security of both the United States and China. We need Chinese cooperation if we are to find ways to promote stability in south Asia, the Korean peninsula, and the Middle East. 
China's historic track record in this area has been poor. Indeed, Pakistan probably would not possess the nuclear capacity it demonstrated late last month were it not for the Chinese assistance over the past decades. China cannot escape some responsibility for exacerbating south Asian tensions by engaging in policies that were seen as threatening to India's security. 
But more recently, China appears to have undergone a sea change in its attitude. China has joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Biological Weapons Convention. China has also agreed to be bound by some, but not all, of the terms of the Missile Technology Control Regime prior to it joining that regime. And, while China's export laws still fall short of international norms, particularly in the area of missile technology, China has been responsive to the administration's interests where we have clearly articulated them. 
Last fall, President Clinton secured a commitment from China not to extend any new cooperation to Iran's nuclear program. China has also pledged to halt all cruise missile exports to Iran in direct response to the urging of the U.S. Government. Moreover, China's initial response to nuclear tests on the subcontinent has been constructive thus far. China has avoided taking any steps which might exacerbate tensions or fuel a regional arms race. 
There is more, however, that China as a great power should do. As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China should join in an international diplomatic effort designed to identify the source of tensions in south Asia and foster dialog between India and Pakistan and between India and China. China should lead by example, by promoting greater transparency in arms exports, defense expenditures, and military exercises. 
China, in my view, should join the Missile Technology Control Regime and agree to bring its export controls on dual-use items and missile-related technologies up to international standards. In addition, it should join the Nuclear Suppliers Group and develop comprehensive controls on all nuclear-related technologies. Taken together, these steps would not only contribute significantly to peace and stability in south Asia, they would also serve the interests of global nonproliferation. 
The administration has accomplished much in the last 6 years: from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the Chemical Weapons Convention, et cetera. I asked, today, Assistant Secretary Roth, who testified before the Foreign Relations Committee, why that occurred. Was it merely the persuasiveness of the U.S. President? Was it because of the sticks as well as carrots that we have offered? Or, as this emerging modern power goes through a transformation, is it because they are finally determining on their own that it is in their own interest not to proliferate? 
I cannot fathom how, as a political leader sitting in Beijing, I could conclude that the ability of Pakistan to launch a nuclear 
weapon on the back of a missile that I had provided to them could possibly enhance my security. I cannot understand how anyone in Beijing could conclude that an arms race between India and Pakistan, and the prospect of what we would call theater nuclear weapons being engaged, could possibly do anything other than damage my security as a Chinese leader. I cannot imagine how they could reach that conclusion. But they have, in the past, reached similar conclusions. 
But I think what we are beginning to see, and it is presumptuous of me to say this about another country, but I think we are beginning to see the political maturation of a country. It is in its nascent stages, but they are coming to some of these conclusions, not merely because of what we do, not merely because of our urging, but because they begin to see it in their own naked self-interest. The only thing I have observed that causes China, in the recent past, to act against their own naked self-interest is if they are put in a position of being told they must do this or that. 
So, although sanctions are appropriate in some circumstances, and stating our view of what constitutes great power behavior is always appropriate, the idea that sanctions are always appropriate when we disagree with China is very mistaken and counterproductive. 
The stakes are high. Our success or failure in integrating China more fully into the community of nations, our success or failure at convincing China to live up to the international norms of behavior in the area of nonproliferation, our success or failure in helping to shape the emergence of modern China as a great power, will have profound effect, not only on the future of east Asia and south Asia, not only on the future of Europe, but on the entire world. 
Mr. President, about 25 years ago Fox Butterfield, the New York Times bureau chief in Beijing, published a book entitled `China: Alive in the Bitter Sea.' In it, Mr. Butterfield gave a moving account of the efforts of ordinary Chinese people to live under the often brutal authoritarian regime that existed at the time. 
Today there remains much injustice in China, and the struggle of ordinary people to exercise their universally acknowledged human rights is fought with peril. The outcome of that struggle will be central to the future of the `middle kingdom.' 
But the changes over the past 25 years have been so profound that those returning to China today for the first time since Deng Xiaoping opened the doors--and I went with Senators Javits and Church and others back in those early years of engagement--those who have gone back barely recognize China to be the same country. 
Engagement, engagement with a purpose, can bring about changes we seek in China, including in areas of vital importance to our national security, but only if we are both patient and principled. 
If we are swayed from our course by those who believe conflict with China is inevitable, or if we are lulled into a false sense of security by those who stand on this floor and confidently predict that China will automatically transform itself into a Jeffersonian democracy as it modernizes, then we will miss out on an opportunity to fulfill our role, as small as it may be, in the search for a modern China. 
Mr. President, to conclude, the stakes are high. This is no time for the U.S. Senate--in this significant summer, at this moment when, if China concludes it wishes to devalue its currency, the situation in Asia could become much, much worse, 
when at the very moment when China is acting responsibly vis-a-vis Korea, we cause it to change its course of action; if at this moment we insist upon all of our agenda being met, we can do irreparable harm to our interests. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President, with a final plea to my colleagues: Please, please, on this critical matter of the security interest of the United States of America, please revert to the tradition that has been time honored in this body. While a President of the United States is meeting with a head of state of another country, do not engage in activities, justified or not, that will sanction the country with which the President is at that moment negotiating. That is inappropriate behavior, in my opinion. That is not only partisanship, but it is against the naked self-interest of the United States, and I think it is reprehensible conduct. 
I am confident my colleagues will ultimately do the right thing. We have plenty of time to act on, and I may even vote for, some of the proposals relating to the sanctioning of China that are contemplated in the upcoming bill. But, please look at America's interest first, look at the longstanding tradition of bipartisanship on this issue, and allow the President to conduct this major foreign policy foray on his own terms until he returns. 
I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I rise at this moment to deplore the ongoing, brutal Serbian repression of the people of Kosovo and to lay out principles for American policy to deal with the crisis. 
Analysts have known for years that the Serbian province of Kosovo is a potential tinderbox for the entire southern Balkans. Approximately ninety percent of Kosovo's population is ethnic Albanian, known as Kosovars. Because of emigration to--not from--to other parts of Serbia and because of a low birth rate, ethnic Serbs now constitutute only about 7 percent of the province's population, down from a quarter of the population in the early 1970's. 
Kosovo is revered, as you know, Madam President, by Serbs as the cradle of their culture. Near the provincial capital Pristina lies Kosovo Plain, the site of the epic battle of June 28, 1389 in which medieval Serb knights and other Europeans were defeated by the Ottoman Turks, who remained in control of much of the Balkans into this century. Many of the holiest monasteries of the Serbian Orthodox Church lie within Kosovo's borders. 
The ethnic Albanians also have long historical ties to Kosovo, tracing, in fact, their origins to the Illyrians who inhabited the area in ancient times. Senator Byrd often talks of this heritage when he recites, as he does better than anyone, the history of Rome and its impact on the region. 
In 1974, Yugoslav President Tito made Kosovo, along with Vojvodina in the north, an autonomous region within Serbia. 
After Tito's death as the old Yugoslav Federation was beginning to disintegrate, an ambitious, demagogic Serbian politician named Slobodan Milosevic used Serbian nationalism and resentment of the Kosovo Albanians as a springboard to national power. 
In 1989, Milosevic abrogated Kosovo's constitutional autonomy, concurrently launching a purge of ethnic Albanians from the province's civil service and curtailing government funding for public institutions, including the schools. 
In response, the Kosovars, led by Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, a Sorbonne-educated intellectual, set up a shadow government and began a campaign of non-violent resistance to the Serbian oppression. The Kosovars set up and ran a system of public schools and maintained other public services. Rugova advocated attaining independence for Kosovo through Gandhian tactics. For most of this decade he was able to keep the lid on popular resentment and prevent violence. 
Rugova's position began to be undermined when the Kosovo Question was left off the agenda at the Dayton Peace talks in November 1995. Younger Kosovars increasingly began to ask why they should hold fast to nonviolence when the Bosnian Serbs were rewarded for their violence and brutality with their own quasi-state within Bosnia. 
In 1996 the beginnings of armed resistance to the Serbs appeared. A clandestine group calling itself the Kosova Liberation Army--KLA in English acronym or UCK in the Albanian acronym--carried out isolated attacks on Serbian police. 
By this past winter the frequency of KLA attacks increased, and Milosevic decided to respond. In late February his special police units, backed up by the Yugoslav Army, stormed into the Drenica area, killing and mutilating civilians who they said were harboring KLA militants. 
Some of you will remember, some of the people listening will remember, that's the circumstance in which the Yugoslav authorities would not allow the international community to examine the bodies. They rapidly buried them in mass graves and would not let outsiders come in and see what they had done. 
But, Madam President, it is essential not to fall into the trap that some have done by making false parallels to Milosevic's vicious military repression. 
These people, either for want of logic or perhaps as Serbian apologists, assert that Milosevic's storm troopers were only doing what any state would do against rebels. 
But, Madam President, if Milosevic had not robbed Kosovo of its legal autonomy, had not closed its schools and other institutions, and had not summarily brutalized and fired thousands of Kosovars, the armed resistance never would have materialized. 
Just yesterday in Moscow, Milosevic refused to deal with the KLA saying, `I see no reason to conduct negotiations with terrorists.' I will return to these prospects for negotiations in a minute, but let me just respond to Milosevic's comment by saying that acting just as he did in Croatia and Bosnia, as he is acting in Kosovo, I ask the rhetorical question: Who is the terrorist? Milosevic is a terrorist and a war criminal. He has demonstrated that over the past 5 to 6 years in Bosnia, and he is revealing it again in Kosovo. 
Since the February and early March massacres by his troops, Milosevic has diddled the Western world, utilizing his classic `bait-and-switch' tactics. 
First, he agreed to negotiate with Dr. Rugova and, thereby, earned from the United States an ill-advised postponement of a ban on foreign investments in Serbia. 
While talking, but not seriously negotiating with Rugova, Milosevic was busy setting in motion the next step in his state of terrorism. Late last month, his notorious special police sealed off western Kosovo and began a murderous campaign of ethnic cleansing, driving some 65,000 refugees into neighboring Albania and others into Montenegro. After killing hundreds and burning entire towns to the ground, Milosevic's forces have reportedly even resorted to strafing fleeing refugees from Yugoslav helicopters. 
One would hope that the West has learned something from its pathetic temporizing in Bosnia earlier in this decade. Perhaps we have, but maybe we have not. The so-called Contact Group, made up of the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Russia, has met regularly to try to hammer out a unified policy on Kosovo before it spins out of control. In spite of the fact that it operates by consensus, which means the `lowest common denominator,' the Contact Group has agreed upon economic sanctions which, given time, will worsen the already catastrophic conditions of the Serbian economy. 
But, Madam President, time is of the essence. Not only are thousands of innocent civilians--most of them Kosovars, but also some ethnic Serbs--being killed or driven from their homes, but the continuing fighting threatens the stability of neighboring Albania and also of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which itself has restive ethnic Albanians who constitute between one-quarter and one-third of its population. 
Maintaining the integrity of Macedonia--a fragile democracy with a Slavic leadership genuinely committed to interethnic reconciliation--must be the cornerstone of U.S. policy. Above all, however, is the stark obvious fact that everyone should have learned from Bosnia, and that is, Slobodan Milosevic will only react to superior force being employed against him. He will not react otherwise. 
Lest anyone forget, while economic sanctions against Yugoslavia may have modified Milosevic's position in Bosnia, it was only the use of American airpower for 3 weeks in the fall of 1995 that brought Milosevic and his Bosnian Serb puppets to the bargaining table in Dayton. So now, Madam President, we, once again, are faced with an unpalatable fact that force may have to be employed in order to prevent the need for even greater force later. But there is no decision more difficult than considering whether to send American troops into action. 
I have been a Senator for 25 years. I started here when the Vietnam war was still underway, and I am here today. I find the single most intimidating decision that need be made by any of us is when we vote, as we have in the past, to put American forces in harm's way, and Kosovo is no exception. 
Let me outline some of the basic principles that have to be part of that decision, outline whether or not that the decision, although difficult, will have to be made. 
First, I believe that, except for those who prefer to withdraw to a `Fortress America' posture, no one doubts the strategic importance of the south Balkans to the United States. 
Second, before we embark upon any military or political 
action, we must have our goals firmly established. 
Third, I also believe that most of my colleagues will agree that NATO remains the cornerstone of American policy in Europe and should be the vehicle by which we act in Kosovo. 
Fourth, it goes without saying that a primary concern in any military planning is to minimize the risk of American lives while ensuring the success of the mission. 
With these principles in mind, let me examine our options in the Kosovo crisis now. 
The United States has declared itself against independence for Kosovo, thereby putting itself at odds with the Kosovar leadership and people, the very ones who are currently being brutalized. 
Madam President, I agree with the position our nation is taking. Whatever one may think of a broader decision made at the beginning of the 20th century as the Turks were pushed out of most of the Balkans, the ethnographic mix of the area simply precludes homogenous states, except through ethnic cleansing, which we must oppose. To put it bluntly, I would use force to stop massacres of innocent civilians. I would use force to prevent cross-border invasions. I would use peacekeepers backed up by force to guarantee the rights of minorities. But I would not risk American lives in a cause of a `greater Albania' which would probably destroy the Macedonian state and set off a chain reaction of incalculable proportions in the south Balkans. 
On the other hand, I cannot imagine asking the Kosovars to accept a return to the pre-1989 autonomy with Serbia. If Milosevic could summarily revoke the autonomy one time, he can do it again. 
Therefore, my own preference as a political goal would be giving Kosovo full republic status within the Yugoslav federation, on an equal footing with Serbia and Montenegro. Perhaps we would also have to have republic status for other parts of Serbia. 
I recognize there are problems with such a solution. Milosevic will be dead set against it, since a Kosovo Republic would ipso facto consign Serbia to a minority role in the upper house of the Yugoslav Parliament and probably mean the end of Milosevic's quasi-dictatorial rule. 
My response is that we and the Kosovars and the democratic leadership of Montenegro and the remaining democrats in Serbia should look at the probable outcome as an opportunity, not a problem. 
Both Dr. Rugova and the KLA have insisted upon independence for Kosovo, but if they keep in mind the scenario I just outlined, they might, in the course of negotiations, agree to a `third republic' or `fourth republic' compromise. 
But how about Milosevic? It is clear to me that only one principle continues to guide his policy, and that is clinging to power. In fact, since he took power in Serbia, Milosevic has been a dismal failure at everything, except staying in power. 
His wars of aggression in pursuit of a goal of a `greater Serbia' have resulted in the extinguishing of hundreds of years of Serbian culture in the Krajina and in Slavonia, and hundreds of thousands of Serbian refugees, and in the impoverishment of most Bosnian Serbs, and all this at a cost of over 300,000 persons killed. 
Meanwhile, under Milosevic's stewardship Serbia itself has plummeted from having been one of the wealthiest countries of Central and Eastern Europe to a near basket-case. 
But Milosevic clings to power. And it is, I regret to have to repeat, only the use of countervailing policy and force, power, that will remove Milosevic. 
And this is the central point. While there is no panacea for the Balkan ills, the necessary precondition for restoration of peace is a democratic government in Belgrade that is prepared to coexist with the non-Serb peoples of the area. 
In order to move events in that direction the Clinton administration has wisely supported the democratic reformist regime in Montenegro--of which Milo Djukanovic is the president--which is already posing a serious challenge to Milosevic within the Yugoslav parliament. 
We must now apply all necessary pressure on Milosevic in Kosovo. 
The Contact Group has issued four demands: a cessation of fighting; the unconditional withdrawal of Serbian special police forces and Yugoslav Army forces from Kosovo; a return of refugees; and unlimited access for international monitors. 
Milosevic's statement on Tuesday in Moscow after his talks with Russian President Yeltsin did not go far enough. He refused to withdraw his troops or to talk with the KLA--two conditions the Contact Group is asking for. 
Milosevic's usual half-way tactics must not dilute the West's resolve to force him to meet all the demands. 
NATO has already tasked its military experts to come up with military options for moving against the Serbs and Milosevic. 
Reportedly, nine preliminary options have been submitted. They range from stationing troops along Kosovo's borders, to imposing a new `no-fly zone' and a `weapons-exclusion zone' over part of Yugoslavia, to air strikes, and even ground invasions. 
In this planning, the possible political ramifications of any military action are, I am sure, being factored in by this administration. 
In the immediate future, though, the NATO military planners will flesh out the details of these options. So, I think it would be imprudent for me or for any other Senator to second-guess the NATO military planners who have the relevant expertise and are in possession of the vital intelligence data needed to make a judgment. 
What I can say is that the use of force must remain on the table, and that, if at all possible, it must be exercised through NATO. 
Within NATO, however, there exists a serious problem. It does not revolve so much around whether or not to use force; for most of our European allies seem to have learned from our Bosnian experience that the use of force in Kosovo may well be necessary. 
The dispute is rather over the question of whether approval by the U.N. Security Council is necessary before NATO acts outside the territory of its members. The United States has always maintained that it is not. As recently as our expansion vote on NATO we insisted that that is not a neessary precondition. A U.N. Security Council mandate is not a necessary precondition to use NATO forces. 
This is a position reinforced, as I said, by the U.S. Senate in the Resolution of Ratification of NATO enlargement overwhelmingly passed on April 30 of this year. 
Most--perhaps all--of our European NATO allies, including the British, assert that U.N. approval is necessary. 
Madam President, this difference of opinion strikes at the heart of the Alliance, for if the European allies' position wins out, the Russians--and even the Chinese--will have a veto power over NATO action in Central and Eastern Europe. This is precisely where Bosnia and Kosovo-like ethnic conflicts are likely to pose the biggest threats to regional security in the coming decades. As much as I support the U.N., I, for one, am not about to yield to the Security Council, the Russians, and the Chinese the decision of whether or not we are able to protect the interests of Europe--requiring their approval ahead of time. 
We must make clear to our European allies, and to the Russians, that while we prefer to act within NATO, we see Kosovo as a vital national security interest of the United States and, hence, are prepared to act alone if necessary. 
This is an unpleasant exercise, but it is preferable to face it now, rather than to postpone the issue. In fact, it would be good to resolve this intra-alliance dispute in the newest revision of NATO's Strategic Concept, which is now being discussed. 
Finally, Madam President, I believe it is absolutely essential for the United States immediately to make contact with the Kosovo Liberation Army. 
A withdrawal of Serbian special forces and Yugoslav Army troops, or a NATO bombing campaign, must not be done unless the KLA first agrees to a ceasefire. For I must repeat--the object of U.S. policy is not only to stop the movement toward a greater Serbia on the part of Mr. Milosevic, but it is also not to become a tool for a greater Albania in the South Balkans. It is to halt the fighting and then to start serious negotiations involving all the parties. I have already made clear my preferred political solution, but the outcome is for the parties to thrash out. 
We are approaching the moment of truth in Kosovo. As usual, the indispensible element in solving the crisis is the active involvement of the United States, just as it was in Bosnia. 
As the U.S. Government continues its negotiations with its allies and its Contact Group partners, and as NATO military planners continue to refine possible military options, I urge my colleagues to recognize the gravity of the situation and to make clear their support for resolute American leadership. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. BIDEN. It is my understanding that the majority leader some 7, 6, 5, 10 days ago, told us that this bill would go nowhere unless we added a Republican provision relating to the marriage penalty. And now he is telling us that it violates the budget because we passed on this floor what he asked us to do. 
I want to tell you, I find that incredibly fascinating. I don't find it unusual, I find it fascinating. I have to get this straight. Here is my question, and I will not object if I get an answer: Is one of the reasons why the Republican leader will argue that this is a violation of the budget agreement the fact that this bill now contains a tax expenditure of tens of billions of dollars to correct the marriage penalty, which all the Republicans voted for and told us we had to have? Is that one of the reasons why we violate the Budget Act? I ask that as a question of my friend.

Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I was about to ask that we move into morning business to speak. My friend from Kentucky wants to speak on this matter, and I will in 10 seconds yield to him. 
I say to my friend from Texas, it is always a joy to listen to him. The fairy tales he remembers always warm my heart. But I think he sometimes gets it mixed up. I think the Goliath here was the tobacco companies with their millions of dollars, and in the health care fight it was the insurance companies with their millions of dollars. I have no doubt my friend, with a small sling and a small stone, with his skill could take down Goliath, but in this case he had a few cruise missiles. The cruise missiles were the $40 million the tobacco companies are spending on advertising to kill this bill and the $14 billion that Harry and Louise spent on television to kill health care reform. 
I don't doubt his prowess, but I acknowledge he probably had a little bit of help. It was a nuclear bomb in that little sling that David had, and it was worth tens of millions of dollars. It works every time in this town, and I just find it absolutely fascinating.

Mr. BIDEN. David was not alone, nor was my colleague with the sling. He had a force behind him of noble tobacco merchants who stood shoulder to shoulder making sure that their ultimate threat was, if they didn't get a bill they wanted, they were going to continue to advertise. Isn't that kind of fascinating. These no-good sons of guns talking about how they care about the health of America. Much of the criticism this bill had leveled at it I agree with. I agree with much of the criticism. 
But the idea that at the end of the day--at the end of the day--we are going to have no bill and these young pages sitting here in front of me, their peer group is going to end up, every single day, being lured by specifically teenage-based advertising done by companies that lied straight out, right through their teeth, about what they have been doing. These companies are going to continue to consciously--consciously--attempt to addict them to nicotine, a conscious effort where they will spend tens of millions of dollars this year, next year, and the following years in advertising to addict them--addict them--and they are going to do it. 
Notwithstanding the fact I had criticisms with some parts of this bill, at the end of the day, they win. They win big, and our children lose. Our children lose. And so David in this case had some cruise missiles. They were all paid for by big tobacco --big tobacco, period. I am not talking about tobacco farmers. They grow it. They get a small piece of this action. They don't do the advertising. I am talking about the tobacco executives. 
And so it is going to be business as usual. But mark my words--let me end with this--the tobacco companies, from the advertising they have been out with now about how bad this bill is, if they are serious, I ask them in good conscience, for the health of the Nation--which they have now finally had to acknowledge has been put in peril by their action--I ask them publicly: voluntarily refrain from advertising, voluntarily refrain from advertising in any way that appeals to our children --if they have one ounce of moral fiber in them. We don't need a bill. They can take care of this if they have any decency. Just voluntarily stop. No Government, no tax, no nothing. They know what they are doing to our children, and they are intending to do it. 
So if they want to solve the problem, it is real simple. Voluntarily stop. As was said years ago in a committee by a witness to a former Senator named McCarthy--at one point the witness looked up and said, `Have you no decency, sir?' My question to the tobacco executives of America today is, Have you no decency? If you do, stop, stop luring our children. 
I yield to my friend from Kentucky, and then later I am going to come back and ask to speak to Kosovo.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, last night I was not present to vote on the two motions to table because I was in Wilmington attending the high school graduation ceremony of my godson and nephew, Cuffe Owens. 
When I left the Senate yesterday, it was not clear that any votes would take place later in the evening and I did not anticipate that I would miss any votes. Nonetheless, after consultation with my colleagues, I left with the belief that, If these votes were ordered, my absence would not affect the outcome, and it did not. Had I been present, I would have voted to table the Gramm amendment, and against tabling the Daschle amendment.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as we focus on improving our education system on the national state and local levels, it is my pleasure to offer congratulations to an award-winning teacher from Dover, Delaware who exemplifies excellence in education for her students, her community, my home state of Delaware, and indeed, this nation. 
For the second consecutive year, Patty Richardson Hinchey received the second place award in the category of Achievement/Research--Faculty Adviser of Student Publications for Secondary Schools. This award is given by the prestigious National Federation of Press Women. The award recognizes the outstanding high school journalism advisers/teachers. 
Patty also won first place in the State of Delaware competition for the past two years in the same category from the Delaware Press Women, which made her eligible for the national award. 
What my colleagues might find most interesting and ironic--the name of the student newspaper at Dover High School for which Patty is the faculty adviser is `The Senator.' The 24-page award-winning issue captivated the pulse of student activities, highlighted the history of soon-to-be graduates, spotlighted student leadership during their four years at Dover High School, congratulated Athletes of the Year, and featured articles about teachers who make a difference. 
Patty's work on the student newspaper goes well beyond the final afternoon school bell. She and her students calculated spending more than 6,000 hours in the last four years putting editions of `The Senator' to bed. Even more remarkable, due to a school-related accident leaving Patty unable to walk, she worked from her home with the students to get the final issue to press on time. 
I have spoken often about the need in this day and age to give young people an `excuse' to stay on the road to achievement, stay in school, stay away from alcohol, drugs and gangs, and stay off the streets. Student newspapers, like Dover High School's, and teachers like Patty Hinchey, are providing these students with that valuable `excuse.' This is positive peer pressure, and our country needs more of it. The students know they have to keep their grades up, get their work done on strict deadlines, and keep out of trouble or else they will not experience the thrill and pride of seeing their byline on an article they researched and wrote. 
So, I want to thank Patty for providing these award-winning students the opportunity to be their very best and strive for excellence in their work. The lessons and values they have learned working on the school newspaper will serve them well throughout their lives--the lessons of deadlines, responsibility, accountability, how to communicate verbally and in writing, and most importantly how to get along with and respect other people. 
I could go on about how impressed I am with Patty, but listen to what her students say about her. The Editor-in Chief of `The Senator' said: `Mrs. Hinchey is an inspirational, talented, creative, hard-working, and most importantly, loving teacher. I am currently a senior and have been in her class since my freshman year. Over this time, I have been able to observe how many students she has become close to and how many people both trust and respect her.' 
Another student, Kate Basone, Advertising Editor, said: `Mrs. Hinchey inspired the students to produce work that reflected their best effort. She would not accept articles that she felt were not up to the standards of `The Senator' which she established. Therefore, because of her constant pushing and sometime pulling, many students found themselves producing some of their best work.' 
Patty is not only a talented teacher, she is a terrific mother to her daughter Andrea, who is student at the University of Delaware, and a career military wife to the now retired Lieutenant Colonel John Hinchey. 
It is with great pleasure that I congratulate Patty Richardson Hinchey for her outstanding accomplishments as an awarding-winning teacher and faculty adviser for the Dover High School newspaper `The Senator.'

Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may consume, up to the time I have allotted to me. 
I was asked by someone yesterday after a meeting at the White House on this issue, What did I think about this sanctions act? And I said: `Good act, bad timing.' Good act, bad timing. 
The extent to which this act that we are about to vote on, this sanctions bill, is of value is a little like nuclear weapons: Their value is in their nonuse; their value is in their threat of use. 
The administration has made significant progress over the 6 months we gave them with the threat of this bill in place. It has had the best of all worlds. It has allowed those in Russia who very desperately want to cut off this program and this relationship with Iran the ability to say, `we must do this or we will lose much more than we will gain,' without having to put themselves in a position politically in their own country in which they appear to be publicly buckling to the pressure applied by the United States. 
So, although I have no disagreement with the principle of H.R. 2709, the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997, and I have no doubt that it addresses an urgent concern we cannot ignore, I have a great deal of doubt about whether we should be voting for it now and sending it to the President now. 
Madam President, to state the obvious, the cold war is over. One of the great wonders of it is that the world was spared any use of nuclear weapons during that cold war, and almost--almost--any use of chemical or biological weapons. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them, however, could bring about the very holocaust that we have managed to avoid over the past 50 years. 
So, everyone here is united in one objective: to stop, inhibit, curtail the proliferation of weapons or the means of delivering those weapons. How do we best do that? Is the best way to do that, relative to Iran's missile program, to impose these sanctions now? Will this bill, by its passage, finally turn off the last few drops of water coming out of that spigot? Or will it enhance the prospect that the cooperation with Iran--which began years ago and has continued in diminishing amounts up to now--will be increased, reversing the momentum of the last 6 months? 
It seems to me, as rational persons--and we all are, obviously, on this--we have to examine that question. For me, the instinct to punish Russia for what they did in the past is overtaken by my fear that the proliferation will increase. To the extent that I have a disagreement with my friend from Connecticut or my friend from Arizona, two of the brightest people in this body, it relates to how I come down on that question. 
One or another country may think it needs these weapons to protect it from its neighbors or gain the attention of the great powers. The fact is, however, that weapons of mass destruction threaten us all, especially when the countries that seek them are ruled by murderous despots or inflamed by ethnic or ideological causes. 
Today, two sets of neighboring countries--India and Pakistan, and Iran and Iraq--pose the greatest threat that weapons of mass destruction might actually be used. India and Pakistan have to be restrained from using such weapons against each other. I was reminded by someone today, we are talking about a response time of 3 minutes--3 minutes; a pretty short leash, quite a hair trigger--when we are talking about Pakistan and India. The same would apply to Iraq and Iran, who have managed over the last decades to kill hundreds of thousands of each other's citizens. So these two sets of neighbors--India and Pakistan, Iran and Iraq--it seems to me, are most likely to get the world in trouble. Iran and Iraq have to be prevented from obtaining such weapons and from using them, not only against each other but also against the whole Middle East region, if not the world. 
Some foreign entities, notably Russia, have continued to assist Iran's ballistic missile program intended to give Iran long-range ability to deliver weapons of mass destruction. This assistance must stop, and it must stop now. 
Since early last year, U.S. officials from the Clinton administration, including the President and the Vice President, have raised the matter with their Russian counterparts, Yeltsin, Chernomyrdin, and Kiriyenko. They have all agreed it is hardly in Russia's interests to give Iran the capacity to fire long-range missiles with weapons of mass destruction. Special envoys Frank Wisner and Robert Gallucci have worked with Russian Space Agency chief Yuri Koptev to help Russia determine what it must do to stem this assistance. 
Let us get a little background here, because we all kind of mentioned it. Here you have a former empire that has crumbled around the ears of Russian leaders. They are left with a number of the old apparatchiks in charge of huge, bureaucratic entities, departments, who have, off and on for the last 9 years, been free agents to some degree or another. 
The idea that Yeltsin has his finger on, and knowledge about, and the ability to control every one of his disparate agencies out there is, I think we would all acknowledge, not nearly, nearly a reality. So, since early last year, American officials have been working very hard, pressuring, cajoling, and educating the Russian leadership as to why this is against the Russian leaders' own interests and how to gain control, how to gain control of their own entities. 
There is an irony here. If we said to our constituents that there is this outfit in Russia that doesn't control what is happening in a department in one of the six nuclear cities in Russia, or doesn't have control over a department in Moscow, they would say: `Wait a minute, isn't this the same outfit that ruled with the iron fist, so that they would be able to not only have a command economy, but to command everything?' But the fact is, the Russian leaders do not have that ability any more. And they do not know how to gain it. 
So I start off with the proposition that this is a very different circumstance than if we were dealing with the U.S.S.R. and this program were going on. If I were to have turned to even Gorbachev, or any of his predecessors, and said, `you are transferring this technology to Iran,' and had them say, `we didn't know that, or were unaware of the extent of it,' having been here 25 years and dealt with them on that issue for 15 years, I would have said unequivocally on this floor, `that is flatout a lie; they cannot not know that.' 
But it is clear that, although much was known in some quarters, a lot was not known. So you actually have the Russian leadership saying, `How do we set up export controls? How do we gain control? You have been doing this. How do you all do it?' --we have not done it perfectly, by the way, but--`How do you do it?' 
The fact is that troubling aspects of the Russian assistance to Iran program continue to this very day. I know that. All of us on this floor have gotten a briefing. We know that. And with each passing day, Iran comes closer to obtaining the ability to have long-range missiles that can rain down chemical or biological destruction on Israel, Saudi Arabia, and U.S. Armed Forces in the region, and, obviously, to understate it, that is a real problem. 
So, what do you do about this? The executive branch, in my view, has made real progress, important progress, that this bill before us, I believe, will sacrifice. Let me give you a few examples. 
Last year, Russia expelled an Iranian Embassy employee who was involved in seeking assistance for Iran's missile program. Russia's Federal Security Service, the FSB, says that Russia also deported a member of an Iranian military delegation. 
The FSB adds, in a statement of May 15, that two officials at a Russian research center were arrested, convicted, and sentenced to prison for trying to `enter into an agreement with a foreign firm to design homing electronic devices for missiles.' 
They also foiled an effort by Iran's SANAM industry group, to get missile parts from a Russian firm, NPO Trud. The FSB statement also adds that, `All the activities of the SANAM group on the territory of Russia have been terminated and prohibited.' 
On January 22, Russia issued Order No. 57 establishing what are called `catch-all controls' over the export of any material or technology that might contribute to Iran's programs to develop weapons of mass destruction or long-range missiles. 
Last week, Russia promulgated implementing directives for that order requiring that each entity involved in high-tech material or technology exports set up a review committee to screen proposals and specifying `red flags' that would require referral of proposals to high-level officials for approval. Those `red flags' are precisely the sort of criteria that we would want Russia to use. For example, they name certain Iranian entities that are automatically suspect no matter what they want to buy. That is a take-no-chances approach that suggests the seriousness on the part of Russia. 
The pace of diplomacy is slow, Madam President, and so is the pace of Russian bureaucracy, and so is the pace of putting together a Russian Government that can control Russia. I understand and share the frustration that my colleagues feel in this regard. But, as the kids say, let's get real. When was the last time we turned Russian policy completely around, and how long did it take? 
When we didn't like the Soviet Union deploying SS-20 intermediate-range missiles in the European theater, we had to build and deploy Pershing missiles in response before they would sign the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty. The process took 10 years. It took a similar period of time for the Soviet Union, later Russia, to admit it was violating the ABM Treaty in building a large phased-array radar near Krasnoyarsk. And there are a lot of other examples of how long this takes. 
My colleagues will say the assistance continues, that these institutions and firms are just looking for ways to get around Order No. 57, and that there are still bureaucracies that oppose Yeltsin and Kiriyenko on this issue; and I will reply, `Yup, you're right, that's exactly what has happened.' 
What on Earth does anybody expect? Do my colleagues expect Russian officials to be grateful when we catch them doing something stupid and call them on it? Do they expect the institutes, that cannot pay for their personnel, or their factories that pay their workers in goods to barter on the market, to be happy when we tell them that they have to turn down hard currency from Iran? 
Look, we have a satellite industry that is apoplectic today--an American satellite industry that is apoplectic today--because the House took action and the Senate may take action curtailing their ability to launch these satellites into space from other launch systems around the world. Why? They are going to lose billions of dollars. Mark my word, you are going to start hearing from their employees saying, `What have you done to my job?' Right? We all know that. We shouldn't yield to the company or the employee if it is against the national interest, but we are going to hear it. 
What would happen, do you think, if all of a sudden we were to say, `By the way, stop doing' such and such, which is the only thing that allows you to make any money at all, to even be given goods you can barter on the street to keep your apartment? I don't say this by way of justifying anything Russia is doing, but there is a report from an organization I have great respect for, the American Jewish Committee. The American Jewish Committee had a report written called `The Russian Connection: Russia, Iran, the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction.' It is a very good report. I recommend it to everyone. 
They point to an article that was written in Russia about missile specialists who worked in Iran during the past few years. It says that specialists were recruited by Iranians in collaboration with the Federal Security Service--which is now going to be part of stopping this. 
Then the article goes on to say that the policy of assisting the missile program began in 1994, when the then-chief of Yeltsin's bodyguard service was involved in export policymaking, and that it was done--for what? For hard currency, for money. 
Now we have convinced Yeltsin and a new government in Russia--which is probably the most pro-American government that has existed in the last 90 years in Russia, maybe in Russian history--we have them taking all these steps to cut this off. OK? So far, so good. 
The American Jewish Committee report points out that the reason they did this was for money. Now we go ahead and we cut off any money that we are going to send these Russian entities in existing bilateral arrangements we have. What do we think Russian leaders are going to do? Are they going to say, `You know, we now lost the American support that we, the new Government in Russia, want, and we don't want to be selling this missile technology anyway because it is against our interest, so at least we could have told the folks in those departments that there was something coming, but the Americans are going to cut off that money, we're not going to get that, but, by the way, still don't follow through on this Iranian program?' 
It is lose-lose. They not only lose the money that encouraged them to enter into these arrangements in 1994, because of our efforts to stop it and because they were not quick enough and thorough enough in stopping it, they have now lost any other aid they have. 
Again, I am not approaching this from an ideological point of view. I am not approaching this from a point of view of who is right or who is wrong, whether they did the right thing or the wrong thing. I am trying to approach this from a practical point of view: How do we assure that what was going on doesn't continue? How do we stop proliferation? 
This same report published by the American Jewish Committee makes a very, very important point in a section entitled `American Policy Options.' 
It says:  
The United States faces tough choices in addressing the issue of Russian-Iranian missile cooperation. Both the Clinton administration and its critics confront the fact that American leverage is probably limited. 
Then it goes on to say: 
However, the threat of sanctions will not in itself be sufficient. The threat of missile proliferation is serious enough to warrant offering improved carrots. 
Let's get this straight. Everybody has kind of figured this out--let's review the bidding. 
The Russians were bad guys. They sold technologies to people who were even worse guys. The combination of that is against the interests of the United States, and particularly against the interests of Israel. We have to turn it around and stop it. 
We went ahead, and after the last couple years--with great pressure during this year, thanks to congressional leadership having the sanctions sitting out on the table--convinced Yeltsin, and now the friendliest government that ever existed in Russian history toward the United States, the two new young guys in positions of power, not only that it is against their interests, but also that they better stop. And there is some evidence they are stopping it. 
They are finding where at least some of the technology leaks are and they are turning them off. And now here we are after they had begun the process saying, `Aha, but you did do it.' Of course they did it. And what we're going to do is to say, `we're going to cut your water off from this end of the spigot. We're going to cut it off.' 
And if the objective is America's interest and indirectly Israel's interest, which is an American interest, how does that make sense? Let me add one other dimension here. 
I said: `This is a good act, bad timing.' Let us review the bidding and what is going on in the Asian subcontinent right now. Regarding India and Pakistan, we are breaking our neck, some of us on this floor personally, the President, Democrats, Republicans, pleading, cajoling, doing everything we can with Pakistan not to up the ante. We are doing everything we can to take an Indian Government that has overstepped its bounds against its good judgment, in my view, and say, `Tone down what you're doing.' We are trying to put a lid on this. 
So what are we doing? Some of us, as well as the administration, are doing everything from picking up the phone and calling Sharif in Pakistan, to saying, through the administration, to Yeltsin, `You, Yeltsin, have a relationship with India. Call them. Tell them. Cooperate with us.' 
Every Republican and Democrat who has any contact in China is trying to get China to put pressure on Pakistan. And in the middle of this gigantic effort, that is literally worldwide, at a moment when every nation in the world, particularly the nuclear powers, fully understands the potential consequence of Pakistan's nuclear testing now and India's heated rhetoric--now, when all this is going on--what are we doing? 
In fairness to the leader, this was under a unanimous consent agreement, and put off from back in November, but what are we doing? We are coming along invoking a sanction potentially that is going to make it more difficult by anybody's standard to get worldwide cooperation. 
Who are the nations that can most influence Pakistan or most influence India right now, beyond the United States? I will bet that if we ask all the staff in the back who are experts on this--whether they are for these sanctions or against them--I bet that if we asked everybody in this Chamber, and I put a list on the board saying, `Which are the most likely countries to be able to influence Pakistan,' and put Russia, France, Germany, England and China--I bet you would all pass the test and say, `China.' And why would you say that? Because China has been selling them missile technology. 
Now, I wonder who would have the most influence on India. The answer is Russia, for similar reasons. So thus it seems to me, Madam President, that this is a good idea at a very bad moment. 
We also have a new government in Russia. We have two young people--and every analyst to whom I have spoken, conservative or liberal, Democrat or Republican, or who has testified before the committee or spoken to my staff has said, `These two new guys are keepers. They're the best shot we have.' They are the best shot we have. Now they have gone out and put their new, fragile reputations on the line in that new government, and said, with regard to assistance to Iran's missile program, `Shut it down.' 
And the first bit of reward we are going to give them is sanctions against entities in their country. 
Now, look, some former President, whom I will not name, once said, `Life is not fair.' I am not suggesting to anybody that it would not be fair to impose these sanctions. By any measure, it is fair, because they did not play by the rules. They broke the agreements. So it is fair; but is it smart? Is it in our interests? Is it a good idea? In my humble opinion, the answer is no, it is not smart, it is not a good idea, it is not in our interest. The sanctions we mandate will be resented and they will be resisted and, in my sincere view, they will fail where diplomacy is succeeding. 
Some aspects of this bill seem calculated to anger Russia rather than to secure compliance. One is the `credible evidence' standard for sanctions. According to the report on this bill, the standard is meant to require sanctions when information is merely `sufficiently believable as to raise a serious question * * * as to whether a foreign person may have transferred or attempted to transfer' sanctionable items of technology. 
This is kind of the `shoot first, ask questions later' approach to international relations. This is cold-war posturing in a warmer environment, with the friendliest government we have ever had an opportunity to work with, and it will likely fail. 
Fortunately, our action today is not the end of the process. The President is very likely--very likely--to veto this bill. And if we have the amendment of the Senator from Michigan accepted, which I expect it to be, we will have to go back to conference. 
And I say to you, Madam President, and to my colleagues, that I hope Russian officials and firms that follow this debate will hear the message my colleagues are sending. If Russian assistance to the Iranian missile program does not cease within a matter of weeks, I truly believe that this body will override the President's veto and set in stone this counterproductive sanctions bill. 
I also say to my friends who believe that this sanctions bill is warranted on the merits, if you just do it based on weighing the scales, that you are giving up nothing by delaying here. Can anyone show me that there has not been real progress over the last 6 months? 
So if in 2 weeks or 6 weeks or 8 weeks this progress has not continued, this sanctions bill can be brought back up. But to pass it now, I honestly believe, will be counterproductive. 
Russia's legal and administrative actions so far, while insufficient, show their good intent. There is also a strong foundation on which to build. But the edifice of enforcement must be built quickly. Only speedy Russian action is likely to avert the sanctions regime mandated in this bill. 
In closing, let me note my deep objection to the other body's insistence upon attaching the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act to this measure. This is a practice that has to stop. It is irresponsible, absolutely irresponsible, in my view. Combining the two bills, the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act and the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act, both of which should be sent over here-- 
I am not suggesting that they shouldn't do that--to tie them together in the hope that it will force the President to sign the bill is holding hostages that relate to our national interest as Americans. 
They did the same thing with the IMF. They did the same thing with the United Nations arrearages by attaching abortion language. Each of these issues warrants debate, but not tied to one another. Attaching the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act to this bill serves merely to delay for many months and to put at risk a bill that is important to our national interests. That was an irresponsible action, in my view, that ill-befits a coequal branch of government, the House of Representatives.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will, in a moment, yield back the time I have left. 
Mr. President, I will conclude by suggesting, again, I think this is the wrong time to do this. I think it has its greatest value held in abeyance, as long as significant progress is being made. I am fearful if this is signed into law by the President, in the near term it is going to have the exact opposite impact. But in the interests of accommodating people's schedules--although I am not sure how much we are going to accommodate because I am told there will be insistence there be a vote on the highway bill, and if that is true, we are not being able to accommodate anybody's time. But I am delighted to yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the `Violence Against Women Act--II.' I am pleased to be joined by several Senators who are cosponsoring this legislation--including Senators Specter, Boxer, Snowe, Murray, Moseley-Braun, Mikulski, Dodd, Lautenburg, Wellstone, Kennedy, and Durbin. 
Mr. President, when I introduced the Violence Against Women Act eight years ago--in June, 1990--it was not clear that the Senate would ever even consider this legislation. The fundamental reason--just eight years ago, few thought it either appropriate or necessary for national legislation to confront the problem of domestic violence. 
From 1990 to 1993, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I convened six hearings on the bill, released six reports on the problems of violence against women, convinced the Judiciary Committee to favorably report the bill to the full Senate on three times and had to re-introduce the bill twice. 
But, it was not until November, 1993--nearly 3 and 1/2 years after introduction--that the full Senate even considered the Violence Against Women Act. In September, 1994, the Violence Against Women Act became law. 
But, even passage of the act into law did not end the significant debate on the issue of whether the problem of violence against women merited a national response. As my colleagues will recall, throughout the summer of 1995, the Congress debated whether or not we should actually fund the Violence Against Women Act. 
Fortunately, by the fall of 1995, the Congress finally reached a consensus--the Federal Government can and should provide resources and leadership in a national effort to end the violence women suffer at the hands of men who profess to love them. 
That consensus has held to this day. 
And, at the most practical levels, that consensus has been rewarded: 
The murder rate for wives, ex-wives and girlfriends at the hands of their `intimates' fell to an 19-year low in both 1995 and 1996. 
Thousands of trained police officers are on the streets arresting abusers before they can victimize again; police officers are working as never before to guide victims toward help; prosecutors have been added to the front-lines to put these abusers where they belong--behind bars; tens of thousands of women have been provided the shelters necessary to protect themselves and their children; battered women are being provided a whole range of support services--counseling, legal help for such matters as getting a `protection from abuse' orders; and a new national domestic violence hotline has already answered nearly 200,000 calls for help. 
Mr. President, our consensus in the Congress reflects a fundamental consensus in our Nation--the time when a woman has to suffer in silence because the criminal who is victimizing her happens to be her husband or boyfriend is over. 
Today, we must build on this consensus and deliver on its promise--because for all the strides we have made, there remain far too many women who will go home this evening knowing in the nervous pit of their stomach that there is a better than even chance that they will get the hell beat out of them. 
I don't know that any of us who have not been in this situation can truly understand what it must be like--an understanding which would, in turn, also help us recognize the tremendous need to take action. 
Perhaps we can gain a glimmer of such an understanding if we recall our school-boy memory--and every man in this Chamber I know has at least one of these--a memory of sitting in class, dreading the time when the recess bell would ring, because the school bully told you that he was going to beat the daylights out of you on the playground. Imagine feeling that dread every day. Imagine feeling that twist in your guts as an adult. 
That is what every man in this Senate, this Congress and this Nation must remember as we continue to debate what we can--and what we should--do to combat violence against women. 
Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today--the Violence Against Women Act II--has one simple goal: make more women safe. 
This legislation seeks this goal by building on the original Violence Against Women Act--continuing what is working; seeking improvements to fix those efforts which could work better; and expanding the national fight into those areas where the need is clear, but our efforts have neglected. 
Beyond describing some of the specifics of the legislation being introduced, I want to make it clear, there are many other ideas and proposals that should be considered before the full Senate debates this legislation. Also, I am sure there are several refinements to improve what is currently in this bill. 
There are several Senators who are developing these other proposals and refinements--for there are many Senators who are deeply committed to combating violence against women. And, I hope that my colleagues will review this legislation, offer their insights and lend their names as co-sponsors and leaders in the fight against domestic violence. 
Still, as my colleagues review this legislation, I believe they will find that it offers comprehensive and sensible responses to violence against women. 
To highlight just some of the specific aspects of this legislation, let me start with what I believe to be the central component of the Violence Against Women Act II--the money, continuing the dollars for cops, prosecutors, judges, shelters, and all the elements which are working. 
This requires one simple step--continue the violent crime reduction trust fund which the Biden crime bill set up several years ago. This trust fund is due to expire in the year 2000. 
Let me remind everybody how it is funded. We agreed that we would reduce the number of Federal workers by over 200,000. We reduced them by 271,000. We agreed that the paychecks that were being paid to those Federal workers would be taken and put in the trust fund, and that trust fund would only be used to fight crime, a part of which is to fight domestic violence. That fund, that trust fund, that separate entity's authorization expires in the year 2000. This legislation first and foremost extends it, extends it to the year 2002. And it does not relitigate the balanced budget agreement upon which we agreed last year. It is accommodated within that balanced budget agreement. 
Beyond this fundamental step, there are four key policy areas addressed in my new legislation. 
1. Strengthening law enforcement's tools. 
2. Improving services for the victims of violence. 
3. Reducing violence against children, not only the frequent and horrible side effects of violence against women but also the wellspring of future generations of abusers because all of the data shows that those who witness abuse, ironically and tragically, tend to become abusers. 
4. To bolster the antidomestic violence training and education programs to enlist many more professionals in our fight to deal with violence.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed the House companion legislation--H.R. 3565--to S. 1985 the `Care for Police Survivors Act of 1998', which I introduced along with Senators Hatch, Leahy, DeWine and Sessions. 
This week we celebrate National Police Week. As we honor those who protect us, it is important that we remember those who have fallen in the line of duty. However, more than mere remembrance is necessary. We must work to ensure that the loved ones these officers leave behind are comforted and assisted in every way. The Care for Police Survivors Act does just that. 
This legislation modifies the Public Safety Officers Death Benefit program, which--as my colleagues know--establishes national programs that counsel and assist the families of slain police officers. The purpose of the Care for Police Survivors Act, which the House of Representatives passed overwhelmingly (403-8), is to enhance these national programs. It does so by directing more funds to these programs that counsel and support these families in the aftermath of tragedy. Under current law, these counseling programs have a ceiling of $150,000, this bill changes this to a floor of $150,000. 
Mr. President, I have long been concerned about the plight of families of public safety officers killed in the line of duty--last year, Senator Specter and I introduced the Public Safety Officers Educational Assistance Act which provides for the education of the spouse and dependent children of law enforcement officers who die or are totally disabled in the line of duty. In that vein, this legislation offers assurance to those in the public safety profession--and even to those considering service as public safety officers--that there is a well established support system in place to comfort and assist their families and loved ones in the event that they die in the line of duty. 
Mr. President, it is critical that we not only remember, but offer real help to the families of those police officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our streets and homes safe.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed S. 1525, the `Public Safety Officers Educational Assistance Act of 1998.' 
Last congress, the Senate passed the `Federal Law Enforcement Dependents Assistance Act'--led by Senators Specter and Kohl and co-sponsored by myself and nearly every member of the Judiciary Committee. This law provides for the education of the spouse and dependent children of federal law enforcement officers who die or are totally disabled in the line of duty. 
The purpose of the legislation was to remove a significant financial burden from the families of these deceased officers and to allow them to continue on the educational path they would have followed had their parent or spouse not been killed in the line of duty. 
Last fall, about 30 young men and women were able to go to college under this program. Unfortunately, this program is only available to the children of federal law enforcement officers. 
The Public Safety Officers Educational Assistance Act, which Senator Specter and I introduced last year, extends these same educational benefits to the dependents of all public safety officers--in other words, not just federal--but also state, county and local law enforcement officers, and fire and rescue personnel--who have given their lives in the line of duty. 
Under this bill, the Attorney General will administer a program which will provide up to $4,485 per child, per year to attend a 4-year college. This is the same amount of educational assistance the federal government provides to veterans. 
The Justice Department estimates the total cost for this year to be about $300,000. What is more, the Justice Department already has the funds to pay for this $300,000 within their current budget--so we will not need any additional appropriations. 
It is critical that we remember the families of those officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our streets and homes safe. This bill is intended to allow the dependents of public safety officers to continue with their education as they would have been able to do had their parent not been killed or totally disabled in the line of duty.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues for their hard work on this legislation--which implements the two world intellectual property organization copyright treaties adopted by the 1996 Geneva diplomatic conference. 
As is the practice on such intellectual property matters, we are first seeking to pass the implementing legislation. This, I believe, will pave the way for the Foreign Relations Committee--and the full senate--to ratify the treaties, which the administration submitted last July. 
The WIPO treaties and the implementing legislation will update intellectual property law to deal with the explosion of the Internet and other forms of electronic communications. Delegates from the United States and 160 other member nations agreed to give authors of `literary and artistic works,' including books, computer programs, films, and sound recordings, the exclusive right to sell or otherwise make their work available to the public. 
The treaties give tougher international protection to software makers and the recording industry--the U.S. Government's biggest goal. The U.S. wanted--and got--tough international protection for sound recordings in order to stop pirating of music compact discs overseas. The treaties protect literary and artistic works from digital copying, but do not make it illegal to use the Internet in the normal way. 
To give a concrete example of what passage and implementation of the WIPO treaties will mean--before the treaty it was illegal to photocopy the contents of an entire book or copy a videotape without permission, but it was not clear whether it was illegal to e-mail copies of a digital book or movie to 500 friends all over the world. Passage of this bill and the WIPO treaties will ensure that both will be illegal--both domestically and overseas. 
I am pleased that this bill contains provisions to clarify the actions Internet service providers--as well as libraries and educational institutions--will be legally required to take when confronted with evidence of copyright violations by users of their services. 
I am also pleased that this bill contains language intended to preserve the ability of consumer electronics manufacturers--and computer manufacturers and software developers--to continue research and development of innovative devices and hardware products. 
These provisions in my view strike an appropriate balance between the rights of copyright holders and the need to encourage continuing expansion of access to digital information to greater numbers of users throughout the world. 
Therefore, I commend my Judiciary Committee colleagues for their hard work on this bill and I look forward to its passage by the Congress.  
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan. 
Mr. President, there are good ideas and bad ideas. There are timely ideas and untimely ones. Whatever our views on a nation-wide ballistic missile defense, S. 1873 is both bad and untimely. 
I urge my colleagues--on both sides of the aisle--to look closely at this bill and ask whether we should really be spending our time on it. Once they consider its implications we can reject cloture and get back to real work. 
What would it mean to make it U.S. policy `to deploy as soon as is technologically possible an effective National Missile Defense system capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack (whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate)'? 
For starters, we would have to deploy a national missile defense even if broke the bank, the budget agreement, and the U.S. economy. And it might do just that, especially if the bill is interpreted as requiring defense of U.S. territories in addition to every square inch of the 50 states. 
This bill would also require deployment before we know the precise nature of the threat--indeed, before we are actually threatened by any strategic missiles other than Russia's and China's, which have posed that threat for years. That raises the distinct risk that we would deploy the wrong defense for the real threats we may someday face. 
Worse yet, we would spend the taxpayer's hard-earned money on the first technology, rather than the best technology. And the first technology may not stop missiles with penetration aids, which Russia and others already have. 
In addition, by putting pressure on the Pentagon to deploy the first feasible technology, this bill will very likely worsen what General Welch's panel recently called a `rush to failure.' Yesterday's fifth consecutive test failure with one of our theater defense missiles is a reminder of how difficult it is to develop any middle defense. Opting to deploy the first system that looks feasible is simply not a prescription for success. 
Worst of all, this bill does not require--or even permit--consideration of negative consequences resulting from deployment. 
Will the march to deployment destroy the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty? Too bad. That's precisely what some of our colleagues want. 
Will the adoption of this objective torpedo implementation of START II and block any further reduction of strategic missiles or nuclear warheads? Too bad, again. Some people find `star wars' an easier solution than the hard, patient work of reducing great power armaments and stabilizing our forces. 
Will renunciation of the ABM Treaty and the START process lead to a collapse of the Non-Proliferation Treaty? That is a real risk. But once again, too bad. 
Do not focus on the Non-Proliferation Treaty's failings, and overlook its successes. What would the world be like if the countries that have stopped short of developing nuclear weapons were to give up on the commitment of the nuclear powers to reduce their forces? Would we really be safer if all those other countries were to go nuclear? 
That is a real risk, if we march willy-nilly to deploy a national missile defense. Remember: when Egypt developed a better defense against Israeli attack on its forces, it was able to mount an offensive attack in the Yom Kippur War. The same thing applies to a national missile defense. We may see it as a defense. But the rest of the world will see it as a second-strike defense that enables us to mount first-strike nuclear attacks. 
Some day, we may really need a nation-wide ballistic missile defense. That is why the Defense Department is pursuing the 3+3 policy of finding a technology that would permit deployment within three years of determining that there was a serious threat on the horizon. 
Some of my colleagues truly believe that we can't wait for that, and I respect their views--although I respectfully believe that they are wrong. Others may be frustrated because they feel the President is trying to steal their issue. `Life is unfair,' as another Democrat once said. 
But frustration and distrust do not make for good policy. And the policy that this bill would establish is simply too much, too soon. Let's get behind 3+3--make it effective, rather than forcing the Defense Department into an even more unrealistic schedule. 
Sensible policy on ballistic missile defense is perfectly feasible. But S. 1873 isn't it. Let's stop wasting the Senate's time with it. 
Mr. President, I am confused as the devil what my friends from Mississippi, Virginia, and others are doing here. Again, there are good ideas, there are bad ideas, there are timely ideas and untimely ideas. This is a bad, untimely idea. I truly am confused. 
No. 1, we don't have any system that works. No. 2, there is no clear analysis of what the threat is that we are going to defend against. That usually goes hand in hand. We say we are going to build a system and here is the threat. 
My friend, the senior Senator from Virginia, says, `Well, you know, the threat may come from terrorist organizations or from specific rogue countries and single-warhead systems.' Fine, that is one kind of system. My friend, the junior Senator from Virginia, stands up and points out, if we come up with a missile defense system for a single warhead that is able to be dealt with, do you think the Chinese are not going to sit there and say, `You know, by golly, we're not going to build any MIRV'd warheads, we're not going to do that'? 
Right now they may not do that. It is clearly against their interests. 
We have this treaty with the Russians, the former Soviet Union, to do away with all multiple warhead missiles because we know they are so pernicious. This will encourage the Chinese to move. No. 1, we don't have an analysis of a threat. No. 2, my conservative friends, who are all budget-conscious guys, like we all are here, have no notion what the cost will be. They are ready to sign on and say, `Deploy. As soon as we find it, deploy it. If it breaks the budget deal, if it causes a deficit, if it breaks the bank, deploy.' No. 3, the idea that the ABM Treaty may or may not be impacted upon by this seems to be of no consequence. And No. 4, my friend, the senior Senator from Virginia, and others stood up on the floor when we were dealing with NATO expansion and said, `Joe, Joe, Joe, the Russians, let's worry about how the Russians are going to think about being isolated; let's worry about how this could impact on Russia. Look, Joe, if you go ahead and do this and expand, what's going to happen is that all arms control agreements are going to come to a screeching halt.' 
Well, let me tell you something. You want to make sure they come to a screeching halt? Pass this, pass this beauty. This will be doing it real well. Bang. All of a sudden, the Duma saying, `Now look, we are going to commit to go to START II, which means we have no multiple warhead weapons, which means we're only going to go to single warhead weapons, which means that, by the way, the U.S. Senate'--and they think we are even smarter than we think we are--`the U.S. Senate just said, `Go ahead and deploy as soon as you have a feasible system.' 
Now, what do you think those good old boys in the Duma are going to do? They are going to say, `You know, let's continue to destroy our multiple warhead weapons. The only thing we know for sure, these guys can't stop.' 
Look, what is viewed as good for somebody is viewed as poison for other people on occasion. And let me point out to you, we are sitting here thinking--and we mean it--that what we want to do is we are going to defend the American people. And we do. But you sit there on the other side of the ocean, the other side of the world, and say, `These guys, these Americans, the only people, by the way, who ever did drop an atomic weapon, these guys are building a system that is going to render them impervious to being hit by nuclear weapons. We think they are building that system for a second-strike capability. They can affirmatively strike us knowing they can't be struck back.' 
Now, don't you think the guys that don't like us might think that? Don't you think that might cross their minds as reasonable planners? And what are we doing this for? What are we doing this for? We have no technology that works now. We are spending $3 billion a year, which I support, on theater and national missile defense research--$3 billion a year. I am for it. We should not get behind the curve so there is a breakout. But to deploy as soon as feasible? So I have only come to one conclusion here, Mr. President. This has to do with either trying to get rid of ABM, which is one of the reasons why some of my friends on the right think it is a bad idea or, No. 2, the President stole the march on the missile defense from them and they are not going to let it happen. This makes no sense. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I opposed the 1995 Securities Litigation Act for several reasons--including the precedent-setting changes to this country's judicial system without the input of the Judiciary Committee. 
I support the Sarbanes amendment for similar reasons--relating both to procedure, and to substance. 
In the past, bills that made changes to the rules that govern citizen's access to State courts were referred to the Judiciary Committee, to enable the committee with expertise to review and work on the legislation. 
While my colleagues on the Banking Committee had the opportunity to examine the specific, substantive changes this bill would make to our Nation's securities laws, it seems to me that we have once again skipped a very important step in the process. 
The securities litigation bill we are considering on the floor today pre-empts State court statutes of limitations in securities fraud cases--and yet again the Judiciary Committee was not given the opportunity to examine the issue. 
In 1991, the Supreme Court significantly shortened the statute of limitations for Federal securities fraud actions--to the shorter of 3 years after the fraud occurs or 1 year after it is discovered. 
Then-SEC Chairman Richard Breeden called the new time limit `unrealistically short.' But, S. 1260 would compound the problem by applying the Federal time limit to State actions removed to Federal court--even though it is shorter than the time limit applicable to actions in 33 of the 50 States. 
This bill would not only leave investors without State court remedies when brokers and dealers make fraudulent statements when selling corporate stock--but it would also tell them that they need only conceal their fraud for 3 years before being absolved of responsibility in Federal court as well. 
And the new time limit will apply even though the 1995 Securities Litigation Act raised the standard investors must meet to win a class action suit--you now have to prove a falsehood was made with clear intent to deceive. 
That's incredibly tough to prove. 
I will admit, some frivolous lawsuits are filed. And some lawyers do make too much from a suit--leaving defrauded investors too little. 
But, immunizing Wall Street professionals who can successfully hide their lies for 3 years is not the answer. 
I support the Sarbanes amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same. We should protect the small investor--not let white collar criminals go unpunished.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be necessarily brief because I have over the years learned to count, and I do not believe I have the votes for this amendment, but I want to make two relatively brief points. 
First of all, in 1970, the Congress greatly assisted the fight against organized crime by adopting the Racketeering Influence and Corruption Organizations Act. We know it as RICO. 
RICO included a private civil enforcement provision with enhanced penalties, including triple damages for racketeering behavior in furtherance of a criminal enterprise engaged in certain, what they call predicate offenses, including murder, arson, bribery, wire fraud, bankruptcy fraud, and securities fraud--securities fraud. 
At the request of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the industry, though against the wishes of law enforcement and State regulators, in 1995, the Securities Litigation Act effectively eliminated securities fraud as a grounds for private civil RICO proceedings. Many of us disagreed with carving out the securities fraud for special status, Mr. President, and protection from application of the civil RICO statute. In fact, my amendment was intended to preserve many civil RICO securities fraud claims and was accepted last time by the full Senate. Unfortunately, it was dropped in committee. 
Last November, the Federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted 19 individuals, including two reputed mob chieftains known as `Rossi' and `Curly,' for their role in the alleged plot to manipulate a thinly traded stock, so-called penny stocks, and for threatening brokers to drive up the prices.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, they are not talking about legitimate traders; they are talking about the mob's attempt to infiltrate Wall Street. It seems to me for us to carve out of the original legislation an exemption from RICO predicate statutes securities fraud is a serious mistake. But it would also be a serious mistake for me to push this issue without the votes at this point, because I realize there is an attempt to bring this legislation to a close. 
I think it is bad legislation generally. I think it is a serious mistake to have done this, but I also have been here long enough, as I said, to be able to know where the votes are. 
I withdraw the amendment.

Mr. BIDEN. Let me state my opposition and why I oppose the Craig amendment. 
I find this debate over the last several weeks to be, in a sense, fascinating--fascinating in this regard. The Members of the Senate who express the greatest concern about the ability of Russia to veto any action NATO takes, the Senators who--with the exception of the Presiding Officer now, who expressed that concern himself--the Senators who have been most vocal about a NATO-Russian accord are now on the floor being the most vocal about their concern about how Russia is going to greet our expanding NATO or voting to expand NATO. So that is one thing I find somewhat anomalous. 
Yesterday, I found it somewhat strange that those who did not want us entangled in border wars in Europe, as they phrased it, or ethnic conflicts in Europe, were the very people who wanted to give up our veto power to be involved in those. That is, right now, under the organizational structure of NATO, if all 15 NATO nations say we should go in and settle this dispute here in Europe and we say no, that is it, we don't go. I found it somewhat anomalous that they were, yesterday, prepared to say: Look, let's have this new dispute resolution mechanism which forced us, whatever iteration it would have come out in, to give up our veto power over that. 
Now, today, Senator Craig, who has been one of the most outspoken opponents, to his credit, to the former Soviet Union, concerned about Russian interference in American affairs--I may be mistaken, but I think he has a very healthy skepticism about any aid to Russia--is now on the floor. He, I think--I know unintentionally, at least in my view--is on the floor unintentionally giving Russia another veto power. 
Mr. President, to reiterate, the amendment of Senator Craig would delay U.S. approval of the accession of Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic to NATO until Congress passes specific authorization for the continued deployment of U.S. forces in Bosnia. This amendment should be rejected because it mixes two vital questions of national security that deserve to be debated and decided, each on its own merits. 
On Bosnia, the U.S. has led successful IFOR and SFOR missions there composed primarily, but by no means exclusively, of NATO forces. The Senate will continue to address the question of whether and how we should continue our participation in the Bosnia mission just as we did during the emergency supplemental budget appropriation adopted prior to the Spring Recess. 
Today, we face an entirely different question: should we vote to bring three worthy countries into NATO as new allies? 
If we are using contributions to the Bosnia mission as a criterion for NATO membership, then all three of the applicants before us are highly qualified. 
Hungary provided a 400-500 troop engineer battalion to IFOR, and a 200-250 troop group to SFOR, as well as a staging area for some 80,000 American troops on rotation through Bosnia at one of its air bases. 
The Czech Republic has been one of the largest per capita contributors with an 870-person mechanized battalion for IFOR, and a 620-person battalion for SFOR. 
Poland, with troops already deployed in half a dozen U.N. peacekeeping missions, contributed a 400-troop airborne infantry battalion to SFOR. 
All three nations provided these assets well before they were formally invited to accede to the North Atlantic Treaty, demonstrating early their willingness to share this burden with us. 
The Senate should reject this amendment. Let us decide these two important questions as they should be--separately, with due consideration for the merits of each case.

Mr. BIDEN. I will yield to my colleague, who has somewhere to go, but I want to ask the Senator from New York a question. Is he aware that the point he is making about a hair trigger--that is, that the Russians have moved to a doctrine of not eschewing the doctrine of first use, that they are now saying they may have to rely on the first use of nuclear weapons? Is he aware that that doctrine which was changed in 1992 had nothing to do with the expansion of NATO? 
In 1992, when the Russian military realized that they, in fact, had imploded when they were incapable of defending their borders, they did exactly what NATO did when we concluded we did not have the conventional force capacity to stop an all-out attack in Europe and indicated that we would use nuclear weapons if, in fact, we were attacked. 
I ask my friend--I am fascinated by his rendition, and I share his concern about the hair trigger. But is he suggesting the decision in 1992 where Russia declared that it would not any longer abide by its previous policy of no first use of nuclear weapons--is he aware that was long before the contemplation of expansion of NATO?

Mr. BIDEN. On my own time, if I might say, that is a little bit like my wife deciding that she is no longer going to cook dinner because she is receiving her Ph.D. and is taking too much time in class, and then 6 months later, after having made that decision, when I, in fact, do something she does not like, she says to me, `I want to formally tell you I haven't been cooking dinner, but I want you to know the reason I am not cooking dinner now is because you were late coming home tonight because you didn't call me from Washington and we missed going to that play.' 
That is what it is like. It has nothing to do--she didn't cook me dinner before for reasons unrelated to me coming home late, but if she wants to make a point that I missed a play, she may very well reiterate, bring out of an old bag something that is already being used. 
That is what the Russians have done, and Mr. Kennan, a revered figure we both know--you know him better than I--believes this is dangerous. Paul Nitze thinks it is dangerous for totally different reasons. Kennan thinks it is dangerous because he thinks it will exacerbate the prospects of any democracy occurring in Russia. Nitze thinks it is dangerous because he is worried that NATO will get fat and flabby now and not be available as a significant military force, were things to go back in Russia. 
I think it is comparing--with all due respect to my learned friend--apples and oranges.

Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, as the Senator knows, they are routinely dismantling that system under Nunn-Lugar, in the face of expansion of NATO. I find that fascinating, and I also find it fascinating that they overwhelmingly ratified the CWC in the Duma. And as recently as two weeks ago, the number two man in the Kremlin is here telling us--excuse me, the foreign minister is here in the United States saying, by the way, by the end of the summer we are going to ratify START II. I don't fail to share the concerns of my friends about the nuclear hair trigger. 
My point is, as we are talking about expanding NATO, what they have been doing is exactly the opposite of what is being implied here. They have continued to move forward on arms control agreement, they have continued to destroy their nuclear arsenal, they have continued to go along with the CFE arms agreement and other treaties and destroyed their conventional weapons, saying they will no longer abide by the doctrine of no first use, which occurred in 1992 when they realized that all they had left was their nuclear arsenal. That is my point. 
It is non sequitur to suggest that the reason why we should be concerned is we are expanding NATO. That has nothing to do with it. There is not a shred of evidence of that. Now, there may very well be a hardening of positions in the domestic political situation in Russia. It may very well be that the browns and the reds get a little more muscle and the nationalists gain some. I don't think so, but I acknowledge that it may be. But their nuclear doctrine is unrelated, put in place 5 years before NATO was a glint in the eye of President Clinton. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, it must be that I am a little slow on the uptake here, because it seems to me that my friends are making my case. Let me explain what I mean by that, and they can correct me. 
First of all, in the Foreign Relations Committee, I recall when we had this vote--and I say it again--in Europe, farm--f-a-r-m--policy always trumps foreign policy. Both have made my point. They acknowledge that. There is no possibility that Europe is going to do the right thing. They have not thus far. The reason, in my view, we must stay as a European power is that they have continued to demonstrate their immaturity over the past, and not much has changed in 50 years in terms of the willingness of anyone to lead. 
If we acknowledge that farm--f-a-r-m--policy always trumps foreign policy in Europe--I challenge anyone to give me an example where it has not--then I ask you: Is this not a red herring? Join EU first before you can get into NATO. 
The second point I will make: No one knows the history of this nation and Europe on this floor better than my friend from New York. As I said before, and I mean this sincerely, I am always uncomfortable when I am on the opposite side of an argument with my friend from New York. 
Let me review very, very briefly the history of NATO and its founding, and the relationship between the economic health of a nation being invited in, and the ability or the willingness of the United States and other NATO members to invite that nation in. 
From a policy perspective, NATO membership and EU membership--that is what this amendment is about, EU membership first before NATO--it is supposed to, and has been suggested by my two friends who are the sponsors of this amendment, somehow put the cart before the horse, that is, military alliance before economic unity, economic growth, economic security. 
I quote from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee report of 1949, the document that was brought to the floor of the Senate urging us to sign the Washington treaty. It said: 
This treaty is designed to contribute toward the further development of peaceful and friendly international relationships, to strengthen free institutions of the parties, and promote better understanding of the principles upon which they are founded, to promote the conditions of stability and well-being, and to encourage economic collaboration. It should facilitate long-term economic recovery through replacing the sense of insecurity by one of confidence in the future. 
That was the original purpose. The original purpose was to promote economic stability. Nobody said then nor has--and I will quote Acheson and a few others in a moment. Nobody has said then or at any moment in our history since that time that, by the way, a condition of joining NATO must be economic integration first, should be economic integration first, must be a demonstration of a strong economy first. No one has ever said that, including George Kennan. George Kennan argued and thought this would promote economic stability as well as military security.

<TEXT>
Mr. BIDEN. To be able to ensure their economic stability. There is no question it referred to that. And there is no question that Acheson, referring to the relationship in 1952, said so in his testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee when he urged Greek and Turkish membership by first recalling that the two nations already joined us in an associate status with NATO, as do the countries we are talking about now, and Acheson emphasized that `the positive action rested not on their military contributions to the alliance but on their advances in democracy, rule of law, western orientation and the likelihood that NATO membership would deepen this.' 
The only point I am trying to make is the obvious one we keep forgetting. My colleagues who oppose expansion and wish to slow it or change it or alter it come to the floor and argue that this was uniquely a military alliance; its soul purpose was to make sure the Fulda Gap was not wide open for Warsaw Pact units to come pouring through. 
That was its essential purpose. It is still its essential purpose. But it was not its only purpose in the beginning, in the middle, in the end. And so I would suggest that we tend to intentionally confuse our colleagues and the public when we say that we raise all these questions about the economic stability. The economic stability of the countries in question coming in is relevant in terms of whether they can pay their freight. That is an important question. 
But this notion of winners and losers, now, I would ask the rhetorical question, if in fact by bringing the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary into NATO, that would in fact seriously disadvantage Romania, Slovenia, and all the other countries in question, does anyone ever stop to ask themselves the question, why is Romania ardently for Hungary's membership? Is it because they 
like being put at an economic disadvantage? Is it because they think this is a good idea; it will spur the competitive juices of our people? Is that why? If this is going to be so debilitating because there is going to be losers, that this is a zero sum game, why are they all for it? Not for it tepidly, not for it on the margins, but for it with an enthusiasm to the degree they send their Foreign Ministers to this country to importune me and many others. Please. 
Now, obviously, they want to get in. They want to get in in the future. They have no promise of getting in. They have the hope of getting in. But the idea that we are going to debilitate, we are going to worsen, we are going to put at a serious disadvantage the economy of our other friends seems either to suggest that our other friends are too stupid to know what their own economic interests are--and they clearly are not, in my view--or it is not debilitating to their economies. 
Madam President, it seems to me if you want to take a further look at this, in 1955, the Foreign Relations Committee report welcomed West Germany as `not only a major step toward the elimination of intra-European strife but in a broader sense these agreements provide the foundation for close cooperation and integration among European allies. The committee was impressed with particularly Secretary Dulles' statement on the psychological impact of this association, the increased effectiveness of the sense of duty, and the cohesion which will be brought about in Western Europe by Germany's participation in the Western European Union as well as NATO.' 
Again, to make the point. Spain, in 1982, bears the closest resemblance to the current applicants. Spain, having returned to democracy only 5 years earlier, believed NATO membership would consolidate Spanish democracy and assist at a lesser cost, as the Poles believe, the process of military modernization it had to undertake regardless of membership. And aside from geography, Spain was judged to offer little in the way of military assets useful to the alliance in 1982 prior to the completion of its modernization. Spain did not enter the EU until 1986, 4 years after, 4 years after NATO. 
Madam President, historically, the economic component of the impact on the relationship with NATO of a new member state has been considered from 1949 on, and every time since, and it has been viewed consistently as better for the economies of the countries that have been unable to gain these larger economic relationships to join NATO first. That has been a stated purpose of bringing them in as well as the military component. 
Historically, membership in NATO has preceded membership in the European Common Market, or any economic grouping, in every instance. 
Reserving the remainder of my time by saying this--when I finish this one comment. Why in the Lord's name would we, unless we just were simply flat against expanding NATO--which I understand. If this is designed as a killer amendment, it is a good strategy, but the logic of it I am lost in trying to comprehend. I find no logic to it, other than it being a killer amendment. You might as well attach an antiabortion amendment to the treaty. That would kill it. I don't want to give anybody any ideas. In this place, it may generate some ideas, but not by any of the Members on the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. But--it is hyperbole that I am engaging in now, it was just pointed out by my friend from New York. But let me tell you what is not hyperbole. There is no historical precedent for this. There is no logical rationale as to why this would, in fact, facilitate NATO membership down the road, because we all know farm policy will prevail over foreign policy. 
And lastly, I respectfully suggest that it bears no relationship, no relationship whatsoever, to anything anyone in the past has thought was necessary to strengthen NATO--none, zero, none, historically, politically, economically, socially, in any way. It may be a good idea, and I have been battling the Europeans, in my capacity as the chairman of or the ranking member of the European Affairs Subcommittee, for years, to `do the right thing. Do the right thing. Let your brothers in.' 
Let me point out, if tomorrow you went to the Russians and said, `I have a deal for you; here is what we are going to do: All those European countries or former satellite states will become part of the EU and you will never be a member of the EU; or they will not be members of the EU, but they will be members of NATO, which you may be able to do; you choose'--there is not an economist, there is not a democrat, in Russia who would choose the former over the latter, in my humble opinion, not a one. 
So the fear--if you are worried about Russia being isolated, then isolate Russia economically from the rest of Europe as a condition before they can enter, anyone can enter, NATO. 
The Europeans may grow beyond that and show their largess and bring in Russian farmers and all that wheat--all that wheat, as we give them the technological capability and the transportation infrastructure to be able to transport it to Europe. You watch. You watch. I am willing to bet any of you anything you would like, the likelihood of the EU being economically generous, extending any largess to the East, is zero, as distinguished from this defensive military alliance that provides political security for Russia on her border and diminishes the realistic prospect that any demagoguing nationalist will be able to inflame people enough to think that they could, in fact, realize any dead dreams. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. BIDEN. I yield myself 30 seconds. 
Madam President, the Treaty of Rome wasn't until the mid-1950s, and it was unheard of in 1949, as the Schuman Plan was. The only point I am making is, any cooperation in Europe was one of the purposes of NATO; it was to encourage that cooperation. But what they had in mind in May of 1949 may have been only the Schuman Plan and/or something else. The EU wasn't even around until the mid-1950s. That wasn't even thought of either. 
So the whole notion was that economic cooperation in Europe produced stability, enhanced democracy, and, in turn, allowed for military security. It is still the case. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, from a strictly American foreign policy viewpoint, requiring EU membership first is sheer folly. Why would we want to place such a key element of our national security decisionmaking in the hands of the European Union--an organization to which we do not belong? 
Already we are seeing the EU members disagreeing over how quickly those invited should be allowed in. 
To give the EU, in effect, a veto over NATO membership, might encourage the creation of an EU caucus within NATO, limiting the United States' ability to advance our diplomatic and military goals in the committees of the Alliance. 
Moreover, advocates of this amendment have misunderstood the importance of NATO membership prior to EU membership, both from a policy and historical context. 
From a policy perspective, NATO membership in advance of EU membership will provide the security these countries need to continue their economic reforms and help to ensure a climate of confidence essential for continued foreign investment and economic integration. 
From a historical perspective, in all its reports on all three rounds of NATO enlargements that took place from 1952 to 1982, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee cited European economic development and integration as one key benefit of expanding NATO's zone of stability. 
I would like to briefly quote from these Senate Foreign Relations Committee reports: 
1949 Report establishing NATO:  
The treaty is designed to contribute toward the further development of peaceful and friendly international relations, to strengthen the free institutions of the parties and promote better understanding of the principles upon which they are founded, to promote conditions of stability and well-being, and to encourage economic collaboration. It should facilitate long-term economic recovery through replacing the sense of insecurity by one of confidence in the future. 
The Committee believes that the [1949] North Atlantic Pact, by providing the means for cooperation in matters of common security and national defense, creates a favorable climate for further steps toward progressively closer European integration * * * 
In 1952, Secretary of State Acheson, in his testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee, urged NATO membership for Greece and Turkey first by recalling that these two nations already enjoyed an associate status with NATO's activities in the Eastern Mediterranean. It was in response to Athens' and Ankara's formal request--their belief that associate status was inadequate to their national defense needs--that they were favorably considered for NATO membership. Acheson emphasized that positive action rested not only on their military contributions to the Alliance, but on their advances in democracy, rule of law, and Western orientation, and the likelihood that NATO membership would deepen this. 
It should be noted that Greece did not enter the European Union until nearly twenty years after its accession to NATO. Turkish membership in the EU remains a contentious, unresolved issue. Are we supposed to kick Turkey out of NATO because it doesn't belong to the EU? 
The 1955 Foreign Relations Committee report welcomed West German accession: * * * not only as a major step toward the elimination of intra-European strife but in a broader sense, these agreements provide the foundation for close cooperation and integration among European allies . . . The Committee was impressed in particular with Secretary Dulles' statement on the psychological impact of this association--the increased effectiveness and the sense of unity and cohesion which will be brought about in Western Europe by German participation in NATO and the Western European Union. 
Of all the examples, the last one--Spanish accession to NATO in 1982--bears the closest resemblance to that of the current applicants. 
Spain, having returned to democracy only five years earlier, believed that NATO membership would help consolidate Spanish democracy and assist, at lesser cost, a process of military modernization it had to undertake regardless of membership. 
Aside from its geography, Spain was judged to offer little in the way of military assets useful to the Alliance in 1982 prior to the completion of its modernization. 
Nevertheless, in favorably reporting Spanish accession to NATO to the full Senate, the Foreign Relations Committee recorded a brief exchange between then-Chairman Charles Percy and then-State Department European Bureau Chief Larry Eagleburger explaining why Spanish accession to NATO was so important to broad U.S. national security interests. Because this exchange is so similar to our situation today, I would like to quote from it. Chairman Percy noted: 
At a time when NATO's cohesiveness and viability is being critically questioned in the press, I find Spain's NATO membership application a reaffirmation of the fundamental principles of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a group of sovereign nations sharing common values and aspirations and committed to working together despite differences to guarantee the security, prosperity, and defense of Western democracy. 
Assistant Secretary Eagleburger replied: * * * in terms of that question of Spanish democracy, it is terribly important that we do everything we can to tie Spain to Western institutions, to have those people be able to deal with Western parliamentarians who also have a commitment to democracy * * * Every tie we can create between Spain and Western Europe and the United States, institutional tie, in fact, I think, strengthens the whole process of democracy in Spain. 
Spain did not enter the EU until 1986, four years after accession to NATO. 
Historically, membership in NATO has preceded membership in European common market or economic integration groupings. 
It is much easier to develop habits of cooperation in common defense as a precursor to the much more complex negotiations leading to economic integration. 
If we wait for the EU to act, we may be waiting for a long time. For example according to recent polls, the Austrian public opposes EU membership for four of the five recent EU invitees. 
Finally, recent history has shown that, in European capitals, when presented with a choice between farm policy and foreign policy, farm policy always wins. 
For all these reasons, Mr. President, I oppose the Moynihan amendment and urge my colleagues to do so.

Mr. BIDEN. Before the Senator from New Jersey leaves the floor, I want to briefly make two points. I find his argument absolutely fascinating that economic dependence or integration with 
the United States is a prerequisite for NATO membership. I wonder if he could explain to me what that dependence was we had with Norway or that dependence we have with Denmark or Portugal or Spain? 
As each came in, as each of these nations came in, if there is a notion that there is a prerequisite of an economic dependency--we have more invested in Poland, more in Poland now than we did at the time of these countries coming in.

Mr. BIDEN. I also find this notion, and it is repeated in different ways but never in a more articulate fashion than just done by my friend from New Jersey, no force on Earth will be able to defend Poland or the Baltics, and he may have mentioned another country, Ukraine, if Russia is not a democracy. 
One of the secondary reasons why people want to expand NATO is because we fundamentally reject that notion, but fundamentally reject the notion that if things `go south,' to use the colloquial expression, in Russia, that someone will be there to never let it happen to Poland again, just like we defended Germany, just like we defended Turkey, just like we defended Norway. 
Now, I am going to, at a later point, speak at length about this iron ring notion my friend from Virginia and my friend from New York talk about and point out that there has been a border shared between Norway and Russia that is one of the most heavily fortified places in the world, and during the period when the Soviet Union was at its zenith, we made a judgment as a people that we would defend Norway. 
Now, I know my friend is not suggesting this, but is anyone implying that peace and stability in Europe is any less at issue if Poland, after having received their independence, were now or again to be invaded as compared to Norway? What are we saying here? And the notion, will we use nuclear weapons to defend Warsaw, do you think anybody in our respective constituency is going to say, yes, let's use them to defend Turkey, Ankara? 
I respectfully suggest that we can use rhetorical devices to make a point, but that they are able to be used in more than one instance. Maybe you are not going to get a consensus to use the requirement, the nuclear protection in NATO, the consultation provision where we are required to go to the mutual defense, I believe article V--and we always used to hear, when the Soviet Union existed, how many Americans are prepared to trade Bonn for Washington, Bonn for New York City. Well, now to say how many people will be prepared to defend Warsaw, I suggest you might get more people to say they are prepared to defend Warsaw than they are prepared to defend Ankara or Oslo. That is my guess, because there are a heck of a lot more Polish Americans than there are Turkish Americans. I don't think it is a useful, in terms of what our national policy should be, particularly useful point to make because it could be made about every capital in Europe, I suspect, if it were put to the American people today. 
But the real question to be put to the American people is--I think they answer affirmatively on it--is peace and stability in Europe in our national interest, 
and it is one of those things that we either pay now or pay later, because Americans have good memories. They understand that every time chaos has reigned in Europe, we have been dragged in this century. And so I suggest further that to denigrate the forces of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, who were equally, or better situated than Spain and Portugal were when they came in, in terms of forces, or to suggest the only way to defend Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic is nuclear weapons is simply militarily not accurate. And so I think what we are really debating here--and I will say it again--and I don't think people really want to speak to it directly--and what this is really about is whether we should have NATO, period--not whether we should expand it, but whether we should have it now. Because if a test as to whether or not we are going to admit Poland is whether or not we are going to use nuclear weapons--and it is not an option because there is no serious problem about conventional forces overrunning Poland today--none--you could scramble enough jets, bombers, fighters out of Germany to get to the Polish border without having to have them in Poland at all, to withstand any reasonable conventional capability that is available to the Russians or anyone else right now. But the question is: Would we defend Warsaw? If we don't believe that resoundingly the American people would say that, then we should not let Poland in. 
I think really what you are saying is that you have to ask the honest question to the folks in Salem, New Jersey, across the river from Delaware, and up in Trenton, and further up in Newark: Are you willing to go to war to save Oslo? I would be willing to make my friend a bet, and let my vote depend on it, that if he got more people to say, yes, we are willing to go to war to defend Oslo, then I will vote against admitting Poland. But my guess is, if you ask any capital in any city in any European country--say possibly London--are you willing to go to war to defend Oslo, I am not sure you would get much of a different answer, no matter where you asked. So if that is the question--and the Presiding Officer knows this issue well--aren't we really asking: Do we want NATO, period? If that is the case, why doesn't someone introduce an amendment, straight up, and stop all this foolishness--I take that back. I withdraw that statement. I don't mean that. Stop all the tangential attacks on expansion and get right to what this is about--introduce an amendment saying that we no longer need NATO. We can save a lot of money. We spend well over $120 billion a year on the deal--nothing to do with expansion. 
I yield the floor.

Let me ask you, do you think this is a relevant question, a threshold question? Would the American people defend Warsaw?

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will make a geographic point. The Polish border, I am guessing, is about 200 miles from the Russian border, if you do not count Kaliningrad where there are not Russian divisions, et cetera. If you were to take a look--my friend says that if in fact this threat, any threat, to Poland from Russia, a NATO commitment to defend would not be credible because of three American divisions. The fact of the matter is Poland is on the Russian border. From the Russian border to the far border of Poland to Belarus is essentially the same distance from the main body of Russia to Poland. The number of American NATO and other divisions that sit in Germany are by a factor of 25 more credible than any force Russia now or in the near term could use to threaten Poland. So the idea we do not have the physical capability, which I understand is the point being made, the physical capability of defending Poland once the pledge is made is in fact, I think, inaccurate. 
I yield the floor. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, those wishing to speak in opposition to the amendment, that I have 
been told of, who have not yet spoken, two of them, who are here, are the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Virginia, Senator Robb, with the possibility of the Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, and the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, all of whom are against the amendment, I believe all of whom wish to speak against the amendment, two of whom are here. And since I have very limited time left, the two who are here I am very happy to give 5 minutes to, and those who show up next I will give 5 minutes, and then I am out of time. It is my full intention to yield to the Senator from Michigan to speak in opposition.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to point out, with regard to the military credibility of NATO raised by my friend from New Jersey, in terms of protecting Poland, I remind him, West Berlin was militarily indefensible but the Warsaw Pact never attacked. Why? Because the Soviet Union knew what would happen. 
The third point I would make is with regard to the 3-year pause. 
The clearest reason this amendment is superfluous is in the Resolution of Ratification itself, Section Two, Paragraph Seven. There it clearly states that the U.S. has not consented to invite any state other than the three before us today, and that many subsequent decision to do so would rest on that state's ability to fulfill the obligations of membership, as well as serve the overall political and strategic interests of NATO and the U.S. 
Further, Article X of the North Atlantic Treaty declares, and as the July 1997 Madrid NATO Summit Declaration repeats, that the door to NATO membership is open to other European states able to further principles of the treaty and to contribute the security of the North Atlantic area. Each applicant country will be judged on its merits. 
Moreover, in the Resolution of Ratification before us, Section 2, Paragraph 7(A)(iv) requires prior consultation of the Senate by the President before the United States can support the invitation of any new member, and recalls that ratification of any new NATO ally requires the advice and consent of this body. 
To mandate a pause would tie NATO's hands should an obviously qualified applicant such as Austria applies for membership. For the moment, it appears that the Austrian government has decided against applying for membership, but that could change after elections next year. 
In fact, Austrian public opinion is already changing. Earlier this month when the Austrian public was informed of NATO's Article 5 guarantees, for the first time in a national poll a majority of Austrians said that Austria should abandon its neutrality and join NATO. 
So if the Austrian government decides to follow public opinion, would we then want to tell the Austrians, `Sorry, no applications accepted until the year 2002'? 
As you know, many, including myself, believe that Solvenia already meets the criteria for NATO membership. I supported its entry in this first wave. There is every indication that Slovenia will be ready to join the Alliance within the next three years. 
To mandate a pause would take the urgency off the reform efforts that nations such as Bulgaria and Romania have stepped up, at great short-term cost to their standard of living, precisely because they want to make themselves NATO-qualified for the next wave. 
Even Slovakia, a long-shot applicant because of its poor record on democratization and privatization, may have a dramatic turn-around as a result of national elections this fall. 
Such a decision would make NATO look like it can't be trusted to judiciously apply its own criteria; namely, that it cannot tell when and whom to invite to become new allies. This is no policy for a great nation like the United States or a great alliance like NATO. 
Secretary of State Albright told the Foreign Relations Committee on February 24 that just the possibility of joining NATO has inspired declared applicants to accelerate reform, to reach out to their neighbors, and to reject the destructive nationalism of their region's past. 
As one of many examples of this, Latvia, Lithuania, and Belarus signed in March a border agreement paving the way for a final demarcation of the 500-kilometer Baltic-Belarusian frontier. 
Given these accomplishments, Secretary Albright warned: 
A mandated pause would be heard from Tallinn to in the north to Sofia in the south as the sound of an open door slamming shut. It would be seen as a vote of no confidence in the reform-minded governments from the Baltics to the Balkans. It would diminish the incentive nations now have to cooperate with their neighbors and with NATO. It would fracture the consensus NATO itself has reached on the open door. It would be dangerous and utterly unnecessary since the Senate would, in any case, have to approve the admission of any new allies. 
There are many foreign policy experts who share these views. But let me quote one concerned American who urged me to oppose this amendment. 
David Harris, Executive Director of the American Jewish Committee, wrote to me on March third, stating:  
Last June 26, we [the American Jewish Committee] observed that an enlarged NATO will mean greater security and stability and also hasten the political and economic integration of Europe. An expanded NATO means greater stability and security for Central Europe, a region that was the cockpit for the two world wars that brought such horror to the world--and to the Jewish people. 
For many of the same reasons we supported NATO expansion we now oppose any effort to mandate a pause in initiating procedures for a second round of its enlargement. 
States throughout Central Europe that hope for eventual membership would feel that the open door enunciated at Madrid had been slammed shut in their face. 
At a minimum these states would be discouraged, and a pause might lead to instability in the region. Hardliners in the Russian Federation would find vindication. 
Supporters of this amendment appear to believe that they are stopping a runaway train of immediate NATO membership for every state from Croatia to Kazakhstan. 
They seem to be unaware that not every European state has declared an intent to join NATO. In particular, Ukraine, at its March 26 meeting with NATO officials, restated its view that while it `does not rule out' joining the alliance, such a move is currently unrealistic. 
Ukraine issued three conditions for joining NATO: (1) decisive public opinion in favor of accession; (2) interoperability of its armed forces with those of NATO members; and (3) a guarantee that its accession would not harm relations with neighboring states, particularly Russia. 
Recognizing that we already have all the control we need over the speed and choice of future NATO members, I urge my colleagues to vote down this amendment.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there is absolutely no evidence today that expanding NATO to include Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary would do anything to exacerbate the problem we all are concerned about--the proliferation of nuclear capability. 
The truth is, notwithstanding the knowledge on the part of Russia that we are going to expand, they continue to destroy their nuclear weapons under the Nunn-Lugar agreement, they have endorsed and have ratified the CWC agreement, and they have committed to take up the START II agreement. Nothing we have done relative to expansion has any negative impact on the continued cooperation between the United States and Russia to deal with the threat of nuclear warfare. 
I respectfully suggest that to vote for this amendment turns over the future of what we think the defense architecture of Europe should be to an organization of which we are not a part, and that is the EU. It says that no one can join NATO unless they are first a member of the EU. Why would we turn our fate over to an organization of which we are not a member? I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, several points. One, this is superfluous. In the actual resolution of ratification, we make it clear in paragraph 7 it requires prior consultation by the President before the United States can support even the invitation of any new member, No. 1. No. 2, we have the advise-and-consent requirement. They have to come here and get our votes to begin with. No. 3, this has nothing to do with cost, nothing to do with cost. It doesn't mention cost at all. No. 4, to say now there is an artificial pause is going to put on hold all those actions taking place in other countries to meet the criteria from border disputes to ethnic disputes that exist within those countries that would be necessary to be solved before they could be invited. It is absolutely superfluous, and I would argue it is dangerous in that it will send a signal that there is an artificial pause that really means no one else will be considered. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against it. It is totally unnecessary.

<TEXT>
Mr. BIDEN. I thank the chairman of the committee for yielding to me. 
And I say to my friend, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I doubt whether, with the exception of two or three other people in this body, there are as many people who know about the defense budget as my friend does. And I want to say at the outset, what I am about to say is--I say this with all sincerity--I am a little bit confused about the two amendments. 
Let me be very specific. The first amendment--I should get the numbers correct of the amendments. Amendment No: I think it is 2066--that is the amendment that speaks to two things, one, a sense of the Senate regarding the common-funded budget or put another way--and I agree with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee that it is--we are instructing the President to negotiate down the percent that we, the United States, contribute to the common budgets of NATO. I think that is appropriate. I think that is necessary. 
In 1950, the percent of the common budget that the United States paid was roughly 50 percent. And in the only renegotiation that took place, that was cut in half and went down to approximately 25 percent. The Senator knows better than I do, there are three common budgets. They are slightly different in terms of percentages, but essentially it is 25 percent. And it should be lower, in my view. I thank him for making it a sense of the Senate rather than a condition to passage of the treaty. 
The second part of that amendment states--and I have a little difficulty with it, but I am prepared to accept it on our side--it says--and I quote on page 2, line 19: 
Annual Limitation On United States Expenditures For NATO. Unless specifically authorized by law, the total amount of expenditures by the United States in any fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1998, for payments to the common-funded budgets of NATO shall not exceed the total of all such payments made by the United States in fiscal year 1998. 
Now, that means, as I understand it, because a lot of our colleagues who do not spend as much time on these issues because of 
their committee assignments as the Senator from Alaska, the Senator from North Carolina, the Senator from Delaware--we are on committees that have these responsibilities--are somewhat confused, as I am, when we start talking about HCFA and a whole range of issues relating to the Department of Health and Human Services. 
The common budget of NATO are all those expenditures which all 16 NATO members have to pitch in to pay for. Now, above the common budget, we have in the past, and we will continue in the future, I expect, expend dollars on--military dollars, State Department dollars, Defense Department dollars--on NATO member countries that are not part of a common budget. 
For example, as the Senator knows better than I do, we have come up with subsidized sales of weapons systems to Greece or to Turkey. We have done the same in terms of cascading down weapons we are no longer using to other NATO countries. They do not fall within the common budget; they are expenditures of American taxpayer dollars on European countries that are members of NATO. 
The way this amendment I am referring to would work, as I understand it, if in the year 1998 the United States of America spent $10--I am going to make this easy for me--$10 contributing to the common budget of NATO, that is, it represents 25 percent of all the expenditures, and all of NATO spent $40 on the common budget, we spent $10, in the year 1999 or 2000, we would be limited to spending $10 toward the common budget even if the total common budget went up to $110 because we would only be able to spend $10, which would represent a lower percentage than our 25 percent unless the authorizing committees in question specifically authorized the additional expenditures. 
Is that correct?

<DOCNO>105-biden-de-56-19980430</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. BIDEN. I think it is unnecessary, but I have no objection to that amendment. 
Now, the second amendment, the number of which I am not going to even try to guess, because I will mess it up, but the second amendment is more direct--not more direct--is shorter and straightforward. It says--do I have a copy of it here? It says: 
Requirement of payment out of funds specifically authorized. No cost incurred by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in connection with the admission to membership, or participation, in NATO of any country that was not a member of NATO as of March 1, 1998, may be paid out of funds available to any department, agency, or other entity of the United States unless the funds are specifically authorized. * * * 
Now, the phrase `no cost incurred by NATO' by definition, as I understand it, means only one thing, the common budget--the common budget. 
Now, if the chairman is concerned that we are going to, out of U.S. taxpayers' dollars, spend money on a new NATO admittee, Poland, let us say, that is not part of the common budget by saying, `You know, NATO has agreed we're going to extend a runway in Warsaw' or wherever we are going to do it. 
That is a common budget requirement. NATO must pay for that. It is not the national defense budget of Poland that pays for that. Since all of NATO is going to use it, we all are going to pay for it. 
On the other hand, if you want to buy F-15 aircraft, we, the United States, will sell them to you under a Foreign Military Sales Act which is subsidized. We will be taking taxpayers' dollars, subsidizing the Polish military, if we sell them under the Foreign Military Sales Act. That is not out of the common budget. 
Now, if what the chairman is trying to capture is those kinds of expenditures that exceed the common budget, I understand that, and I will support that, requiring a specific authorization. But if he is talking about any common budget expenditures by NATO, I see no distinction, by requiring a specific common budget expenditure that falls under the $10 ceiling, because we will be limited by the first amendment to spending no more than $10 the next year. 
If, in fact, we require no specific authorization to extend the runway in Germany, and if it is a common budget investment and a NATO investment to extend a runway on German land for a NATO facility, and we don't have to have a specific authorization to do that as long as it doesn't exceed the cap of $10 total spending, then I don't understand why we would have to have a specific authorization to do the same exact thing with an equal member of NATO--assuming Poland is admitted--in Poland. It is not doing anything other than meeting a NATO obligation we will have had to sign on to. 
Secondly, if I am right--and I may not be, because I may not understand the second amendment--when I read the phrase, `No cost incurred by NATO in connection with admission of new members'----

Secondly, I must tell him, as a former chairman of an authorizing committee and now a ranking member of an authorizing committee, I am heartened and my soul is soaring to hear a chairman of the Appropriations Committee say, `First get an authorization.'

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have been here 25 years. The chairman of the full committee knows that there may have been, and there are people who have been, more effective people in pursuing arms control than the Senator from Delaware but none more consistently and more fervently than the Senator from Delaware. 
This is not the place for this amendment. This is a treaty. This is a treaty. It is a treaty about expanding NATO. One of our colleagues on the Republican side, I was told earlier, had an amendment on the Kyoto environmental treaty saying we could not--I am told; I did not see it; but I am told he had been talked out of it, I believe--that we could not expand NATO unless Kyoto was dealt with. 
Another one has an amendment that may come up here tonight dealing with--I believe, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, at least he was talking about an amendment relating to a position I know the chairman shares, which I do not share, relating to strategic defense initiatives. This is not the place for that. 
Secondly, I find it absolutely fascinating that some of the very Senators who have come to the floor and said, look, what we want to do here is we want to slow down passage, stop passage, or slow down new members coming in, because we are fearful it is going to offend the Russians or the Russians are going to get upset--a legitimate concern. But then they come along and say, and by the way, before--before--we can deposit these instruments, the Russians have to agree to cut their tactical nuclear weapons, or whatever. 
Now, that is giving to Russia a veto power over expansion in NATO.

Mr. President, maybe the Senator can help me out. It says, `Prior to the deposit of the instruments of ratification, the Administration shall certify to the Senate that with regard to [the following],' and it lists the following nonstrategic nuclear weapons, that `it is the policy of the United States . . . that discussions toward these ends have been initiated with the Russian Federation.' 
All the Russian Federation can say is, `I'm not going to discuss this with you,' done, period, over; they have vetoed it. Look, if I am sitting in the Russian Duma, I am going to--and we are all worried about these reactionary nationalists who are the browns and the reds undercutting Yeltsin--I have got a real easy one. I go to Yeltsin and say, I tell you what, you've indicated to us you don't want to expand NATO but there is nothing you can do to stop it. I've got the way to stop it right now. When the President picks up the phone and calls you and says, `By the way, I want to initiate discussions relative to tactical nuclear weapons,' tell him, `No. No.' 
Guess what? By definition, no expansion of NATO, because the President cannot deposit these instruments until--until--he can certify to the U.S. Senate that discussions with the Russian Federation have been initiated. 
Now, call me paranoid, if you would like, but I know what I would do. I am a pretty good politician. The Senator from North Dakota is even a better politician. We are all politicians in here. They are not any different in the Duma. They are no different in the Russian Federation. So I have a real easy one. And by the way, if they had not figured it out, I just told them.

So you mean the President can say, when we pass this, `You know, Bingaman and Conrad are good guys, they're my buddies and allies, but I'm not going to pay attention to them; I'm not going to certify anything'? Can he just say, `I'm not going to certify it'?

Mr. BIDEN. I have great respect for the Senator from New Mexico. Much of what he says makes sense, but basically what is happening here is we are having a rerun of the Warner amendment. We are basically saying here that before any new members can come in, what has to happen is there has to be a new strategic concept agreed to. 
Now, if I can make an analogy, that would be like saying my friend from Utah, the Presiding Officer, or of my friend from New Mexico, I am not certain what year their States came into the Union. The only claim to fame Delaware has is we are the very first State in the Union. I shouldn't say the only claim, one of the most notable claims. It would have been a little bit like Delaware, in the Thirteen Original Colonies, and the other States east of the Mississippi saying to you all out West, as long as the constitutional amendment for suffrage is under consideration to amend our document that controls our national affairs, no new States can come into the Union. 
Nobody is allowed in. As long as we are reconsidering--again, I don't know the years, and I apologize, when your States came into the Union. But as long as we are considering the 17th amendment, whether or not Senators are popularly elected, we are going to put on hold any new State becoming a member of the Union. 
The 1991--and I don't have it with me--strategic concept was drafted by and agreed to by the 16-member nations after the Berlin Wall came down and after the Soviet Union had disintegrated. The reason I bother to point that out, Mr. President, as my friend from New Hampshire kept saying yesterday--and appropriately--we have to look at the realities of the new world. This new strategic document took into consideration a new reality that there was no Soviet Union, there was no Warsaw Pact, there was a different world. 
Now, what we said with the leadership of Senator Kyl of Arizona yesterday, by a vote of 90-9, was the following. We said any new strategic concept that is to be agreed to in the future should accommodate the basic fundamental principles that we have adhered to thus far in NATO; and the Senator, with great skill, laid them out in specific form for all of us to see, incorporating the strategic notions that have underpinned NATO and the new reality. 
So even though there is a consideration at the moment in NATO for an updated strategic concept, that could happen in a week, a year, a month, 5 years, or it could never be agreed to. And by an overwhelming vote in the Senate, 90 percent of us said, Mr. President, before you can agree to any new strategic concept, you have to make sure that what we have laid out here as the fundamental principles to guide that are incorporated in that concept. So I fully appreciate and believe that the Senator from New Mexico is concerned about strategic doctrine and is not using this amendment as a killer amendment to accomplish what Senator Warner was unable to accomplish--that is, a de facto slowdown of any new admissions, an arbitrary judgment made that, without a new doctrine being consummated and another little blue and white book being published, no one can come in. 
I further point out that the strategic concept of NATO is always under review, formally as well as informally. I assume the Senator's amendment speaks only to the formal review, the formal reconsideration of what that concept should be. Since 1991, NATO has changed internally with the creation of bodies such as the Partnership for Peace, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, NATO-Russian Founding Act, NATO Ukraine Commission, and a more distinct role for the European pillar of this operation has emerged. The European politico-military situation has also changed. There has been significant reduction in the conventional armed forces. Both Warsaw and the Soviet Union are dissolved. NATO subsequently decided, via the ministerial and summit statements, to invite new members. We are doing all these things that we are concerned about already. We sent out a glidepath and a guide book to the administration as to how they must proceed with the next one, and to say until that is all done, no new members, is another way of trying to do in a 15-minute debate what my friend from Virginia and the Senator from Oregon and myself debated against for days. 
So I respectfully suggest that our friend from Arizona has accommodated any concern about strategic doctrine with the amendment we overwhelmingly adopted, thereby clearing the way, and any justification for suggesting that the doctrine might change so radically that it might affect who we would be willing to bring in. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will ask my friend a question on my time. What is the relevance of whether or not there is a new strategic concept as it relates to whether or not Austria is a new member of NATO? Are you suggesting that if the 16 NATO members now agree--or 19 when we finish tonight--to a change in the strategic concept, that change might or might not influence whether we should let Austria in if they meet all other criteria?

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's answer. The relevance is lost on me as to how that would affect who we would bring in or not. I understand the value of the strategic concept and why it is important that we should know it. These folks have already applied. 
Let me point out one last thing. The Bingaman amendment would give sort of a pocket veto to further enlargement of certain countries. 
The French did not want the Slovenians in this time. But they didn't want to publicly say that they didn't want the Slovenians this time. This is my interpretation. And they said no Slovenians unless Romanians, because it is not very politic in Europe to say you don't want someone in directly. If I were the French or Germans or anyone else, I just don't agree to the new strategic concept. The present one works pretty well--en bloc membership. 
I just think, Mr. President, this causal relationship being asserted between the strategic concept and new membership is tenuous. In changing the strategic concept, which we know has to follow the guide path of our friend from Arizona, we already know what it must contain for us to sign on to it. I just think it is totally unnecessary. 
If the Senator is willing, and with the permission of the chairman, I am willing to yield back our time if there is any left, and move on, if my friend from New Mexico is willing to yield back his time.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, for months and weeks and days, we have listened to the intellectual exchange, the foreign policy considerations, the financial impact and what effect what we are about to do will have on bilateral-multilateral relations of the United States with other nations. That gave a context for this debate. 
My friend from Maryland showed us the soul of this debate. I am proud to have been on the floor to hear her at this moment make the statement she made. Not only is it historically accurate, but it reflects the wave of emotion that tens of millions of Americans of Polish descent are feeling at this moment. 
I would like to say something that is going to make her very angry. I would like our colleagues to consider that when we get to 67--we are going to cast our votes from our seat; I don't know if it is possible; it has never been done before--I think she should have the honor of casting the 67th vote for this treaty. I don't know mechanically how to do that. But you have no idea how much this means to her. You have no idea how much this means to millions of people like my colleague from Maryland. 
I don't know how to work this out, but I am going to try, with the Democratic and Republican staff, to figure out whether there is a way we can officially record that my friend from Maryland was the 67th vote cast to take care of a historic inequity that her grandmother brought as a burden to this country and she as a Senator will help end.

On behalf of Senator Stevens, I ask that a modification to amendment No. 2065 be sent to the desk.

I want to state my understanding about this amendment before we adopt it, which I have also cleared with the Senator from Alaska. 
First, this amendment does not affect the Partnership for Peace Program. 
Second, I understand this to mean that NATO cannot incur NATO expansion costs 
for which the United States would be obligated to pay except through NATO's common-funded budgets unless specifically authorized by law. And with those understandings, the amendment, as modified, is perfectly acceptable to me.

This is a means by which to artificially delay any new decision relative to new entrants. We already have the strategic concept that contemplated and reflected the changes that took place in 1991. You all voted 90 to 6 last night on the amendment of the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, laying out in detail what must be taken into consideration by the United States of America to sign on any new strategic concept. This is, in fact, not necessary. It is not needed, and it is an unnecessary delay.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will not take the time of the Senate to respond to all the Senator said. We have rehashed a lot of those things. I will just note that a 59-41 vote--I have been here a long time and I never thought that was a close vote. But let me say with regard to only one point, because a lot is not rehashed and lacking consequence, but we have debated it a lot. One point was raised that is new, and I thought it would be raised by someone. 
The Senator from Iowa has just repeated the oft-heard assertion that the United States promised Gorbachev during negotiations on German unification that we would not expand NATO. 
This is an important assertion. It is also historically incorrect. 
Since opponents of NATO enlargement have taken to repeating this assertion as if it were true--most recently in a full-page advertisement in the New York Times, which contained other striking factual errors--I think it is imperative to set the record straight. 
Both Robert Zoellick, a senior State Department and later White House official in the Bush Administration who drafted the famous `Two-Plus-Four' Agreement with the Russians in 1990, Eduard Shevardnadze, the current President of Georgia who was then Soviet Foreign Minister, have both made clear the no such promise was ever made. 
There is nothing in the `Two-Plus-Four' Agreement about NATO expansion. 
There is no secret addendum to the `Two-Plus-Four' Agreement. 
U.S. Secretary of State James Baker did make a comment `not one step further east,' which has been intentionally or unintentionally misinterpreted as having precluded NATO enlargement. 
In actuality, according to Mr. Zoellick, the drafter of the agreement, this remark was related to what would be the status of U.S. forces if a united Germany were part of NATO. That is, there would be no permanent stationing of American troops east of Germany, a position which did become official NATO policy as enunciated by the well-known statement of the North Atlantic Council on March 14, 1997: 
In the current and foreseeable security environment, the alliance will carry out its collective defense and other missions by ensuring the necessary interoperability, integration and capability for reinforcement rather than by additional permanent stationing of substantial combat forces. 
In fact, with possible NATO enlargement in mind, Zoellick made sure that the `Two-Plus-Four' Agreement did not foreclose the possibility of forces transiting Germany to reinforce Poland. 
The September 12, 1990 Treaty precluded stationing NATO-integrated German forces on the territory of the former German Democratic Republic (i.e. East Germany) until after the withdrawal of Soviet forces. These agreements explicitly did not apply to the rest of Europe. 
Any agreement on the future security arrangements of other European countries would have been inappropriate, since such countries were not part of the talks. 
Mr. President, lest anyone believe that this is one-sided American historical analysis, I would like to quote from an article in The Reuter European Community Report of February 13, 1997 entitled `West Made No Pledge to Moscow, NATO Told': 
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze told NATO this week that the West did not offer Moscow any guarantees about the alliance's future during talks over German unification in 1990... 
...Shevardnadze's comments, made to NATO Secretary General Javier Solana during a meeting in Tbilisi on Wednesday, contradict Russian claims that NATO's enlargement plans represent broken promises by the West. 
Shevardnadze, who was Soviet foreign minister when Moscow cut the deal in 1990 with Western powers opening the way for unification, told Solana that the talks only concerned Germany... 
President Shevardnadze told the secretary general that during those two-plus-four-talks, no guarantees had been given concerning NATO enlargement... 
Mr. President, the striking fact that the chief negotiators of German unification on both the Soviet and the American side have made categorical denials that any assurances were given about NATO enlargement should lay this specious claim to rest.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Senator from New York has asserted several times that NATO's enlargement to include Poland would for the first time bring NATO up to Russia's borders. This is because Poland shares a small border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. 
As I mentioned in our floor debate last month, the Senator's assertion is factually incorrect. Ever since the founding of NATO in 1949, Russia--first as the Russian Republic in the Soviet Union, then since 1991 as the Russian Federation--has shared a border with Norway, a charter member of NATO. 
Norway's relations with Russia have remained excellent throughout. In fact, Norway gives Russia foreign aid, as do many other NATO members, the United States included. 
The Senator from New York responded by minimizing both the size and importance of the Russian-Norwegian border. Here again, he was incorrect. 
First, in regard to length, the Russian-Norwegian border is nearly as long as Poland's border with the Kaliningrad exclave--104 miles versus 128 miles, to be exact. 
Second, militarily speaking the Russian-Norwegian border is much more important than the Polish-Kaliningrad border. Norway abuts Russia's Kola Peninsula, one of the most heavily militarized regions on earth. Among the Kola Peninsula's armaments are nuclear weapons. 
In spite of the strategically sensitive nature of the NATO-Russian border, for nearly half-a-century relations have remained very good. 
One might ask why. Aside from the tact and diplomacy of the Norwegians, another reason may be that NATO has not permanently stationed in Norway troops from other Alliance countries. 
Mr. President, this is precisely what NATO declared on March 14, 1997 as the Alliance's policy for the prospective new members. So let's dispose of this bogey-man: Russia will not have to worry about large numbers of permanently stationed non-Polish NATO troops facing Kaliningrad. 
I would like to return to geography for a few minutes, since the Senator from New York and the Senator from Virginia have brought this topic up several times. 
I think that they would agree that in the bad, old Soviet Union the non-Russian Republics were wholly-owned subsidiaries of Moscow. Ethnic Russians who took their orders directly from the Kremlin filled the key positions in the Republics' political, economic, and military structures. 
In that context, it is important to note that since Turkey entered NATO in 1952, the Alliance had a common border with Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia--at that time Russian-ruled parts of the old Soviet Union. 
For the record, that border was considerably longer than either the Russian-Norwegian or the Polish-Kaliningrad borders--328 miles long, to be exact. 
So for nearly forty years, NATO had a lengthy border with the strategically vital southwestern flank of the Russian-ruled Soviet Union. 
In fact, Mr. President, even today there are Russian troops stationed in the independent states of Armenia and Georgia. 
So, once again, let's finally put to rest the nonsensical argument that Poland's joining NATO would constitute a new geographic move by NATO up to Russia's borders. It just isn't true.

I believe that this is a matter that merits careful consideration within NATO councils. It would certainly be preferable for NATO to discuss this in a careful and measured way now, rather than to be faced with the issue at some future time when an emergency situation exists. I want to commend the Senator from Michigan for raising this matter. I also commend him for not seeking to amend the resolution of ratification, for, as he has correctly noted, this issue is not related to Poland, Hungary or the Czech Republic.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there is no more complex issue than the financial cost of NATO enlargement. 
Over the past two years there have been several studies by private and by governmental organizations, which have yielded widely differing estimates. 
The highest figure reached one hundred twenty-five billion dollars over ten years, with over thirty billion of that accruing to the United States. The most recent--and I believe the best--estimate is NATO's own cost study, which estimates only one-and-a-half billion dollars in direct costs over ten years. According to the latest estimate, the expected U.S. contribution to the direct costs of enlargement are estimated to average forty million dollars per year for ten years. 
There are good reasons for the vast disparities in the estimates--basically there was a lot of `apples and oranges' mixing going on. 
Explaining all this requires a fair amount of effort, which, I regret, some of the critics of enlargement either were unwilling to give, or which they eschewed for the easier route of utilizing unexplained, raw data for partisan purposes. 
Mr. President, at this time I would like to examine the cost issue. 
The 16 NATO nations collectively spent about $455 billion on defense in 1997. Of that total approximately $1.6 billion goes to the NATO common budget. 
What does the NATO common budget pay for? Let's take the airbase at Aviano, Italy, as an example. 
The host country, Italy, maintains an airbase that has been designated for NATO use. Italy pays for all costs related to the base except new construction and improvements that benefit the United States Air Force units stationed there. These improvements, above and beyond the national needs of Italy, comprising some $260 million, are paid for by NATO's common budget. 
One of NATO's founding principles was (and remains) equitable cost sharing--that is, nations make financial contributions to offset costs based on their ability to pay. 
In the 1950's, the U.S. paid almost 50% of NATO's operating costs. In the 1960's, however, our European allies assumed about half of the original U.S. contribution in recognition of our worldwide security commitments. 
Since then, our overall national contribution to NATO's three common budgets has been reduced to about one-quarter. Our allies account for the other three quarters of NATO operating costs. 
We participate in NATO at a reduced rate, but we receive security benefits that far outweigh our financial contributions. 
Let's take a closer look at where our annual contributions to NATO's budget go. 
NATO has three budgets, each supporting a distinct aspect of NATO operations. 
NATO's Civil Budget pays for the operating costs of NATO's modest, 1960's-vintage headquarters building plus associated staff in Brussels. 
Additionally, there are numerous public information, political, and scientific activity programs supported by this budget, including civilian elements of NATO-sponsored Partnership for Peace activities. 
The annual U.S. contribution is provided by the State Department. 
NATO's Military Budget provides support for NATO's military headquarter (SHAPE) in Mons, Belgium, and other elements of the integrated command structure. 
This budget also supports operations of several key NATO military agencies, like the NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency, the NATO C3 Agency, for example, and the costs of running the NATO AWACS fleet. 
Annual contributions are paid from Department of Defense Operations and Maintenance funds. 
NATO's Security Investment Program pays for construction of the facilities and installations NATO uses to support alliance military activities, such as command structure C3 support, force mobility projects, and training facilities--in other words, infrastructure. 
It is also used to support common-user procurements to meet priority military requirements set by SACEUR and SACLANT, like integrated air defense and interoperable communications systems. 
U.S. contributions to this budget are obtained from Department of Defense Military Construction funds. 
As I said, the U.S. pays approximately one-quarter of the overall NATO common budget. 
If there were no enlargement in 1999, we would still expect to pay about $458 million. 
Now let's turn to the costs of enlargement. NATO has estimated that over 10 years, the cost to the NATO common-funded budgets will be about $1.5 billion. 
While the amount may not be distributed evenly over 10 years, let's accept for the sake of discussion that it will. 
This means that the U.S. quarter-share will be about $400 million over 10 years, or about $40 million a year. 
This represents only a 9% increase in our total contribution to the NATO common-funded budgets. 
Bearing in mind that the U.S. share of NATO's common-funded budgets represents only one-tenth of one percent of the current defense budget, I believe that enlargement expenditures are a pretty good deal. 
The key questions for us should be: Is the $1.5 billion figure accurate? What is the U.S. share? and Is the U.S. share a fair share? 
Anyone who has looked at this issue would, I believe, agree that it is extremely confusing. 
There are lots of numbers out there on enlargement costs in addition to the $1.5 billion. 
You will recall that the Administration told us in February 1997 that the total cost of enlargement would be about $27 to 35 billion. 
Let's look at those numbers. 
First, as the General Accounting Office (GAO) has pointed out, the Administration's estimate included two categories of costs that are not direct enlargement costs. 
The first was costs to current NATO members--$8 to 10 billion. These are the national costs the current allies needed to spend to meet their commitments under the revised 1991 Strategic Concept to improve their mobility, reinforcement, and power projection capabilities. 
They would incur these costs even if NATO did not enlarge. 
That's why GAO said the Administration made a mistake in including them in the February 1997 estimate.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. A century ago, our predecessors in the U.S. Senate took a very bold step in ratifying the North Atlantic Treaty. 
It is easy for us today to forget what a break with the past that vote represented. For the first time, this country committed itself, in peacetime, to the defense of democratic Europe. The Senate recognized by its far-sighted action that our future--indeed our own freedom--is inextricably bound to Europe. 
The success of the fledgling NATO was by no means certain. Western Europe was made up of a jumble of nations, several of which had only recently been at each others' throats. Germany and France alone had fought each other three times in 74 years. The three western zones of Germany, which were not the Federal Republic and, in fact, were not invited to join NATO. 
The countries of Western Europe were economically weak, not yet having recovered nearly fully from the devastation of World War II. 
Several European NATO members had strong Communist parties whose loyalty and commitment to democracy were suspect. 
Mr. President, our predecessors took a gamble. Fortunately for us and our children--and I hope for our grandchildren--NATO succeeded beyond the Senate s fondest expectations. 
As we all know, for 40 years, it kept Soviet imperialism at bay, thereby providing the security umbrella under which democratic Western Europe could recover socially and economically, and thrive. 
In the process, NATO expanded its membership three times to welcome Greece and Turkey, West Germany, and Spain. With each expansion the Alliance was strengthened. 
Largely thanks to NATO's persistence, communism in most of Europe crumbled, including in the Soviet Union. 
Now, nearly 50 years after our predecessors met the challenge of their time, we are called upon, once again, to take up the torch. 
Three highly qualified democracies that chafed under the Communist yoke for four decades are now candidates for membership in NATO. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have already rejoined the West politically and socially. Tonight we can vote to readmit them to the West's security framework. 
In a larger sense we will be righting a historical injustice forced upon the Poles, Czechs, and Hungarians by Joseph Stalin. 
Mr. President, NATO enlargement is squarely in America's national interest. It is in Europe's interest. And yes--by stabilizing a historic crucible of violence in East-Central Europe--it is in Russia s interest. 
I am proud to be able to play a small part in this historic occasion. I will cast my vote with conviction to ratify the Resolution of Ratification, and I urge my colleagues to join me. I yield the floor.  
Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to take a brief moment to thank some of the incredibly qualified staff we have here. I don't know whether the public realizes, but some of the young, and in the case of some of my staff not so young, women and men are incredible assets to this country. There are more Rhodes scholars, Marshall scholars, Ph.D.s, professors, former professors, and incredibly talented people who sit here in these seats, not only on treaties, but on every major thing we do and advise us. 
On Chairman Helms' staff, as always, Admiral Bud Nance, a retired Admiral in the U.S. Navy, and close friend of the chairman's and a close advisor, did a terrific job in directing the entire staff and working closely with our staff, as did a man who was kind enough to stay with me, a man who is a significant and capable lawyer, as well as a staff director for the minority, Ed Hall. These two guys run that operation in a way, I say to the leader sitting here, that was almost like the bipartisan days, the old days, in large part because they get along so well and they trust each other so much. 
Bud Nance is a gentleman who has already given decades of service to his country in the U.S. Navy, and continues to serve the chairman in his role as staff director. 
Additionally, I thank Steve Biegun, Beth Wilson, and Alex Rodriguez, as well as Marshall Billingslea, of the majority staff, who did a first-rate job in pulling together our hearings last fall and in helping draft the resolution of ratification. 
On my staff, I will start with this man. I worry about these guys who have one doctorate, but this guy has two. He came to me from a distinguished career as a professor, as well as working in the Library of Congress, Dr. Mike Haltzel. He is the minority staff member for European affairs. He traveled with me throughout the European capitals and to Russia in preparation for the hearings, and he wrote the major portions of the remarks given and rebuttals during this debate. It was a pleasure to have him at my side. 
During this process, he has been ably assisted by Mark Tauber, a Pearson Fellow from the State Department; Ed Levine, the committee's arms control expert; and Erin Logan, a Javits Fellow who has honored the memory of our former colleague by her service to the committee. 
In addition, Marnie Davidson, Ursula McManus, Dawn Ratliff, Mike Schmidt, and Marc Mellinger provided considerable assistance behind the scenes. 
Finally, I thank my counsel on the committee, a young man who came to me out of Auburn, NY, 20 years ago to stay for a `few days' and stayed on, and while with me, he graduated from law school, clerked, and then came back and is the legal director for the committee, Brian McKeon.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the best time to target a new drug with uncompromising enforcement pressure is before abuse of that drug has overwhelmed our communities. 
That is why I introduced legislation last Congress to place tight federal controls on the date rape drug Rohpynol--also known as Roofies--which was becoming known as the Quaalude of the Nineties as its popularity spread throughout the United States. 
My bill would have shifted Rohpynol to schedule 1 of the Federal Controlled Substances Act. Rescheduling is important for three simple reasons: 
First, Federal re-scheduling triggers increases in State drug law penalties, and since we all know that more than 95 percent of all drug cases are prosecuted at the State level, not by the Federal Government, it is vitally important that we re-schedule. 
Second, Federal re-scheduling to schedule 1 triggers the toughest Federal penalties--up to a year in prison and at least a $1,000 fine for a first offense of simple possession. 
And, third, re-scheduling has proven to work. In 1984, I worked to reschedule Quaaludes, Congress passed the law, and the Quaalude epidemic was greatly reduced. And, in 1990, I worked to re-schedule steroids, Congress passed the law, and again a drug epidemic that had been on the rise was reversed. 
Despite evidence of a growing Rohpynol epidemic, some argued that my efforts to re-schedule the drug by legislation were premature. Accordingly, I agreed to hold off on legislative action and wait for a Drug Enforcement Administration decision on whether to schedule the drug through the lengthy and cumbersome administrative process. 
As I predicted, the DEA report on Rohpynol--handed down in November--correctly concludes that despite the rapid spread of Rohpynol throughout the country, DEA cannot re-schedule Rohpynol by rulemaking at this time. 
The report notes, however, that Congress is not bound by the bureaucratic re-scheduling process the DEA must follow. Congress can--and in my view should--pass legislation to reschedule Rohpynol. 
Specifically the report states: `This inability to reschedule [Rohpynol] administratively . . . does not affect Congress' ability to place [the drug] in schedule 1 through the legislative process'--as we did with Quaaludes in 1984 and Anabolic Steroids in 1990. 
Let me also note that the DEA report confirmed a number of facts about the extent of the Rohpynol problem: 
DEA found more than 4,000 documented cases--in 36 States--of sale or possession of the drug, which is not marketed in the United States and must be smuggled in. 
`In spite of DEA's inability to reschedule [Rohypnol] through administrative proceedings, DEA remains very concerned about the abuse' of the drug. 
`Middle and high school students have been known to use [Rohypnol] as an alternative to alcohol to achieve an intoxicated state during school hours. [The drug] is much more difficult to detect than alcohol, which produces a characteristic odor.' 
`DEA is extremely concerned about the use of [Rohypnol] in the commission of sexual assaults.' 
`The number of sexual assaults in which [Rohypnol] is used may be underreported'--because the drug's effects often cause rape victims to be unable to remember details of their assaults and because rape crisis centers, hospitals, and law enforcement have only recently become aware that Rohypnol can be used to facilitate sex crimes. 
Nonetheless, `DEA is aware of at least 5 individuals who have been convicted of rape in which the evidence suggests that [the Rohypnol drug] was used to incapacitate the victim.' `The actual number of sexual assault cases involving [the drug] is not known. It is difficult to obtain evidence that [the Rohypnol drug] was used in an assault.' 
I would also note that my efforts to re-schedule this drug have already had beneficial results: The manufacturer of Rohypnol recently announced that it had developed a new formula to minimize the potential for abuse of the drug in sexual assaults. 
This is an important step. But pills produced under the old Rohypnol formula are still in circulation, and pills made by other manufacturers can still be smuggled in. Furthermore, the new formula will not prevent kids from continuing to ingest this dangerous drug voluntarily for a cheap high. 
In short, stricter, Federal controls remain necessary; and DEA is powerless to respond to Rohypnol abuse until the problem gets even worse. 
Therefore, I am reintroducing my bill to re-schedule Rohypnol in schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act. I urge my colleagues to support this effort to take action against this dangerous drug now, rather than waiting for the problem to develop into an epidemic. 
My bill also places `Special K'--ketamine hydrochloride--a dangerous hallucinogen very similar to PCP, on schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. Despite Special K's rising popularity as a `club drug' of choice among kids, the drug is not even illegal in most States. This has crippled State authorities' ability to fight ketamine abuse. 
For example, in February 1997, two men accused of stealing ketamine from a Ville Platte, Louisiana veterinary clinic and cooking the drug into a powder could not be prosecuted under State drug control laws because ketamine is not listed as a Federal controlled substance. 
Similarly, a New Jersey youth recently found to be with possessing and distributing ketamine could be charged with only a disorderly persons offense. 
Prosecutors are trying to combat increased Ketamine use by seeking lengthy prison terms for possession of the drugs--like marijuana--that users mix with Ketamine, but if it is just Special K, there's nothing they can do about it. 
I am convinced that scheduling Ketamine will help our effort to fight the spread of this dangerous drug by triggering increases in State drug law penalties. 
Without Federal scheduling, many States will not be able to address the Ketamine problem until it is too late and Special K has already infiltrated their communities. 
Medical professionals who use Ketamine--including the American Veterinary Medical Association and the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists--support scheduling, having determined that it will accomplish our goal of `preventing the diversion and unauthorized use of Ketamine' while allowing `continued, responsible use' of the drug for legitimate purposes. [Letter from Mary Beth Leininger, D.V.M., President of the American Veterinary Medical Association] 
And the largest manufacturer of Ketamine has concluded that `moving the product to schedule III classification is in the best interest of the veterinary industry and the public.' [Letter from E. Thomas Corcoran, President of Fort Dodge Animal Health, a Division of American Home Products Corporation]. 
Scheduling Ketamine will give State authorities the tools they desperately need to fight its abuse by young people--and end the legal anomaly that leaves those who sell Ketamine to our children beyond the reach of the law--even when they are caught `red-handed'. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
In addition to raising controls on Rohypnol and Ketamine, the legislation I am introducing today would increase the ability of the Attorney General to respond to new drug emergencies in the future. 
Our Federal drug control laws currently allow the Attorney General limited authority to respond to certain new drugs on an emergency basis--by temporarily subjecting them the strictest Federal control while the extensive administrative procedure for permanent scheduling proceeds. 
But the Attorney General has not been able to use this authority to respond to the Rohypnol and Special K emergencies--because she does not have authority to--move drugs from one schedule to another, or to schedule drugs that the Food and Drug Administration has allowed companies to research but not to sell. 
This amendment would grant the administration this important authority by--authorizing the Attorney General to move a scheduled drug--like Rohypnol--to schedule I in an Emergency; by applying emergency rescheduling authority to `investigational new drugs'--like Special K--that the Food and Drug Administration has approved for research purposes only, but not for marketing. 
And by providing that a rescheduling drug remains on the temporary schedule until the administrative proceedings reach a final conclusion on whether to schedule. 
This legislation would give the Attorney General the necessary tools to respond quickly when evidence appears that a drug is being abused. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the New Medicines to Treat Addiction Act of 1998, legislation that builds upon my efforts in previous Congresses to promote research into and development of new medicines to treat the ravages of hard core drug addiction. 
Since the first call to arms against illegal drugs in 1989, we have learned just how insidious hardcore drug addiction is, even as the ravages of substance abuse--on both the addict and his victims--have become ever more apparent. The frustration in dealing with a seemingly intractable national problem is palpable, most noticeably in the heated rhetoric as politicians blame each other for the failure to find a cure. What gets lost underneath the noise is the recognition that we have not done everything we can to fight this problem and that, like all serious ills, we must take incremental steps one at a time, and refuse to be overwhelmed by the big picture. 
Throughout my tenure as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I called for a multifaceted strategy to combat drug abuse. One of the specific steps I advocated was the creation of incentives to encourage the private sector to develop medicines that treat addiction, an area where promising research has not led--as one would normally expect--to production of medicines. The bill I am introducing today, the New Medicines To Treat Addiction Act of 1998, will hopefully change that. It takes focused aim at one segment of the drug-abusing population--hardcore addicts, namely users of cocaine and heroin--in part because these addicts are so difficult to treat with traditional methods, and in part because this population commits such a large percentage of drug-related crime. 
In December, 1989, I commissioned a Judiciary Committee report, `Pharmacotherapy: A Strategy for the 1990's.' In that report, I posed the question, `If drug use is an epidemic, are we doing enough to find a medical `cure' for this disease?' The report gave the answer `No.' Unfortunately, almost a decade later, the answer remains the same. Developing new medicines for the treatment of addiction should be among our highest medical research priorities as a nation. Until we take this modest step, we cannot claim to have done everything reasonable to address the problem, and we should not become so frustrated that we effectively throw up our hands and do nothing. 
Recent medical advances have increased the possibility of developing medications to treat drug addiction. These advances include a heightened understanding of the physiological and psychological characteristics of drug addition and a greater base of neuroscientific research. 
One example of this promising research is the recent development of a compound that has been proven to immunize laboratory animals against the effects of cocaine. The compound works like a vaccine by stimulating the immune system to develop an antibody that blocks cocaine from entering the brain. Researchers funded through the National Institute of Drug Abuse believe that this advance may open a whole new avenue for combating addiction. 
Despite this progress, we still do not have a medication to treat cocaine addiction or drugs to treat many other forms of substance abuse, because the private sector is unsure of the wisdom of making the necessary investment in the production and marketing of such medicines. 
Private industry has not aggressively developed pharmacotherapies for a variety of reasons, including a small customer base, difficulties distributing medication to the target population, and fear of being associated with substance abusers. We need to create financial incentives to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop and market these treatments. And we need to develop a new partnership between private industry and the public sector in order to encourage the active marketing and distribution of new medicines so they are accessible to all addicts in need of treatment. 
While pharmacotherapies alone are not a `magic bullet' that will solve our national substance abuse problem, they have the potential to fill a gap in current treatment regimens. The disease of addiction occurs for many reasons, including a variety of personal problems which pharmacotherapy cannot address. Still, by providing a treatment regimen for drug abusers who are not helped by traditional methods, pharmacotherapy holds substantial 
promise for reducing the crime and health crisis that drug abuse is causing in the United States. 
The New Medicines to Treat Addiction Act would encourage and support the development of medicines to treat drug addiction in three ways. 
It reauthorizes and increases funding for the Medications Development Program at the National Institute of Health, which for years has been at the forefront of research into drug addiction. 
The bill also creates two new incentives for private sector companies to undertake the difficult but important task of developing medicines to treat addiction. 
First, the bill would provide additional patent protections for companies that develop drugs to treat substance abuse. Under the bill, pharmacotherapies could be designated `orphan drugs' and qualify for an exclusive seven-year patent to treat a specific addiction. These extraordinary patent rights would greatly enhance the market value of pharmacotherapies and provide a financial reward for companies that invest in the search to cure drug addiction. This provision was contained in a bill introduced by Senator Kennedy and me in 1990, but was never acted on by Congress. 
Second, the bill would establish a substantial monetary reward for companies that develop drugs to treat cocaine and heroin addiction but shift the responsibility for marketing and distributing such drugs to the government. This approach would create a financial incentive for drug companies to invest in research and development but enable them to avoid any stigma associated with distributing medicine to substance abusers. 
The bill would require the National Academy of Sciences to develop strict guidelines for evaluating whether a drug effectively treats cocaine or heroin addiction. If a drug meets these guidelines and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, then the government must purchase the patent rights for the drug from the company that developed it. The purchase price for the patent rights is established by law: $100 million for a drug to treat cocaine addiction and $50 million for a drug to treat heroin addiction. Once the government has purchased the patent rights, then it is responsible for producing the drug and distributing it to clinics, hospitals, state and local governments, and any other entities qualified to operate drug treatment programs. 
This joint public/private endeavor will correct the market inefficiencies that have thus far prevented the development of drugs to treat addiction and require the government to take on the responsibilities that industry is unwilling or unable to perform. 
America's drug problem is reduced each and every time a drug abuser quits his or her habit. Fewer drug addicts mean fewer crimes, fewer hospital admissions, fewer drug-addicted babies and fewer neglected children. The benefits to our country of developing new treatment options such as pharmacotherapies are manifold. Each dollar we spend on advancing options in this area can save us ten or twenty times as much in years to come. The question isn't `Can we afford to pursue a pharmacotherapy strategy?' but rather, `Can we afford not to?' 
Congress has long neglected to adopt measures I have proposed to speed the approval of and encourage greater private sector interest in pharmacotherapy. We cannot let another Congress conclude without rectifying our past negligence on this issue. I urge my colleagues to join me in promoting an important, and potentially ground breaking, approach to addressing one of our nation's most serious domestic challenges.

<TEXT>
Mr. BIDEN. I find myself once again in an uncomfortable position. I admire and like my friend from Texas. And maybe she is not, but I am looking for something to agree with her on, but this is not the one. 
She has been, as she always is, persistent and effective in making her case. She and I have been sort of at this dispute about dispute resolutions privately and also in our official capacity of attending the observer group meetings. And so here it is on the floor. 
I just rise today to strongly oppose the amendment because its prescription, I think, is both unnecessary for NATO as an organization and, quite frankly, harmful--harmful--to continued U.S. leadership to the alliance. Let me explain what I mean by that. And none of this will come as any surprise to my friend. I do not expect to change her mind at all, but I do want to make the case why I think this is a bad idea. 
It is unnecessary because the North Atlantic Council, which is now known as the NAC, the principal political organ of NATO, is by its very nature already a dispute resolution mechanism. That is the place we make decisions in NATO. All actions in the NAC--all of them--are taken by consensus, which comes, in almost every circumstance, after very lengthy formal and informal discussions among the 16 nations who are members of the NAC. 
For example, all delegations to NATO are housed in the same headquarters building in Brussels. Every working day there is a wide variety of meetings among delegates and member countries. Some are briefings; some are informal group meetings; and some are one-on-ones. Every Tuesday, NATO ambassadors or so-called perm representatives meet in an informal luncheon, which is strictly an off-the-record luncheon. A lot is resolved there as well. The purpose of these luncheons is to work out tough questions out of the glare of the press and publicity and to be able to be brutally candid with one another. 
In addition, the North Atlantic Council holds a weekly formal 
meeting which is on the record. By that time, issues in dispute, in almost every circumstance, have already been settled. As the alliance grew from 12 in 1949 to 16 in 1982, it has expanded its areas of common endeavor rather than retreated due to the inability of each to reach consensus decisions. Even during the divisive Bosnia debate, which has been referenced here, when one ally favored the Serb position and another the Muslim, the alliance still agreed to the largest historic commitment leading to the Dayton peace implementation force. 
This amendment notes that the North Atlantic Treaty does not provide for a dispute resolution process by which members can resolve differences among themselves. As true as that statement is, it is also equally irrelevant. NATO has a remarkably good track record in resolving disputes among its members, or at least in previewing them and then preventing them from escalating into open conflict. 
In fact, I think we ought to declare it the sense of the Congress that NATO is to be congratulated for having aided immeasurably in helping two of its members, France and Germany, to resolve their age-old antagonisms that caused two world wars in this century alone. That did not need a formal dispute mechanism. That was a consequence of the way the NATO negotiations take place now among its members. 
I think it should be the sense of the Congress that NATO is to be congratulated, notwithstanding the comments of my friend from Texas, for having prevented two members, Greece and Turkey, from going to war on more than one occasion. 
I am told my friend has indicated that that may have been the case in the past, but no longer. The truth of the matter is, NATO is still deeply involved in preventing the disagreement over Cyprus and the Aegean, certain islands, the transfer of weapons. It is the real place where most of the resolution takes place, because those Greek generals and those Turkish generals and the Greek perm representative and the Turk perm representative, they pass each other in the corridor every day. They meet every day. They probably talk every day. 
More recently, we ought to congratulate NATO for having integrated Germany so well with its neighbors so that the rest of Europe is now comfortable with a larger united Germany. Up until 12 years ago, there were as many people in the West as the East who were concerned about a united Germany. There was as much talk among parliamentarians in the East as the West about a united Germany--not a prospect in 1948, 1955, 1965, 1975, and I would argue even 1985 that anyone was rushing to embrace on the continent. 
Why did it go off so smoothly? NATO. NATO. More importantly, we ought to congratulate NATO, under American leadership, for having resolved all these disputes while assembling the most awesome defensive military alliance in history, one that no foe has dared to attack for 49 years. 
The only change to the NAC as a result of the enlargement that is about to take place with the addition of three new countries, the only change will be the addition of their three perm representatives, of their generals, of their people in the same building at the same meetings interfacing on the same questions. 
Some may worry that they will carry their own hostilities with neighbors into the NAC. I would argue that not only is that not likely to happen, if past is prologue, they have put away those hostilities in order to be able to get into NATO. 
NATO--just the prospect of membership to NATO has caused each of those countries, in varying degrees with varying degrees of disputes outstanding, to settle those border disputes, to settle those ethnic rivalries. I mentioned half a dozen times on the floor I doubt whether anyone on this floor would have predicted 2 years ago, let alone 20 years ago, that Romania would be accommodating a Hungarian minority or that Poland would have settled all of its border disputes.

Now, it seems to me that if I were a member of the NAC presently, if I were France, I might like this dispute resolution mechanism. They have been trying very hard to take over your fleet, without supplying a ship. They have been trying very hard to take titular leadership of NATO--I will get a lot of letters on this.

Why would we even want to do that? That would be a question to my friend from Virginia, other than responding to my other colleague. Why would we want to do that?

Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, the Senator doesn't often confuse me. We very often agree, and when we disagree, I usually understand clearly why we disagree. Let me explain my confusion, and if the Senator wishes to respond, I would appreciate it. If not, I understand. 
The Senator has been the most vocal and articulate opponent of NATO and/or the United States alone getting involved in what he believes to be intractable civil conflicts, border disputes, that have hundreds of years of history that precede them. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-biden-de-8-19980429</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. BIDEN. And I respect that. But what confuses me is, with the Senator's grave concern, why would he even want to give the NAC, or NATO, a possibility of taking away his power to influence those outcomes? He says that he is worried about--and I know him to be--the next strategic doctrine NATO may come out with. 
Right now the way NATO is constructed organizationally is if they come out with a doctrine that we sign off on, or intend to sign off on, the distinguished Senator from Virginia can come to this floor, pass a resolution and/or an amendment to a piece of legislation instructing the President not to sign on, and he can make that prevail depending on the number of votes available. If this were to be put before NATO, which would, by the way, imply at a minimum that the United States supported it, and the President doesn't, we do not support it. We wouldn't table something we don't support. People do not go around tabling things and asking for consideration that by implication they don't support. This administration does not support that. The last administration, to the best of my knowledge, does not support that. 
But why would this Senator even put in play the possibility that his influence over whether or not we are involved in a border dispute is rendered null and void? For if this were tabled, and if NATO adopted this, we would be in the position of taking exception to getting involved in a border dispute quite possibly, and if the dispute mechanism resolution requiring binding arbitration were in effect, the Senator would have no, no, no impact over whether or not that occurred, other than passing a resolution suggesting we would throw off from NATO. 
I don't understand, even though that is not likely to happen, why the Senator would even want to put himself in that possible position. The higher one is concerned with being involved in border disputes seems to me to increase in direct proportion the need for opposition to this amendment. Those who are willing to get involved in every border dispute who think we should be the policeman for all of Europe, central Europe, the former Soviet Union, that we should do whatever our European friends think should be done, they should be for this because it doesn't matter. It may very well be that we have a President who doesn't want to get involved in those disputes. But a majority of the members of NATO do, and they think that is good foreign policy. 
But I am perplexed. The more one is concerned about border disputes, the less they should be willing to give an absolute veto power that we now have--absolute. There is no need to discuss it. There is no need to do anything. The President of the United States picks up the phone, the Secretary of State picks up the phone and says to our Ambassador to NATO, `Vote no.' Done, over, gone, finished, no troops, no NATO. Why would you want to give up that lock? It is beyond me.

Mr. BIDEN. As my friend will remember, a man named Werner was a very dynamic leader of NATO, a German who was made the number one man in NATO. I recall being in Brussels. Don't hold me to the year. I think it was somewhere around 6 over 8 years ago. There was a lot of saber rattling going on relative to Greece and Turkey. 
I remember asking Werner about what this all meant. We were about to have a meeting. He was having a luncheon for me, as they do for any Senator who will go over and pay attention, and with the permanent reps and some of the military. He said to his assistant general so and so, and general so and so, one a Turk and one a Greek, `Call them in the office.' They called them in the office. He basically said, `What is going on, fellows? What is the deal?' The Turkish and Greek military representatives of NATO sat there and in the privacy of that room discussed the politics in their own country; why they didn't see there was much of a problem, but you have to understand it is going nowhere. 
If any formal mechanism is put in place, the ability of that Greek general and that Turkish general to walk into a room and totally off the record say, `We think this, we think that,' and talk about it in front of a German, and an American, all members of NATO, that would evaporate. Now we will have set up a bureaucratic deal, no matter what it is, no matter how tenuous it is, now it is posture. 
One of the things that we get done--and it will come as a shock to some people, but in the Chamber it will not come as a shock--is how do we most often on this floor resolve the disputes when we really get down to it at the last minute in a crunch on any important issue. 
We go back to one of those two rooms. There is no press. There is no floor. There is no record. And I say, `OK, what's the deal? If I change this, can you do that?' Isn't that how we do it? That is how NATO does it. Now, if we were required by law, by our governments, by our parties, that the only time we could meet is if we say, `I will meet you at 3:30; we will meet in room S. 107, and we will have two people there, and I will formally table my concern,' that is what worries me.

Mr. BIDEN. Whether or not--and we disagree in the policy. I have been on this floor for 4 years saying we should be involved. But whether or not we should, NATO has nothing to do with that. NATO troops ended up there, but not because the American President went to a NAC meeting or our Ambassador to NATO at a NAC meeting raised this issue. It is because there was a policy decision made by a President, supported by this Senator--he didn't do it because of me, but supported by this Senator--to try to persuade NATO to do that. Whether or not there was a dispute resolution mechanism in place in NATO that was formal or informal is irrelevant to that question. The President of the United States first picked up the phone and called Tony Blair. Then he called Chirac. Then he called--and the list went on. Then they ended up in NATO. 
So I understand what the Senator is trying to deal with. To use an old expression, she in a sense is trying to fight the last war. We fought that war about Bosnia in the Chamber here. My team won; her team lost. But NATO enlargement and a dispute resolution mechanism have nothing to do with that decision. 
I yield the floor.

And as he pointed out in a Roll Call article he got framed for me and signed--it was an article featuring him and his aides--I am the only person in the Senate who could beat Strom Thurmond's record if I served in the Senate until I reached age 73, which I am sure my constituents will not let happen.

Mr. BIDEN. I am not really warming the chair. I am serious. I could not see it. If I may beg the indulgence of my Republican colleagues, let me answer, because I think at least anything useful that could be said on my part has been said, with one exception, and I will say this and cease and desist. 
As I read the amendment, on line 5 it says, `establishing a process of dispute resolution among allies.' 
Now, the Senator from Texas has pointed out--and she has been a very, very, very forceful leader in opposition to our present policy in Bosnia. I wish she were not as effective, because she and I disagree. But she raised Bosnia again. I don't know how this dispute resolution mechanism of any nature would involve Bosnia at all. Serbia is not an ally, Bosnia is not an ally, Herzegovina is not an ally, Croatia is not an ally, Moldavia is not an ally. 
Looking over here, Romania--Romania is listed in the potential border disputes, ethnic Romanians in Moldavia versus Russia. None of those parties, Moldavia, Russia or Romania, are our allies. Bulgaria-Serbia, Estonia-Russia, Latvia-Russia, Estonia-Russia, Croatia-Serbia, Macedonia-Albania, Moldavia-Russia, Yugoslavia Serb-Bosnia, Serb-Croats, Serbs-Kosovo, Serbs-Macedonia, Albanians-Serbs, Hungarians--possibly; Serbs--Albanians-Kosovoans, Greeks-Albanians, Albanians-Macedonians. 
None of those concerns, not a single solitary one, involves allies. They would not be covered by even the unstated illusory mechanism that might be created if we don't table this. My reason for being opposed to this is a little bit like what Senator John Pastore from the State of Rhode Island told me in 1973. I said, `I'm not sure about this, Senator'--a vote. And he said, `Let me give you a piece of advice, Joe.' He talked with a gravelly voice. He said, `When in doubt, vote no.' 
I am in grave doubt, at a minimum. I cannot possibly see how what the Senator is suggesting in any way--I don't fully understand it. She is not proposing a particular mechanism. But I can't envision any mechanism that would have any impact on any of the things that are listed on that chart. Not a single one. Not a single one would fall within the definition of her resolution. 
Bosnia would not fall within the definition of her resolution. 
I know, ever since Ross Perot, all of us have gotten chart mania. You know, me, too. I have my charts back there. Maybe the chart was just wheeled out by mistake. But it, the chart, has no relevance to the resolution, none at all. I say as a Democrat on this side of the aisle now--I guess I should not be so flip about it. I do not mean to be. But all kidding aside, I really, truly, as they say--I don't get it. The examples the Senator from Virginia and Texas are worried about would not fall within the purview of this resolution even if such a dispute mechanism were arrived at. Nothing on the chart would fall within the purview of this resolution. I don't know what would that is not already working. And I don't know what is broken. I can't think of a single example--I would like to hear one--where NATO was unable to come up with a dispute resolution within the present structure. So that is why I oppose this. I will oppose it. 
I have great respect for my friend from Texas. I mean that sincerely. But I strongly disagree with this and I will urge my colleagues to vote `No.' I thank her for her indulgence. 
I have been asked to yield to Senator Craig for a consent request, unanimous consent request. I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we have enough time within this time to debate and finish the amendment of the Senator from Texas. But the Senator from Idaho has a very, very important amendment. If I agree to this request, it leaves me a total of 4 minutes to respond to his amendment, and nothing has been said in opposition to his amendment yet. If the Senator from Missouri speaks, it will leave less time. 
So I assume it's the leader's desire to have two votes by 5:10 or thereabouts. I don't know how we can do that.

Mr. BIDEN. The managers' amendment which the Senator from Oregon has just offered addresses several of the amendments which have been offered by our colleagues. Let me very briefly highlight a few of them. 
First, we have an amendment proposed by Senator Bingaman affirming the importance of the Partnership for Peace program. 
Second, there is a provision offered by Senator Hutchison of Texas related to the strategic importance of NATO. 
Third, there is an amendment offered by Senator Specter related to payments owed to the victims of Nazi Germany oppression. 
Fourth, there is a requirement for a report on future rounds of enlargement. This amendment is a combination of amendments offered by our colleagues, Senators Bingaman, Harkin, and Jeffords. 
This is a very useful amendment, in my view, because it will require the executive branch to submit a detailed analysis related to the possible new members of NATO, including cost and military readiness issues before--before--a nation is invited to begin accession talks. This will, I hope, allow the Senate to have a better understanding of the ramifications of admitting new members in the future and thereby enable the Senate to fulfill its constitutional function of providing advice to the President in the negotiation of treaties. 
Finally, Mr. President, there is an amendment related to intelligence issues which was proposed by the chairman and vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Shelby and Senator Kerrey of Nebraska. 
I appreciate very much the cooperation of all our colleagues and urge the approval of the managers' amendment.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho and I are going to have a chance to debate this issue later this afternoon. But I would just say to those who heard what he had to say in the introduction, consider the following: This is a treaty. This is not a conference report. This is not a piece of legislation. This is a treaty. And we should not be effectively legislating on a treaty. This treaty is going to go back to every other nation to sign, and we are going to say, by the way, there is a paragraph in here that says, `The Senate authorization committee,' and they are going to think they are reading Greek. It has nothing to do with the treaty. 
I do not in any way belittle his concern; it is worthy of debate, but it should not be on a treaty. I will make that point more forcefully when we get into the debate. 
I thank my colleague for yielding.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today marks the first anniversary of the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use of poison gas. The achievement of that Convention and of U.S. ratification were signal accomplishments of the Bush and Clinton Administrations. 
I am pleased to report that, after a year in force, the Chemical Weapons Convention has begun to pay significant dividends for our national security. Those dividends would be even greater if both Houses of Congress would pass legislation to implement the Convention, so that the United States could come into compliance with it. 
When the United States finally ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention, just days before it entered into force, we joined roughly 90 other states. In the days and months that followed, several important countries followed our lead. Among the 107 countries that now have joined the Convention are Russia, China, India, Pakistan, and Iran. Over 60 more nations have signed the Convention, and some of those are in the final stages of ratification. 
I want to emphasize those five particular countries that have ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention since we did. Many opponents of ratification said that Russia and China would never join, that we would be limiting our own options while other major powers refrained from the obligation to do without chemical weapons. Both Russia and China have joined, however, and China has admitted--for the first time--that it has had a chemical weapons program. 
India and Pakistan have also ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention, and that is something of a triumph. South Asia is probably the area where the risk of nuclear war is highest today. Both countries are generally assessed as nuclear-capable. Pakistan recently tested a missile that could target nearly any site in India, and India is talking about reviving a missile that could strike all of Pakistan. Yet both those countries ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention, and India admitted--again, for the first time--to having a chemical weapons program. 
Before the Convention entered into force, the United States and Russia were the only two admitted chemical weapons possessors. To date, however, six more countries--including South Korea, as well as China and India--have complied with the Convention's requirements to declare their chemical weapons and existing or former chemical weapons facilities. 
The chemical weapons that India has declared will be destroyed. The chemical weapons facilities that China, South Korea and other countries have declared will be destroyed, unless the Council of States Parties approves conversion of those facilities under stringent safeguards. These are achievements that we could not guarantee a year and four days ago, when Senate consent to ratification was debated and approved. But we have them today, and I hope there will be more such admissions, declarations, and destruction of chemical weapons and chemical weapons facilities in the years to come. 
In the past year, the Technical Secretariat of the Organization for the Prevention of Chemical Warfare (the international inspectorate for the Convention) has conducted nearly 200 inspections. Roughly three-fourths of those inspections--including 25 in Russia--have been at chemical weapons production, storage, and destruction facilities. 
About a third of the inspections have been in the United States--with no problems in protecting sensitive U.S. information. The United States is the only country currently destroying its chemical weapons, and the Technical Secretariat must monitor these facilities continually during destruction operations. As other countries begin to destroy their chemical weapons stocks, their inspection numbers will increase accordingly. 
Few among the treaty's critics or proponents expected this much progress so soon. There is still a long way to go. But in just one year, the Convention has clearly begun to prove its utility as a tool to reduce the threat of chemical weapons. 
What remains to be done? One crucial step is for the United States to come into compliance with the Convention. We have yet to enact implementing legislation pursuant to the Convention. Until we do so, our country will remain a violator of the Convention. 
Why is that? The Convention requires us to make violations of it a crime; we have yet to do that. The Convention also requires declarations regarding certain chemical production. We have submitted that declaration only regarding government facilities, because we lack legislation to require commercial reporting and to protect the confidential information in those reports from disclosure through the Freedom of Information Act. Finally, we still need a regime to govern international inspections of private U.S. facilities. 
Aside from the dishonor that we bring upon ourselves by failing to comply with a treaty that we have ratified, why should we care? We should care because our failure to enact implementing legislation harms the national security. It makes it difficult to encourage compliance by other countries, or to request a challenge inspection if another country's declarations omit a suspected chemical weapons facility. 
In addition, other countries are using our delay to draw attention away from their own misdeeds. Last month, a Russian general was interviewed by Izvestiya. The general made an utterly specious claim that the Sverdlovsk anthrax disaster was due to natural causes--a claim that even Russian officials have long since abandoned--and he even recycled the old lie that the United States invented AIDS. But how did the article end? Why, with a recital of the U.S. failure to enact implementing legislation! That's truly outrageous, but that will continue until we come into compliance. 
The fault does not lie with this body, Mr. President. The Senate passed S. 610 on May 23 of last year. It then languished in the House for six months, before being attached to an unrelated measure. One way or another, we must enact this legislation. 
The implementing legislation is not perfect. I noted last year that it harms U.S. interests if we bar the analysis of U.S. samples outside this country or give the President the right to invoke a national security exemption from inspections. The immediate need, however, is to enact a bill and bring our country into compliance with this important and useful Convention. 
We have come far with the Chemical Weapons Convention. It is already proving its worth. But there is still this overdue work to accomplish--not for the sake of others, but to further our own national security. We can do it, and we should do it now.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on a hill in the western section of my hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, stands St. Anthony's Roman Catholic Church, a beautiful and imposing masterpiece of architecture and a testimonial to the power of faith that dominates the skyline. Founded in 1924, St. Anthony's Parish has been a major force in the religious, social, and cultural life in Wilmington for four generations. In addition to the magnificent church, the parish has built St. Anthony's Grade School, an elementary school, and Padua Academy, a fine high school for young women. In addition, there is Fournier Hall, a center for the social and recreational needs of the community; The Antonian--an apartment complex built to ensure that the neighborhood's senior citizens have access to quality, affordable housing; and the Father Roberto Balducelli Community Center, which provides day care for the community's children and daily activities for their grandparents and great-grandparents. And every June, St. Anthony's Festival draws tens of thousands of Delawareans and people from across the country for a week of good food, good fun, and a celebration of God's blessings. For three-quarters of a century, the good people of St. Anthony's Parish--both clergy and parishioners--have looked to the needs of the entire community, and joined together to meet those needs. The entire Greater Wilmington area has benefitted from their efforts. They truly have earned a special place in our lives and the life of our city. 
As St. Anthony's Parish begins the year-long celebration of its seventy-fifth year, they have chosen to kick off that celebration Thursday evening, April 30, with a dinner and Mass of Thanksgiving, in which they will honor three of the pillars of the parish, three individuals who have labored long and hard over many years to build St. Anthony's into the vital part of community life that it has become; Father Mario Bugliosi, Brother Michael Rosenello, and Father Roberto Balducelli. 
Father Mario came to Wilmington for the first time in 1954, as a teacher at Salesianum High School, a premier Catholic high school. After spending five years at Salesianum and a year at a high school in Philadelphia, Father Mario returned to Wilmington in 1960 as an Associate Pastor at St. Anthony's and, except for a two-year hiatus in his native Italy, has been doing the Lord's work among us ever since. His kind, gentle manner and complete decency--always there with a supportive word for everyone--has made him the parish's chief `Confessor'--the man you go to in times of crisis (spiritual or otherwise), at times when you are in need of advice and counsel, and at times when you simply need someone to listen. He personifies the notion that `to minister' need not refer only to great and glorious words from the pulpit, but to a quiet moment over a cup of coffee, a shared walk along the street, or to a visit to the home of someone in spiritual need. 
Brother Mike--there are folks in the parish who refer to him as `Mr. Padua' for his yeoman like work at the school--also first came to St. Anthony's in 1954 as a Pastoral Assistant and the Director of Youth Ministry. After a short absence in the 1960's, he returned to the parish in 1966 as the Director of Parish Maintenance, where he has overseen virtually every aspect of life at the school, starting with the construction of the new school building beginning in 1967. He developed the girls' athletic programs at the school and coached basketball himself for many years. He has organized and directed many of St. Anthony's most successful social events over the years and decorated the church for all of its major feasts and celebrations. And perhaps most importantly to the students at Padua, he has overseen the operations of the school's cafeteria, ensuring that lunch time is both delicious and nutritious as well as a time for catching up with friends. He is one of those fellows who is always there when the parish or the 
parishioners need a fresh idea, an organizer, or a pair of hands used to hard work. 
For fifty-two years, first as a teacher and Associate Pastor, then for twenty-nine years as pastor, and for the past ten years as the parish's `Senior Statesman', Father Roberto Balducelli--`Father Robert' to everyone in Wilmington--has been the man who makes things happen. He is responsible for the building of St. Anthony's Grammar School, the Parish House and Rectory, the Padua Academy, and the Antonian. He was the founder of the community center which now bears his name, and initiated the St. Anthony's festival, which has become one of the premier social events for families of all faiths in the Wilmington area. He is a living legend, known and respected by Delawareans who have never set foot in his church but who share his love for our city and its people, and yet for all of his success in working with the leaders of Delaware industry, commerce, and government, he has never left the working-class community to which he came from Italy a half-century ago. Twenty years ago, he was chosen by Delaware's largest newspaper, The News Journal as one of ten outstanding Delawareans--and he has been building upon that legacy for two decades since. Since his `retirement' in 1988, he has continued his efforts to develop recreational facilities for young people bringing youngsters from the city out into the country to enjoy the outdoors and share in the spirituality and enjoyment of God's natural creations. Those efforts would tax the energy of a dozen people half his age, but for Father Robert, it is simply a continuation of his tireless energy on behalf of his flock. He is truly one of Delaware's living treasures. 
These three individuals, plus the thousands of parishioners and staff who have worked so hard with them over the years, epitomize the old idea that a church is a vital part of the community, not just on Sundays, but every day in many ways to everyone in the community. Their spirit is the spirit that has sustained St. Anthony's parish for seventy-five years, and hopefully will sustain the parish and its parishioners for many years to come. 
I am honored to have the opportunity to salute that spirit and commend St. Anthony's Parish as they embark upon their seventy-fifth year doing God's work in Wilmington.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to recount a little history--a history I'm sure many are familiar with. One hundred years ago last August, the first World Zionist Congress convened in the Swiss city of Basel. Although the gathering attracted little attention at the time, what transpired then would forever change the course of Jewish history, and indeed world history. 
What later came to be known as the Basel Program stated quite simply that the aim of Zionism was `To create for the Jewish people a home in Palestine secured by public law.' 
With that simple proposition, the delegates at the first Congress formally set into motion the Jewish national liberation movement. It would mean the fulfillment of a spiritual yearning that had remained unrealized for over two millennia. 
At the conclusion of the conference, Theodor Herzl recorded a prescient entry in his diary: 
In Basel, I founded the Jewish state. If I were to say this aloud I would meet with laughter; but in another five years, and certainly in another fifty years, everyone will be convinced of this. 
From the distance of a hundred years, I can say we are convinced. 
Of course, it took fifty years of sacrifice--and a world shamed by the Holocaust--before Herzl's dream of a Jewish homeland became a reality. But it happened, and tomorrow we celebrate fifty years of Israeli independence. 
In that short span of time, Israel has become the beacon of hope for Jews the world over. It has successfully absorbed wave after wave of immigrants from every corner of the globe. It has built a thriving economy larger than the economies of all its immediate neighbors combined. It is the sole democracy in a region where dictatorships and monarchies are the norm. It excels in science, technology, and culture far out of proportion to its small population. 
In short, the Jewish people have, after long tribulation, taken their rightful place among nations. And Israel has become a symbol to all of us. 
The very fact that Israel exists means that Jews will never again be at someone else's mercy. They are masters of their destiny. Israel is the tangible expression of the solemn vow we made after the Holocaust--`Never Again.' 
Never again will Jews be powerless. Never again will they have to rely upon the mercy and goodwill of an overlord. Never again will they have to watch helplessly as nearly half of their people is exterminated. Put simply, Israel symbolizes the restoration of Jewish independence and dignity. 
Nearly a quarter century ago as a junior Senator on the Foreign Relations Committee, in my first official trip overseas, I made a formative journey to Israel. It was just after the Yom Kippur war--a war that vividly brought home Israel's vulnerability as well as the absolute necessity of an intimate U.S.-Israel relationship. 
The lessons I learned on that journey have remained with me ever since. In the past twenty-five years, I have worked with six different Israeli Prime Ministers and six different American Presidents. I have been twice in the majority party in the Senate and I am now in the minority for the second time. 
But through it all, the United States relationship with Israel has remained a constant feature. It transcends individual leaders and political parties. It is not subject to the vagaries of international events. The bond between Israel and the United States is unbreakable. 
This strategic and moral partnership between Israel and the United States has made possible the peace agreements between Israel and three former adversaries. 
As Israel's enemies have seen that they cannot drive a wedge between our two countries, so they have come to recognize slowly but surely that Israel is here to stay. 
I know that I speak for many of my colleagues when I say that the American commitment to Israel over the next 50 years will be just as reliable as it has been in Israel's first 50 years. 
I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution and I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the chairman and I have worked very, very hard over the last 9 months to produce this bill. I will not reiterate all that each of us said last week at the end of the day. We have no real disagreement in terms of the substance of the bill. We have a disagreement on not even whether or not we should attach a provision relating to family planning and abortion in the bill. We don't even disagree on that. The chairman had nothing to do with that being in. He is a strong supporter of the family planning limitation that is in this bill, so-called Mexico City, although he did not ask for it to be put in this bill, 
but it is on the bill. We are faced with the reality, it is on the bill. 
The question is, What do we do from here? I urge my colleagues, notwithstanding the agreement the Senator and I have in every other aspect of the bill, to vote against this conference report. I do so because, at the insistence of the House, the Mexico City provision, which is not related to the underlying legislation, is in the bill, and stopping the conference report, I hope--and I may be tactically wrong here; this is my objective--I hope we send a signal to the House that we will not yield to what I characterize--not the chairman, `me'--characterize, as legislative blackmail on this or other controversial issues. 
As indicated, it would be inappropriate, if the Democrats took back the House next time out--I have no idea whether that will happen, but if they did--for them to attach to one of the bills an education provision that no one on the Republican side liked and said, `Take it or leave it.' I think it is a mistake. 
The underlying legislation is critically important to American foreign policy. It would pay off our arrearages to the United Nations and bring additional reform to that body and reorganize our foreign policy agency, and it begins to provide the funds, in essence, to restore our diplomatic presence worldwide. I believe the President will sign it promptly, provided we send him one without Mexico City attached. 
Again, the only thing that the chairman and I disagree on, he believes, and he believed, and I believe he believes it, that what the House sent is at least a compromise on Mexico City. I view it as not a compromise at all on Mexico City. 
So I urge my colleagues to reject this conference report so we can return to conference and produce a bill that the President can sign.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I know my friend from Oklahoma didn't intend to mislead, but there is already a law, the Helms amendment, which says no U.S. money can be used for that purpose --no U.S. money. 
What the Mexico City language in this bill says is that these nonprofit organizations cannot use their own money, the money they raise, in Mexico, in Argentina, in Italy, in France, in China, they can't use that money to lobby their government. No U.S. taxpayers' dollars are allowed under present law to be used to lobby for abortion, period, bang. That is already law. That is the Helms amendment. 
What we are talking about is using their money raised from sources other than a contribution from the U.S. taxpayer.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Harkin amendment. Everyone should understand one thing. This has nothing to do with the expansion of NATO. Under the resolution we are passing, we say we are not going to do anything beyond what we now do to contribute to the common budget of NATO, which, on average, is 25 percent. 
There are three common budgets. My friend from Iowa comes along and says: Look, we are not going to allow you to do what you were allowed to do now for Greece, Turkey, Germany. For example, when we passed the CFE agreement, we agreed we would get rid of a lot of materiel. That materiel was worth the sum total of about $185 million. We gave it to Turkey, Portugal, Germany, et cetera. 
Under this amendment, we would not be able to do that kind of thing for any of the new countries if they come in. In addition to that, we would be limited to be engaged in any foreign military sales to these countries. Nothing to do with common budgets. 
I urge you to vote no.

Mr. BIDEN. I will be very brief. Speaking for myself and my side and I think Senator Smith of Oregon, who will say the same thing, we are prepared to accept the amendment. 
Let me just make a few very brief comments. I think that the applicants for NATO accession have provided cooperation, as was indicated in the U.S. efforts to locate American POWs and MIAs in the cold war. 
In July of 1987, the U.S.-Russian Joint Commission on POW/MIAs visited Poland; the Department of Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office visited in December of 1997. Resulting from these visits, senior Polish officials pledged to search their archives thoroughly and open all relevant information to the United States. U.S. officials met with the Polish National Security Bureau, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Intelligence Services, the Office of Central Security, Central Archives. All, in the minds at the Pentagon, are fully cooperating. I can say the same relative to the Czech Republic and with regard to Hungary. 
So although I, quite frankly, do not think it is necessary, I have no objection to the amendment. And let me say to my friend from New Hampshire, all you have to be is the brother, sister, mother, father, son, daughter, nephew, or niece of an MIA to understand everything the Senator says. 
My mother lost her closest brother in World War II, shot down in New Guinea. They never found his body. To this day, my mother--and that was 1944--wakes up after dreaming that he has been found. To this day, he is a constant--`constant' would be an exaggeration--he is a regular source of painful memories for my mother. The idea that there is no closure, the idea that there has never been the ability to say his name was Ambrose J. Finnegan, God love him--his nickname was Bozy to everybody in my mom's family. My mother, when I was a kid, literally would wake up at night screaming from a nightmare. She would scare the hell out of us, dreaming that her brother was in the most extreme circumstance. 
I do not mean in any way to suggest this is not important by saying we will accept it and that I do not think it is necessary, because it is being done, because it is true, the pain lasts. My mother just turned 80 years old. It is like yesterday for my mother. 
So I appreciate what my friend from Texas and my colleague from New Hampshire are doing. Again, I do not think it is necessary, because I anticipate they will fully cooperate. But I see no problem in accepting the amendment.

Mr. BIDEN. My uncle. My mother was one of five children. It was her brother and her soul mate. It is amazing how, like I said, she is 80 years old, God love her, and it is still there. 
The only reason I bothered to mention it--I never mentioned it before on the floor in all the debates we had about POWs and MIAs. I compliment my colleagues in their diligence to continue to pursue accounting for POWs and MIAs, and I didn't want them to think that, because I slightly disagree with their assertion of what these three countries have done--I agree with my friend from Oregon. I think they are clearly interested in helping. If there are any countries that are fully aware, as my friend from Oregon said, it is the Hungarians and the Czechs and the Poles, who have had people dragged off to those gulags, never to be heard from again. 
These democratically elected officials, now--I would be dumbfounded if they did not fully cooperate. But I understand the motivation. That is my point, to my two colleagues. I am happy, from our side, to accept the amendment, as well as my friend has indicated he is willing to accept it.

Mr. BIDEN. Obviously that is the Senator's right. I do not challenge it. I just am reminded, I remember one time when I first got here--and I know he has been here a long time. I went up to Russell Long, the Chairman of the Finance Committee, and indicated to him I wanted help on an amendment to a Finance Committee bill. Senator Long, the senior Senator and Chairman of the Finance Committee, said, `Fine.' He accepted it. 
Then I thought later it would be good to have a recorded vote. I stood up and said, `I have decided I want a recorded vote.' He said, `In that case, I am against it.' We had the recorded vote and he beat me. So I learned, from my perspective anyway, that when someone accepts an amendment, I am always happy to do it. 
But I understand the Senator's motivation. I will not change my position, but maybe he would reconsider whether we need the vote. But that is his judgment. I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it is true the Delaware which touches New Jersey is owned by Delaware, but I am from Delaware. I would be proud to be from New Jersey, but I am prouder to be from Delaware. 
Mr. President, I understand we are going to go to the Kyl amendment very shortly and I cosponsor and agree with the Kyl amendment. I think the manager supports the Kyl amendment, too. But while we wait for Senator Kyl to make his opening statement in support of his amendment, I would like to reiterate a point I made yesterday with Senator Smith, in the few minutes while we are waiting for Senator Kyl to come to the floor. 
Yesterday there was a good deal of talk here about whether or not this expansion of NATO was good, bad or indifferent. The distinguished Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, the distinguished Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner and others, were taking issue with the expansion of NATO. I referenced why I thought the Poles thought this was in their interest because the comments were basically made that the Poles--Senator Smith of New Hampshire said we support the Poles anyway. 
I made the point that that kind of promise had been made to Poland before. In 1939, France was considered to have Europe's strongest army. It had built the massive defensive fortification called the Maginot Line which was widely thought to be impregnable. 
Hitler's generals warned against an attack on France. In late August of 1939, of course, came the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany which--difficult though it may be to understand today--astonished the world then. 
Little more than a week later, on September 1, 1939, Hitler's forces launched a surprise attack on Poland. Here we come to two critical points. 
First, Great Britain and France had cobbled together an alliance with Poland earlier that year after Germany had annexed the rest of Czechoslovakia. 
But that last-minute alliance, of course, can in no way be compared to today's powerful integrated military command of NATO. France and Britain had no capability to project forces eastward to defend the Poles. Furthermore, Poland was then ruled by authoritarian colonels, while Britain and France were democracies. Therefore, appeasers could and did proclaim that they would not `die for Danzig.' 
Hitler saw all this and correctly anticipated that France and Britain would not actively oppose his attack on Poland. And they didn't. 
Secondly, Hitler's generals needed the attack on Poland to perfect their new tactic which was dubbed the `Blitzkrieg' or `lightning war.' The panzer attack on the Polish cavalry, as was 
pointed out yesterday, an incredible undertaking where Poles on horses were taking on armored divisions of the German Army, which the Senator from Virginia recalled earlier in the debate, was a metaphor for the effectiveness of the German's new kind of rapid, mobile warfare. 
I said yesterday that France and Britain, after formally declaring war on Germany September 3, 1939, did nothing. In fact, Mr. President, for more than 8 months nothing happened on the Franco-German frontier. Commentators labeled this the `phony war,' a term which students of history will call and readily recall. 
Meanwhile, after carving up Poland with Stalin, the Germans were freed to redeploy offensive combat units for use in the West. On May 10, 1940, Hitler invaded France and the Low Countries using the Blitzkrieg tactics perfected against the Poles, now against France. Going through Belgium and Holland, the Germans simply bypassed the vaunted Maginot Line, and soon they were in Paris. 
So I repeat, Hitler's road to France went through Poland. We should ask ourselves what lessons can be learned from this sad tale and acknowledge Poland is east of Germany. How did it get to France? Had they not gone into Poland first they would not, in all probability, have been nearly as successful as they were in 1940. The road to France was through Poland. 
First, the lesson we should learn from this sad tale is the alliance only means something if it has a deeper purpose. Today, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are democracies with Western values--not as Poland was then, a very different country. By the way, only extreme isolationists, I submit, would repeat a `I won't die for Danzig' slogan in 1998. 
Second, the alliance must have military muscle to back up a paper agreement. NATO clearly has the military structure in force to make collective defense credible. 
The third lesson, is NATO, through its Partnership for Peace Program, is actively cooperating with non-NATO countries, including Russia, to lessen tensions and make future conflicts highly unlikely. 
So for all these reasons, Mr. President, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, passionately want to become members of NATO. All three countries have successfully completed a demanding set of reforms in order to qualify. 
History need not repeat itself, Mr. President. But history is always instructive. That is why I mention the connection between Poland and France in 1939 and 1940. I hope this explanation is helpful to my colleagues. I hope we keep it in mind. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. On my time, let my take a crack at that, if I may. I am a cosponsor, although I cannot take credit for the drafting. It is totally a product of my friend from Arizona, and it is an admirable job. The Senator from Oregon and I were just talking about what a good amendment this is. I am glad to cosponsor it. But let me maybe help. 
I have in my hand the alliance's Strategic Concept of 1991, the last one that occurred. It is the present operating doctrine for NATO. My friend from Virginia pointed out that the North Atlantic Assembly committee gets together and they decide whether this should be updated periodically, what it should say, and what article V of the Washington treaty means. Article V of the Washington treaty, the NATO treaty, was read earlier by my friend from Virginia. 
It starts off, the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all, consequently, and it goes on from there. Let me read from the strategic concept, the alliance's strategic concept, which is the operating strategy of NATO, as we speak, the one that was, in effect, redone in 1991 to respond to the changed circumstances, meaning no longer the Soviet Union, the Berlin Wall is down, and all these nations. We are talking about independent republics and nations themselves. OK. That is the concept in which the strategic document came about.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if I may respond, since I am not the author but only the cosponsor, I do not want to take the liberty of suggesting what the Senator from Arizona meant, but that is my understanding. It is my understanding that the words as drafted now in paragraph 5--and I apologize. I am searching for the language--say each of the threats are self-evidently covered by present NATO doctrine: `Re-emergence of hegemonic power confronting Europe,' i.e., Russia. That is part of our existing doctrine today. `Rogue states and non-state actors possessing nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons and the means to deliver these weapons by ballistic or cruise missiles,' et cetera. That, as I read paragraph 10, is contemplated within the `serious economic, social and political difficulties.' It says, `including ethnic rivalries and territorial disputes' but not limited to those two items. 
No. 3, `Threats of a wider nature, including the disruption of the flow of vital resources' obviously would affect the economic security and the stability of the NATO nations. No. 4, `Conflict in the North Atlantic stemming from ethnic and religious enmity.' That is covered. So as I said----

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, to respond, that is exactly what this amendment says. The amendment says, as my friend from Arizona has drafted it, it is a decision self-evident. In this amendment, it is a decision for the NAC to make whether or not it is an armed conflict that will spill over. There have been a number of ethnic conflicts in Central and Eastern Europe which we had concluded not to get involved in because the NAC concluded they were not directly threatened, they did not directly threaten the security of those countries. They did conclude that the ethnic rivalries and the war in Bosnia did--did--threaten their security. They made that judgment internally within the NAC, within that governing body of NATO. 
So I reserve the remainder of my time. I have 2 minutes, I am told.

It is worth, as they say, the read, and is incredibly instructive. I mean it sincerely. It is incredibly insightful, and those of you who have an interest should take a look at it.

We may or may not through the program which the opponents of expansion constantly point to--the Partnership for Peace, as what we should have stuck with--we may or may not do that. But passage of the expansion of NATO for these three countries in no way affects the point of whether or not we give assistance to Romania or we give assistance to any other country questioned.

Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, the answer is I am saying there is no obligation we undertake. The Senator sits on the Appropriations Committee. The Senator will have to make an individual judgment as each of the items come before him whether he wishes to do it. 
For example, we are going to have, and right now the President has sent up within the last 3 months a request for additional equipment for Turkey, additional military equipment for Greece. Now, they have nothing to do with our common budget in NATO, zero. 
Now, the Senator sits on the Appropriations Committee. He can come to the floor, and on foreign military sales of those countries, he can say no, we don't want to do that, and we can vote against it. It is irrelevant. It has nothing to do with whether or not Poland is a member of NATO or the Czech Republic is a member of NATO. 
What the Defense Department means, I respectfully suggest, is the following; that with NATO, with the additional three countries in NATO, we may conclude that our defenses would be further enhanced, bilaterally enhanced, U.S. interests enhanced if we gave more money, more for military sales to Romania or to the Baltics or somewhere else. But it has nothing to do--nothing to do, zero--with whether or not we expand NATO. Zero, nothing. 
The Senator from Virginia is on the floor, a strong opponent of expansion. He knows that the Armed Services Committee has no obligation to send foreign military sales which we subsidize to Greece or Turkey, yet he votes for it. But it has nothing to do with NATO, zero. Nothing to do with NATO, zero. It is not part of NATO's common budget, common budget. 
The only thing, I respectfully suggest to my colleague, that we are committing ourselves to with the expansion of NATO is that we will continue to participate roughly 25 percent of the cost of the common budget of NATO. The things that the DOD referenced and what my friend from Iowa is talking about have zero to do with the common budget. 
There is a chart here, `budget cost-sharing formula, in percentage of total NATO common budget.' I will later in the day go into great detail, because I think one of the great misnomers here is how the NATO is funded. I am not speaking to my friend from Iowa, who knows this area very well because he serves on the Appropriations Committee. But many of us who do not serve on the Appropriations Committee or Armed Services Committee don't necessarily understand the details of how the NATO budget is constructed. There are three common budgets. I will not go into it now. But they are the things that all 16 NATO nations reach into their pockets and pay for. They are not the national budgets. 
The national budget, my friend on the authorizing committee--both my friends stand here on the Armed Services Committee--in the national budget we decide whether or not out of our military budget we are going to help Greece beyond the common budget, whether we are going to help Turkey beyond the common budget, whether we are going to help Chile beyond the common budget, whether we will spend money in Korea beyond, and it has nothing to do with the common budget of NATO. 
So what happens here is we are taking great big apples and putting them in baskets of small oranges. We talk about mixing apples and oranges. The reason why the numbers, which I will go into in great detail later, range from $125 billion to $1.5 billion is that we are counting the wrong things. 
So the issue here, and we will get a chance to talk about this in detail, what is NATO's--and I know my friend from Virginia knows this well--what is the common budget of NATO? And what are we committing ourselves to spend in addition to what we are now spending on the common budget of NATO because these three countries 
 are going to be added--if they are added, if we prevail? 
So, that is the issue. With all due respect, my friend is mixing apples and oranges here when he refers to the DOD saying we might in the future decide to spend more money. It has nothing to do with any obligation we are taking on as a consequence of expanding NATO. 
I thank my colleague. I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend, one of the things the Armed Services Committee has been very jealous of, rightfully so, even though foreign military sales fall within the Foreign Relations Committee purview, when we argued in the Foreign Relations Committee, some of us, against some foreign military sales, the Armed Services Committee members and staff have often come to us and said, `Joe, do you know what you are doing?' If you don't let Lockheed or Marietta Martin sell that particular item subsidized to the Germans or to the Greeks or to the Spaniards or to whomever, do you know what you are doing? You are just subsidizing the French because they will sell them a Mirage; they will sell this, they will sell that. 
When we make these judgments on foreign military sales, they are judgments that are not only made in terms of what we believe to be our security interest, but when we fail to participate in that, we find that we lose part of our infrastructure because we find that, as a lecture I received many times on the floor from Armed Services Committee members, we lose the competitive advantage to those foreign military sales merchants in France, in England, wherever else. 
So what we are talking about is the independent judgment of whether or not we may, in the future conclude, as we have in the past, that in addition to our contribution to the common military budget, in order to keep peace in the Aegean, we have supplied in addition to that common NATO budget, we have supplied additional moneys or subsidies to Greece or to Turkey or Denmark. We have done it for almost all of the 15 members. 
What the amendment of my friend here would do is something revolutionary. It would say that we will redefine what NATO's common budget is as it relates to the United States. We now would have to include as part of the economic budget any of the following: foreign military financing under the Arms Control Export Act, transfers of excess defense articles, emergency drawdowns or no-cost leases of U.S. equipment or subsidies or loan guarantees, which would in effect give veto power over our interests with the other 15 NATO nations. The reason we give a veto power is because if we draw down, if we have to draw down from a 25 percent foreign military sales, we can't then pay our common budget that is owed to NATO because we have agreed. If we don't do that, then NATO says `Woe, woe, you are not engaging in cost sharing.' 
 And that, in turn, means that they can veto whether or not as a practical matter we decide it is in our national interest to sell Cobra helicopters to the Greeks. My time is up.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it clearly does. It says that if we want to `take a tank off the shelf,' as they say, which comes right now out of the Defense Department budget, and we want to give that tank to Turkey, or to Greece, or to Germany, it says that tank can't be given if in fact we have already met our obligation of 25 percent under the common budget because it would exceed 25 percent. So he is limiting--limiting in perpetuity--the amount of money we can spend out of our national budget. 
Look, this is apples and oranges again. We say with NATO, here is the deal: We are going to pay 25 percent of all the moneys that directly relate to NATO. We do not say we are only going to keep 25 percent of the total amount of money we spent at 25 percent if, in addition, we decide we want to help, as we have over the last 30 years, Greece. If this had been the law in the last 20 years, the military aid that we have given to Greece and Turkey would have eaten up our share of what we agreed to do in the common 
budget. So in Aviano, Italy, the national budget of the country of Italy pays for that Air Force base. But if we are going to build a runway to land NATO planes on, or Italy comes back and says, wait a minute, even though that is on an Italian air base for which we pay for all the infrastructure, if you want to lengthen the runway to accommodate NATO planes, the other 15 members of NATO have to kick in to pay for it. If it costs $10 to extend the runway, we take out $2.50 and pay the 25 percent. But if we have already given $2.50 off the shelf to Greece, we don't have any money, we are prohibited by law from being able to do this. 
This is hamstringing our national defense budget, unrelated to NATO. It is a little like my saying that we are not going to spend anymore money on education than what we now spend on title VII. So if we want to pass, as I do, and did, the subsidy for IRAs for private schools, that would have to come out of the ceiling for all title VII, which was a billion dollars. We would have to find $300 million out of that billion dollars, which means you don't have enough money to meet the obligation you have agreed to, separate and apart for decisions independent of NATO considerations. You know, the rest of NATO has not wanted to support Greece. We stepped in and said, OK, notwithstanding that NATO doesn't want to support Greece beyond the NATO common budget, we are going to step in and give them the following subsidies, or the following military equipment off our shelf, out of our national budget, out of our pocket. 
Now, if we deal with any NATO nation, and we conclude that we want to engage in foreign military sales with them, unrelated to NATO, if we want to convince the French--which we never could--to stop flying Mirage aircraft in their national air force and fly F-15s, we could not do that. And so this is a profound change in national defense policy that, with all due respect, has nothing to do with NATO. If you want to cap all U.S. spending as it relates from the Euros to the Atlantic at 25 percent, fine, do it; but understand that you are making a profound foreign policy judgment that has nothing to do with whether or not Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary are members of NATO. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Where you don't go back 50 years--for example, if the Senator's amendment had been in place, we probably could not have amended the conventional forces in Europe. In 1991, it became clear--the wall came down in 1989--we had to amend the conventional forces amendment. We renegotiated that agreement. The flank agreement in the Senate was an amendment. It was passed in Russia in the Duma as well. What we said was that we had to give up a number of pieces of equipment, thousands of pieces of equipment, but because Greece and Turkey were on the southern flank of NATO and because we still were concerned about instability in the region, we still wanted force structure there, we had to call for a cascading down. We took all of the equipment that we were giving up, thousands of pieces, and we just gave them to the Greeks and the Turks. It was in our national interest to do so. 
Had the Senator's amendment been in place, the cost of all of those pieces of equipment would have to have been computed and added up, and then reduced from the 25 percent ceiling that was allowed to be spent by the United States on the common budget of the NATO. That had nothing to do with the cold war; it had to do with reality. It had to do with the arms control agreement. That arms control agreement would have done one of two things. It would not be able to have been negotiated and signed by us because we would not have been able to have that force structure on the southern flank, or we would have had to go in arrears to our commitment of saying 25 percent of the common budget of NATO. 
That is a contemporary example. That went on from 1991 to 1996. It is a further example of how well-intended but dangerous this amendment is. 
I thank the Senator for yielding.

Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield. If in fact this logic makes sense, I don't know why we would produce an amendment that says right now we spend--I don't know the exact national budget. My friend from Virginia may know how much we spend on defense right now in the United States of America on our total defense budget. I will make up a number. Let's say it is $300 billion. Why don't we attach an amendment right now and say that we will not spend more than $300 billion on defense, period? Why don't we do that? It is the same logic. Let's tell the American taxpayers now we are limiting what they are going to spend on defense. We will do it now. We will limit it to that number, not just in Europe but all over the world. Tell them that right now. If there is an emergency, we can come back. 
This is the same man, whom I respect enormously, who argued strenuously, and he argued on the same issue of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. 
Why not set a number? Defense spending cannot increase at all. We can pass it now, unless we come along and by a two-thirds vote in this body agree to spend more money on defense. That is what we are doing here relative to these three countries. That is what we are doing for Europe. Why don't we do it for the all of the national defense budget? 
If it doesn't make sense for the whole national defense budget, I respectfully suggest it makes zero sense to do it in Europe for these three countries.

Mr. BIDEN. The Senator from Iowa forthrightly responded, as he always does, that if we wanted to sell Poland, like we sell Greece or Germany or anyone else, a piece of American-made military equipment, as long as we did not subsidize more than 25 percent of what that was, then we could sell it. 
I wonder, why in God's name would the French Government agree to come up with money for Poland to allow them to buy an American jet instead of a French jet? Why would they possibly do that? And does this not give a veto, a veto on the part of other NATO nations, over American foreign military sales? Because unless they come up with 75 percent of what any subsidy would be, why would they possibly do that? 
Is it not true--the Senator is on the Armed Services Committee--is it not true that one of the core debates in NATO beyond burdensharing has been who gets to sell NATO the equipment, whether they fly Mirages--whether NATO planes are Mirages or whether they are American made aircraft? Every other European country in NATO has been saying, `You Americans get too much of an advantage.' Every time we talk about burdensharing, don't they come back and say, `Yes, but you don't get it; you get to make all that money and get all those jobs because you are supplying the equipment that all the NATO uses'? 
So why in the Lord's name would we give a veto power over the ability of American manufacturers and American employees to keep their jobs to the French and the Germans and the Brits?

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I realize we only have a minute or two before the unanimous consent order kicks in which ends discussion at 12:45, but let me say for the record that one of the aspects of the amendment that we are considering and will be voting on when we come back from our caucus luncheons, the Harkin amendment, deals with requiring excess military materiel transferred to any NATO country--in this case, the three new members--to be counted against our common budget. 
I did not have these numbers before, but I want to put them in the Record now. The Senator from Iowa has contended that we provide aid only to the less well off countries in NATO, and he implied they are the only ones we have given this excess military equipment to. Most people don't know what we are talking about here, so let me make it clear. Here are the facts. 
In fiscal year 1996, we provided excess defense articles to the following countries: Denmark, Germany, Greece, Portugal, and Turkey, for a total value of $55 million. In fiscal year 1997, these excess articles went to the United Kingdom, Norway, Spain, and Turkey; value: $113 million. And my friend from Iowa, if his amendment passes, would say we can continue to spend taxpayers' money for what we believe is in our national interest to give excess items to other NATO countries, not part of our NATO requirement but our individual judgment, but we could not do the same for Poland, the Czech Republic, or Hungary. I think that would a serious mistake. If he wishes to do that and `save the taxpayers' money,' why not have his amendment say no excess military arms could go to any NATO country? Why single out for this second-class treatment the three new countries? 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I support the confirmation of the nomination of Greg Sleet to be the 22d Federal district court judge in Delaware. 
One of the most important duties of any U.S. Senator is the duty of advice and consent to the President's judicial appointments. I have worked hard throughout my career to ensure that the Senate provides the Federal courts with a steady supply of judges to enforce our Federal laws. 
But, after serving on the Judiciary Committee for the last 20 years, and after serving as U.S. Senator from Delaware for the last 25 years, this is my first opportunity to recommend a Federal district court judge for Delaware. 
I took this responsibility very seriously. And I have no doubt that Greg Sleet is the most qualified and experienced person for this position. 
This is the second time President Clinton has put Greg's name through the rigors of Senate confirmation. But this is no surprise--he enjoys a reputation for impeccable integrity in the Delaware legal community. 
In 1993, when I recommended Greg as U.S. attorney for Delaware, President Clinton was wise to follow my advice--he could not have nominated a more qualified, well-rounded, experienced Delawarean. 
Greg was confirmed unanimously and flawlessly, and for the past 4 years has exceeded even my highest expectations. 
And it is not only his distinguished service for Delaware, but also the breadth of Greg's experience that has impressed Delawareans, and convinced me that he will make a distinguished Federal judge. 
Greg is a graduate of Rutgers University School of Law and completed his undergraduate work at Hampton University in Virginia. 
He began his legal career in 1976 by serving for 7 years as a Philadelphia public defender--arguing before juries and representing indigent defendants at all stages of the criminal process--from pre-trial through the appellate courts. 
He than gained experience in civil litigation, civil rights, estates, and criminal defense as an associate in private firms--most recently as a sole practitioner for his own firm. I know how tough--and rewarding--running your own firm can be. 
In 1990, Greg began his service as deputy attorney general for the State of Delaware, where he gained experience prosecuting a variety of criminal cases at the State level. 
He has practiced corporate and commercial law as well--working as an attorney in the legal department for Hercules Inc., where he helped manage corporate operations and litigation, and provided advice on acquisitions and antitrust matters. 
Since Greg became U.S. attorney, he has demonstrated strong leadership as my State's chief Federal law enforcement officer-- 
He has developed a solid reputation by prosecuting many significant criminal cases, including numerous Federal drug and gun cases. 
He has prosecuted hate crimes and fraud cases more aggressively than ever before. 
And, in addition to his accomplishments in the criminal court at the Federal level, he has made it a priority to strengthen the civil division in Delaware's U.S. attorney's office. 
Mr. President, I will not take up any more time--other than to repeat my `bottom line' from Greg's Judiciary Committee hearing: 
Greg Sleet's record speaks for itself--the Federal bench needs judges like him. His background makes him exceptionally qualified to service on the Federal bench, and his record shows that he is tough--as we need our Federal judges to be--with the practical abilities and experience to do the job. 
I am deeply proud to be associated with Greg's service as Delaware's U.S. attorney, and look forward to his service as a U.S. district court judge. 
I commend my colleagues for taking the time to review Greg's record and thank them for their support for the candidacy of this fine nominee.

Mr. BIDEN. I think what is really at the heart of this is what was said, if I am not mistaken, in a sort of dress rehearsal of this debate--the Senator from Virginia and I appeared before a group of Connecticut voters who were down here at the request of one of our colleagues, Senator Dodd. He may remember my saying the real debate on the floor is going to be whether there should be NATO. 
The only thing I would like to state now, before I make my opening statement--in the context of a question so the floor hasn't been yielded to me; ordinarily I would not put it in the context of a question--is that isn't the real debate here, if there is no strategic rationale for expanding, if there is discussion questioning the strategic doctrine of NATO as it exists now, as Senator Bingaman said, and if there is no threat at all, as my friend from New Hampshire says, the real question is--this is a veiled way of us saying: Should we have NATO at all? If there is no threat to France, no threat to Germany, no threat to Poland, then obviously don't expand but also don't have NATO. If there is a threat at all to Germany or to France or the other 15 nations, or 13 nations, then there is clearly a threat to Poland or to the Czech Republic. 
You cannot have both. This call of no threat either present or anticipated, indicating there is no need to expand, I think, leads one to the conclusion that if they take that view, there should not be NATO. So I don't know why you don't just stand up and say why don't we just eliminate NATO because there we are spending, for assets devoted to NATO, counting our national budget, over $100 billion a year.

Mr. BIDEN. I think the Senator has just made an overwhelming case why the Poles think it is so important. The Senator just points out, World War I, World War II--by the way, for those wars to get to France they had to roll over Poland first on the way. Then the reason why there was no war, as the Senator points out, after World War II--a cold war, not a hot war--is we had NATO. And the nations that we extended the umbrella of NATO to were kept free from fear of attack. Guess what. Poland was occupied during that whole period. 
Now Poland is no longer occupied, and they are worried that the world may have the same kind of amnesia that it had in 1917, and 1916, and 1915--and 1938 and 1939 and 1940. They are kind of worried because they figured it out, if you are under this umbrella, it dissuades anyone from invading you. 
So if it is a rationale to keep Germany in NATO, and NATO protects Germany because that gives it that added security, you can 
kind of understand why the Poles think it also makes sense for them, since they have been the doormat to Western Europe. 
There is much more to say about this. I will not go on. But the point is that NATO membership significantly reduces the prospect that anyone now or in the future would conclude that you are a worthy target of their aggression. That is the point the Senator is making. And the clear notion is that if in fact Poland were part of this alliance, to take one country, they would not have to wonder any longer whether or not they would have to wait for the Brits to do something--as occurred in World War II. They would not have to wonder if Russia or anyone else understood that Poland was no longer the doormat of Europe. 
If all goes well, as I anticipate, and I vote with my taxpayers' pocketbook to try to promote democracy in Russia--if all goes well, then in fact there is not any greater need in Russia for Poland to be a member of NATO than for Germany to be a member of NATO. There may be no need for NATO. Or it may be that Russia is part of NATO. But we are in a position, as the Washington Post says:  
American interest in expansion lies in reducing unpredictability and instability in an arc that has generated the century's major wars. 
One of the things, as the Post and many others have tried to point out, and as I have tried to point out on the floor before, part of Russia's necessary post-cold war evolution, mental evolution, if you will, is to understand and consider the novel notion that its neighbors have a right to whatever national orientation they want. Most other democracies in the world have figured that out. Most other nations have figured that out. And if you are not going to--the current likelihood that there is little danger that is posed for these three countries or any other part of Europe, it seems to me, again to paraphrase the Post, `makes it smart and a cheap buy for the extra security now, in case things don't go the right way.' 
But the bottom line is this: If, in fact, there is a rationale for us to continue to be a member of NATO, and I believe there is, and to continue to make commitments to the likes of Germany and other allies--if there is a rationale for expanding NATO on the Soviet Union's border bringing in Turkey not too many years ago, there is a rationale to bring Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary under that umbrella. 
I will conclude--and I thank my colleague for allowing me to respond--but I conclude by suggesting to you that the way to the greatest certainty that Russia continues along its democratic trek and nonimperialistic instinct is to have these nations within NATO, forever removing the realistic possibility that they are part of the hegemony of the former Soviet Union or Russia.

Mr. BIDEN. Let me respond, if I may, to the question of urgency and the process to clarify the issue of going to Poland's defense. 
My point about going to Poland's defense did not relate to whether Americans were courageous, were good, were bad, or kept or didn't keep a commitment. It was a statement of fact. 
My friend talks about the real world. The real world, that was 1939. We got in the war on December 7, 1941. In the meantime, nothing happened. We were a major power. My colleague points out that we weren't militarily prepared. By our own choice, we weren't militarily prepared. But other nations that were allegedly militarily prepared were powers on the continent. They also did nothing, and they watched. 
All I am pointing out to you is, from a Pole's standpoint, it is of little consequence to tell them, `Don't worry, if you're ever threatened, we'll be there, we'll be there.' That would be like 
saying to most Poles, `The check's in the mail.' 
They look at history, like other nations have looked at history, and they know what has happened to them, and they know the powers who had power did not respond when power was available and they were in trouble. I think it is unrealistic to think that we should expect the Poles to assume that, especially with some of the comments made by my colleagues on the floor in this debate over the last couple weeks about whether or not it is in our vital interest that Poland be free. That question was raised on the floor, and it is raised constantly in the minds of those who deal with the issue of European security. 
So, from the Polish standpoint, there is a clear, clear reason for them to know and understand that there is a big difference between being part of an alliance where the sacred word and trust of a nation is committed in advance and being left to the vagaries of rationalization on the part of a country after the fact to justify why they did or did not go to the aid of a country in question. It is a big difference. If it is not a big difference, then why do we have any treaties at all? 
With regard to the real world--let's look at the real world. The real world is, as my friend from Virginia has pointed out, that we have committed over $2 billion dealing with arms control agreements and providing American dollars to allow them to keep a commitment that they made with regard to arms control treaties. 
All of the Western European nations, the United States included, have contributed over $100 billion to Russia since the wall has come down and the empire has broken up. We, along with our other NATO allies, have taken the unprecedented step, accused by many on the right of having yielded our sovereignty to Russia by doing the NATO-Russian accords where they have full transparency within NATO. 
We have and continue to seek ways in which to restore--`restore' is the wrong word; there never was a democracy--seek to provide the circumstances where democracy can flourish in a market economy with American tax dollars and German tax dollars and French tax dollars. So there is no reason--no reason--whatsoever for the Russians--no real world reason for the Russians to conclude that they are viewed as the enemy, the enemy by us. Any indirect comparison to the Weimar Republic is bizarre. We were exacting reparations from them; we are sending dollars, we are sending deutsche marks, we are sending francs, we are sending pounds to Russia, maybe not as much as we should, in the minds of some of us, but we are. 
With regard to the urgency, the worst time in the world to have to enlarge an alliance is at the moment of threat, because then it leads the other country in question to conclude that if they do not act out what we fear they will do before the alliance is reached, they will be in a weaker position. 
I respectfully suggest that urgency isn't the question. The question relates to, Is this the time and the moment, 9 years after the wall has come down--almost 9 years now after the wall has come down--to end once and for all the artificial boundaries and the ability of any nation, including Russia, to suggest that individual nations within Central and Eastern Europe do not have the ability to choose their own natural and national alliances? 
That is the urgency. The urgency is, the opportunity is here. It is the cheapest way to do it. It did not come as a consequence of any fad. It was debated and reflected among the NATO nations, not a decision made alone by the United States of America. 
Fifteen other European nations thought it was in their interest and the interest of the West, did not feel that it would increase their jeopardy and offend the Russians to do this, and unanimously all voted to take in these three nations. The only debate related to whether we should take in three or five. That was the debate among our NATO allies. 
So let me conclude--and I thank my colleague again for yielding this time--the urgency is that this is the most propitious time to end--to end--the artificial division of Europe and the implicit recognition that any country in Europe, including Russia, has the right to some buffer zone or has the right to impact upon the national decisions of a neighbor in that neighbor's determination to enter into a defensive alliance they view in their national interest--and I emphasize the word `defensive.' 
I yield the floor and thank my colleague.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I think again we should focus on what my colleague from New Hampshire said about the real world. I think that is a legitimate point to make. 
The real world several years ago was, we had 338,000 American troops in Europe. Today we have 100,000. That should make it awfully clear to Russia that ours is not an aggressive posture. The expansion of NATO is not for purposes of encircling and/or crushing Russia. The real world is, all indicia out there that are available for the Russians to look at--I understand the psychology, but the real world is, there is no threat, this is a defensive alliance. 
With regard to drawing lines--I do not suggest in any way, in mentioning what I am about to say, that my friend from New Hampshire in any way wishes to ratify Yalta, but the practical fact of the matter is, Yalta was a deal made out of at the time, viewed by that President at the time, a necessary requirement to basically say, `Hey, look. Hey, look, you've got this sphere of influence. This is the line drawn in Europe.' At the time, there was not this anticipation there was going to be this carnage that would result, there would be this overwhelming suppression that would result. `But here is the deal. Here is the line we are going to draw you. You have this buffer zone.' That is what it was all about. 
To say now that these nations cannot come in is to ratify in a different way but the same line. Why? `You can't come in because the successor to the Soviet Union--Russia--does not want you in.' So when I say `redrawing the lines,' I say, to say they cannot come in ratifies the old line drawn after World War II. 
And when you erase that line, it is, in my view--and I respect the Senator from New Hampshire and all those who oppose expansion, but I argue it does not send a line closer to the Soviet Union for purposes of encircling; it says that there is no automatic line either of us, East or West--Russia-the United States, Russia-Germany, Russia-anyone else--is going to say, ipso facto, that no nation can make its own choice as to wherein they wish to have their alliance reside. That is what it says. That is what it says. 
So, therefore, when I say `redrawing a line'--excuse me, `erasing a line,' the line I am talking about erasing is Yalta. And separate and apart from the physical occupation of those countries, at its root it was an admission and an acknowledgment of a sphere of influence of one country over--over--the fate of other countries in Central and Eastern Europe on the grounds that to do otherwise would put them in jeopardy, they had a right to at least indirectly control the national decisions of those nations relative to where they viewed their security to lie, in what alliance, if any. 
So to not extend, in fact, in my view, is a bold confirmation that that sphere of influence still remains. And that is a tragic historic mistake, in my view.

Mr. BIDEN. Before the Senator leaves the floor, let me thank him again for allowing me to engage and be engaged while he spoke. 
Before he leaves the floor, I indicated to Senator Warner, and at least in an informal way I invite the Senator--it requires no invitation--I invite the Senator from New Hampshire, maybe we can work out a time tomorrow where those interested in the cost issue would be here to debate. 
The cost of $250 billion for expansion of NATO is bizarre, in my humble opinion. I will lay it out in detail why it is tomorrow. All of NATO combined, including our national budget now, doesn't cost but half that, less than half of that. How adding three nations would more than increase over 200 percent over the cost--I guess I assume the Senator is talking over a 10-year period--but essentially increase by 50 percent the costs of NATO is beyond me. 
I think it may be orderly and useful to our colleagues and to the public if those of us who, as the Senator from New Hampshire does, have spent a lot of time researching the detail related to the cost in trying to decipher and explain the reasons for the inconsistent numbers. The inconsistent numbers relate to what we talk about as the unified budget, the national budget, and so on, what we allocate as part of our--for example, we spend a lot of money, $300 billion a year, roughly, for defense. Is that all accountable to NATO? Do we say that the United States is spending $300 billion a year on NATO? What portion of that is the consequence of us belonging to NATO? When we build a runway and so on, is it because of NATO? 
The NATO budget and the cost relating to expansion I think are very, very important and warrant a very focused and coherent presentation by each of us. 
I will be here tomorrow prepared to do my best to outline in detail why we are talking more on the order of $40 million a year rather than $200 billion, and I will lay out my reasons. Hopefully, Senator Warner and Senator Smith and others will come and lay out in detail why they believe rather than picking an estimate that has been set out by someone, explain how they arrive at those numbers. 
I must say, if you tell my constituency to keep NATO--forget expanding, if you told them to keep NATO--it was going to cost them $250 billion, I imagine the referendum in my State would go through like a hot knife through butter. They would say get out. Obviously, if you set a number where the costs could be from $40 million to $150 billion, as I think the Princeton Survey was, although I may have heard it incorrectly, that came hot off the press, obviously a majority of the people would say, `I am not for that. You mean to tell me I'm signing on for 150 billion bucks?' 
I will be here tomorrow, and it might be useful to pick a time when we can be here, all of us interested in the cost, to debate it in some detail. 
In the meantime, I will take this opportunity to make a broader statement and I will respond to some of the things said today.

Mr. BIDEN. It will arrive in the form of the Senator from Delaware. We do have a formal estimate of the cost, and the chairman of the full committee was, I think, being his usual diplomatic self in saying that. Maybe it is best that we debate this in a coherent way and a very specific way. So that is why he asked the Senator to submit in writing, if I am not mistaken--Senator Warner submit in writing; I was not here at the time--his questions and the basis of his analysis of the cost and he would come back with a formal response.

Mr. BIDEN. Maybe we could all try to work out a time through our offices if they are listening, although I'm not sure when I speak my office listens, but if they are listening, maybe the other offices might see if we can coordinate a time on the floor tomorrow where we could enlighten one another and enlighten the country about the cost of the matter. 
Mr. President, as the Senate begins reconsideration of the resolution of ratification for enlargement--and I and others who are for or against expansion all agree on one thing: I strongly believe it was a mistake, for whatever scheduling reasons, to have brought this up, then delayed it, put other things before it, and then brought it back up. So my hope is--and those who support expansion and those who oppose it have all communicated to their respective leaders that we hope nothing will intervene during the consideration of this debate so that we can give it the time and attention and detail that the public is entitled to. 
The truth of the matter is, all those folks sitting back behind the bar, back there on both sides, they, along with me and a number of others, have already devoted hundreds of hours to this. This is not a new deal. This is not something that all of a sudden we woke up one morning and said, you know, I feel like expansion today, let's expand, and here we go, let's go through it. This has been a long, serious debate, which has taken place within NATO among the military types and the political types. It has taken place within the national governments of each of the other NATO nations. It has taken place within this country, within the administration. 
There was a NATO observers group that, in my 25 years in the Senate, was granted unprecedented access to the decisionmaking process. There were 28 of us, the bulk of whom participated, while the decision to invite, if to invite, and who to invite, to join NATO was being made. We went to Europe on several occasions. I bet there were at least a half dozen trips of the NATO advisers to Europe to meet with the military in each of the existing NATO countries and all of the aspirant countries. 
I myself spent time with my colleague, Dr. Haltzel, next to me here at the moment. We went to Russia, we went to Poland, we went to the Czech Republic, and to Hungary, and to Slovenia, and we met with all of the relevant parties--every leader of every major faction within the political spectrum in Russia today. We had long, private, and sometimes contentious, but always frank meetings. We met with military personnel. We met with the Polish Chief of Staff of the military. We met with the Defense Minister, the Prime Minister, and every major player. We did the same in each of the countries in question. We have hosted the NAC. I was at a meeting with Senator Roth--I am the cochair and he is the chair of the NATO observer group--where there was so much brass in the room, I thought the floor was going to crack. If I am not mistaken--and I may be mistaken--I think the person comparable to our chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was present for every one of the nations in question, every one of them. I am serious. We debated and we argued and we discussed. It was open and frank. There is nothing new about this, and there is nothing quick about it. 
The wall went down almost 9 years ago. The Soviet Union crumbled. It ended its existence. That was not yesterday, but a long while ago, in political terms. No one rushed out to judgment. The other thing I should point out is that we, under Secretary Perry, the predecessor to Senator Nunn, sent out a group of what he called the Perry principles, the requirements that each--I said Senator Nunn, who was our colleague who I wish was still here; he has a different view from me on this. Senator Cohen is the Secretary of Defense. I know it, Bill, if you are listening, I know it is Senator Cohen. But the truth of the matter is that Secretary Perry set out some criteria that were minimum requirements for any aspirant country to have to meet. By the way, just setting out criteria has fundamentally changed the dynamic and the picture in Central and Eastern Europe, without even joining NATO. 
If I told my colleagues in 1992 that I believed by the year 1998 that we would have a circumstance where there was an accommodation to the Hungarian minority in Romania or that any border disputes or claims were settled by Eastern European countries--and I could name them--and a whole range of other things, that there would be total civilian control of the military in Poland, et cetera, I think they would have thought that probably wasn't going to happen. But because we said to all nations who wish to be part of NATO, hey, look, there are certain basic drop-dead requirements to even be considered, democracies who lack imperial designs, abide by certain rules, and here are the minimum rules even to get in the game, and we laid them out--I might note, parenthetically, that I attended a conference with some leading Chinese Government folks--not dissidents--and we get the same kind of arguments with regard to China. If you want China to continue its market programs and market economies, you have to go easy on them. You have to back up and you have to slow up. 
The question I raised there was, hey, wait a minute, if in fact you want to be part of the civilized world and seek civilized behavior and civilized treatment, when you sign an agreement and make a deal, should we not hold you to that deal? There are certain minimum requirements to be able to establish your bona fides as even an aspirant democracy or a market economy. 
In the case of Russia, can anybody in Russia say now, next year, or could they say yesterday that the minimum requirement for a peaceful democracy is, by the way, my neighbor has a right to choose, assuming it is nonthreatening to me, whatever alliance they wish. It is called their national sovereignty. We relinquish any claim to hegemony. It seems to me to be a minimum nonstarter if you fail to do that, a minimum requirement, a nonstarter, if you fail to do that. How have we threatened Russia? I am the author of the act that became the Freedom Support Act under President Bush. What have we done to threaten Russia? The irony is how the tables are turned here. 
In the early 1970's, some of my conservative colleagues would look at me as if I were an apologist for the Soviet Union. And here I am now saying expand NATO to include these three nations, assuming they meet the criteria, and extend beyond what we already have, a hand of friendship and help to Russia. They are not inconsistent. As a matter of fact, in my humble opinion, if you would like to diminish the drive toward democratization in Russia, if you would like to diminish the prospects of an emerging market economy in Russia, let the browns and the reds, let the nationalists within Russia crow about how their unsatisfactory response to expansion in NATO was the reason why the United States did not go along and vote to expand NATO. If you want to give antidemocratic forces in Russia a boost, that is a good one. That is the one to do. 
That is not the intention of any of my colleagues. This is a legitimate, honest, and open debate. I am not questioning the motives of any man or woman in this body. Not a one of us desire anything other than security in Europe and a democratic Russia. That is a universe that all of us can agree on in this body. 
I think we kind of have it backwards, because, as I said earlier, I think what is strung throughout this, as Senator Warner and Senator Smith of New Hampshire--I do not want to put words in their mouths. So I will say they did not take strong exception to my saying what this is really about is whether or not there should be a NATO; not whether or not to expand NATO but whether or not there should be a NATO. That is a legitimate debate. We have not addressed that in 50 years. For 50 years, we have said this is a good thing. The world has changed, as they point out. It is legitimate to debate whether or not we should even have NATO. But let's not confuse expanding to include these three countries with whether or not there should even be a NATO. If it is about NATO and its existence, let's debate it. Because, as I said, I constantly hear, What is the threat? My response is, If you don't think there is any threat now or in the future, why NATO? Why not save a lot more money? Why not bring all 100,000 folks home? Let's do that. Some would say, yes, let's do that. But I think it is real important we get our facts straight. After a tremendous amount of study and discussion by more than 70 Senators and 4 different committees, and the Senate NATO observer group, before we began the debate, we began on the floor last month to focus attention on whether we were going to vote up or down for or against expansion. 
So I welcome this climactic debate. As with many momentous decisions, there are legitimate questions to be asked, and it is always easier to criticize than create. But, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues not to fall into the trap of failing to see the forest for the trees. Let's step back a little bit and take a look at the big picture. 
By enlarging NATO membership to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, we will merely be catching up with reality. For centuries, these three countries have been part of the West. Four decades of Communist oppression and isolation was the historical aberration that has been all but corrected culturally and economically. Prague, Budapest, and Warsaw are now every bit as European as Madrid, Paris, and Berlin. It would be, in my view, indeed, perverse to recreate Stalin's immoral and artificial dividing line through the heart of Europe. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic belong in NATO, and in the European Union. They will soon join these organizations. 
I would parenthetically note, if you were a Russian and you had the choice of having other European nations near you join NATO, or join the EU, I suspect they would view their economic interests as the most negatively impacted upon by the EU being enlarged and them not being a part of it. 
What are we talking about? We talk about how we are offending the Europeans or expanding the EU. We are offending Russia to expand the European Union. Great. Great. You are sitting in Russia. Hey, good idea. I now have bilateral relationships that work pretty well with Poland and with Hungary and with these other countries. But I will tell you, they are now going to join the EU, and we don't get a piece of the action. 
Look, you cannot have it both ways. If this is about Russian pride, Russians feeling they are not part of the West, Russians not being involved in a way that they see their future in the West, then how does isolating them economically in the same way it is isolating them militarily, how does that convince any Russian leader? `They won't let me sell my widgets in Paris. But they say I am part of the West. They are welcoming me. I need to sell my widgets so I can employ my people.' 
The same polls we hear bandied about--the last poll I recall being conducted in Russia, the Russian people didn't even raise 
NATO on the scale of concern. Zero. Literally zero, of little or no concern to them. 
So it would be perverse if we were to say that, `Hey, by the way, you can't join NATO until you are part of the EU.' As if Russian is going to say, `Oh, that's a good idea. I really want Poland in the EU and a member of NATO. That will make me feel a lot better.' 
It is kind of hard to get a handle on this. But let me just read this poll: 53 percent say Poland--this is in Russia, a Gallup poll, March 14 of this year--53 percent say Poland should be allowed to join NATO. 
Did you hear what I just said? Fifty-three percent say Poland should be allowed to join NATO; 57 percent say the Czech Republic should be allowed to join NATO; 54 percent say Hungary should be allowed to join NATO, and 25 percent had no view on the matter. Threat? That is one of the reasons I think, by the way, that the Russian people think that, No. 1. This is conjecture on my part; no poll says this. I cannot cite any evidence of this. But I think they are like the American people. They are pretty smart, intuitively pretty smart. They know if Poland is part of NATO that any of the harebrained schemes any of their leaders may have in the future about sending their boys to Poland will be eliminated. I think they are pretty smart. They kind of have us figured out. 
If, in fact, national Poland is a part of NATO, they realize their political leadership in the future, as well as what is already done now, will have to finally shed 500 years, from czar through commissar, of a notion that somehow in American terms there is a manifest destiny for Russia to control Poland or any other place west of their boundaries. 
Don't you kind of find it fascinating that a majority of the Russian people say these countries should be able to join? We talk about this like it is a vacuum, where we are operating in a vacuum. How about all those European countries, our allies? I am not suggesting we should take a different kind of poll; that is, the more nations that agree, the better it is. But in counter to the argument that you know the best way to bring Russia around permanently is not to have NATO expanded. But the countries who are most threatened by Russia over the years, don't you kind of find it fascinating they think expansion is a good idea? We hardly agree with the French on anything. We can't even agree with them on Coca-Cola. We hardly have similar values. We hardly agree on any foreign policy national matter, except NATO. They think it is a good idea. The Brits think it is a good idea. The Danes and Spaniards think it is a good idea. The Italians and Greeks think it is a good idea. It is the only thing the Greeks and Turks agree on. 
Those who argue for expansion sometimes exaggerate the benefits that flow from this picture. I assure you that those who argue against expansion vastly exaggerate it and the potential damage that can be done to the emergence of a democracy in Russia. 
I ask my colleagues: What are we worried about? Are we worried about Russia? Of course, in public most Russian politicians will grouse about NATO enlargement. Public pronouncements cost them nothing. But from my many conversations with Russian politicians, both here and in Moscow, I can tell you that not one--not one, I repeat, not one--think that the entry of Poland and Hungary and the Czech Republic into NATO will constitute a military threat to Russia, 
including a long private luncheon with Chernomyrdin not too long ago--2 weeks, 3 weeks ago, whenever he was here last. 
Now, it would be my opponents, the opponents of enlargement in this country, who will cite a range of issues on which Russia and the United States have different policies and then point the wagging finger at NATO enlargement as the universal culprit. One size fits all. Secretary Albright used an apt metaphor when she labeled NATO enlargement as the opponents' `El Nino.' They blame it for everything wrong in the United States-Russian relationship. 
But even a superficial familiarity with the recent history of our relationship gives the lie to such illogic. Russian Communists and ultranationalists were against ratifying START II before NATO enlargement was even a gleam in the eyes of Lech Walesa and Havel, let alone U.S. policy. Why were Russian Communists and ultranationalists against it? I'll tell you why. Because American arms control negotiators did a heck of a job, and Russia knew it. 
That does not mean that ratifying START II isn't in Russia's self-interest. It is. But it will take some hard swallowing for them to take that step. It's all part of Russia coming to terms with the end of an empire. And this difficult psychological adjustment lies at the root of the Russian rhetoric against NATO enlargement. But I repeat, when you get down to brass tacks in discussions with Russian leaders, absolutely none of them think that their country's security will be threatened by Polish, Czech, or Hungarian troops being part of NATO--none. 
Why should they worry? Do my colleagues really believe NATO is anything but a defensive alliance? Surely they don't want to validate crude Russian cold war stereotypes of NATO as a rapacious aggressor just waiting to invade Mother Russia. We all know that NATO never had a plan to invade Russia. Do you know what? The Russians know it, too. How do I know that? They know it because thanks to the NATO-Russia Founding Act, which was signed in Paris last May, Russians have a permanent physical presence at NATO headquarters in Brussels and at SHAPE headquarters in Mons, Belgium. They take part in all discussions with NATO members, and they see for themselves that NATO has no hostile intentions. 
If they don't believe my analysis, let me quote from an article by the Defense Minister of the Russian Federation in the spring of 1999 edition of the NATO Review. The very fact that the Russian Defense Minister is now contributing, I might add, to the NATO Review, I believe says something in itself, as does the title of his article: `We Are Not Adversaries, We Are Partners.' 
Although the Russian Defense Minister repeats the obligatory negative attitude toward NATO expansion, the vast majority of his article stresses the positive. In particular, he declares:  
Today it is an established fact that Russia and NATO no longer regard each other as adversaries. * * * Moreover, a partnership in maintaining peace and security on the continent has begun to take shape in our relations. The NATO-Russia Founding Act is an example of this. 
It doesn't sound to me like a guy who thinks that expansion jeopardizes the security interest of his country. So let's give the Russians a little credit for being intelligent, thinking people who are not captives of outdated, ideological propaganda. From the Gallup Poll I read you, clearly the Russian people are not. And, obviously, the Russian military is not either. 
If some of my colleagues still don't believe me, I direct their attention to the balance sheet of recent Russian international behavior. On the negative side, from America's point of view, is their unwillingness to follow our lead on inspections of suspected Iraqi military sites, weapons sites. 
Does anyone really think this had anything whatsoever to do with NATO enlargement? Russia has two centuries worth of involvement in the Middle East, has had Iraq as a major client for decades, has a foreign minister who specializes in that area and has had a lengthy personal friendship with Saddam Hussein. It is nothing to do with NATO. 
I may be wrong, but I doubt that when Mr. Primakov and Saddam 
Hussein get together, they talk about the evils of the enlargement of NATO. 
And, I might add parenthetically, if the reason why the Russians didn't go along with our plan--someone explain to me, my ancestors, the French, how did they arrive at that? Was their decision to side with Russia relative to inspectors because of NATO enlargement? I think it was. I think it was. It is bizarre--I am only joking. I don't think it was. 
So, you can't have it both ways. It is often cited: You know, they were with us in the gulf war. France was with us in the gulf war. It was a different circumstance. A country had been invaded. They are not with us now, nor is France with us this time. 
How about Iran, another irritant in our relationship with Russia? Russia's involvement with Persia is even older than that with the Arab world. We certainly must and do oppose Russian investment in Iran and arms shipments and technology transfers to that country. But, again, their policies are grounded on historic geopolitics on their southern flank, economic distress, and lax controls--not on NATO expansion. 
Or let me frame the issue another way. I ask the critics of NATO enlargement, if NATO rejects enlargement, rebuffs Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, who have met NATO's rigid membership qualifications, is anyone going to be prepared to come to the floor here--the staffs of the opponents are listening here--is anyone going to come to the floor and say, if we reject NATO expansion, and we do it on the floor in the next week or so, that out of heartfelt gratitude you are going to see Russia break off relations with Iran, break off relations with Iraq--which is what we wish them to do--and immediately ratify the START agreement? What do you think? 
If Senator Roth and I lose on this one, I'm willing to bet you a year's salary, and that is all I have is my salary. It's plenty, but that's all I have. I am willing to bet you a year's salary--that's a joke. I'm not allowed to bet on the floor. I don't really mean it. I'll get letters saying Biden is gambling with his salary. But I will bet you anything that I'm allowed to bet that circumstances, in terms of the ties with Iran and Iraq, will increase, not diminish; that there will be less prospect for future arms control because the nationalists will have prevailed and they will triumph, and they will trumpet their triumph. So, look, if NATO expansion is the reason these bad things are happening to the extent they are happening, then obviously, if it's defeated, a lot of good things are going to happen. Don't hold your breath. 
Let's turn to the other side of the ledger and go back for a minute to arms control. What is Russia's recent record? I keep hearing from my friend from Virginia: You know it's going to be the end of arms control. Everything is going to come to a screeching halt because this occurred, because we voted to expand --so on and so forth. Let's look at the record. Much as opponents of NATO enlargement would like to forget, the facts are that within the past year the state Duma and Federation Council have ratified two critically important international treaties. One is the Flank Document to the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe. As the Presiding Officer and all my colleagues know, that is the treaty that talks about how much materiel, armored personnel carriers, et cetera, weapons, heavy weapons that each side could have and where they could have them. 
We just modified that agreement. They ratified it--an arms control agreement. 
With regard to the Chemical Weapons Convention, I was told once we passed it here, that would be the end of it in the Duma. If I am not mistaken, it was almost the very day we were in either Paris or Spain where the President and the 15 other NATO heads of state were inviting--inviting--these three additional countries to join that by an overwhelming vote, their version of our Senate and House, the Duma, went ahead and overwhelmingly ratified a very controversial arms control agreement requiring them to destroy thousands of tons of chemical weapons. 
Even now, the Yeltsin government has pledged to push for ratification of START II. Russia is well ahead of schedule in its destruction obligations under START I, and the Russians continue to work with us in implementing the vitally important Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. That doesn't sound like a country that is so blinded by hatred for NATO enlargement that it is opting out of international arms control agreements. 
How about cooperation in conventional weapons? I might add, Chernomyrdin, when he met with us here, predicted by the end of summer, he was confident that they would ratify the START II treaty. But how about conventional weapons? Russia and the United States and 28 other countries signed the CFE Treaty and, as a consequence, destroyed more than 53,000 pieces of heavy equipment in this decade. And the process continues. 
Does that sound like a country that is opting out, figuring there is a threat and they are going to stop and start to rebuild? Not only not rebuild it, they are continuing to meet their obligations under the CFE Treaty and destroying military equipment. 
Let me say that again. More than 53,000 tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery pieces and helicopters, and guess what, NATO enlargement hasn't stopped this remarkable process on multilateral disarmament, and it won't stop it after Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic finally join the alliance. 
Finally, NATO enlargement has not prevented Russian forces from serving side by side with U.S. forces under NATO command in Bosnia. In my last of several trips to Bosnia, I was standing at what we call Camp McGovern. I was standing out in the field talking to an American one-star general. A Russian colonel who looked every bit like the guy who fought Sylvester Stallone in Rocky IV, whatever that was, ramrod straight, 6 foot 3, wearing a Russian uniform, comes up, seeks to interrupt, salutes the American general and asks what his orders are. 
I don't know. For all this lack of cooperation we are talking about, how much the Russians hate expansion, how much they view it as a threat, how it is going to bring to a crashing end any cooperation on military matters, on arms control, conventional and strategic, I don't see it. I see no evidence to suggest that. 
For someone like me of the cold war generation, this was mind-boggling to watch this Russian colonel salute an American general. In spite of the policy differences between Moscow and Washington with regard to Bosnian Serbs, cooperation on the ground is exemplary. I heard the same thing from the Russian Ambassador who is deputy to the American civilian administrator in Brcko when I was in Bosnia. I scarcely need to say that neither the Russian colonel nor the Russian Ambassador had even one word to say about NATO enlargement. It was a nonissue to them. In fairness, there was no way I brought it up. It wasn't like they raised it and I responded. Nobody said anything to me. 
The salient point which the naysayers would like to obscure is that NATO enlargement is simply a matter of catching up with reality. It would be nothing less than grotesque, in my view, for the U.S. Senate, out of a totally misplaced fear of offending Russian sensibilities, to consign the thoroughly Western Poles, Czechs and Hungarians either to Moscow's sphere of influence or to a `gray zone' in Central Europe. 
Imposed spheres of influence have no place in Europe in the 21st century. Every country must have the right to choose its own 
political system, its own economic system, its own cultural direction and its own security arrangements, including whether or not to join the alliance. If we would reject the Poles, the Czechs and Hungarians for fear of antagonizing the Russians, the only people we would be helping would be the Russian ultranationalists and Communists by validating their outdated, vicious portrait of the United States, a view not shared by the democrats. 
The worst you hear, by the way, in Russia from Russian democrats, the worst you hear is not that `we think expansion is a threat, we think expansion will be a problem to us.' We know it is not. The worst you hear is `this expansion will or might give fodder to the ultranationalists and the Communists in our battle to establish democracy.' That is the worst you hear--the worst you hear. 
The only people, in my view, we would be helping if we rejected expansion would be the ultranationalists and Communists by, again, validating their outdated and vicious portrait of the West and their outdated and dangerous notion of what they are entitled to do in terms of influencing their neighbors. 
That rather obvious conclusion brings up a more basic point, which is regularly glossed over by the opponents of NATO enlargement. The choice is not between enlarging or maintaining the status quo; the harsh reality is that the status quo is not an option. 
It is myopic, in my view, to believe that three booming, vigorous Central European countries, all of whom have bitter historical memories of Russian domination, if rebuffed by NATO would sit idly by and trust good fortune to protect them. 
It should be obvious that they will not. They didn't do it in the interwar period earlier in this century, and they wouldn't do it now. The renationalization of security policy would take place, undoing all the stability that has been painstakingly created since the fall of communism. It would allow the poisonous forces of ethnic and religious hatred and international crime to regain a foothold in that volatile region. 
Nearly 60 million highly educated, talented Central Europeans are ready and willing to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area. All three candidate countries have carried out rigorous reforms to conform to NATO's political and military standards. All three have already contributed to NATO-led missions in the gulf war and in Bosnia. They will be an invaluable asset in controlling the forces of chaos and destruction that are now the real threats in Central and Eastern Europe. Indeed, this is the basic rationale for NATO enlargement--to extend the zone of peace and stability in Europe. It is a zone within which democracies do not fight with each other and which other countries, Russia included, need not fear. 
Obviously, there are certain risks associated with NATO enlargement, as there are with any policy initiative. But the risk of not enlarging NATO, of not catching up with history, in my view, are far greater. 
One other word about history. In the frantic flurry of last-minute attempts to derail ratification of NATO enlargement, I have even heard the accusation that we would be undermining the young Russian democracy, of helping to create a so-called `Weimar Russia.' Well, that charge wins the prize for historic illiteracy. 
After World War I, the victorious allies imposed punitive reparations upon Weimar Germany and kept it out of the League of Nations until 1926. 
After the cold war, on the contrary, the victorious West has done exactly the opposite with Russia. The United States and Western Europe have pumped more than $100 billion in aid and investment into Russia and have brought Russia into the international bodies where it was formerly not represented. They have even brought Russia into a working relationship with the inner councils of NATO itself. 
So please, in this round of Senate debate, let us spare ourselves hearing about `Weimar Russias' and `Iron Rings' and other ridiculous historic constructions. We are building a partnership with Russia which can continue to grow. Later in this session, Senators will have the opportunity to strengthen this process by voting resoundingly for the administration's enhanced funding request for assistance to Russia and the Nunn-Lugar program. I want to see all those who are opposed to expansion of NATO on the grounds of, it is going to offend Russia, to step up to the ball and do what they say they really are concerned about. Let us see them vote for enhanced funding for assistance to Russia and the Nunn-Lugar program. 
Another canard of the opponents of enlargement is that we will saddle the American taxpayer with mountainous new costs. Although I would invite my colleagues who wish to debate this to set a time tomorrow to do that, and do it in a coherent way, let me very briefly speak to that. 
Fortunately, we now have indisputable facts to refute this element of the basic scare tactic which is being engaged in: Is it going to cost $250 billion? $125 billion? and so on. NATO officials estimate that the total common cost of enlargement is $1.5 billion over 10 years. Of this, the share of the United States will be approximately $400 million, or an average of about $40 million per year over 10 years. And that is based upon our accepting the same proportion of responsibility for enlargement as we have for NATO thus far--burdensharing as we have been engaged in it for the past 20 years. 
As I said, later in the floor debate I hope to have an opportunity to explain this official cost estimate in some vivid detail. For now, however, I refer the doubters to the analysis of two U.S. Government agencies, the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office. 
The GAO concluded last month that NATO's approach to determining the $1.5 billion estimate over 10 years is reasonable. The CBO, which traditionally uses worst-case analysis as a hedge against any surprises in the future, set the common cost at $2.5 billion over the next 10 years. 
The worst estimate is one-tenth of what the worst estimate suggested by our colleagues is. Even the CBO figure, however, would yield an annual American contribution that amounts to only .15 percent of our total defense budget--.15 percent--almost only one-tenth of 1 percent. 
One final word is in order. No resolution, or even final legislation, is perfect. And there may be a few areas in the resolution of ratification that could be improved upon. Senator Helms and I plan to offer an en bloc managers' amendment that includes several of the amendments proposed to date. 
I anticipate that in these coming days several other amendments to the resolution of ratification will be offered and we will have ample time to discuss them. So I will not go into detail now. But, Mr. President, I see my senior colleague from Delaware is on the floor, so let me wrap up what I am about to say and what I have been saying in order to give him a chance to speak. 
Mr. President, it is important to note that the resolution of ratification is thoroughly a bipartisan product, as you will soon hear from my colleague from Delaware, a product in the committee crafted by the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms and myself, with significant input from other members of the committee and our respective staffs. It was voted out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by a vote of 16-2 after hundreds and hundreds of pages of recorded testimony for and against expansion. 
I urge my colleagues to reread the resolution before offering amendments, for upon careful scrutiny, some of them prove to be superfluous, others harmful, and some both. 
An example of this is the amendment introduced by my friend and distinguished senior Senator from Virginia which would mandate a 3-year pause for additional countries before they could be invited to join the alliance, if they were to be invited. This would tie our hands diplomatically, Mr. President, if, for example, a clearly qualified country like Austria should apply for membership, and will put an arbitrary hold on Slovenia's case for membership which I believe is already convincing. 
Other amendments offered by my friend, the distinguished senior Senator from New York, for whom I have no higher regard, would require new NATO members to first join the European Union. This, in my view, equates apples and oranges, forgetting that the criteria to qualify for those two organizations are dramatically different. 
Moreover, his amendment would turn the institutional history of the last 50 years on its head. Traditionally, NATO membership has preceded EU membership. And I would further add that he chooses, as we are trying to come up with a new architect for the security of Europe, a requirement to go forward first by a group of which we are not a member and in which we have no say. 
We are not a member of the EU. To suggest that, before we could consider membership in NATO, it has to be decided by the EU whether or not they can join essentially takes us out of the game. And every time we have been taken out of the game in Europe--I might note parenthetically, this is not a direct analogy--but every time we have been taken out of the game or taken ourselves out, there has been real trouble in Europe. We are still a European power. We must remain a European power. We must continue to have a major say in the structures of Europe, because we have found, when we do not, nothing good usually happens. 
Still other amendments proposed by the junior Senator from Texas and the junior Senator from Missouri would use the enlargement ratification process as a vehicle to alter the very fundamentals of the NATO treaty that exists today, either by changing the rules of the North Atlantic Council or by putting severe restrictions on non-article V missions--an issue that is being debated right now within NATO. 
I want to put my colleagues on notice that I will oppose any amendments that will undermine the most successful military alliance in history. 
Mr. President, nearly 50 years ago, NATO was founded to counter a Soviet threat in Western Europe and to establish stability in the rest of Europe. Today, the new threat is instability itself arising out of ethnic and religious conflicts. And this is, at a minimum, a hedge against any future wrongheaded decisions by Russia. Enlarging NATO to include Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary is a unique opportunity to expand the zone of stability in the continent. It serves America's interest, Europe's interest, and the world's interest. I am absolutely confident, if we do this, history will record, as well, it serves Russian interests. 
I thank the Chair, and I now am happy to yield the floor to my colleague from Delaware, Senator Roth.  
Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there is not much that my colleague from North Carolina, the chairman of the committee, has said that I take issue with. Sitting with my staff here, as I was waiting to speak, I said, `I have this long statement that is prepared that goes into detail about the bill. The truth of the matter is, the debate here is almost not about the bill, not about the conference report.' 
I can and I guess I will at some point do what I probably shouldn't do and that is second-guess what the rationale and motivation of the House leadership is and what the rationale and motivation of the President and administration is relative to the one thing that doesn't have a darn thing to do with what the Senator and I worked so hard to put together--and, I might add, the Presiding Officer, as well is a member of the committee. He will remember we spent a lot of time on this--a lot of time. 
There has been talk, led by my friend from North Carolina, about reorganizing the State Department for the past several years. Nothing ever really happened. There was a lot of work, don't get me wrong, but in terms of producing something that would become law, nothing ever happened. 
We have been debating and talking about U.N. arrearages. We have really been debating the U.N. arrearages, or whether or not it was a reasonable, functional, useful organization. That has been a raging debate probably since the mid-1980s. It has been around for a long time but, in terms of the political chemistry on this floor of the U.S. Senate, for the last probably 10 to 12 years in earnest. As a matter of fact, I think my friend from North Carolina would acknowledge with me that in both our political parties it has taken on, in the fringes of our parties, a status that far exceeds anything about what the United Nations does or doesn't do. On one end of my party it is the salvation of the world, and on the other end of the Senator's party it is the Devil incarnate. It has kind of replaced the fervor that involved the debate for and against communism. It is a new thing, a new political dynamic. 
We worked very hard and we actually came up with a resolution. I respectfully suggest that what we did--and we made serious compromises--the Senator from North Carolina did not come to this conclusion gently, nor did the Senator from Delaware in terms of the compromise relative to what we did in the United Nations here. But the vast majority of the people who are informed on this issue, both in politics and in the foreign policy establishment and in the world community, acknowledge that what we did is a reasonable, straightforward and, I think, significant piece of work. 
I don't want to get my friend from North Carolina in trouble. I think the most significant thing about it is the Senator from North Carolina signed on to this. That puts in perspective not only the arrearages but what he has wanted to do to get the United Nations to change its tune a little bit. Hopefully, we will not be arguing another decade about whether or not it is a salvation of the world or the Devil incarnate. We will have a pretty clear-eyed view of what we expect of the United Nations and what we think its value is. That is a very valuable contribution all by itself, in my opinion. 
The third thing we did here, and I am sure my friend will not mind my saying this because we both said it publicly in different iterations over the last year or so--when I inherited this job from the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, who retired, I went to see the chairman. We came here together, same year, same time. We have been friends; we have been ideological foes. We have been on the opposite sides on issues, and we have been together. We have been hanging out with each other for 25 years. I went to him and I said--which is, I guess, uncharacteristically blunt for me--`We can play this flat or we can play this round, Mr. Chairman; how do you want to do this?' 
He came back and said, `Joe, what are your priorities? What is important to you? This is what is important to me. Let's agree with what we can, and fight it out where we cannot agree.' He has 
kept his word in everything he said to me. I said, `It is important to me, with the end of the cold war, the Berlin wall down, that we do not cut back our foreign policy establishment.' As we are cutting back our defense establishment I think as far as we should cut it back, cutting back our defense establishment, there is a need for us to extend our foreign policy reach and establishment, whether it means embassies or consulates or enough personnel or intense involvement in other countries. He said, `It is not my intention in reorganization to emasculate the foreign policy,' the 150 function, as we call it in budget parlance. 
So the third piece of this deal here is the State Department has been trying to get full funding for all its operations for years. And it is in here. Now there are reorganization provisions. The President agreed to the reorganization, and we put the structure of it into this bill. The Administration didn't like some of it. But the Senator and I agreed it was necessary. And in return we got a pretty balanced package here. 
Now, so far, so good, as they say. The Senator, I think, is fond of telling the joke about the guy who jumps off the 100-story building and as he passes the 50th floor a group of people are standing at a window and yell out, `How is it going?' And the guy falling down says, `So far, so good.' That is how I felt about this whole operation. I am feeling real good. We just haven't hit the ground yet. Everything we have done I am, quite frankly, proud of. 
I think we have made what has to happen. In a democracy of 250 million people, we make compromises. But the end result is, I think this conference report strengthens the foreign policy and the ability to conduct foreign policy and the security of the United States of America. 
Now, that is the so-far-so-good part. We both knew, the chairman and I, that the President wanted fast track, something he feels very strongly about. He probably could have saved fast track if he were willing to compromise on Mexico City, although that wasn't attached. I understand at the end of the day there were some in the House who said, if you attach this, we will go along with fast track. He didn't do it then. He didn't do it on other things. 
By the way, I have to say for the Record, because I want to be straight up about this, my colleagues know this, but so that everybody understands how I approach this, the abortion issue is not one that I live and die on. I think government should stay out of the business. I vote against funding of abortion and I vote against restrictions on a woman's right to an abortion, which makes everyone angry with me. The only person happy with me is me, in my conscience. But this for me is not on the list of the 10 most important issues facing America. It doesn't make that list for me. I must admit I do not have the passion for or against what is being debated in here to think it is warranted or worthy of being attached to what I consider to be a serious array of foreign policy considerations affecting this Nation. 
On the other hand, the Senator from North Carolina does. It is a matter of great passion and commitment to him. His opposition to abortion from the day we arrived on this floor of the U.S. Senate and I first became acquainted with him to today has not waned a bit. I respect him for that. I disagree with his approach--at least most of it. I vote against funding, so that part we agree on, but I disagree with his approach. But I respect it, as I do people like my friend Senator Barbara Boxer and others who vehemently feel the other way on both funding and access. 
The reason I bother to tell you that, Mr. President, is this. It took nothing on my part, I had to make no compromise to say to our House friends and to our friends in the Senate, we want to keep Mexico City off of this; but it did take some real sacrifice on the part of my friend from North Carolina to say, as he did last year, look, keep this off. There are other vehicles. We can fight this out other places. Don't confuse it with this historic undertaking. 
We have, I think, accomplished, in at least what we passed out of the Senate--I will be straight up with everybody. We hung tough on that. The truth of the matter was neither one of us were able to affect the House's attitude toward this. The one thing I think we share a lot in common, the one thing the chairman and I share in common is we are realists. We have been here for 25 years; we know how this place works. 
This is not something that--not because we are so smart, you would have to be an idiot to be here 25 years and not know how it works--speaking for myself. It is pretty clear that once we could not control what would happen in the House and what Representative Smith--who, I might add, I suspect, although he knows a lot about the issue, knows a lot less about the issue than my friend from North Carolina. My friend from North Carolina was dealing with this issue before a lot of other people knew it existed. It became clear that we could not do much about it. 
Although the chairman and I still disagree on a number of things, one thing we have established--and I am proud of it, and I think he is too--is that we are absolutely straight with each other. So he came to me and said, `Look, Joe, this is in. They are going to compromise on this, but it's going to be in. So my position now, Joe, is it's in, so let's pass the whole thing.' I tried my best and kept my promise, I stuck with my commitment, but I told him, `If it's in, I am going to have a problem sticking with the deal--that is, pushing this through.' 
Let me tell you why. It has less to do with the merits of the argument relating to Mexico City than it does if we pass it here with this attached, even though the President will veto it. I am going to be completely blunt about this. If we pass this, my worry is that it will embolden the `Congressmen Smiths' and others to suggest that they can keep doing this on everything that comes over here. I want to tell my friend straight up, that is my rationale. 
I am of the view--and this is like reading the entrails of goats and guessing like the soothsayers did 2,000 years ago what is going to motivate Members of the House or an administration to act or not act. My feeling is, since the Senate has not passed this Mexico City language in the past, and there is a majority that votes against Mexico City language--and this is purely presumptuous on my part--if Speaker Gingrich, keeping his commitment to his people, put it in, he realizes and is able to say, the Senate will not pass this, the President will not veto it, let's move on; we have a better chance of getting to the spot we want to get to--the Senator and I--which is to clear up the U.N. arrearages, reorganize the State Department, and fully fund the State Department. 
So I guess what I am saying is, the only place we disagree is tactically what is the better thing to do to get what we both want, notwithstanding that we disagree on Mexico City. I vote against Mexico City restrictions; the Senator votes for them. But I don't think that is what is motivating either one of us here at this moment. To speak for myself, that is not what is motivating me at the moment. What motivates me at the moment is, what do I tell my colleagues on my side of the aisle, a fair number of whom listen to me on these issues--and that is presumptuous to say, but it is just because I am the ranking member. What do I tell them is the most likely route for us, at the end of the day, to be able to get the State Department reorganized, get the U.N. arrearages paid, and funding for the State Department through the supplemental? 
The conclusion I have reached--and I would not bet college tuition on it for my daughter--is to stand firm, demonstrate there are not enough votes here to pass Mexico City, with the knowledge the President is going to veto it and the pressure is to get on with the business of foreign policy. I 
could be wrong about that. 
One way or another, I think it is fair to say that at least the Senator and I know--from different perspectives--that isn't going to become law. The President is going to veto this with this language attached. I could--and I am inclined to, because I am proud of it--spend a great deal of time talking about the merits of each of the pieces of this conference report. I will refrain from that, because I would be preaching to the choir. I am preaching to the author here. It is not like I am going to say anything he doesn't know. 
I can put in the Record the details of what constitutes what we have accomplished and what is in the conference report. In many respects, the conference reported back a better bill than we put out. In many ways, it has been a better bill. But time is our enemy. Time is our enemy. 
I must again be completely blunt with my colleagues. At one point, I counseled that we not even debate this, let's vote, get it over with, and send it to the President and let it be vetoed. I believe the more time we take to deal with the U.N., the more difficult and intransigent the U.N. becomes, the harder it is for Ambassador Richardson to take what we have given him and get the results we want, the harder it is for us to unravel a State Department that needs unraveling, in terms of reorganization. Time is not our friend. 
I read on the way down this morning on the train--I commute every day from my home State of Delaware. I have a little ritual, and my friend knows about this. I read my local paper because of its interest and out of self-defense, I read the New York Times, and I read the Wall Street Journal, and that gets me to Baltimore. From Baltimore on, I prepare whatever I am going to do that morning. So commuting 4 hours a day isn't all bad, because you have a lot of time to prepare. 
On the way down, I read in the New York Times this morning's lead article about the IMF. It is pretty clearly unrelated to this issue but tangentially involved with the issue of Mexico City. But it looks like IMF isn't going to go anywhere. I will not put this in the Record. I don't often put in news articles. But this is on page 9 of the New York Times, entitled, `GOP Snubs White House on Billions for IMF.' 
Well, there are only three or four major foreign policy considerations on our plate right now. NATO is a big one, and the Senator and I will deal with this come Tuesday. Then there is IMF, the U.N., and reorganization of the State Department. It seems to me--and I do not in any way--and I give my friend my word on this--direct any of this at him or to anyone in particular. It seems a shame that three of those four major issues get tied up in what is in fact a divisive and, understandably, national debate relating to abortion. 
Sometimes I wish we had the House rules, which say that whatever you do has to be germane. But then I am not so sure, because I realize they can get the Rules Committee to do anything they want. But it is too bad we can't say that we are going to debate foreign policy and settle it, that we are going to fight out abortion, and that we will fight out education, and so forth. I understand the practical reasons why that is not the case, but the truth is that it creates real problems. 
The one and only place--and I will cease after this--where I disagree with my friend from North Carolina, the chairman of the full committee, is on this issue of whether or not there has in fact been a compromise that has been put forward by the House leadership on the issue of Mexico City. It has been stated--and this is the only place I disagree with my friend--that the House anti-abortion forces, led by Smith of New Jersey and Gingrich, the Speaker, compromised on 90 percent of what the Mexico City language is. In truth, I think that is illusory. I don't think there is any compromise. 
Let me for the record, for those who are going to make difficult decisions here on how to vote--I am going to vote no on this bill. The reason I am going to vote no on this bill is because I am opposed to Mexico City. That is true. But that is not the main reason I am going to vote no. To be honest with you, were I President of the United States, I would have a harder time deciding whether to veto this or not because I care so much about the three provisions. 
Arguably, someone could say why not swallow on another provision that you strongly disagree with, but in comparative weight, in terms of how it affects the national interest, arguably you should go ahead and not veto. But I am not President. I am a U.S. Senator. As a U.S. Senator, I am obliged to explain my rationale for why I am going to vote against this. I am reiterating what I said at the outset. I think if we vote no in this body, whether you are for or against Mexico City, we, quite frankly, take the House leadership off of a bit of a dilemma. I believe in my heart that much of the House leadership would rather this not have been in this bill. They know how important this is, even though I am not questioning their support for the Mexico City language. 
It is a little bit like my saying I feel very, very strongly about tobacco companies being able to target advertising to children--very strongly. I think they have been outrageous in what they have done. Should I attach that tobacco language to this foreign policy bill? Would that be appropriate no matter how strongly I feel about it? Should I say I am not going to fund the United Nations arrearages, I am not going to reorganize the State Department, I am not going to fund the State Department, and, by the way, although it is not in this bill, I am not going to replenish the International Monetary Fund even though there is an economic crisis in Asia that could still spill over to the United States? And the single most significant thing we could do to stop that from happening is regenerate confidence to the degree that everyone knows there is enough money in the IMF to help these countries get back on their feet. Should I say because of my feeling about tobacco advertising that I am ready to scuttle all three of those? I think that is inappropriate. 
I think the House leadership--I could be wrong, but I think the majority of the House thinks it is inappropriate. It does not matter. A minority in the House, as has occurred in the Senate, with Democrats as well as Republicans, on other issues, both of us have attacked it. I think the strongest message we could send is to stop it. The Senate is not going to accept it. The President clearly will not accept it, because then I think the leadership on the other side will say, `Look, minority within our minority. I know this is important to you. I kept my commitment to you. We tried it. Now let's get down to the business of the Nation.' 
I could be wrong about that. But that is why Joe Biden is voting against the thing that he, at least 49 percent, was responsible for creating, this bill, along with the 51 percent of my friends, including the Senator from North Carolina. I cannot think of anything other than the crime bill that I put as much time into than this. This is a little bit like sacrificing your child. I put a lot of time and energy, and my staff put in hundreds of hours, as has the chairman's staff. I am proud of our product. But I know the President is going to veto this. What is going to embolden the Chris Smiths of the world to continue to throw a monkey wrench into the foreign policy of this Nation? 
My point to my colleagues on my side of the aisle is to vote no. That, coupled with the President being against it, maybe will allow us to get down to the regular business of the Senate again. But I could be wrong. 
Again, this is a tactical judgment, from my standpoint, on how we get on with conducting the foreign policy of this Nation and taking on our responsibilities in the U.S. Senate to do that. 
But having said that, let me make sure everybody understands 
what Mexico City is. You say to people out there, `Well, this is about Mexico City. Well, is it about smog? What do you mean Mexico City? What is this about? Corruption? Drugs? No. It is about Mexico City. 
Mexico City is a consequence of a reference to a meeting which took place on population planning back in 1984 where a whole bunch of nations got together under the auspices of the U.N. They were going to meet in Mexico City and decide how they should deal with the notion of population planning. The Reagan administration announced administratively a new policy on international population assistance, which was a change in what the U.S. Government policy had been as it related to assisting organizations involved in population planning in other countries. 
Let me make a very important distinction. Even I had to go back and read this. This is not about involving any restrictions on governmental agencies. Money we send to the Mexican Government, the Mexican Government can use in population planning funds--if we send them any--any way they want with one restriction, and it is the Helms law. Senator Helms--and I supported it--argued that we should not be sending taxpayer dollars to other countries in the form of foreign aid if those other countries, or private organizations within those countries, are going to take our taxpayer dollars and perform abortions--in the case of China, coerced abortions, where the Chinese Government has coerced people into having abortions, forced abortions, to maintain this one-child policy, one child per family. So it became law. It is still law. Under the Helms amendment, taxpayer dollars collected and sent overseas, in what most people would refer to as foreign aid, cannot be used to perform or to coerce abortions. That is the law. 
Mexico City is in addition to that. Mexico City says--I caution my staff to correct me if I make even any nuance mistake about this because it is important--Mexico City comes along and it does two things. It says when the United States, by whatever mechanism, sends American taxpayer dollars to nongovernmental organizations instead of to the comparable Department of Health and Social Services in Mexico--for example, they have a comparable agency in their Federal Government like we have in ours--sending funds to them, it gets treated one way. Sending funds to, say, Mexico City Planned Parenthood, not a U.S. corporation, not a U.S. entity, but a Mexican entity, or any other country, in Argentina, in China, in Vietnam, the Mexico City directive of President Reagan said not only can they not use their funds because the Helms amendment blocks use of any taxpayer dollars--OK? Not only the government, but to these private agencies. The add-on that President Reagan, through Executive order, laid out was the following. It said not only can they not use our funds, the money we send, say, to Planned Parenthood Mexico, they cannot use their funds--let me get this straight for everybody. Right now, if we sent, through a population control program, money to Planned Parenthood Mexico, Planned Parenthood Vietnam, Planned Parenthood--I don't know that they have one but assume they do--and we sent money to the Government of Vietnam, the Government of Mexico, the government of another country, as well for population control under our law, if we find out they, either the private agency, or the government, is using that money to perform abortions, then it is against Federal law. We stop doing it. It is the Helms amendment. It cannot be done. 
OK. That is the law. That is not in question here. That is the law now, and it will stay the law. But this is a different deal. Former President Reagan said not only do we want to stop that; we want to stop these nongovernmental agencies from using their own money. So now Planned Parenthood in Mexico gets a dollar of U.S. taxpayers' money; they can't use that dollar to perform abortions. They can't use that dollar to go out there and be promoting those abortions. OK. 
But now let's say they have a fundraiser in Mexico City, and all Mexican citizens show up and they contribute $2. So they have $3 to spend now, two of their own that they raised that has nothing to do with taxpayers' dollars and one that is the American taxpayers' dollar. Mexico City says they can't even use their own dollars, their own money to do either of two things: One, to perform abortions or, two, to lobby their own Government on anything relating to abortion. 
Now, the irony here is if they were the Right to Life Committee in Mexico City, they also could not lobby with their own money their Government to end abortions. It is a gag rule. We are saying what we can't say to their Government--even Mr. Smith and others have not tried to say--any money we send to the Mexican Government to control population can't be used to perform abortions, and if they take any of our money they can't use any of their own money to do anything relating to abortion. We don't say that. We know we can't tell another Government they can't use their own tax dollars, but we feel we can tell a nongovernment agency, these NGOs they talk about, nongovernment organizations, we think we can tell them what they can do not only with the money we send them but with their own money. 
That is the objection this President has. By the way, we went through a similar debate here in the United States on the so-called gag rule. It would be unconstitutional. We could not say to local Planned Parenthood in Duluth, MN, `You are getting some Federal funding; you can't use the Federal money. . . .' We can say that. But we could not then say, `With your money, you can't even tell anybody who comes in to see you about the options that are available.' We can't say to a local doctor in the United States of America, `Look, we can pass a law saying you cannot perform an abortion with taxpayer dollars'--we could do that, but under our first amendment we could not say to the doctor or clinic, using their own funds, you cannot counsel the patient, `By the way, there are four ways to deal with your problem. One of them is . . .' We can't do that. 
That is what we call the gag rule. But we are going to gag the world. We are going to tell the world, if you are involved with us in any way, you not only in accepting our dollars cannot use our dollars, you can't use your own dollars. The President and a vast majority of my colleagues feel very strongly--I admit they feel more strongly than I do--about that as a matter of principle. 
So what is this fight about? Where did the compromise come in? What did the House do to make this Mexico City language more palatable or reflect what is called a compromise by my friend from North Carolina? Well, the compromise contained in this report would put Mexico City into place, make it law--it is not law now, but it was an Executive order, by the way, from President Bush and President Reagan, and eliminated by President Clinton. This would now put into legislation Mexico City language. But here is what the language said. It would permit the President to waive the restriction on U.S. funds to a group that used its own money to perform abortions. Hardly any of these groups do that. So it is really not giving up much, and it would require the President to say, you can use your own money to perform an abortion. 
That is allegedly the compromise. But let's look at what it leaves in place. And by the way, there would be a small financial cost in doing so. Population funds would then be limited to $356 million in that year as opposed to $385 million if he exercised this waiver. That is the penalty the President would pay to waive. 
But there is no waiver authority on the provision which is referred to as the lobbying restriction. And this is the more important provision because (a) few of the organizations that receive population funds actually perform abortions, and (b) from the administration's viewpoint, the principle worth upholding is one embodied in the first amendment of our Constitution, and that is this provision restricts free debate. 
In fact, the reason the restriction applies only to foreign organizations and not domestic organizations is that it wouldn't be permitted under our Constitution under the first amendment if we tried to apply this language to an American nongovernmental organization. It would be unconstitutional. 
Now, the statement of the managers in the conference report elaborates on the definition of lobbying and makes it clear that the provision is in fact designed to restrict speech. What are we doing now? We are telling them they can't use their own money to speak to their own Government, not our Government, not our money, can't use their own money to speak to their own Government about the issue of procreation. 
Let me read the managers' statement, fancy term for saying what is contained in the attachment to this legislation. This is relating to what constitutes lobbying. `Such practices include not only overt lobbying for such changes but also such other activities as sponsoring rather than merely attending conferences and workshops on the alleged defects of the abortion laws as well as drafting and distributing of materials or public statements calling attention to defects in the country's abortion laws.' 
That is pretty broad. That is the problem the administration has. This is so far-reaching in terms of what it does as it relates to speech that as a matter of principle they have made no bones about it; 3 days after they came into office they scrapped this language. It is now being forced down their throat if they want to be able to conduct the foreign policy of the United States of America. 
So my disagreement with my friend from North Carolina relates only to whether or not this is really a compromise. None of the language is changed. Only the ability of the President to waive the first section, not the second section. And by my understanding the managers' definition of what constitutes lobbying is even broader than anyone reasonably would think lobbying is in our country. 
Now, I think this is antidemocratic. It is a gag rule. It is inappropriate for us to do this. It interferes in ways we should not be interfering. And it will have no impact, in my view, on whether there are more or fewer or lesser abortions performed in the United States of America. As a matter of fact, I am of the view--and I am, as I think 99 percent of Americans are, opposed to abortion. No one likes abortion. Even among those who have had one and/or perform them, I don't know anybody who likes abortion. But I think, ironically, Mexico City could cause more abortions to be performed worldwide. If Mexico City's restrictions are reimposed, several population organizations, including the largest in the world, the International Planned Parenthood Federation, will not any longer take any U.S. population control money. They are going to say, `If the price for us taking your money is we have to not use any of our money ever again, then we don't want your money.' Is that a good idea? What have we accomplished? 
I think these restrictions could lead to significant cutbacks in family planning assistance in several countries. Such assistance increasing access--for example, assistance to increase access to contraceptive services, to information related to everything from the rhythm method to the use of condoms to the use of the pill, all those things which are critical in preventing unwanted pregnancies--I think that the lessening of the amount of money available for that, because you know these organizations are not going to accept U.S. money, I think it is going to increase the number of abortions. 
I think this is especially so in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, where abortion, under the Communist period, was often the method used for family planning. For example, in Kazakhstan, U.S. assistance to some two dozen clinics, Planned Parenthood-type clinics in Kazakhstan from 1993 to 1994, led to a 41 percent decline in the number of abortions performed in that country. 
Did you hear what I just said? When we were engaged in pointing out to the people of Kazakhstan what alternatives they had to deal with unwanted pregnancies other than abortion, and that information was made available, the number of abortions declined by 41 percent. In Russia, contraceptive use increased from 19 percent to 24 percent in the years 1990 to 1994. During this period, from 1990 to 1994, the number of abortions dropped from 3.6 million performed in Russia to 2.8 million. If, like me, you want to stop abortions, you had over 800,000 fewer abortions in Russia because we were providing money to train and to make available information to Russian women and men about the use of contraceptives. 
But what are these organizations going to do now, when they say, if we give them money, they know they can't even talk to their governments or attend conferences and talk about abortion? They are not going to take the money. 
In Ukraine, the Ministry of Health reported an 8.6 percent decrease in abortions between January and June of 1996, which it directly attributes to the women's reproductive health program that began in 1995 with U.S. funding. For every 100 abortions performed in the 6 months before, there were 8 fewer performed in the next 6 months. Why? Because of population services. 
Now, look, I don't mean to, I don't intend to, and I don't pretend to want to engage my friend in a debate on abortion. As I said when he was necessarily off the floor, the only place we disagree as it relates to this conference report is how much of a compromise the House really made. I would argue essentially they made no compromise and allowed the President to waive in one circumstance the Mexico City restriction which is hardly ever used anyway. I think--I know from the administration's perspective and the majority of my colleagues on this side and about 8 or 10 on your side, that it is a larger principle of whether or not we can impose internationally a gag rule that can't be imposed nationally because of our first amendment. Again, I am not arguing the merits of it, but I am arguing that is enough, I think, to doom this conference report. 
And I will conclude by saying--and I thank my friend for his 
indulgence--but I conclude by saying the only other thing we probably disagree on, and only of late, is tactically what is the best way to get what we both want done. I think if the Senate rejects, as well as the President veto's threat exists, tactically that puts up more of a wall that says, Look, let's deal with foreign policy, not with Mexico City on this; pick another vehicle. 
But I want to tell you--and I don't say this to be solicitous--I don't know anyone who is tactically smarter, in terms of Senate procedure, than my friend from North Carolina. We have both been here the same number of years, but I do not have his knowledge and experience relative to the rules. But I think I have almost as much of an instinct about what will motivate or not motivate our colleagues in the House or the Senate. 
So, again, we disagree on only two points: One, this is not much of a compromise on Mexico City; two, tactically I am urging my colleagues to vote `no' to make the point that this is not an easy access, to keep attaching this kind of language. Because it will allow, in my view, the leadership in the House to say, `Look, if we want to get something done, let's not attach it.' 
That is my rationale. We have no disagreement on the legislation. We both made real compromises on the core of this. I think we both, on both our parts--it is presumptuous of me to say this and self-serving for me to say this--but think we did a good job. I think we worked the way one of the major newspapers in America said the way the committee is supposed to work. We actually heard the facts, debated it, fought it out, resolved it, and did what was reasonable in the outcome. 
So I say to my friend, I don't know where this will all lead except I am confident, either because of action on this floor or by the President, this conference report is not going to become law and we are going to have to go at this again. But I fear, as he does, time is awasting. It is harder each time to put Humpty-Dumpty back together again. Time is running out. We are moving into an election year. I do not in any way question his motivation. I do not in any way suggest that I know my tactical judgment is better than his. But I have reached this conclusion--and we talked about this--I have reached this conclusion for the reasons I have stated. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have listened to and been involved in this debate now for weeks before this got to the floor, and since it has gotten to the floor, and now in the final moments. And I find myself in an unusual position. I think the claims made by everyone on both sides of this issue are greatly exaggerated. 
Although I have voted against vouchers, and have voted against direct funding to private schools, I strongly support, and have since I got here in 1973, the use of the Tax Code to indirectly assist private schools. 
My friend from North Dakota talked about how the public schools are getting short shrift, but so are the private schools. The private schools I went to were Catholic grade schools where the average income I expect was lower--I know it was lower in the neighborhood I lived in--than the average income in the public schools. I will not belabor this, mainly because no one is interested and, secondly, because I do not have the time. 
I think when we get here on the floor and people say, this is really about priorities, I agree. And if the debate really were whether or not to spend this money for aiding higher and elementary and secondary education, all three--and about $300 million of this bill is for secondary and elementary education through the Tax Code--I would say that is a legitimate debate. 
The truth is, most of the people who are voting against this are voting against it because in principle they don't think the Tax Code should be used this way, period. They have no desire under any circumstance--and they think it is anathema to our system--to help even indirectly private schools. 
So I find myself in strong disagreement and in a distinct minority in my party on that view. Consequently, I voted against a whole lot of things I have supported for 20 years, because most of the initiatives that were brought up that I supported were in lieu of--in lieu of--this use of the Tax Code, this IRA, which is going to be a very, very small amount of money for most people, by the way. 
Then having done that--and I do not in any way suggest that the sponsor of this legislation had this in mind--along came an amendment that trumped everything for me. I have always been an extremely strong supporter of public schools. I have supported education for the 25 years I have been here. With every major education initiative, I have played a small part, at least in my vote, along with the Senator from Massachusetts, who has been the leader in this body on education issues since I have been here. 
So along comes an amendment by Senator Gorton that essentially emasculates the notion of Federal participation in the education process in our country. I am not suggesting that he is not philosophically committed to the notion that there should be no Department of Education, that it should all be local. But, I think that is malarkey. I think that is absolutely `brain dead' in terms of what this country needs. That is my view. 
So now I am faced with a dilemma. I want to support this bill. But, in helping a little tiny bit those parents who send their kids to private schools--over the objection of my friend Senator Kennedy and others--in the process, from my perspective, I would be voting to emasculate the Federal responsibility in education by shifting all programs to a block grant. 
I find it ironic, by the way, all this talk from Republicans about, `We don't want any directed education programs, we want block grants,' and then everyone voted for a Republican-sponsored amendment to create a new directed Federal Government education program which is not a block grant. 
At any rate, I can no longer support this bill. It really makes me angry with myself that I can't vote for this bill. All these years trying to get a little bit of fairness, in my view, for private and parochial schools. It is just about to happen, and I can't vote for it now because it undermines everything I have believed about the role of the Federal Government in education for the last 25 years. 
So I say to my friend from Georgia, who has been straight up with me, upfront with me, the whole way--our offices are across from one other--although we met on this and strategized on this, and, I think to the chagrin of my Democratic colleagues, although I helped play a part in getting this bill to the floor, now I can't vote with him. 
Now, if you go to conference and this is dropped--that is, the foolishness of the Gorton amendment--and the bill comes back here without the Gorton amendment in it, I will vote for it and I will vote to override a Presidential veto. But I cannot vote for it in its present form. 
The reason, Mr. President, I wanted to vote for the Education IRA proposal is because I believe in it. I have always believed--and I voted as far back as 1978--that we should find some way to help financially those parents who wish to send their children to the school of their choice. 
That does not mean that I support every effort to provide tax dollars or tax breaks to support private education. But, I have supported--and will continue to support--reasonable, appropriate, constitutional measures that do not take money away from the public schools to help middle-class and lower-income families who choose an alternative to public schools. 
Let me also say that my support for this bill--and similar initiatives--should in no way be viewed as an abandonment of public education. Yes, there are some supporters of this bill who believe that there should be no Federal role in education or that the Federal government should not help States fund public education or that we should decrease our commitment to public education. I have not, do not, and never will subscribe to that philosophy. 
I have supported and will continue to support increasing funding for public schools and for programs to help the public schools--Title I for disadvantaged children, Goals 2000 academic standards, safe and drug free schools, special education, school construction, and smaller class sizes, to name a few examples. Public education must be our top priority. But, no matter how much those on both sides of this issue try to make it so, this is not an either-or choice--where you either support public education or you support families who choose an alternative to public schools. That is a false choice. 
Now, having said all that, Mr. President, let me explain in some detail why I believe it to be true--why I believe this bill is reasonable and appropriate, and does not undermine public education. In doing so, I need to review some of the provisions of this bill, which my colleagues are familiar with. I do this because as I have talked to people about this bill--and as people have talked to me--it is clear that there is a lot of misunderstanding about it. So, let me take a few minutes to explain exactly what this bill is and is not. 
This bill is not is a voucher bill. It does not provide a voucher or grant to pay for private schools. This is not a tuition tax credit bill. It does not give a tax write-off for the costs of tuition at private schools. And, this is not a bill to aid private schools. It does not give private schools a dime of tax money. 
What this bill does is simply say that the interest earned on a family's savings that are used for education will not be considered taxable income. Let me be more specific. 
Last year, we established Education IRAs for higher education. This was a proposal that I had originally introduced in 1996 as part of my comprehensive bill--known as the `GET AHEAD' Act--to make college more affordable for middle-class families. Under last year's tax bill, families can now put up to $500 per year into an Education IRA and if that money is later used to pay for the costs of higher education, the interest on that savings will not be taxed. 
This bill does two things to build on last year's law. First, it increases the amount that can be put into the account each year from $500 to $2000. Second, for families with incomes under $160,000, the bill allows funds in an Education IRA to be used--without having to pay tax on the interest--for the costs of a child's education at any level--elementary, secondary, or higher education--and at any school, public or private, or for home schooling expenses. 
There is no tax deduction for the amount put into the savings account. And, there is no tax deduction for the entire cost of a private school education. Those are myths. This bill simply says that interest earned on Education IRAs--which already exist for higher education--will not be taxed if the money is used at any level of education. What is the harm in that? I see none. We are simply expanding existing Education IRAs so that people can use their own money to pay for elementary and secondary education costs. 
Now, Mr. President, here is something interesting. The cost of this proposal is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to be $1.6 billion over ten years, paid for by closing loopholes in the current tax law--not by taking money away from public schools. But, about $1.3 billion of the cost is expected to result from Education IRAs used to help finance the cost of a higher education. Only $300 million--and, remember, that's over a 10-year period--would result from Education IRAs used to help pay for elementary and secondary education. In other words, less than 20 percent of the cost of this proposal is a result of Education IRAs being used for elementary and secondary education costs--what all the hullabaloo has been about--and some of that would be used by families with children in public schools. 
Let me repeat that. Under this bill, Education IRAs can be used to help families whose kids attend public schools. If parents need to buy their kids public school uniforms, they can use this money. If parents need to buy their kids a computer, they can use this money. If a child needs an after-school or summer tutor, parents can pay for that tutor using this money. 
How is that a disaster that will befall this nation's public school system? The answer is, it is not. That is a rhetorical exaggeration by opponents of this bill, who are trying to have it both ways. On the one hand, they claim that this bill is significant because it will undermine public education, and on the other hand, they argue that this bill is meaningless because the tax benefit for the average family, they claim, will be $37 per year. Which is it--significant or meaningless? It cannot be both. 
The truth is, this bill in the aggregate will have only a marginal impact. But, to some families, it will be a real help. And, so I believe that this bill is an appropriate way to reach a desirable goal--assisting parents who wish to send their children to the school of their choice. 
Finally, Mr. President, although I support this bill, let me say that I am disappointed with the way the Republican leadership chose to bring up this bill. I am disappointed because we did not use this opportunity to have a serious debate on education in this country. By any measure, as I just noted, this bill will have only a small impact. And, it will help primarily--not exclusively, but primarily--families whose children attend private schools. I support it out of a sense of fairness. 
But, meanwhile, there are 45 million public school children in this country. And, we have schools that are falling down, classes that are overcrowded, and children who have nowhere to go and nothing to do when the final school bell rings at 3:00 in the afternoon. Even if the Education IRA proposal becomes law--which I think it should, and I hope it will--it is not a fix for the problems of America's schools, and we should not pretend otherwise. No matter how important I think this bill is, it is not about making our public schools better. We could have put more money in building and repairing schools. We could have put 100,000 new teachers in our elementary school classrooms to reduce class size. We could have funded after-school programs to help keep kids off the streets and away from crime. We could have done all of these things in addition to the Education IRA proposal. But, we did not. 
We have missed the opportunity to think big and have instead gone forward with a bill that gets by with something small. Nonetheless what is being done here is important, and I look forward to voting for it if the Gorton amendment is dropped.

Mr. BIDEN. Once again, Mr. President, as often occurs here, we are presented with Hobson's choices. As I said, I have strongly supported and continue to support the school construction initiatives of Senator Moseley-Braun, but her amendment should have been added to the bill, not given as an alternative to it. In order to vote for her amendment, I would have had to vote against the guts of the Coverdell bill. I support the essence of what Senator Coverdell is doing. So I voted against Senator Moseley-Braun's amendment, although I strongly support it and think we need to invest considerable amounts of money in school construction. 
I conclude by saying I only wish it had been an add-on to the Coverdell bill, not in place of the Coverdell bill. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my good friend, the distinguished Ranking Member of the Budget Committee, Frank Lautenberg, in introducing this amendment. We are in excellent company, joined by the distinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee, Bill Roth, the distinguished Majority Leader, and other supporters of Amtrak. 
As I testified just last week before Senator Shelby's Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Amtrak is currently under the gun--both the Amtrak Reform Act we passed last year, and our current budget plans assume that Amtrak will be without operating subsidies beginning in 2002. 
Personally, I am not convinced that this is a wise course of action. Virtually all passenger rail systems in the world are supported by public funds, because their benefits--reduced congestion on highways and at airports, less air pollution--are enjoyed by those who may never ride a train. Public support does not automatically signify inefficiency, Mr. President; in the case of passenger rail, it is a recognition that the public benefits are not fully paid for by individual ticket purchases. 
But it is even clearer, Mr. President, that passenger rail deserves support for its major capital needs. Just as the federal government provides funds for highways, airports, ship channels, and ports, it has a proper role--justified by the strictest notions of economic efficiency--in providing support for the basic infrastructure of our national transportation system. 
Despite the heavy burdens placed on Amtrak by years of under funding, Amtrak has responded with increased efficiency--and has undertaken a business plan that aims at operating self-sufficiency by the year 2002. 
This amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that we should live up to our end of the deal we entered into when we passed the Amtrak Reform Act last year--we should, at an absolute minimum, provide Amtrak with the funds necessary for them to reach 2002 with the equipment, routes, and ridership that will make that self-sufficiency possible. That means providing Amtrak with the funds--both long-term high-return capital from its capital funds, as well as operating support--that they anticipate in that business plan. 
And I must add, Mr. President, that following the recommendation of last year's Presidential Emergency Board, Amtrak has agreed to provide pay raises for its long-suffering workers. To make good on that commitment, and to provide similarly for all of the workers that have gone for years without a pay raise--or even a contact--Amtrak will require the funding level we commit to with his amendment. 
I am gratified that we have the support of so many of my colleagues for this amendment. Today, we will put the Senate on record in support of funds for Amtrak that will allow them to achieve the goals that we have set for them. That, Mr. President, is the least we can do.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, of all the priorities included in the Budget Resolution now before the Senate, I believe that none is more important than continuing our fight against violent crime and violence against women. 
To a great extent, this Budget Resolution meets this test--but, in at least one area of this crime front, I believe the Budget Resolution must be clarified. 
The amendment does exactly that--by clarifying that it is the sense of the Senate that the Violent Crime Control Trust Fund will continue through fiscal year 2002. 
First, let me point out that it is Senator Byrd who, more than anyone, deserves credit for the crime law trust fund. Senator Byrd worked to develop an idea that was simple as it was profound--as he called on us to use the savings from the reductions in the federal workforce of 272,000 employees to fund one of the nation's most urgent priorities: fighting the scourge of violent crime. 
Senator Gramm was also one of the very first to call on the Senate to `put our money where our mouth was.' Too often, this Senate has voted to send significant aid to state and local law enforcement--but, when it came time to `write the check,' we did not fund nearly the dollars we promised. 
Working together in 1993, Senator Byrd, myself, Senator Gramm, Senator Domenici and other Senators passed the Violent Crime Control Trust Fund in the Senate. And, in 1994, it became law in the Biden Crime Law. 
Since then, the dollars from the Crime Law Trust Fund have: Helped add nearly 70,000 community police officers to our streets; helped shelter more than 80,000 battered women and their children; focussed law enforcement, prosecutors and victims service providers on providing immediate help to women victimized by someone who pretends to `love' them; forced tens of thousands of drug offenders into drug testing and treatment programs, instead of continuing to allow them to remain free on probation with no supervision and no accountability; constructed thousands of prison cells for violent criminals; and brought unprecedented resources to defending our southwest border--putting us on the path to literally double the number of federal border agents over just a 5 year period. 
The results of this effort are already taking hold--according to the FBI's national crime statistics, violent crime is down and down significantly--leaving our nation with its lowest murder rate since 1971. And the lowest murder rate for wives, ex-wives and girlfriends at the hands of their `intimates' to an 18-year low. 
In short, we have proven able to do what few thought possible--by being smart, keeping our focus, and putting our `money where our mouths' are--we have actually cut violent crime. 
Today, our challenge is to keep our focus and to stay vigilant against violent crime. Today, the Biden-Gramm amendment before the Senate offers one modest step towards meeting that challenge--By confirming the Senate's commitment to fighting crime and violence against women will continue to at least 2002. By confirming the Senate's commitment that the Violent Crime Control Trust Fund will continue--in its current form which provides additional federal assistance without adding 1 cent to the deficit--to at least 2002. 
The Biden-Gramm amendment offers a few very simple choices: Stand up for cops--or don't; stand up for the fight against violence against women --or don't; stand up for fighting the scourge of youth violence--or don't; stand up for building new prisons--or don't; stand up for increased border enforcement--or don't. 
Every member of this Senate is against violent crime. Now, I urge all my colleagues to back up with words with the only thing that we can actually do for the cop walking the beat, the battered woman, the victim of crime--provide the dollars that help give them the tools to fight violent criminals and help restore at least some small piece of the dignity taken from them by a violent criminal. 
Let us be very clear of the stakes here--frankly, if we do not continue the Trust Fund, we will not be able to continue such proven, valuable efforts as the Violence Against Women law. Nothing we can do today can guarantee that we, in fact, will continue the Violence Against Women Act when the law expires in the year 2000. 
But, mark my words, if the Trust Fund ends, the efforts to provide shelter, help victims and get tough on the abusers and batterers will wither on the vine. Passing the amendment I offer today will send a clear, unambiguous message that the trust fund should continue and with it, the historic effort undertaken by the violence against women act that says by word, deed and dollar that the Federal Government stands with women and against the misguided notion that `domestic' violence is a man's `right' and `not really a crime.'

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the President's current trip to Africa and the importance of Africa to United States national interests. I highly applaud the President's decision to go to Africa. The President's trip to Ghana, Botswana, South Africa, Uganda, Senegal and Rwanda comes on the heels of visits to the region last year by both the First Lady and the Secretary of State. This marks only the second time that an American President has undertaken an official trip to sub-Saharan Africa, and the first visit to any of the countries on the President's itinerary. As we have seen by the warm reception that the President has enjoyed so far, this first visit in 20 years by an American President carries considerable symbolic significance for the 650 million people in Africa. For the 270 million people of America, the President's visit will help further strengthen U.S.-Africa relations and promote important national interests. 
President Clinton's trip highlights a very different Africa from the one President Carter saw during the first Presidential visit in 1978. At that time, Washington largely viewed Africa as merely another battleground for U.S.-Soviet Cold War competition. Today, in many parts of the region nations are working to reform politically and economically. More elections have occurred at all levels of government in the last five years than in the last two decades. The traditional image of African states controlled by dictatorial strongmen is giving way to multiparty political systems with an increasing appreciation for democratic institutions and processes. And economically, many African countries have rejected the failed policies of central planning in favor of privatization of state assets and the creation of free markets. 
Mr. President, the image that we often see of Africa in the media largely is one of famine, instability, and ethnic conflict. The purpose of the President's trip is to refocus the international spotlight to include the emerging economic and political renaissance that is occurring in some countries. I applaud President Clinton's recognition of the importance of including Rwanda in his itinerary. In contrast to the relatively positive outlook for the other countries on the President's itinerary, the outlook for Rwanda is not so clear and bright. Rwanda is still reeling from the aftershocks of the brutal 1994 genocide that resulted in the deaths of upwards of 800,000 men, women and children. For the last two years, more than 120,000 accused genocidaires have waited in prison for a trial. The country remains under insurgent attack by the 1994 genocidaires who are now based in neighboring Congo. 
Rwanda is still waiting for justice. Rwanda--and the rest of Central Africa--will not be able to move forward until there is justice for the victims of genocide. Justice is the critical factor that will either allow that country to move forward, or see it fall backwards into bloodshed. I support the President's proposed Great Lakes Justice Initiative to assist the states of the region to strengthen judicial systems and the rule of law. I also urge the Administration to continue its efforts to ensure the effectiveness of the International War Crimes Tribunal for Rwanda. The Tribunal was established over three years ago to bring to justice leaders of the 1994 genocide. To date, however, only 35 persons have been indicted and the Tribunal has yet to hand down its first sentence. By contrast, the Yugoslav Tribunal already has cases in the appeal stage. The Tribunal s effective and efficient functioning will be key to allowing the Rwandan justice system the political and legal flexibility it needs to deal with the 120,000 men in prison. 
Mr. President, Rwanda is not the only troubled African nation. Some nations, such as Liberia, the Central African Republic, and Angola, are at critical crossroads and will make decisions that will have a significant impact on their political and economic futures. Others, such as Nigeria, Sudan and Cameroon, have resisted the tide of political openness and economic reform that is sweeping through their neighbors and have remained repressive. As the President continues current efforts in Africa and undertakes new initiatives, it is critical that the United States strongly and clearly encourages those countries at the crossroads to choose the right road. At the same time, we should be unambiguous in our non-acceptance of those countries that continue to choose political repression and failed economic policies. 
One of the most critical tests that United States foreign policy currently faces in Africa is the Democratic Republic of Congo. An enormous country the size of the United States east of the Mississippi River, the Congo is strategically located in the heart of Africa. Bordered by nine different countries, it is at once a Southern and Central African state. Blessed with natural and human resources, this country for the last thirty years has been cursed with poor leadership and financial ruin. The term kleptocracy was coined for the despotic rule of former President Mobutu Sese Seko which saw billions of dollars of foreign assistance misappropriated and the national coffers drained. 
Foreign Relations Committee staff members who traveled to Congo last month saw a country in crisis. Critical infrastructure such as health and transportation are in disarray. There is no justice system to speak of. Human rights conditions are, in the words of one international human rights worker, catastrophic. The Congolese President, Laurent Kabila, a guerilla opposed to the former government for most of his adult life, has no relevant experience governing a country. The same is true for most of his cabinet. Perhaps the only positive news to report is that the security situation is relatively calmer for the moment than it has been in recent years. As discouraging a picture as this might be, recent Central African history has shown that Congo's future disposition will have a significant impact on its neighbors with potential consequences for much of Africa--and United States national interests. 
Mr. President, some might wonder whether the United States has any interests in Africa. Since the end of the Cold War, there are those who have argued that the United States should cut back on its engagements abroad. In regards to Africa, they argue that we should focus on regions of greater geopolitical and economic importance. Let me state clearly my belief that without a doubt the United States needs to be actively engaged in Africa. 
Why? Because just as we support democracy, free trade and human rights in the rest of the world, so too should we continue to support these goals in Africa. Moreover, the United States has strong economic interests in Africa. U.S. exports to Africa last year totaled $6.2 billion, more than total U.S. exports to all of the states of the former Soviet Union combined. Since 1994, U.S. trade with sub-Saharan Africa has grown on average at 16.9% annually, outpacing growth in global trade in 1995 and 1996. Through our engagement with Africa we support and encourage partners who cherish the same values that we do. By encouraging political and economic stability we contribute to the preservation of our own nation s continued prosperity and security. 
Mr. President, some among us may be disillusioned into believing that our interests in Africa are purely humanitarian, that Africa doesn t hold any strategic value for the United States. When I hear statements to this effect, I have to wonder whether they are living in the same world as the rest of us. As we have seen with the recent Asian financial crisis, global drug trade, and even the El NinAE6o weather phenomenon, Americans today are more interconnected, if not interdependent, with the rest of the world than at any previous time in our nation's history. At this unique point in time as the sole superpower with the ability virtually to reach around the globe, the rest of the world has an equally unprecedented ability to touch us back. In such a global environment it is vital to our nation's security that we exercise vigilance in the conduct of our foreign relations. 
Mr. President, even if we could stick our head in the sand, the rest of our body would be exposed to all of the negative consequences that a neglected Africa would incur. Imagine the effects of a large region of the world ignored and not encouraged to develop effective health systems, where new exotic diseases are not checked but given free reign to develop and old ones can develop drug resistance. The Asian bird flu would be nothing compared to what we might see. Imagine nations with minimal resources but great needs not supported to effectively maintain their natural environment, and compelled to compromise rainforests and natural ecosystems vital to our planet's well-being. If we think El NinAE6o is bad, just wait until we meet his big brother. 
Mr. President, we wouldn't allow this to occur in any other part of the world, and we certainly can not afford to allow this to happen in Africa. Protecting American interests in Africa is no simple task. The subtleties and complexities that confront us in the 48 nations of sub-Saharan Africa require diplomatic skill and finesse. How does Rwanda move to democracy whilst Hutus vastly outnumber Tutsis, and distrust and violence on both sides goes back generations? How do ethnic communities in Kenya share power in such a way that the rights of the minority are protected? How does the Congo move towards democratic governance and financial responsibility after a generation of misgovernment and kleptocracy? 
There are no easy solutions to any of these questions, but the answers must be found if Africa is to advance politically and economically--and U.S. national interests are to be protected--into the next century.

Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I rise this morning to support the addition of urgently needed funds for the IMF to this supplemental appropriations bill. 
Despite the clear need, despite the strong statements of concern by Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan, and by Treasury Secretary Rubin, some of our colleagues continue to miss the point. As the biggest, most open economy in the world, as the leader of the world economy and the only global superpower, the United States has a special role to play in, and a special need for, international institutions to maintain the stability and openness of the world's financial system. 
The problems now brought to light in Asia--the increasing billions in international investments that flow around the globe with the stroke of a computer key, the uneven development of banking systems in newly industrializing nations--are very real challenges to our own well-being that require serious analysis and a truly international response. They are not an annoyance that we can blissfully ignore. And they are not to be dismissed with a few ideological platitudes. 
As the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee stated so clearly and forcefully just yesterday, the Asian financial crisis is an `economic El Nino' that directly affects American sales overseas and jobs here at home. Our contributions to the IMF are made to protect us from the shock waves of that crisis in the Pacific, Madam President, and by denying or delaying those contributions we would only hurt ourselves. 
Certainly, the IMF could well use a breath of fresh air--more openness to develop more public understanding and trust. And it is clear that we have a long way to go to establish a sound international financial system, with the clear reporting standards and accurate data that will allow markets to operate efficiently. 
Those of us who share those concerns understand the need to provide the IMF with the resources it needs right now to maintain its role as lender of last resort in the kinds of currency crises that can have truly global consequences. If we do not, weaknesses in the world's financial system will only deepen and persist. And, I must add, so will the burdens carried by those people in the affected countries that are least able to deal with them, who too often pay the price for the financial follies of others. 
So congratulations are due to those who worked so hard to make sure that the funding becomes part of this bill today. I know that Senator Hagel, my colleague from the Foreign Relations and Chairman of our International Economic Affairs Subcommittee, has played a key role. And a great deal of credit must go to Senator Stevens, Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, for his indispensable leadership. 
I know that there are more hurdles to clear in this process, Madam President, but I am pleased to see that this amendment has become part of the emergency appropriations bill. Just last week, when our IMF contributions seemed in real trouble, I expressed my confidence that the Senate would work quickly and responsibly to make this funding available. Today, the Senate has rewarded that confidence. 
I pay special tribute to Senator Hagel for his hard work on this and Senator Stevens for promoting and providing the means to do this and my friend from Maryland for being such a strong voice. I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. I thank the chairman of the committee for accommodating one of my concerns that I expressed through staff on this amendment that he changed. 
I agree fully, as the Senator knows from our many discussions on the United Nations and some disagreements relative to the United Nations, that I, like he, believe we do not get sufficient credit. He may remember the debate we had in the committee where I found myself at odds with some of my colleagues who share my view that we, in fact, owe a good deal of money and should pay it. 
I take issue, for the record, with my friend from Minnesota about his characterization of what a terrible job the administration has done. I do not believe that is the case. I believe that Secretary Albright, when she was at the United Nations, and others have never failed to point out the extent of our involvement. 
I do not think we should confuse apples and oranges here. The truth of the matter is there are certain things that are U.N. sanctioned and there are other things that are U.N. administered. When folks wear blue helmets, everybody gets repaid. When they are not wearing blue helmets, they do not get repaid unless it is a chapter 7 undertaking administered by the U.N. I will not bore my colleagues with the details that relates to, but let me say we are not the only country who has acted unilaterally under the cover of or with the sanction of a U.N. resolution. There are other countries who have done so and have not been reimbursed for their contributions, from France to Germany to Great Britain. 
For example, in 1994 voluntary expenditures by France amounted to $747.5 million, for which they did not seek reimbursement; Italy, $347.7 million, et cetera. We by far and away are the biggest of the contributing noncredit-given countries in the United Nations, I acknowledge that. And I think we should be doing what the Senator from North Carolina is saying: We should make it clear, in part to our folks as well as the rest of the world, that we do a great deal more than we get credit for. 
I further say that we could amend--and I am not going to --we could amend this resolution to ask the world body to understand that there are other tens of billions, hundreds of billions, we spend that are not under any U.N. auspices, that are done for the good of the world, that we get no credit for. 
It is true we do not get sufficient credit. But I respectfully suggest that it should not be confused with whether or not we owe or do not owe what we agreed to under the deal we signed up to when we joined the United Nations. I make a distinction here. No state receives credit against assessments for unilateral activities in support of U.N. security council resolutions which represent a majority of the U.S. cost incurred during the period my friend from Minnesota is talking about.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to the chairman of the full committee I will summarize my statement here, and when anyone is ready to go with an amendment, I will cease. But I will speak on the overall supplemental, if I may. 
I rise in strong support of the supplemental appropriation for troops in the Persian Gulf and for our troops in Bosnia. I want to say a few words about our policy in the Persian Gulf and then turn to a more detailed discussion, if I have time, of our SFOR mission in Bosnia. 
Passing this supplemental appropriations sends an unequivocal message to Saddam Hussein that the United States is committed to thwarting his intent to threaten our national interest. Diplomacy backed by the credible threat of force has put the international inspectors back in business, and for the first time in 7 years these inspectors, Mr. President, are doing their work without hindrance. Maintaining our military force in the gulf is as important as anything else in keeping Saddam Hussein honest, although it is expensive and it is costly in many ways. 
I know that some of my colleagues, including the senior Senator from Alaska, have expressed concerns about the willingness of our allies in the gulf to share the financial burden of our current deployment. 
Many of these concerns are valid. We should expect our allies to support us militarily and otherwise, especially when our actions safeguard their interests. But I think it is equally important to recognize that we are in the Persian Gulf, first and foremost, to protect our own vital interests. 
But I think it is equally important to recognize that we are in the Persian Gulf first and foremost to protect our own vital interests. First, we ignore at our peril the chemical and biological weapons programs of a leader with a demonstrated proclivity for using weapons of mass destruction. Second, whether we like it or not, sixty-five percent of the world's proven oil reserves are in Saddam Hussein's backyard. 
None of us wants to hand over our energy security to the whims of a maniacal tyrant. But that is exactly what we would be doing if we withdrew our forces from the Persian Gulf. 
Failure to approve this supplemental would lead Saddam to conclude that the United States is losing its resolve. He would resume his defiance in short order, and before long he would menace the region once again with chemical and biological weapons. 
Now, Mr. President I want to discuss the mission in Bosnia. 
By now the importance of the American-led SFOR mission in Bosnia should be manifest. The Dayton Accords of November 1995 ended three-and-a-half years of carnage and gave Bosnia and Herzegovina a roadmap for rebuilding a peaceful, civil society. 
No one can dispute that it is the overall security environment created by the international community through SFOR that makes civilian progress possible. 
Mr. President, several Members have already spoken this morning on the Bosnia amendment offered, and then withdrawn, by the junior Senator from Texas. 
Had the Senator not withdrawn her amendment, I would have opposed it. If she offers it again on the Defense Appropriations bill, I will speak against it. 
For now, however, I would make only two brief comments on the amendment before I turn to a more detailed discussion on our strategy in Bosnia. 
First, mention was made of `shifting goalposts.' I quite agree, but the shifting has been done by the opponents of our involvement in Bosnia, not by President Clinton. 
In an effort to prevent, then shorten, our Bosnia mission, the opponents complained that the Administration had not spelled out clear benchmarks, which, if met, would enable our troops to withdraw from Bosnia. 
Now, my friends, he has given us these benchmarks. And what do the opponents of our Bosnia policy say? They say that he has shifted the goalposts by giving specifics. Give me a break! 
Second, I understand that the Senator from Texas said that she didn't find the benchmarks to be very concrete. After having examined the conditions and benchmarks, I find her confusion rather puzzling. Therefore, I will now go into detail about them. 
I have spoken frequently about the enormous progress that has been achieved in Bosnia since the cessation of hostilities and about the difficult tasks remaining ahead. 
Today I will concentrate on showing that in voting to fund a continuation of the SFOR mission, we are not voting for an open-ended commitment. 
Rather, the Administration has drawn up clear benchmarks, which, when met, will allow our troops to come home. 
But, Mr. President, part and parcel of these benchmarks is interpreting them, and in this connection I will insist that the Senate is part of the process. 
Mr. President, ten key conditions have been identified, each containing objectives and concrete benchmarks, which constitute our `game plan' in Bosnia. 
These ten conditions are: 1. Military Stability; 2. Police and Judicial Reform; 3. Functioning National Institutions; 4. Reformed Mass Media; 5. Democratization and a Functioning Electoral Process; 6. Economic Reconstruction and Recovery; 7. Refugee Returns; 8. A Settlement for Brcko; 9. Resolution of War Crimes; and 10. International Organizations Able to Function without Military Support. 
I would like to turn to the benchmarks for each of these conditions. 
The precondition for all progress, of course, is the creation of military stability. The benchmarks of this first of the ten conditions include the maintenance of the ceasefire, weapons secure in their cantonment sites, and the arms control limits set since Dayton adhered to. 
The special police forces must be disbanded or restructured and inter-entity arms control and confidence and security building measures adopted. 
In addition, the American-run Train and Equip Program must be successfully completed, with a traditional support and sustainment arrangement with the Federation Army in place. 
Second, the benchmarks for police and judicial reform require that all local police forces are restructured and ethnically integrated. Basic skills and human rights training must be completed so that the police can deal effectively and fairly with civil disturbances. Police academies with professional leadership must be functioning. 
The intelligence services and the secret police must be stripped of all police functions, and an effective judicial reform program must be in place. 
Benchmarks for attaining the third condition for troop withdrawal are in the governmental area. They include all outlawed pre-Dayton institutions having been dissolved. Foremost among these are the remnants of the Bosnian Croat so-called `Herceg-Bosna.' 
A functioning customs service and control over state revenues must be established, including transparency in budgets and disbursements. Funds must be flowing to national, not entity, institutions, which have permanent staffs and facilities in place. 
The fourth condition for the withdrawal of our troops concerns the mass media. Its benchmarks begin with political parties being divested of their control of the broadcast networks. Entity and national-level media policy and regulatory structures must be in place. A new election law must guarantee that opposition parties have access to the airwaves. Independent media, already in existence, should be generally available throughout the country. 
Benchmarks for the fifth condition, democratization and the electoral process, are particularly important. Local, entity, and national governments must be beginning to function transparently. Political parties will have to accept binding arbitration for the implementation of the results of contested local elections. 
Bosnian electoral laws must be modified to meet the standards of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The September 1998 elections must be conducted in a free and fair manner, with the need for OSCE supervision reduced. 
The sixth condition for withdrawal of American troops involves economic reconstruction and recovery. As benchmarks, agreement must be reached on a permanent national currency. Privatization laws must be drawn in line with Dayton. Major infrastructure including transportation, power grids, and telecommunications must be repaired and functioning. 
The program of the International Monetary Fund must be in place with traditional lending programs begun. 
The fundamental and emotional issue of refugee returns comprises the seventh condition. The property laws of both entities in Bosnia must comply with the Dayton Accords. Property commissions must be fully functioning. Both the Federation and the Republika Srpska must be participating in phased and orderly cross-ethnic returns. 
The key cities of Sarajevo, Banja Luka, and Mostar must have accepted substantial returns of refugees and displaced persons, and the local police throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina must protect returnees, whatever their religion or ethnicity. 
The thorny subject of Brcko comprises the eighth condition needed to be met before all troops can be withdrawn. An arbitration award must have been implemented without violence. As we know, Mr. President, in mid-March the arbitration award on Brcko was postponed for the third time. 
Specific benchmarks for Brcko include local elections having been implemented, an integrated police force functioning, two-way refugee returns and ethnic reintegration continuing to progress, and job creation underway. 
The ninth condition involves war crimes. All parties to the Dayton Accords, including entity justice authorities, must be cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). 
Local authorities must facilitate the apprehension of indictees. 
The tenth and final condition necessary for withdrawal of American troops, Mr. President, concerns the relationship of Bosnia with international organizations. One benchmark is certification that local authorities and the entity armies are capable of assuming responsibility for demining operations. 
Another is that the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia (OHR) demonstratres its authority to enforce inter-entity agreements without military back-up. 
A third, more general, benchmark is that the OSCE, NATO, and the European Union develop more traditional relationships with Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
Mr. President, I believe that these detailed conditions and benchmarks show conclusively that the Administration is not asking for an open-ended commitment. It has the exit strategy that critics have long been demanding. 
One or two of the ten conditions, and several more of the individual benchmarks have already been met. Many others are well on their way to fulfillment. Many others are only just beginning to be implemented. 
And, Mr. President, I would repeat my cautionary word that the fulfillment of such a detailed formulation leaves much open to interpretation. 
If the Senate approves this supplemental appropriation for our troops in Bosnia--as I strongly believe it should--we have the right to insist that the Congress be consulted on an ongoing basis on how the implementation of these civil-military benchmarks is going and also that our NATO and other SFOR partners are continuing to shoulder their responsibilities. 
The SFOR mission is of high national security importance for the United States. 
We have every right to be pleased with the quite striking progress that has been achieved in Bosnia over the past year. Much remains to be done, and with the game-plan--the `exit strategy' if you will--that the Administration has provided, closer cooperation with Congress is possible. 
I urge passage of this supplemental appropriation for both Iraq and Bosnia. I think that it is vital that the Senate and House pass this supplemental as soon as possible. The more expeditiously we act, the less our military readiness will suffer. The brave men and women serving in Bosnia and Iraq deserve to know that their missions are adequately funded by a proud Congress and not by cannibalizing important core military accounts. 
For that, they should thank the Senator from Alaska, because he has been absolutely, positively--how can I say it politely--consistent in insisting that we undertake these missions without cannibalizing our core accounts. 
Both of these missions further America's national security interests. They have achieved real results and what the Chairman of the full committe is suggesting is the way to go. 
I compliment the chairman in being able to fend off the amendments put forward so far today. I wish him luck for the remainder of the process here. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

As a matter of fact, we had a little bit of a disagreement in our caucus over that issue on the substance. But there is one thing there is not any disagreement in our caucus about, and that is whether or not--and I suspect there would not be if the roles were reversed for the majority leader--whether or not we would sign on to--even those who support the Coverdell legislation--whether or not we would sign on to a position that would effectively require us to give up our rights to offer amendments, because although I am for this bill, it may be there would be a crime bill on the floor or there would be a foreign policy initiative on the floor that, once I agreed to give up that right procedurally, I would have put myself in the permanent minority and not being able to exercise the rights I have under the rules of the Senate. And I am absolutely confident the Senator from Mississippi would take the same position were he on the opposite side of the numbers at this time, the numbers being in the minority. 
But I, for one, believe that we should try to work out an overall arrangement relative to making sure we deal with education-related issues. I would--and far be it from me; I am not capable of being the leader of either one of the parties on this floor. But I would suggest that while the minority leader, the Democratic leader, is considering this, that the majority leader, the Republican leader, consider whether or not there is any benefit in trying to put a time limit on this now. 
Suggesting time limits on amendments is like waving red flags. I can name 10 Senators on your side, if I said that we are going to give their State an additional $70 billion but there will be a time limit on debate, they would automatically disagree. So I think there are sort of red flags. 
And far be it from me to get in the middle of this negotiation, but I compliment the Republican leader on what seems to be at least a slight change of approach in terms of what I think is an equitable way in which to deal on this floor. But people like me, who strongly support the Coverdell bill, absent something worked out like this--I must say to my friend from Georgia, I am with you, but I ain't with you when I have to give up my rights on everything else that comes down the pike-- as strongly as I support this. 
So I compliment, again, the Republican leader. I hope he and the Democratic leader can work this out, because I would like very much to get to this debate and get to voting on it. And, to be very selfish about it, I would also like to clear it out of the way so we can focus on NATO in a coherent way. 
I see the Presiding Officer shaking his head. He has a great interest in the NATO issue as well, I know. There are a number of Members who do. It would be nice to have a coherent, consistent debate on that issue, because it is of such consequence. 
I thank both leaders for allowing me to get into what is not usually something I speak to, and I appreciate their efforts.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I find this absolutely astounding. Are my friends suggesting that the Russians were justified in marching into Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania and annexing them in the name of preventing a ring from surrounding them? What in Lord's name are we talking about? No. 1. 
No. 2. I have the map, and I am looking at the map. I am trying to figure where the ring is. But let's assume it is a ring. It seems to me, if it is a ring, it is a ring of freedom, a ring of freedom that tolls out and says anybody who wants to have it put on their finger can join and work it out, including Russia. 
And Kaliningrad is a port, but if you look at the Kola Peninsula at the top of that map, which is considerably more armed, including with nukes, than Kaliningrad is, it happens to have shared for the last 40 years a border with a NATO country called Norway, about the same length of mileage. 
Now, look, this is a bit of a red herring, as we used to say when you practiced law or in law school. What is this ring? We are not talking about Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia or Belarus or Ukraine or Romania now. That is not part of the debate today. 
Now, if my friends are saying anyone who votes for expanding NATO to include Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary are tying this noose around the Russian neck, this iron ring, well, then, I don't quite get it. But if they are saying that if you vote for these three you must be saying you are going to vote for all 12 or 15 or whatever, well, then, that is not how it works. That is a fight for another day. 
But I find this notion that Kaliningrad, which was awarded, if you will, to Russia after World War II, that subsequent to that the Russians were justified--they didn't say this; I am saying this--that the Russians were justified to assure that they could have access to this piece which was separated from their otherwise--we call them the contiguous 48--separated from their historic border, that they were justified in taking the freedom of the Lithuanians so they could have access, the Lithuanians are somehow out of line because they will, based on some notion of, apparently, religion or some just international pique of some kind, not allow Russian troops to march through their country and that makes them bad guys--the same troops that subjugated them for the last four decades. I don't find that a religious concern. I do not understand how that somehow makes the Lithuanians a little bit shaky. These are the people who for 40 years subjugated them, took away their national identity. And now just 7 or 8 short years after the wall is down they are somehow the bad guys because they will not allow Russian divisions to march from Kaliningrad to Moscow. Oh, my goodness. 
And the other argument I am finding fascinating, the solemn commitment--it is a solemn commitment--we make if, in fact, we find ourselves saying that another member can join, we make a solemn commitment to them just as we did Germany, and the comparison is made between Poland and Somalia. We had no staying 
power in Vietnam and Somalia. I would respectfully submit that Vietnam and Somalia are not Central Europe; they are not Poland; they are not Hungary. 
Implicit in the statement is if, in fact, tomorrow or the next day or the next year or the next decade someone invaded Poland again, we would, like the French, stand there with our thumbs in our ears and not respond, then I say we really have lost the meaning of what it means to be an American. That is what Europe did. They refused to make a solemn commitment to Poland. Then when they did make it, they broke it. 
What I find an incredible leap here is, what commitment are we making in NATO that I hope every Senator on this floor would not make absent Poland being part of NATO? Is someone suggesting to me tomorrow--and this is not a possibility realistically, but if Russia decided to put 40 divisions back in Poland and the Senator from Oregon, presiding, stood up and said, `We should respond,' what do you think would happen on this floor? Well, I hope to God what would happen on this floor would not be what happened in the British Parliament, what happened in the French legislature, what happened in the other capitals of Europe. I hope we would not say, `Oh, my goodness, no; maybe they have a historic right. Oh, my goodness, let's think about it. We will be making a commitment that is awful. Oh, my goodness, this is a dilemma.' 
What is the dilemma? What is the dilemma? Or Hungary. By the way, I happened to notice on the map, I don't know that anybody is talking about Ukraine, including Ukraine. I don't know that anybody is talking about Belarus, including Belarus. I don't know that anybody is talking about Slovakia, including Slovakia as being members of NATO now or in the near term. It seems to me they somehow sit between that iron ring and that noble emerging democracy of Russia. 
Look, I guess the thing that sort of got my goat a little bit here is that Americans do not have staying power. What they are really talking about is the Senator's generation and mine, Mr. President, that we do not have staying power. I will tell you about the staying power. The staying power of my friend's generation was real, but it was enviable because they didn't have to doubt whether or not what they were doing was saving the world. They didn't have to doubt whether or not what they were doing was, in fact, literally preserving the freedom of their wives and children back home in the old U.S.A. They didn't have to doubt that they were out there fighting one of the most miserable SOBs in the history of mankind. 
But my generation went full of doubt and still went--and still went--never once having the solace of knowing the malarkey we were being fed about Vietnam approached the truth of what their generation was fed about Nazi Germany and fascism in Europe. But they went. I don't doubt the staying power of the American people. I doubt the wisdom of our leadership in the places we have asked them to stay. But if this implies that if there were--and there is no realistic prospect of this--but if there were an invasion of Poland or Hungary or the Czech Republic, not a border dispute, an invasion, that we would not respond, that we would have to think about it, that there is any substantive difference today----

no ring at all, the notion that Kaliningrad is somehow going to be isolated relating to expansion. It is already isolated because of the place called Lithuania. The only answer to the lack of isolation is Lithuania limiting their sovereignty. That is the only answer. There is none other. Nobody can get from Kaliningrad to Russia through Poland. They are not trying to get there that way. This is about Lithuania when you talk about Kaliningrad. And the commitment being made to Poland and the Czech Republic and to Hungary, I hope we would make whether or not there was a NATO to which they would join.

Mr. BIDEN. As calmly as I can say it, I guess the point I am trying to make is, it seems to me we should compare apples and apples and oranges and oranges. Does the Senator believe there is any more or less support on the part of the American people to defend Dresden than there is Warsaw? To defend Budapest than there is Florence? To defend any one of the countries that we are talking about, their cities, than any other European city? It seems to me that is the question. If we would not go, if we cannot get American staying power to defend Poland, then I respectfully suggest we cannot get American staying power to defend Germany. 
I would think, in America, if you ask for a show of hands, so to speak, on a question of whether we should defend anybody--but the reasonable comparison was these NATO nations that are seeking admission versus NATO nations that are already in. To compare this to Iraq, with all due respect, is comparing very different things. 
By the way, five votes were a close call. But in my father's generation it was one vote that allowed the draft. The British had already been pushed into the English Channel, all of Europe had already been conquered, Jews were already being slaughtered, and there were not a lot of people walking off this floor, or any other floor in this generation or any other generation, raising their hands to join. It was only after Pearl Harbor. I don't say that critically; I say that as an observation, a statement of history, historical fact. 
So, this notion that the staying power in Somalia or even in the gulf should be equated to the staying power that would or would not exist in Poland, the Czech Republic or Hungary, I think is comparing two different things. I think the most appropriate comparison would be--and you may be right, Senator, that there is no staying power--but the staying power we would have to defend Germany, the staying power that we would have to defend Turkey, I will lay you out 8 to 5, you take the bet, if you took a poll in the United States of America and said you must send your son or daughter to defend one of the two following countries, Poland or Turkey, I will bet my colleague a year's salary they will say `Poland.' 
I will bet you a year's salary, and that is all I have. I have no stocks, bonds, debentures, outside income. I will bet you my whole year's salary. You know I am right. As Barry Goldwater would say, `you know in your heart I'm right.' 
So, if there is no staying power for Poland there sure in heck is none for Turkey.

Mr. BIDEN. I know the Senator from Connecticut wishes to speak. I will just take 2 minutes here. 
One, I want to make it clear, when I was making a case to my friends from Virginia and New York about the comparison of Turkey and Poland, it did not relate to whether there was merit in defending Turkey. There is. Not only merit, there is an obligation. I was making the larger point which goes to the serious issue the Senator from Virginia has raised honestly--and the only one who has done it forthrightly so far--and that is, is there a consensus in America to defend any European country? 
Whatever commitment we make, we must keep. And he is right in raising the issue: Are the American people--do you all understand, all America, that if we expand, we are committing our sacred honor to defend Poland as we have Germany, to defend the Czech Republic as we have England, to defend the country of Hungary as we have Denmark? Are we prepared to do that? That should be discussed, and it should be discussed forthrightly. And I thank him for raising that issue. 
There is much more to say, but I will have plenty of chance to say it, so I yield to my friend from Connecticut.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes this afternoon to address the urgent need for IMF funds, to restore confidence to a fragile international financial system and to maintain a leadership role in the world economy. 
I am pleased to see that the Appropriations Committee has moved quickly this week to provide funding for continued U.S. participation in the IMF--both for the new arrangements to borrow that represent the emergency reserves of the fund, and for the quota increase to restore the IMF's ability to meet potential new demands on its resources. 
The current news from Asia--declining U.S. exports, the threat of increased imports, a more fragile international banking system--has brought home to us the importance of international cooperation to prevent the outbreak and spread of financial crises. It also reinforces the need to move quickly to restore the IMF's ability to contain the current crisis and to maintain the IMF's ability to respond to future problems. 
That is why I am concerned about some of the conditions put on the IMF funds in the Appropriations Committee on Tuesday. Treasury Secretary Rubin, who, along with Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan has repeatedly reminded Senators of the need for quick action on these funds, has called those conditions--and I quote: `Impractical to the point of being unworkable.' 
This is no way to treat funds that are needed to restore the equilibrium of the international financial system, and to no way maintain the leadership of the United States in the world economy. 
The International Monetary Fund was created by us at the end of World War II to maintain the stability of the international financial system. Today, its task as the lender of last resort in the kinds of meltdowns we have seen in Asia is by no means simple. 
With the rise of market economies among the developing nations of the world, and with the expansion of the international financial system--both developments that promote the long-term interests of the United States--the task of the IMF has become increasingly difficult. 
I am not here today, Mr. President, to argue that the IMF is a perfect institution; in fact, our own Treasury, under the leadership of Secretary Rubin, has used its substantial influence to push for important reforms, to open the IMF to greater public understanding and trust. Secretary Rubin is also working with his counterparts around the world to reform the workings of the international banking system to reduce the risk of crises such as one we watch today in Asia with great concern. 
As the leader in the world's economy--indeed as the model economy which the rest of the world aspires to emulate--we in the United States have a special role to play in helping to sustain the health of the international economy. By maintaining our position in the IMF--by paying our dues and maintaining our dominant position there--we will remove lingering doubts in financial markets that make recovery and reform in Asia harder to achieve. 
And, as the most open economy in the world, we have the greatest stake in maintaining the stability of international trade and finance. The longer we leave the issue of our IMF commitment in doubt, the more our own farmers, workers, and manufacturers will lose overseas sales. 
I want to remind my colleagues that our contributions to the IMF don't cost American taxpayers a dime. Like deposits in a credit union of our own making, our contributions are matched by interest-bearing assets, and we can call for the return of those contributions if we choose. For those reasons, those contributions have no impact on our Federal deficit--or the surplus we now enjoy. 
With the outcome of the Asian crisis still to be determined, with the world looking to us for the leadership that will restore confidence to private sector investors, we must act quickly and decisively to maintain the strength of the IMF--and to maintain our own dominant voice within the IMF. We should not make demands of the IMF that could delay indefinitely the day when private financial markets regain the confidence that will mark the turning point in the current financial crisis. 
That is why I am pleased that my friend and colleague on the Foreign Relations Committee--chairman of the International Economic Policy Subcommittee--Senator Hagel, has taken the lead in introducing legislation authorizing funds for the IMF with workable, sensible reforms. Together with Senator Grams on our committee, and Senators Roberts, Chafee, and Domenici, Senator Hagel has provided us with an important point of reference when we consider IMF funding here on the Senate floor. 
And I hope that will happen soon. Right now, there is no guarantee that we will take up the urgent issue of IMF funding at any time this year. Failure to act, and to act soon, would be irresponsible. It would expose the United States as vacillating, indecisive, and unable to lead in a time when what is needed most is leadership and commitment to restore confidence and stability to a shaken financial system. 
Similarly, it would be irresponsible to add unrelated, highly charged issues to the consideration of what are clearly urgently needed funds for the IMF. 
Mr. President, I am confident that in the end, the United States Senate will respond to the current challenge with both the decisiveness and good judgment that must characterize the actions of a great Nation in time of crisis. 
I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to make that faith a reality.

Mr. BIDEN. The Senator does not owe the Senator from Delaware any apology at all. I think the case he makes is the correct case. 
I am particularly concerned that the most important foreign policy debate we have had maybe in the 25 years that I have been here is being used as a filler. That bothers me. It bothers me in the sense it lends an air of credibility to the unfair criticism that we have not adequately and fully and seriously taken into consideration the pros and cons relating to expansion. It just reinforces, in my view, that false argument. 
I happen to support the position of Senator Coverdell on the procedural aspects of the issue. There is no question the Senator from North Dakota, in my view, is correct. 
I have been here 25 years. We have just begun, in the last couple of years, deciding new and innovative ways to avoid the opportunity for people to be able to get a vote on issues on this floor. For the first 23 years I was here, I don't ever recall us being in a circumstance where the minority was presented with the proposition that you put up your package, we will put up our package, we each get one vote, and that is it. That is not the way the rules were intended to work, in my view. I am not suggesting that the majority leader is violating the letter of the Senate rules, but I think the spirit is being violated. 
I have a secondary problem that is almost as bothersome to me. I have, along with the Republican manager of this bill and the 
chairman of the full committee, Senator Helms, and others, devoted hundreds and hundreds of hours to this issue of NATO expansion, taken the issue very seriously, and now it is kind of like, well, yesterday we had extra hours so, boom, let's go ahead and throw in NATO. By the way, we don't know what else to do. Today we hit a logjam, the Democrats wouldn't swallow the, in my view, heavy-handed tactics employed here on the education bill; so, what do we get? There must be something out there--grab NATO. 
So it will reinforce the notion that somehow we are not taking this incredibly important foreign policy consideration seriously. This should be set aside to have one solid, continuous debate, whether it takes 2 hours or 2 weeks--and it is closer to 2 weeks, and appropriate, than 2 hours--in order for the public to be educated about what we are doing. I believe no foreign policy can be sustained or should be sustained without the informed consent of the American people. This a gigantic issue which, understandably, and historically, they are not interested in, in the day-to-day sense, in that they are more concerned about the classroom the Senator described in his own State or whether or not their company is downsizing and they will lose their job or whether or not they will be able to get their child to college. 
I am not critical of the American people. The only time we have an opportunity to get their attention--and when we do, they pay attention, they understand, they fully grasp what we are about--is if we say, `And now we are about to debate a major foreign policy issue. Basically, tune in, and we will have a coherent debate.' This place is capable of coherent and intelligent debate. This, in a sense, demeans the process and demeans the issue. 
The Senator owes me no apology. Now that we are on NATO, I hope we don't get off NATO; I hope we continue. Let's pick a course here. If we are going to debate this issue, debate it fully and resolve it and put everything else aside until we do it. I really hope the majority leader will refrain from using NATO as sort of a filler here, because it is so much more important, and we all know that the way in which the process treats an issue reflects, at least in the mind of the press and the public at large, what value we place on the issue, how important we think it is. 
I don't mean to be personally critical of the leader. I think he grabbed whatever was available procedurally to be able to be brought up and this was here. I am really sorry that we have gotten to this point. 
Again, let me conclude my comments relative to this by saying to the Senator from North Dakota, he owes me no apology. He is protecting not only his rights but he is protecting the rights of the Senator from Delaware, majority and minority Members. I have been here long enough to realize that there is no such thing as a permanent majority. I have been in the majority, I was then in the minority, I was back in the majority, and I am now in the minority, and I look forward to being in the majority again. This kind of precedence sets a tone that puts the majority--whichever party that may be--into the position of ratcheting up the way in which they attempt to have their way on the floor. I think it is not prudent.

Mr. BIDEN. I see my colleague from Nebraska is here. We worked closely together on the Foreign Relations Committee. 
I say to the Senator, I have an opening statement in the hope and expectation that we really will debate NATO now for some time. To make it clear to my colleagues who are listening, I have no strong preference whether we have education on the floor or NATO expansion on the floor; I just hope whatever we have, we stick with it, so there is coherence to the debate. That is my overall point. 
I ask my friend from Nebraska, as the manager for the Democrats on the NATO expansion issue, I have what we might call the obligatory very long and detailed statement. My statement is probably the better part of a half hour to 45 minutes. I don't want to begin if my friend would rather speak now. I want to accommodate the Senator. When I begin, I would like to be able to begin and, in an attempt to be coherent, lay out in detail my position on NATO expansion.

<TEXT>
Mr. BIDEN. I will proceed. 
I thank my colleague and I thank the Presiding Officer. 
Mr. President, I rise in support of the Resolution of Ratification of the Protocol for the Accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, which we oftentimes refer to as the Washington Treaty. 
On March 3, the Foreign Relations Committee, in a show of overwhelming bipartisan support, agreed to the resolution expanding NATO by a vote of 16-2. The decision of whether or not to enlarge NATO for a fourth time in its history is a momentous one. Unlike the admission of Greece and Turkey in 1952, West Germany in 1955, and Spain in 1982, NATO now, for the first time, is proposing to welcome former members of the now-defunct Soviet-led Warsaw Pact Organization. 
Mr. President, the rationale for favorable action on the resolution of ratification, in my view, is very clear. For political, economic, strategic, and cultural reasons, Europe remains an area of vital interest to the United States of America. We are a European power, and for our own safety's sake, in my view, we must remain a European power. Stability on that continent is fundamental to the well-being of our country and to our ability to move our assets and attention quickly to other parts of the world when necessary. 
The primary purpose and benefit of NATO, since its inception in 1949, has been ensuring stability in democratic Europe by guaranteeing the territorial integrity of alliance members. I argue, Mr. President, that this focus continues. History shows us that when there is a vacuum in Central and Eastern Europe, countries are forced to pursue their own individual security arrangements. We saw that before and after World War I. Enlargement, Mr. President--and this is a central reason why I believe it is in our interest to enlarge NATO, to embrace the three countries in question--will preclude a repeat of the developments in post-World War I. Enlargement will extend the zone of stability and help eliminate the gray area in Central and Eastern Europe. In fact, the prospect of enlargement has already had a positive impact on stability by stimulating internal reforms in Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic and encouraging them to resolve historic disputes with their neighbors. 
Mr. President, prior to Poland being offered the opportunity to join NATO, there was a question of whether or not the military controlled the military or civilians controlled the military in Poland. They made a very difficult political decision of doing what was stipulated in the Perry requirements--that is, the requirements set forth by former Secretary of Defense Perry--for expansion of NATO, and what all other NATO nations have done, which is to guarantee that there is civilian control of the military. I respectfully suggest that that action would not have been taken but for moving into NATO. 
The three applicants for NATO membership before us have resolved long and historic border disputes such as those between Poland and Germany, and Hungary and Romania. Romania, also hoping to become a member of the NATO, has for the first time in modern history reached an agreement for the equitable treatment of its Hungarian minority. I could cite you example upon example in Central and Eastern Europe where actions have been taken as a consequence of even the prospect of NATO membership. This prospect, of being anchored to the West, has caused many countries in that region to accord their behavior with international norms that we believe are minimum requirements for countries with whom we wish to be allied. So the process of NATO enlargement has already had, in my view, a very stabilizing impact on Europe. 
Numerous witnesses before our committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, have made a compelling case for NATO enlargement. They have not only made it to our committee, Mr. President, but to the committees on which you serve; they have made compelling cases of 
the strategic value of embracing the Poles, Czechs, and Hungarians as our allies in NATO in the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services Committee, as well. They talked about the qualifications for NATO membership and the fact that they will be net contributors to the alliance that we call NATO. 
My colleagues who vote for this resolution should, however, be clear about the costs. I realize that some outside groups who support NATO expansion, because they know I am such a champion of expansion and that I speak around the country about it, will say don't talk so much about the cost, because obviously the cost could be an Achilles' heel for enlargement. But I believe, Mr. President, as I said earlier, no foreign policy can be sustained, no matter how well conceived, without the informed consent of the American people. I think that one thing that your generation and mine learned about Vietnam, whatever other lesson we take away from Vietnam, is that without the informed consent of the American people, no policy can last. 
Part of the informed consent is to be honest and straightforward with the American people about the obligations we will be undertaking financially, politically, and militarily if we expand NATO. For what I do not want to see happen--it would be tragic--is to enlarge NATO, and 2 years later when the bill comes due, for colleagues who voted for expansion to say, `Wait, I didn't know it was going to cost me more money; I am not going to vote for more money.' Such a turn of events would exacerbate the always-present burdensharing debate within NATO, and could harm alliance cohesion. So I think it is important, Mr. President, that we be frank with ourselves about the costs. I look forward to debating my colleagues on what I think are very manageable costs, with benefits that far exceed any cost that expansion will entail. 
My colleagues who vote for the resolution should know what these costs are. They are real, but they are manageable. The most recent NATO estimates, which I will be talking about in great detail as this debate unfolds, calculate that direct costs to the United States will be roughly $40 million a year over the next 10 years. That is $400 million over the next 10 years. That is what it will cost, our direct costs, to bring these three applicants into the alliance. This reflects a realistic assessment of the state of the military infrastructure in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary and the threats that presently face NATO, which in a military sense are virtually nonexistent. It also reflects an equitable sharing of the burden among the existing 16 NATO members. 
In fact, a condition which the Foreign Relations Committee set forth in the resolution of ratification states, in effect, if there is not an equitable burdensharing arrangement, don't count us in. For example, I served with one of this nation's great Senators, Russell Long from Louisiana, who was chairman of the Finance Committee. I remember going up to him one day on the floor--I don't think he would mind my saying this--I walked up to him and said, `Mr. Chairman, I would like your help' on such and such a piece of legislation. It was in the Finance Committee. He looked at me--and those of you who served with him know he used to put his arm around your neck--and he said, `Joe, as my uncle used to say, I ain't for any deal I ain't in on.' 
The truth of the matter is, if we want the American people in on this deal, we have to let them know what the costs are, what it's going to be. We also have to, frankly, let our allies know what we expect of them and what portion of the cost we are contemplating they will carry. So that's why the resolution that the Senator from Nebraska and I helped report out of our committee specifies that the burdensharing must be equitable. And we go on in legislative language in the committee report to explain what we mean by that. But, again, I will come back to that point and many others that I will raise today as we continue this debate. 
Many have raised the possibility that enlargement of NATO may damage our relations with Russia. Mr. President, I believe very strongly, as one Senator who has spent a lot of time dealing with these foreign policy issues--which doesn't qualify me for anything other than knowing the arguments--that the single most important bilateral relationship our country has to deal with and nurture over the next decade is that with Russia. If Russia moves into the mode of being a democratic republic with a market economy, that bodes very well for us and our ability to deal with Russia and the rest of the world. If Russia turns into an absolute failure--something approaching the aftermath of the Weimar Republic--where totalitarian government re-emerges and militarism takes hold--that is very bad for us, and it is very bad for the world. So I take very seriously those Senators--and I count myself as one of them--who look at this enlargement of NATO, not solely, but in part, through the prism of how will this affect the single most important relationship we have, in my view, with another country. 
I come to a very different conclusion from some of the critics. I believe that the guaranteed stability in Central Europe that will be brought about as a consequence of expansion will enhance Russian security rather than diminish Russian security. I spent a great deal of time speaking with our Russian counterparts in the Duma, as well as with every leader of the four or five major factions in Russia--from true Democrats to old apparatchiks--and not a single solitary person I spoke with in Moscow believed that Russian security was diminished by the expansion of NATO. Not a single one viewed it as a threat. None of them liked it. Views ranged from seeing it as a slap in the face to a reflection of the attitude of the West that we never wanted Russia to be part of the West. Neither is true. Both are understandable. This is a nation that, as my mother would say, has fallen from grace, fallen very far--a superpower that is on the balls of their heels right now and feeling very, very put upon--a proud nation that has lost its empire. 
I am not suggesting that we have to do anything that would allow them to regain their empire, but I am suggesting that it is not difficult to understand their present thinking. I want to make it clear that I don't believe anyone can give me any proof or evidence that the enlargement of NATO to include these three countries in any way is likely to alter Russian behavior because Moscow now believes its security interests are in greater jeopardy than they were before. I do not believe there is any credible evidence to sustain that assertion, an assertion you will hear made over and over again by opponents of expansion on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
As I said, I do not dismiss the concerns that have been raised by my colleagues in this regard. But that is the very reason why I enthusiastically back the NATO-Russian Founding Act. The Founding Act, signed by Russia and NATO's Secretary General Javier Solana in the name of NATO, negotiated a consultative relationship with Russia on what we call `transparency.' In this agreement, NATO basically says, `Hey, Russia, look. This is what we are doing. We don't intend it as a threat to you. It is not an offensive threat to you. And, to prove it to you, we will let you take a look at what we are doing.' That is smart negotiating. That is smart business. That makes good sense. 
This act, which Russia signed formally with NATO--not just with us, with NATO--laid out how the alliance would give the Russians access to information. So that there was no reason for them to believe that we were doing anything as an offensive against them. To ensure Russian confidence that threat is not the rationale behind our action. 
I note parenthetically that one of my colleagues said to me at lunch, `Joe, I just spoke with a Russian ambassador, and he says that we refused to promise what they wanted us to promise--that we would never station additional forces and/or equipment and/or nuclear weapons on the soil of these three countries, and therefore we are engaged in a breach of good faith.' That is somewhat disingenuous, if that is what was said, and if I understood it correctly. Russia asked us to formally commit that we would not do that. We cannot formally commit to that. We cannot yield our sovereignty decisions to another nation. 
But what we did say was that this alliance--and what all of the Presidents of each of the three applicant countries fully understand--has no intention, no plans, no requirement, and there is no request from any of the applicant countries that NATO forces be stationed on their soil. Further, we said that there was no need for conventional equipment of an offensive nature to be forward-based on their soil or for nuclear weapons to be placed on their soil. We have committed that we will not do that. We have not, nor should we ever, commit that in writing to another power. 
Militarily speaking, what this expansion is going to require of us, as well as the Poles and the 15 other nations, along with the Czech Republic and Hungary, is the time and money to upgrade the applicants' military infrastructure. This means bringing up to NATO standards the runways, the hangars, the storage depots, the fuel depots, et cetera, as contingencies against an offensive action against these countries in the future by someone else. But upgrading infrastructure against a possible exterior threat is a distinction with a gigantic difference. 
NATO enlargement has been facilitated greatly by this Founding Act. In fact, the text of the resolution of ratification puts the Senate on record as supporting the Founding Act while restating the supremacy of the North Atlantic Council and advocating a new and constructive relationship with Russia. 
I know all of my colleagues on the floor know what the North Atlantic Council is. But since I am talking about the informed consent of the American people--and I hope they are listening--the North Atlantic Council is that mechanism whereby the designated representatives of the leaders of each of the 16 NATO countries meet and make policies, where they make the decisions. And Russia has no voice within that organization, nor should they, nor should any non-NATO member have a voice within that organization. But that is very different from saying that the North Atlantic Council should not reassure, if it chooses to do so, Russia, or any other nation, that we have no ill intent by what we do, allowing them to see, allowing them literally to have offices in a similar complex to be able to see what we are about. 
Those of you who are students of history, as I am--and it is sort of my avocation--would not disagree about the point made by some historians that World War I occurred in part as a consequence of a mistake, a mobilization that was meant to be a response but 
was viewed as an offensive. And things started unraveling. If there had been `transparency,' we may never have gotten to the point where the war started the way it did, and when it did, and where it did. 
So NATO enlargement, as I said, Mr. President, is a historic opportunity for the United States to set a positive course upon a situation in Europe, Russia, and the neighboring countries that is dynamic and fluid. Voting to enlarge NATO now, in my view, expands the zone of stability eastward, embracing those dynamic forces of positive change, giving them a chance to take hold and bear fruit in the future. 
I don't know whether your parents as you grew up had the same expressions that mine had. I will bet that if you sit down and give me 2, 3, or 5 expressions that your mother or father used more than 100 times, we could all come up with something. One of them that was heard in my family was, `Sometimes it is better to have a direction and move than to have no idea what you want to do.' Part of what we are doing here is giving direction to a fluid European security situation where no one can predict with any degree of certainty what is going to happen in Russia any more than they could guarantee the future of Romania, Poland, or any country in Central or Eastern Europe. But absent a structure, absent a framework, plan, a well thought out architecture, the likelihood of greater mistakes and more mistakes being made increases, in my opinion. 
So I go back to the central theme that my colleagues will hear me speak to time and again. Expanding the zone of stability into the gray area of Central and Eastern Europe is in the interest of all countries, including Russia. For the last thing, it seems to me that you would want, if you were a Russian leader is instability to your West. In saying this, I do not presume to tell another politician what is in his interest, or to tell another country what is in its interest. But I would respectfully suggest that if any of us were the leader of Russia, we would much prefer that there be peace and stability between Poland and Germany, Poland and Belarus, and Romania and Hungary, and so on and so on. Instability works against Russian interests as well as our own. This is a place where conscience and convenience cross paths, in my view. 
Mr. President, for all of those reasons, I believe that there is an overwhelming case for the bottom-line value to America of expanding NATO. Inevitably, however, the qualitative new situations surrounding the admission of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have occasioned serious questions, which I will attempt to deal with shortly. 
Before I turn to them, I thought I should dispel one procedural claim that has resurfaced in recent days. That claim alleges that there has been insufficient discussion of NATO enlargement to warrant the issues being considered by the full Senate at this time. That is the tactic, I say to the chairman of the full committee, Senator Helms, which we find those who oppose our position keep falling back to--a different strategy. First the tactic. I should say `tactic' rather than `strategy.' It was a frontal assault--which is their right, and I respect it--to stop expansion. I think they believe and have concluded that the momentum was too strong to do that. 
Then the next tactic was, Well, what we will do is we will not be able to fight expansion, but let's set conditions to expansion that could not be realistic, nor should necessarily be fulfilled before there is admission--conditions, I might add, we never set on the four previous occasions we enlarged NATO. Then when that looked like it might take hold--we don't know until we count the votes--but when that didn't seem to be gaining fervor, the part of the foreign policy community which I would argue is a minority of the community, including some of our well respected former colleagues who disagree with expansion, and some of our well respected present colleagues who disagree with our position, decided on a new tactic, and that was to argue that we just have not given sufficient time to debate this issue, so why doesn't the 
majority leader postpone the consideration of this for an indefinite period so we can really debate it. 
I asked one of the newspapers who made that argument--a reporter for one of the newspapers; he doesn't set the policy. I said, `I found it fascinating that you want an open and thorough debate. Your paper talked about the need for that. And yet, when the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee'--I will document this in a moment--`had hours and hours of hearings on this subject and finally voted on the resolution, it appeared in a small box below a Monica Lewinsky story. I don't quite get this.' Do you know what this person told me? He told my press person, `Well, another major paper in America put it on the front page. We will wait until we get to the debate and final vote.' 
Now, look. You can't have it both ways. This is not a subject that is going to get my mom at home saying, `Joey, I am so glad you are working on NATO. I think you should do that. Put aside Social Security. Don't worry about that. And put aside Medicare. Don't worry about that. And, by the way, education.' Americans don't think that way, they never have, about foreign policy. They have enough trouble figuring out how to put food on the table, sending their kids to school, how to pay the medical bills, and how to keep their jobs. 
So this notion that in the past we have had these debates about foreign policy where everything has come to a halt and all of America is focused on it, and all have been heard, that only occurs in times of crises. God forbid, were there an attack on NATO, it would be the focus of everyone in America. But it was not the focus even when Vandenberg was debating NATO in the late forties and before we voted on it. It is very hard to be proactive in a foreign policy initiative that is going to capture the imagination of the American people. And it is not because they are not interested; it is because they are urgently attending to many other things. That is one of the reasons I think we have a representative government. I think that is one of the reasons why they look to us. I think that is part of our job description. 
So to the extent that we could generate discussion and interest about this, I respectfully suggest under the leadership of Chairman Helms of the Foreign Relations Committee, we have in fact engaged in a serious debate thus far. The closer we get to this final resolution, the more the public will focus on it. In fact, few foreign policy issues have been scrutinized as closely or as openly in public session as this has been in the 25 years that I have been here. 
Beginning in 1994, the examination of the question of NATO enlargement by the Committee on Foreign Relations has been a well thought out and bipartisan effort. The committee's first hearings on NATO enlargement took place early in 1994. More hearings were held in 1995, and since October of 1997 the Foreign Relations Committee, under Chairman Helms' leadership, has had no fewer than 8 extensive hearings, for a total of 12 in all. One of those hearings was held last fall and featured testimony from 15 American citizens, many of whom represent grassroots civics groups interested in NATO. 
I would like to publicly commend the Senator, who is on the floor now, Senator Helms, for the strong and able leadership of the Foreign Relations Committee in building bipartisan support for membership of these three candidate countries and for helping to craft a bipartisan resolution for the protocols of accession. 
It is also important to note that three other Senate committees--the Armed Services Committee, the Appropriations Committee, and the Budget Committee--have also held hearings on NATO enlargement. The Armed Services Committee filed a report with the Foreign Relations Committee recommending certain understandings which the Foreign Relations Committee has taken into account in developing the resolution of ratification of the protocols of accession that we voted out 16 to 2. 
The Intelligence Committee filed a report that favorably assesses the intent and ability of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to protect classified military and intelligence information which would be provided them as NATO members--something we are all concerned about. We have not taken this thing on face value or willy-nilly. We had the committee of jurisdiction thoroughly look at it. They concluded that they would in fact be trustworthy members. 
From the very outset of 1994, the Foreign Relations Committee made certain that voices in favor of NATO enlargement as well as voices against enlargement would be heard equally and fairly. I believe this decision was essential for the committee members to get all sides of the argument. I will not go into the details at this moment of which witnesses addressed which arguments except to say that a glance at the list of witnesses reflects the extraordinary effort we made at balance. Many of the leaders of both the proenlargement and antienlargement camps were represented before our committee. And 2 months ago, in mid-January, the Committee on Foreign Relations published a 552-page document entitled: `The Debate on NATO Enlargement.' The compendium contained the full testimonies of witnesses from the seven hearings of the committee from October to November of 1997, questions from members of the committee and witnesses' responses and a good deal of additional material received for the record. It included the reprinting of lengthy articles against enlargement by Dr. Michael Mandelbaum, of Johns Hopkins University, one of the leading opponents of enlargement, and the report of a factfinding trip that I took late last year to Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia, to give you the extent, and a lot more is covered. I am not suggesting that my report is any more or less significant than what Dr. Mandelbaum or anyone else testified to, but I am making the larger point that it is extensive. 
Mr. President, it is possible that some aspects of the NATO enlargement question are not covered in this 552-page compendium, but I do not know of any, and I have spent, along with my colleagues in the Chamber, literally hundreds of hours attempting to educate myself on this subject, with 25 years of experience. The document I have referred to was sent to all 100 Senators with an accompanying letter from Senator Helms and me. 
In short, all the issues have been out there for a long time for any interested party to study. Moreover, the legislative record of the Senate testifies to a longstanding engagement with NATO enlargement. In 1994, 1995 and 1996 the Senate debated and approved legislation in favor of NATO enlargement. On July 25, 1996, by an 81-to-16 vote, the Senate approved legislation stating that `The admission to NATO of emerging democracies in central and Eastern Europe, which are found to be in a position to further the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty, would contribute to international peace and contribute to the security of the region.' 
Last April, by agreement, the majority leader, Senator Lott, and the minority leader, Senator Daschle, established the NATO Senate observer group to facilitate close interaction with the executive branch as plans for NATO enlargement went forward. 
Now, I cite this only to demonstrate that not only have we gone out of our way to look at the arguments for and against, but this group that was set up with Senator Roth, my senior colleague from Delaware, and me as the cochairs, that traveled with the President--not just the two of us but others, including the Senator from Nebraska--spent an inordinate amount of time with the administration, whether it was with the National Security Adviser, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the President himself, or the Vice President, so that we knew what was going on during the negotiations relative to who might be invited. 
On July 25, 1996, by a vote of 81 to 16, the Senate approved legislation stating that `Admission to NATO of emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe, which are found to be in a position to further the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty, would contribute to international peace and contribute to the security of 
the region.' 
I repeat that for a second time because that was back in July of 1996. Last April, as I indicated, the leaders of both parties set up this NATO observer group. Twenty-eight Senators, 14 in each party, were named to the observer group, and as I said, Senator Roth has demonstrated a strong commitment and leadership as chairman of this group. Since then, the observer group has held no fewer than 17 meetings with the administration, NATO and other foreign officials. Members met with President Clinton, Secretaries Albright and Cohen, National Security Adviser Berger, and many other high ranking civilian and military officials. Members of the Senate NATO observer group have met with the Presidents of Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and their Foreign Ministers. They have met with NATO's Secretary General Solana; they have met with NATO Chiefs of Defense, and the chairman of the NATO military committee. Some have actually met and addressed the NATO PermRep group that met here earlier in the year. We have met with the chiefs of staff of each of the present NATO members. There have been significant encounters. 
The observer group was represented in a delegation to the signing of the Founding Act between NATO and Russia in Paris in May of 1997. The Senate observer group was also represented in the U.S. delegation to the NATO summit in Madrid in July, and I would like to repeat that 28 Senators are members of this observer group. 
When we add to that the number of other Senators who are members of the Foreign Relations, Armed Services, Appropriations and Budget Committees, all of which have held hearings on NATO enlargement, we find that no fewer than 74 Senators have been exposed more than tangentially to the issue of NATO enlargement through one or more committees or the Senate NATO observer group--nearly three-quarters of the entire Senate. That is quite a remarkable fact, which I submit definitely puts to rest the charge that this issue lacks study. 
I challenge any of my colleagues to name me another major issue where 75 Members of the Senate have gotten themselves, through specific assignments, more involved in the details. To me, it is abundantly clear that consideration of the Resolution of Ratification of NATO enlargement upon which we are embarked today is the culmination of several years of detailed scrutiny and debate within the Senate. As a matter of fact, my good friend and worthy opponent on occasion, although we agree more than we disagree, the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia and I, even as long ago as last--I don't know how long ago it was now--found ourselves debating before a group of very distinguished--it wasn't an intended debate, but we ended up with, I thought, an informative and thoughtful debate before a group of leading citizens in the State of Connecticut at the behest of our friend, Senator Dodd. So we are not new to this, Mr. President, notwithstanding the fact this will be news to some members of the press and it will be news to some members of the public. But the notion that we have not taken it seriously and it needs more time, I think, is unfounded. 
That is not to suggest that it would not warrant taking a lot of time in the Chamber. I think that is totally appropriate because this is ultimately the forum where the folks actually get a look at what we are doing. No one followed us to Madrid or to Paris. No one was involved in that room in the Dirksen Building when the Senator and I exchanged views before a group of Connecticut voters. But the truth of the matter is this is the forum to do that. And knowing my friend from Virginia, who is on his feet and in the Chamber, it will be spirited and it will be an informative debate, at least from his perspective, from his side of the argument. 
Mr. President, I think it is abundantly clear the consideration of the NATO resolution of ratification for enlargement upon which we have embarked today is a culmination of several years of detailed scrutiny and debate within the Senate. I would like, now, to turn to some of the arguments against enlargement or for qualifications on enlargement, and then explain why I do not find them very convincing. 
Some say that since the Soviet Union is but a dead memory, some would suggest a bad memory, that there are no longer any threats to democratic Europe. Others maintain that because the Pacific rim and Latin America have gained in importance, we should scale down our commitment of resources to Europe and devote them more to the Pacific rim. 
Some of my colleagues worry that NATO enlargement may strengthen the nationalists and Communists, the Reds and the browns, within Russia and draw new dividing lines in Europe. Recently, fears have been voiced that NATO enlargement is open-ended and, hence, out of control. Opponents of NATO's involvement in Bosnia see it as an open-ended and dangerous model for future out-of-area NATO commitments, an expression put forward in a very articulate manner by my colleague from Missouri who is on the Foreign Relations Committee. 
Finally, on an issue that concerns us all, opponents assert that the cost NATO enlargement is going to require is not clear at best and exorbitant probably. Some fear that the cost of enlargement will fall disproportionately on the United States. All of these arguments against are important and, I submit, can be answered satisfactorily, but clearly must be answered. 
I submit, first of all, without minimizing the importance of Asia and Latin America, that Europe remains the vital area of interest to the United States for political, strategic, economic and, yes, cultural reasons. A sizable percentage of the world's democracies are in Europe, and the continent remains a major global economic player and a partner of the United States. 
In economic terms, the European Union, with a combined population a third larger than ours, has a combined GDP that exceeds ours. While the United States has a larger and, I might add, less balanced trading relationship with Asia than with Europe, we invest more in Europe. In fact, we have more direct investments in Europe than in any other area of the world, an amount in excess of $250 billion. 
Several new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe have highly educated work forces and, as President Clinton said in his message of transmittal of the protocols of accession, they `have helped to make Central Europe the continent's most robust zone of economic growth.' 
The three candidate countries already attract considerable American investment. Moreover, most Americans trace their cultural roots to Europe and millions retain personal ties to it. By any geographical standard, it would be a catastrophe for U.S. interests if instability would alter the current situation in Europe. 
How might that instability occur, Mr. President? No one believes that the Russian Army is poised to pour through the Fulda Gap in Germany, NATO's horror scenario for 45 years. The Russian Army is in such pitiful shape that it could not even reconquer little Chechnya, a part of the Russian Federation. 
Nonetheless, some say that someday Russia will regain her military might, and if democratization there does not succeed, NATO might, once again, be democratic Europe's insurance policy against reemergence of a hegemonic power, as is outlined in declaration 2 of the resolution of ratification. 
For the foreseeable future, however, the primary threats to stability in Europe are different, although no less real, than those of the cold war. We all know what they are. They are ethnic and religious hatred, as horrifyingly shown in the hundreds of thousands killed, raped, made homeless, and brutalized in Bosnia and most recently in Kosovo. They are the well-organized forces of international crime, whose tentacles extend from Moscow and Palermo to New York and Los Angeles. The history of the 20th century has demonstrated that the United States must--and I emphasize `must'--play a leading role in organizing the security of Europe. 
In World War I and World War II, and lately in Bosnia and Herzegovina, without American leadership, the countries of Europe have been unable to resolve their differences peacefully. While American idealism has certainly played a role in our various interventions to rescue Europe, enlightened self-interest has been our dominant motive. 
Put simply, it is in the vital interest of the United States of America that stability be preserved in Europe, not only because Europe itself is of central importance, but also in order that, when necessary, we are free to concentrate our assets on problems 
in other areas of the world. 
How does this need for security in Europe translate into 1998 terms? It means that we must lead the Europeans to create what is called in the current foreign policy jargon a new security architecture of interlocking organizations with NATO at its core. Of primary importance is that this policy will guarantee stability to Central Europe, where newly independent states are striving to create and solidify political democracy and free markets. This is a very difficult process, subject to destabilizing forces like ethnic antagonisms, economic downturns, international crime, and, in some cases, thinly disguised foreign pressure. It is in this context that the enlargement of NATO must be seen. 
During the cold war, NATO provided the security umbrella under which former enemies, like France and Germany, were able to cooperate and build highly successful free societies. It was the framework under which former pariahs, like Germany, Italy, and Spain, could be reintegrated into democratic Europe. And it was NATO that on several occasions helped keep the feud between Greece and Turkey from escalating into full warfare. 
The enlargement of NATO can now serve to move that zone of stability eastward to Central Europe and thereby deter external destabilization, prevent ethnic conflicts from escalating, and forestall a scramble for new bilateral-multilateral pacts along the lines of the 1930s from occurring in the 1990s and the next century. This is the strategic rationale for enlargement laid out in detail in declaration 2 of the resolution of ratification. In fact, the zone of stability is already developing. 
As I mentioned earlier, in anticipation of NATO membership, several Central and East European countries have settled longstanding disputes. I need only mention Hungary and Romania, Slovenia and Italy, Germany and the Czech Republic, Poland and Lithuania, Romania and Ukraine, and there are other examples I will go into detail about later. If NATO were not to enlarge, however, the countries between Germany and Russia would inevitably seek other means to protect themselves. It is a certainty. The policy option for today is not, as it is often phrased, enlarge NATO or remain the same. The status quo is simply not an option over the next several years. 
Mr. President, there is one additional argument for NATO enlargement which may have fallen out of fashion, and I am going to mention it now at the risk of engaging this debate in a different direction, and that is the moral argument--the moral argument. 
For 40 years, the United States loudly proclaimed its solidarity with captive nations of Central and Eastern Europe who were under the heel of Communist oppressors--40 years. Now that most of them have cast off their shackles, it seems to me it is our responsibility to live up to our pledges to readmit them into the West through NATO and the European Union when they are fully qualified. 
In my view, not to do so out of an excessive fear of antagonizing Russia would accord Moscow a special sphere of influence in Central Europe, essentially validating the division of Europe at Yalta. For me, such a course is unthinkable. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have all made tremendous efforts to meet NATO's stringent membership requirements, and, based on my reckoning, they have succeeded. 
Not even the opponents of enlargement can dispute that fact. Hence, as declaration 4 of the resolution of ratification reaffirms, the three new members will have all the rights, privileges, obligations, responsibilities, and protections that are afforded all other NATO members. There is no second-class citizenship in NATO. 
Ironically, within the fruits of NATO's unparalleled success lie the seeds of its possible demise. Alliances are formed to fight wars or to deter them. Once the adversary is gone, unless alliances adapt to meet changing threats, they lose their raison d'etre, they lose their reason for being. Thus, enlargement must be accompanied by a fine-tuning of NATO's so-called strategic 
concept last revisited in 1991. 
The alliance's primary mission, outlined in article 5 of the Washington Treaty of April 4, 1949, remains the same: treating an attack on one member as an attack on all and responding through the use of armed forces, if necessary. 
Condition 1 of the resolution of ratification underscores that the core purpose of NATO remains collective defense. In addition, since the end of the cold war, non-article 5 missions, like peacekeeping, sometimes in cooperation with non-NATO powers, have become possible. The SFOR joint effort in Bosnia with Russia and several other non-NATO countries is an excellent example. 
To the critics who see our involvement in Bosnia as a harbinger of future NATO peacekeeping engagements or, from their point of view, entanglements, I would only say the success in Bosnia will provide the best deterrent to future ethnic cleansers and aggressors and, thereby, reduce the likelihood that American troops will have to be used in combat in Europe. 
Condition 1 of the resolution of ratification foresees article 4 missions on a case-by-case basis only when there is a consensus in NATO and that there is a threat to the security interests of the alliance members. Through briefings required by condition 1, the executive branch will have to keep the Senate informed of any discussions in NATO to change or revise their strategic concept. 
Some critics might ask why the Europeans can't take care of their own problems. First of all, Europeans shoulder three-quarters of the common funded cost of NATO and furnish an even higher percentage of the alliance's troops. Both our current NATO allies and the candidate countries have agreed to shoulder their fair share of financial costs and all mutual obligations connected with enlargement. 
In order to guarantee a continuation of this alliance burdensharing, condition 2 of the resolution of ratification mandates an annual report by the President containing detailed, country-specific data on the contributions of all NATO members. It also requires that the inclusion of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary not increase the percentage share of the United States to the common budgets of NATO. 
To my colleagues who are understandably concerned about possible hollowing out of our worldwide military capability--by that I mean they argue that expanding NATO and the additional resources required will require us to take military resources to other parts of the world, meaning they will have a hollow capability in other parts of the world, thereby, in an overall sense, reducing our security--those who are concerned about this possible hollowing out of our worldwide military capability, I draw your attention to another element of condition 2 of the resolution of ratification which directs the President to certify that NATO enlargement will not detract from the ability of the United States to meet or to fund its military requirements outside the NATO area. 
I know that many of my colleagues are concerned about the enlargement's effect upon our erstwhile cold war enemy Russia. I firmly believe that NATO enlargement will not adversely affect U.S. relations with the Russian Federation. As I indicated earlier, I came to that conclusion following a trip to Moscow and several European capitals last year and subsequent discussions on that topic. 
Although few Russians are fond of NATO enlargement, policymakers in Moscow have come to terms with the first round. Moreover, no Russian I met with, from Communist leader Zyuganov to liberal leader Yavlinsky to the nationalist leader Lebed, none of them believe that NATO enlargement constitutes a security threat to Russia. 
In fact, nearly all politicians and experts with whom I met understood the nonaggressiveness implicit in NATO's two recent declarations on nuclear and conventional forces. In the famous `three noes,' the alliance declared that it has no reason, intention, or plan in the current or foreseeable security environment to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of new member states and no forces to do that, no forces, in the future. 
Similarly, NATO stated that in the current environment, it would not permanently station substantial combat forces of the 16 members on Polish, Czech or Hungarian soil. Rather, the Kremlin's public opposition to enlargement is largely--largely--a psychological question connected with the loss of empire, wounded pride and, most importantly, an uncertainty about Russia's place in the world of the 21st century. The Russian Ambassador in Washington reiterated this psychological problem in a newspaper article just last week. 
As part of this uncertainty, most Russian leaders are worried about their country being marginalized, and as a result, they are eager to move forward with its bilateral relationship with the United States. 
We must continue to engage Russia politically, militarily, economically, and culturally. Declaration 5 of the resolution of ratification specifically endorses this `new and constructive relationship' with the Russian Federation. 
The Clinton administration, together with our NATO allies, has already begun to do just that. The NATO-Russian Founding Act signed in Paris last May is a good start at binding Russia closer to the West and soothing its bruised feelings. 
The Founding Act, however, in no way gives Moscow a decisionmaking role in NATO's core structures like the North Atlantic Council, as condition 3 of the resolution specifically explains. 
The purely consultative mandate of the new NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council does not mean that it cannot evolve into a truly valuable mechanism for promoting mutual trust. 
As Russian officials better understand that NATO is not a rapacious caricature of Soviet propaganda, but rather a defensive alliance and force for security and stability in Europe, their animosity toward the organization may dissipate. And by working together in the Permanent Joint Council, Russia can prove that it is a responsible partner for the West. 
Through this mechanism and others, over time Moscow can come to realize that enlargement of NATO by moving the zone of stability eastward to Central Europe will increase her own security, not diminish it. 
It is also essential that arms control agreements with Russia be ratified and expanded. 
Of special importance is getting the state duma, their parliament, to ratify the START II treaty and then, together with the United States, to move on to further reductions in START III. 
The statement last week made by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin that he would push for duma ratification of START II is another clear sign that NATO enlargement does not stand in the way of arms control. 
The nationalist and Communist objections to START II predate even a discussion of NATO enlargement, and I might add that in my meeting with Chernomyrdin, even though he and I got into a heated discussion about Iran, he never once suggested that expanding NATO was going to diminish the prospects of ratification of START. I asked him, and others did, when he thought that would occur. Because it was a private meeting, I will not set the time or the date that he suggested. But I will assure you that he is of the 
view that ratification will occur. 
Now, how does that square with those who say that talk of expansion is going to kill arms control? I managed, along with significant assistance from my friend from the State of Oregon, the Chemical Weapons Convention. We were told if we ratified that, the duma would never, if we went ahead and invited these three nations to join NATO, they would never ratify it. 
While we were together in Spain, if I am not mistaken, with the President of the United States, the Secretary of State, the National Security Adviser, the Secretary of Defense and the Presidents of 15 other NATO nations, the duma either at that moment or shortly thereafter, by an overwhelming vote, ratified that arms control agreement. And now Chernomyhrdin--to our friends who believe that NATO expansion will be damaging and cite him and his predecessor as a casualty of the talk of expansion--sat in a room just across the hall, the door I am pointing to, last week and talked about his certainty that there will be a ratification of the START agreement. As my brother would say, `Go figure.' How does that justify the argument or make the case that this is going to kill cooperation with Russia on arms control? 
The arguments against the START II predate any debate on NATO enlargement. The duma has shown, though, that it is willing to conclude agreements, as I have indicated, not only the Chemical Weapons Convention, but the Flank Document to the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe, or the so-called CFE agreement. All have been ratified. 
Condition 3 of the resolution of ratification reaffirms that the ongoing CFE talks are a venue for further conventional arms control reductions, not the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council. Did you hear what I just said? That is an important, if I do say so myself, an important point. That is that if, in fact, Russia was determining everything through the prism of whether or not we are expanding NATO, why are they not insisting that further discussions on conventional arms be done through the NATO-Russia accord? Why are they continuing to use the mechanism that was in place? Why did they pass the Chemical Weapons Convention? Why does their Prime Minister believe they are going to ratify the START agreement? And even if they do not, why is he pushing it? 
It is because they are wise enough to know it is not an offensive threat and wise enough to know that arms control agreements should be judged based upon whether, standing by themselves, they are in the interest of their country or not. 
Although the Russians have all but officially acquiesced to the first round of NATO enlargement, they would, I acknowledge, have much more trouble with the admission in the future of some other countries in Europe, principally the Baltic states or Ukraine. 
Critics of enlargement worry that the process is so open-ended that it is dangerous. It is true that the official policy of NATO as most recently enunciated in the 1997 Madrid summit, is the `open door'--and that is the official, enunciated policy--and that membership in the alliance is open to any European state, any European state that is in a position to further the principles of the NATO treaty, the North Atlantic Treaty, and to contribute to the security of the alliance as a whole. 
But it is equally true, as declaration 7 of the resolution of ratification unambiguously states, that other than Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, the United States has not consented to invite any other country to join NATO in the future. 
Moreover, according to declaration 7, the United States will not support such an invitation unless the President consults with the Senate according to constitutional procedures and the prospective NATO member can fulfill the obligations and responsibilities of membership and its inclusion would serve the political and strategic interests of the United States. 
This declaration, Mr. President, is crystal clear and not only refutes the critics of enlargement, but also obviates the need for any amendment that would impose an artificial pause upon the 
enlargement process after this round. 
Such a condition would not only be superfluous, but would also have serious negative practical consequences. It would slam the door in the face of the several countries that in good faith are adjusting their policies to meet NATO requirements. 
It would also arbitrarily rule out admission of already qualified countries like Slovenia, a formal applicant, and Austria, which might reassess its neutrality after national elections next year. 
The amendment that would postpone the admission of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic until they are admitted to the European Union is also, in my view, fatally flawed. Declaration 6 of the resolution of ratification recognizes the EU as `an essential organization for economic, political, and social integration of all qualified European countries into an undivided Europe' and encourages the EU to expand its membership. 
My friend from Oregon, who is on the floor, and I share a number of common views related to this, one of which is we have been individually--to the best of my knowledge, this is correct; and I will stand corrected, obviously, if I am not--either quietly chastising or publicly promoting our European friends to expand the EU membership. We think we have problems with American special interests. Well, in Europe it pales by comparison in terms of certain political groups within Europe who are not at all willing to expand. But it must expand. 
So we do not argue with the need for the EU to expand. That is why in declaration 6 of the resolution of ratification, we cite the EU as an essential organization for economic, political, and social integration. 
But the EU has a lengthy, complex admissions procedure, which employs criteria very different from those of NATO. 
Let me end where I began. Why on Earth would the United States want to link fulfillment of our strategic goals to an organization in which we have no say and to which we do not even belong? Why would we do that? I do not understand that. Why would we say, yes, we know our interests are impacted upon. We are a European power. And the security architecture of Europe, whether you are for or against enlargement--we are all agreeing that is important. One of the reasons my friend from West Virginia is opposed is he says it will harm the security architecture. One of the reasons we are for it is we say it will enhance it. 
Whether we are for or against it, why, in the Lord's name, would we say that whatever that architecture should be is going to be determined by an organization where we do not have a vote? I do not get that. I truly do not get that one. 
Is that to say I do not think like the Senator from New York thinks, that the faster the EU is expanded, the more stability there will be in Europe? No. I agree with that. I agree with that. It is in our interest. It is also going to be a competitive problem down the road for us as well, but it is in our interest. But, my goodness, to say that the one thing we all agree on, NATO in its present form or altered state is the security architecture for Europe that is important to us, but its future we are going to yield to an economic organization of which we are not a member and we have no vote--I 
find that absolutely incredible. 
Now, I will end with this. This is my last statement, and I appreciate the indulgence of the colleagues. I warned my colleagues early on this was an opening statement and would take this long, and I am about to finish. 
As for the argument that the addition of three new members would somehow render the alliance immobile in the face of all objective evidence, the Presiding Officer knows how this argument goes. My goodness, we have trouble enough getting 16 members together; adding 3 more, it will be harder to get consensus. This `doing business by consensus,' means everyone signs on. Therefore, it will be a lot harder. Therefore, that is the argument against enlargement. 
I might add, by the way, if we are looking for certainty, we would not have expanded beyond the United States. We would have had great difficulty expanding anyway. I do not disregard this argument but it does fly in the face of all objective evidence. 
The three previous rounds of NATO enlargement did not damage the cohesiveness of NATO, and there is every indication that the Poles, the Czechs, and the Hungarians will be among America's most loyal allies. I will get myself in trouble for saying this, but were the French only as cooperative as the Hungarians. I pray the day comes that my French ancestors are as cooperative as are the Hungarians. Or, I doubt whether we will see the day when the internal differences between the Poles and the Hungarians, divided by other countries, separated by other countries, will have disagreements that equal those that exist within Greece and Turkey at the moment. These three new nations, if anything, will strengthen our position within NATO as well as strengthen NATO. 
In considering the ratification of NATO enlargement to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, the Senate has a historic opportunity to enhance the security of the United States of America by extending the zone of stability and peace in Europe. 
Mr. President, I look forward to our debate on this resolution of ratification, which I truly believe protects American interests and American leadership within NATO. At its base, you will detect, not from my friend from Virginia, I want to make this clear, but I predict to you on the floor, you will find an undercurrent here that really, if phrased correctly, would be stated this way: Why do we need NATO? Much of the debate about expansion is really the debate about the efficacy and need of an organization, the one we have now. 
I note parenthetically if my friends say why expand NATO when there is no threat in Europe, I ask the rhetorical question, why continue to have NATO if there is no threat in Europe? 
I see my friend from Virginia is on his feet. I welcome his comments or questions, but I will yield the floor to give anyone else an opportunity to speak, if they wish. But I want to make it clear to my friend I am not retreating from the field; I will stay here if he wishes to engage me.

<TEXT>
Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be delighted to answer. 
Let me make one prefatory comment. My reference to 74, 75 Senators being exposed to this issue is in no way to imply that all 75 or 74 were in favor of expansion. I know, with men of the caliber of the Senator from Virginia, and the man who I think is one of the most informed people in the Senate that I have ever served with, my friend from New York, Senator Moynihan, I know with their doubts about expansion that this is far from a certain outcome. So I do not mean to imply that all who were exposed were in favor. I was responding, before the Senator came to the floor, to the assertions made in the press that this has not been given due consideration by Members of the Senate. 
Let me go specifically to the question that was asked; then I will finish my statement and will be happy to yield then or engage in a colloquy or take questions. That is I, too, agree that Harry Truman was one of the great Presidents and Harry Truman did say that one of his two greatest achievements was NATO. He said the reason NATO was necessary was a moment of uncertainty in world history. I respectfully suggest if there has ever been a moment of uncertainty, and I might add `in world history,' it is today. 
I spoke at my hometown, my birth town, of Scranton, PA, last night to an organization called the Friendly Sons of Saint Patrick, where my great grandfather was a founder in 1902, a State Senator named Edward Blewitt, and I quoted William Butler Yeats' poem `Easter 1916,' where he concluded by saying the world is changed. `All changed, changed utterly: A terrible beauty is born.' He is talking about `the rising,' as we Irish Catholics refer to it, the rising on Easter Sunday in 1916. 
I would paraphrase that by saying: With the fall of the wall, a terrible beauty has been born. It is a new world. The world has changed utterly. 
Although it is a different threat, although it is a different concern, although it is not amassed forces of the Warsaw Pact lining up to flow through the Fulda gap to take over West Germany, it is a different enemy. The different enemy is uncertainty. The different enemy is instability. The different enemy is nations seeking to define themselves and their futures and their security relative to one another in an area of the world--I will get in real trouble with my European friends for saying this--where the degree of political maturation has not moved to the point that I have confidence they will reach the right decision without our involvement in that process. So, the same circumstance, uncertainty, exists today as existed in 1946, 1947, and 1948--uncertainty. 
Second, the Senator asked, Is this a military alliance? It is a military alliance. That is why I hope we will continue to treat it as a military alliance and reject this facile argument being promoted by some, put forward by some of my friends who are among the most respected former Members of the U.S. Senate, who say they should join the EU before they join NATO. 
If this is a military alliance, why in the heck do they have to join an economic union before they join the military alliance? It is a military alliance. I might add, we have not asked anyone else to do that. It is beyond me why we would ask, why we would put the fate of the military architecture of Europe in the hands of an economic organization of which we are not a member, have no vote, and have no ability to shape, essentially giving these other European nations the ability to veto our ability to put together this new architecture for security in Europe. 
But to the very specific point the Senator raised, what about the notion that we are inviting Hungary but not Romania? Are we creating this dynamic where we gave Hungary a great boost up and Romania essentially is pushed down in relative terms? I will go into great detail to respond to that as the debate goes on, but in the interests of getting on with the rest of my statement, let me answer it with a question: If the countries that border the countries that are being invited are going to be put at such a disadvantage, I would ask the question, why do they all favor the expansion? Why did Romania favor--favor, 
now, notwithstanding the fact they fought to be invited and were not--why do they favor Hungarian membership? Why do the Germans favor Polish membership? Why are all the countries that sought admission thus far in favor of the three countries that were granted the opportunity to prove they were ready to join? 
I would add one further fact. The corollary to that question would be: Are we then going to be placed in the position of either having to embrace all the former Soviet Union in one fell swoop as members of NATO whether they are ready or not, or none? Because if you take the logical extension of my friend's argument, it leads you to only one of two conclusions: Either every country seeking admission should be admitted at the very same moment, thereby not allowing one to have the perceived advantage my friend from Virginia says occurs with membership, or the perceived disadvantage of not being a member--you either admit them all at once, which I am positive he does not support, absolutely positive, or you admit none. You have no alternative. 
So I say respectfully to my friend, this is a dynamic situation. The world is changing rapidly. We do not have the ability to freeze-frame the world and say now we are in one broad stroke going to redefine, in this case the security architecture of Europe, with finality. That's it. 
That is not the history of NATO. When NATO started, Germany was not part of NATO. Germany was not part of NATO. It would have been reasonable to ask why do we have a NATO with no Germany? It was equally reasonable to ask why in the devil would you have Germany part of NATO at the time? When we brought in Germany, we did not say bringing in Germany puts Turkey and Greece at a disadvantage. We did not say that. When we brought in Turkey and Greece, we did not say Spain will be hurt badly. One of the problems with foreign policy is that it reflects life writ large. There is nothing neat about it. Notwithstanding what many of my academic friends enjoy doing, we are not able to come up with a universal construct that in one fell swoop can be materialized. 
I suggest to my friend, the invitation to Hungary has produced democratization internally within Romania, a consequence that was not anticipated by anybody 2 years ago. So, instead of, for example, Hungary being invited and Romania being outraged and having their policy move toward totalitarianism and away from democracy, the exact opposite happened. It created a dynamic effect. I am not here to tell any of my colleagues that I can predict with certainty what the dynamism will produce. I have served here sufficiently long to be sufficiently humble to know that I do not possess that capacity. But I do suggest that we can play the odds, and the odds are this is a pretty good bet, an overwhelming good bet. 
So, my response, and I will go into it in more detail as the debate goes on, but my response is that if I accept the proposition put forward by my colleague in the way in which the question was phrased, then I am left with a conundrum of either everybody or nobody. And I, to paraphrase Russell Long when he used to kid around, `I ain't for nobody, but I also ain't for everybody right now.' 
So I think this is a rational, relatively predictable--to the extent anything can be on the world stage--and useful incremental development of an architecture that hopefully will take us for another 50 years with peace and security in Europe like the last architecture. 
I will note here, parenthetically, I do not think the choice is expand or status quo. I think the choice is expansion or atrophy, and I will go into that in a later moment.

Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, in response, as the Senator will see in the Record, what I said was they have accepted the first round, explicit in terms of the first round. 
The second point is I may have misled the Senator, but unintentionally, when I talked about the NATO nations of the former Soviet bloc nations that were seeking admission. I do not include Ukraine in that. 
Third, the Senator is absolutely correct that there is talk in and among, in Russia and among Russian leaders, about no second round. 
The Senator then went on to say that under no circumstance should we give them a veto right over any security question. That is why I believe that the amendment he is considering would be very, very unwise. I think if he concludes it is not in our overall interest, and by that I mean including our relations with Russia not to have a second round, we should not have a second round. We should make that decision ourselves. We should not preempt that decision by essentially yielding to the concern expressed by Russian leaders today, because I respectfully suggest--and who knows whether the Senator and I will still be here; he may be, I may not--when the full integration of these three countries occurs, I predict to you there will be a very different circumstance in Russia 3 years from today than there is today. It is not static. 
We assume that there is a dynamism of what is happening in the West and in Central Europe as if there is no dynamism in Moscow or in Russia. I acknowledge that could turn sour, but I think there is even a better chance it will turn positive. 
I would not want us to preempt ahead of time, prematurely, unnecessarily, appearing to be yielding to the most conservative elements in Russia, giving them an upper hand in the debate in the Duma, by us going on record of first establishing the membership of three new countries, and in the same breath saying `but we will not do anymore.' I guarantee you if that occurs, I am prepared to bet any one of you that within a 24-hour period that the Duma is in session, you will have the allies of Mr. Zyuganov standing on the floor saying, `If only Yeltsin had done what we did 
and told the Americans we would not stand for a second round,' he would have gotten the result we got. I respectfully suggest that if you don't want to expand, make the case in here. If you don't want to expand any further, see to it that does not occur by importuning our President and this body, but not formally going on record at this time to say that, yes, these three, but no more for a time certain. So I hope that answers the Senator's question.

Mr. BIDEN. Yes. If I may be precise, when I said that I found no one of the major political leaders in Moscow viewing the expansion of NATO as a security threat to them, I was referring explicitly to the first round. That included the prospect of four nations at the time, not just three. There was no concern expressed by anyone to whom I spoke, including the think tank folks in the Russian-American--my friends from Virginia or New York may remember what it was called.

Mr. BIDEN. The Canadian-American department. Even among them, there was no concern. As a matter of fact, there was a sense of bravado when they would say, `obviously, this is no security threat to us, but. . . .' The `but' would come in and the `but' always related to something along the lines of: This is an attempt on your part to isolate us, an attempt on your part to keep us from becoming full members of the economy to the West; or this is an attempt on your part to humiliate us, but not a security threat. 
So I was speaking to the prospect of four nations, only three of which are being invited here. I was not talking about the Balts, Ukraine, Belarus, or other countries that could, theoretically, come up in a 2nd, 3rd, 5th, or 15th round.

Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I will respond briefly. Speaking for only myself, I believe that my colleagues are correct. There is no urgency to move to the next round. But I point out that, from my perspective, I think the position we should be taking is not a formal position that belies the principle of saying anybody who is ready can come forward; I say that we should say that there will be no second round until all these three nations are fully integrated into NATO's integrated command structure. No one suggests that is likely to occur in less than a couple of years, and most think it will be like it was for Spain, Turkey, Greece, and like it was for Germany--several years. 
My deceased wife used to say something. I will never forget, when we were a young married couple, we were visiting another couple and we had two young children a year and a day apart, 2 months old and 14 months old. We were with this other couple we had gone to school with and they had their young child there. The husband and wife began to argue about what college they wanted her to go to, this 12-month-old child. My wife, who had great wisdom, said this as we were riding home in the car: `Let's make a pact never to argue about anything that requires a decision not to occur for at least a decade.' So from that point on, we used to say when we got into an argument, `this is about college and they are only 
in grade school,' and that was our code phrase for, Look, when the time comes, we can settle that; why fight about that? We have enough to disagree on now. 
I respectfully suggest that `this is about college.' Let's wait until that time comes. Don't prejudge it. Don't artificially set limits on it because then you send a different message. I want the Romanian Government, which has been on good behavior for the first time in five decades or longer--I want the Romanian Government out there, just like my 16-year-old daughter, saying, `If I behave this weekend, maybe I'll get the car next weekend.' I want the Romanian Government out there saying, No, it could not happen tomorrow, or it may not happen for a month, or for 3 years, but I know it won't happen if we don't continue to treat this Hungarian minority properly, et cetera. Why set these artificial limits? Let's not argue about what college our daughter is going to go to when she is only 2 years old. It is going to take 2 to 3 years to fully integrate the three countries in question. So I think the Senator will get his wish regardless of whether or not an amendment is passed. I just think we are begging for trouble by setting artificial limits.

Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, he did not promise them anything. He threw a lifeline out because the Europeans threw no lifeline out, because the Europeans didn't do what my friend from New York is encouraging them to do. They did not step forward. They were irresponsible in their unwillingness to invite the Balts to become part of the European Community. They finally, about a month and a half ago, at the same time they kicked Turkey in the teeth, extended a belated invitation that is somewhat attenuated. But that is the reason the President did that. 
We are looking for stability. Stability. I don't want anyone in the Balts, I don't want anyone in Ukraine, I don't even want anyone in Belarus, which is still a totalitarian country, concluding that there is no hope. I don't want to falsely hold out hope for them. The reason why, I assume, the President said what he said relative to the Balts was to dampen, not to inflame the debate here about whether or not the Balts were being shortchanged by not being brought in. I have just been handed something by my staff here, and I have been here so long I need glasses. It must be very insightful.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it is signed by the President and the heads of state of Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia in mid-January, as a commitment to a Europe that is whole and free, based upon Western values and Baltic integration into interlocking European and transatlantic security institutions. 
The key language on NATO membership states: 
The United States of America welcomes the aspirations and supports the efforts of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to join NATO. It affirms its view that NATO's partners can become members as each aspirant proves itself able and willing to assume the responsibilities and obligations of membership, and as NATO determines that inclusion of these nations would serve European stability and the strategic interests of the Alliance. 
We said the same thing to the Russians and to every other country. I might add, by the way, when I say the President made the same commitment for theoretic membership of Russia in the alliance, people say, `Oh, my God, how can you say that?' I would like to take us back 40 years when NATO was contemplating debate on this floor. If someone would have said, `if the admission of Germany would enhance stability, we would invite them,' they would have been looked at like they were crazy. Our goal is European stability, territorial integrity. I don't think the President's actions in fact----

Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I will attempt to respond. Please, I ask both my colleagues. I have a very good friend whose interest is more practical in academics, and every once in a while I will say, `Bob, do you understand what I am saying?' And he will look at me, and say, `Joe, I not only understand, I overstand.' If I get into the `overstand' category, please let me know if I am overresponding to what you wish me to respond to. 
But let me answer the French issue first. It is always difficult, as my friend knows, understanding what the French mean. But the short answer to his question is that France has changed its view. France has publicly now said that in fact it will now meet its share of the expansion cost. 
Second, on the first question asked about target goals, I remind my friend of a little bit of history; that is, that it is important to note that Greece, Turkey, Germany, and Spain were admitted to NATO without any target force goal, and that no ally meets--including us--100 percent of the target force goal now, No. 1. 
No. 2, to the extent that the three new applicants are committing to and fulfilling their targets in advance of accession is another demonstration that their commitment to the alliance and their capability to fulfill those target goals are, in fact, real, Poland has stated that it will fulfill all the target force goals that are due prior to accession. The Poles address the capabilities of NATO military authorities to determine what NATO military authorities have determined are necessary for new members. Of the additional target force goals over the planning period of 1999 to 2003, only a portion of them have target dates that are applicable prior to accession. Poland has also stated that it will complete all the remaining target goals; the other nations as well. And when you talk about the target goals, the Senator makes it sounds as though it will be 10 years before anything is done, 10 years before all of these things are met. Many of them will be met within the next 6 months; some will take as long as 10 years. 
With regard to what number I am using in terms of the cost of enlargement, I am using the figure $40 million a year for the next 10 years. If you want me to elaborate on that, I will be happy to explain what I mean by how I arrive at that and why I think the figure that has been put forward by NATO is an accurate figure. But I do not want to take the time of my colleagues, if they wish to respond. 
So I say to my friend, the figure that I am using is the figure of $40 million a year based upon a U.S. commitment of $400 million over 10 years. That reflects roughly a 25 percent burden sharing on our part for the costs of enlargement, the total cost being, over 10 years, roughly $1.5 billion. That is how I arrive at our cost. I will be happy, as I said, to go into detail on that if my friends would like me to.

Mr. BIDEN. While the Senator from New York is in the Chamber--and I have said this privately but also sometimes it is worth saying in public--there quite literally is no one for whom I have greater respect than the Senator from New York. I think he is the single most erudite, single brightest and the single most informed person serving in the Senate. I must tell you only he has made me wonder even for a moment, after 5 months of debating this with myself, whether the resolution I have reached with expansion is correct. Only he has given me a twinge in his opposition. I mean that sincerely. He was kind enough, after meeting with some of our colleagues, to call me at my home a couple weeks ago and to sort of forewarn me--that was not the purpose of the call--but forewarn me that he may be settling on the position he has, and I made my plea over the phone with him. I kept him on the phone for about 15 minutes making my arguments why I thought we should expand. And I got off the phone, and I turned to my son, who knows of my admiration for the Senator, and I said, I have been around this place a long, long time. Here I am on the phone trying to--and I say this very respectfully--educate the most informed man I know about a position that I thought he was wrong on. I was certain of my assertions on the phone. And I hung up and I thought for a brief moment, if he thinks that way, I must be wrong. 
But I quickly overcame that, and I would just suggest that it is one of the rare occasions I have disagreed with the Senator. So it is not hard to be civil when you admire someone as much as I do the Senator. I promise I will not resort again to such personal references, but I mean it sincerely when I say to my friend that I listen to everything he has to say. I disagree with him on this. 
I would make one comment--I know he has to leave the floor--and then I will yield the floor to my friend from Rhode Island, because I have had plenty of occasion to speak already today. 
With regard to the document my friend references, it does reference expansion of NATO. But I would respectfully suggest that, like many times in human endeavors, the same conclusion would have been reached had expansion not been contemplated. I assert that the demise of the Soviet--I doubt whether my friend would disagree with me--the demise of not only the Soviet Union and the Soviet Army but the Russian military had nothing to do with the expansion of NATO.

Mr. BIDEN. And I would further argue, although I have not read the document, that if the document is complete, which it is asserted to be and I believe it to be, that the strategic judgment made to rely upon nuclear weapons was arrived at in the same way that NATO arrived at a similar judgment 30 years earlier when we concluded that we were not prepared or able to keep 40 or 50 or 60 divisions in Europe to meet a conventional attack by our Warsaw Pact enemies. 
That is a long way of saying that, were we to announce that we were ceasing and desisting from an effort to expand NATO at this moment and went on record, the strategic planners in Moscow, in my view, would be compelled to reach the conclusion that they reached in the document that was posited on the Senate floor for the Record today. 
I do not in any way underestimate the impact of damaged psyches on national policy. I do not in any way, in any sense, underestimate that feelings of isolation on the part of the Russian military, the Russians, might produce an extension of a position that otherwise would have been reached anyway. But I would conclude by saying I do not believe that the strategic document that the Senator spoke to today is as a consequence--notwithstanding that it mentions the expansion of NATO--of the talk of expanding with the inclusion of Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland into NATO. 
But my friend from Rhode Island has another urgent meeting he wishes to attend. I am happy to yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the United States in concert with its allies must act immediately to prevent a resumption of the brutal repression of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and to get real--not sham--negotiations started. 
The past two weeks have seen appalling massacres of innocent ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by heavily armed Serbian paramilitary forces. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's black-suited thugs used artillery, armored personnel carriers, heavy caliber machine guns, and even helicopter gunships to carry out their gruesome work. 
The pretext for their violence was an ambush of Serbian policy by the secretive Kosovo Liberation Army, which left four policemen dead. But we know that Milosevic had been planning military action in Kosovo for months. He was just waiting for an excuse to issue the final orders. 
Not only were supposed members of the Kosovo Liberation Army murdered, but scores of innocent civilians, including women and children, were killed. 
There is strong circumstantial evidence indicating that many victims were tortured before being put to death. Demands by Kosovo Albanians for outside forensic investigations before their kin were buried were cruelly denied by the Serbs, who dumped the corpses into mass graves. 
Next, the world witnessed the spectacle of survivors exhuming the bodies of their loved ones in order to give them dignified, Muslim burials. 
Mr. President, this behavior is worthy of the Dark Ages, not the end of the twentieth century. 
Having ordered these massacres and ghoulish follow-up, Milosevic, true to form, attempted to con world opinion. 
He sent a delegation to Pristina and offered to talk with the Kosovo Albanians `without preconditions'--except for the little detail that the Albanians would have to negotiate within the framework of the Republic of Serbia. 
In other words, the Kosovo Albanians would have to give up their only bargaining chip at the outset, namely their demand for independence. Some deal. 
Moreover, the Belgrade Bully rubbed salt in the wounds of the community whom his storm troopers had just massacred by declaring that he would negotiate with the `Albanian minority,' meaning a minority in Serbia, not the ninety percent majority they hold in Kosovo. 
No, Mr. President, this was not a serious offer of negotiations. It was vintage Milosevic `bait and switch.' Rather than beginning the necessary quiet dialogue, he cynically tried to make a public splash, while continuing to repress. 
Once again, the civilized world is faced with a deadly serious challenge. 
There is a real possibility that if Milosevic in his Greater Serbian haze tries to `ethnically cleanse' Kosovo of its ethnic Albanian population, the violence could spread into a full-scale Balkan War, cutting short the recent progress we have made in Bosnia and fracturing NATO. 
The cynical side of me tells me part of why he moved when he did was because of Bosnia. 
Mr. President, I hope this time we will act without having to have 4 years of convulsions like we had on Bosnia, even though it is a very different circumstance in terms of what is at stake. It is not different in terms of the brutality and the atrocities that have occurred. It is time to act. The bipartisan resolution I am cosponsoring is just a beginning. I believe the United States should immediately reimpose all financial sanctions against Serbia, except for democratic assistance. We should insist that Milosevic lift the repressive martial law in Kosovo and withdraw his storm troopers. The United States must actively facilitate immediate good faith negotiations between Belgrade and Kosovo without preconditions as called for by the contact group to which we belong. 
If Milosevic does not unconditionally come to the negotiating table by next week, we should freeze Yugoslavian assets abroad, attempting to exempt assets in Montenegro whose new reformist President has been cooperative in a number of ways. Milosevic and his Serbian colleagues should understand that if the atrocities resume, and if he does not protect lives, human rights, and the autonomy of the people of Kosovo, the pressure from the United States, and hopefully others, will escalate. 
I believe the President is right when he suggests that no option should be ruled out. Milosevic is a thug. He is the President of a country but he is a thug. He should be indicted as a war criminal. He should be tried at The Hague. I reiterate what I told him to his face 4 years ago in his office when he asked me what I thought of him. He is a war criminal. He looked at me as if we were having a civilized discussion and said, `And what do you think of me,' and I repeat publicly what I said to him privately. I said, `I think you are a war criminal and should be tried as such.' Unfortunately, I have never been more correct than I was then. This guy is a thug. We should make no bones about who he is. 
Mr. President, I hope that the concurrent resolution for which we have 1 hour of debate here, the concurrent resolution that is introduced by Mr. Nickles, Mr. Dodd, myself, Mr. Helms, Mr. Lieberman and others, I hope we pass it, and pass it swiftly. 
I see my friend from Connecticut. I yield the floor to my friend from Connecticut.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, while the Senator from Connecticut is on the floor, I will just say one thing. In this case, I think he underestimates what he has undertaken here and the impact of it. This is more than merely a resolution. It calls for a very specific action. The truth of the matter is that, according to my information, every single time we have responded to Milosevic's thuggery, every single time we have threatened action and/or taken action, he has backed down. I happen to think that the one thing that can alter his conduct in Kosovo--because it will reoccur again--the one thing that he pays most attention to is his own naked personal self-interest. He has been playing on this Serbian nationalism as communism has collapsed in the former Yugoslavia like a harp. But even his people are beginning to tire of what he is doing. He has been spreading lies and has been on Belgrade television talking about the awful things that are happening to Serbs--orthodox Serbs--in Kosovo, which are not true. He has been fomenting this kind of awful conduct for some time. 
I think, in addition to what we have here in the resolution, that ultimately we are going to have to face up to the fact that he is a war criminal. We should have him tried as one. I think that will change his conduct more than anything else. 
But I compliment the Senator from Connecticut for his initiative. In this case, words count. I am confident that if we are able to take this action, in the sense that the administration follows through on the essence of the resolution here, that we can impact upon the circumstances of Kosovo. We are not asking for independence. We are not dictating an outcome. We are dictating an end to the conduct. I think the answer lies in autonomy, which he revoked in 1989. But that is to be negotiated. 
But I compliment the Senator on his initiative. Words count here. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, today, we commemorate the great moment when Greece began to reassert its historic role as a leading light of democracy. In 1821, when valiant Greeks raised the flag of revolt against their Ottoman Turk oppressors, they were striking a blow for liberty that captivated freedom-loving men and women all over Europe, and in the young American Republic. Thomas Jefferson was inspired enough to become involved in the Greek struggle in the twilight of his life. In the summer of 1823 the Greek Hellenist and patriot Adamantios Koraes wrote to our third president, requesting advice on drawing up a constitution for the liberated Greece he was certain would be achieved. 
Jefferson's lengthy reply detailed his views on the fundamentals of democracy--freedom of religion, freedom of person (habeas corpus), trial by jury, the exclusive right of legislation and taxation reserved to the representatives of the people, and freedom of the press. The 80-year-old scholar-president concluded his letter with a moving tribute to Greece's unique importance to the world. 
It took nearly a decade more of struggle until Greeks once again became masters in their own house. And maintaining Greece's independence and freedom over the ensuing 163 years has proven not to be easy. 
Greece has had to cope with internal divisions and external threats. Seemingly unending arguments over the Greek constitution and form of government occupied much of the nineteenth century. Then came the two Balkan wars, World War I, the Anatolian War, World War II, the Civil War that pitted Greek against Greek, and after a peaceful, if troubled, interlude, the short-lived dictatorship of the Colonels. 
Thankfully, today we can celebrate nearly a quarter-century of restored democracy and peace in Greece. Greece is now solidly integrated economically and politically in the European Union. 
Greece's relations with most of its neighbors have improved. Despite some lingering problems, relations are relatively good with the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia and with Albania. Greece continues to maintain a solid relationship with Bulgaria. 
I will not hide the fact that--like every other country--Greece still faces formidable problems. Athens' relations with Ankara remain stormy. Turkey continues its illegal occupation of Northern Cyprus and its belligerent behavior in the Aegean. 
Moreover, the state of the Greek economy still leaves much to be desired. Let us be honest--as in the United States, there have been gross inefficiencies and wasteful policies. Greece will have to put its financial house in order if it hopes to take part fully in the ambitious integration that the European Union foresees in the coming years. I am confident that Prime Minister Simitis' reform program will bear fruit. 
Improving Greece's economy and finding ways to improve relations with Turkey are daunting tasks. But one look at hard-working, talented Greek-Americans, assures me that Greeks everywhere will continue to triumph over adversity and will remain an inspirational democratic ally.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Specter for his leadership in championing the resolution passed overwhelmingly by the Senate a short time ago. 
Our action has put the Senate on record in support of establishing an international commission and criminal tribunal for the purpose of investigating, prosecuting, and ultimately punishing Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi officials for genocide and crimes against humanity. 
Through his genocidal campaigns against the Kurds and the Shi'a, the brutal treatment of Kuwaiti civilians, and the repeated use of chemical weapons, Saddam Hussein has earned his place as one of this century's most odious tyrants. 
Perhaps the best documented case of Saddam's genocidal policies is the infamous Anfal campaign launched in February 1988 against Iraqi Kurdistan. The purpose of Anfal was to break the back of the Kurdish resistance using whatever means necessary. Large tracts of rural Kurdistan were declared off-limits and forcibly depopulated. Those who remained were branded `traitors' and `saboteurs' and were systematically liquidated during a ruthless six and a half month campaign. Human Rights Watch estimates that, in all, between 50,000 and 100,000 innocent civilians were killed during Anfal.

Mr. BIDEN. The weak international response that followed Halabja emboldened Saddam. In August 1988, he launched his final offensive against dozens of other villages, killing hundreds, and causing tens of thousands to flee to neighboring countries. A staff report prepared for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, based on interviews with survivors, described the atrocities in vivid detail: 
The bombs . . . did not produce a large explosion. Only a weak sound could be heard and then a yellowish cloud spread out from the center of the explosion. . . . Those who were very close to the bombs died almost instantly. Those who did not die instantly found it difficult to breathe and began to vomit. The gas stung the eyes, skin and lungs of the villagers exposed to it. Many suffered temporary blindness. 
After the bombs exploded, many villagers ran and submerged themselves in nearby streams to escape the spreading gas. . . . Many of those who made it to streams survived. Those who could not run from the growing smell, mostly the very old and the very young, died. The survivors who saw the dead reported that blood could be seen trickling out of the mouths of some of the bodies. A yellowish fluid could also be seen oozing out of the noses and mouths of some of the dead. Some said the bodies appeared frozen. Many of the dead bodies turned blackish blue. 
Saddam's outrageous act prompted only a muted response from the world community. One of the few sounds of protest came from this body, where Senators Pell and Helms promptly introduced legislation to impose sanctions against Iraq. 
The bill sailed through the Senate on a voice vote, a day after it was introduced. Unfortunately, the Reagan Administration, still under the delusion that it could deal with Saddam, denounced the bill as `premature,' and later succeeded in blocking its enactment in the final days of the One Hundredth Congress. 
The Kurds are not the only victims of Saddam's atrocities. The `Marsh Arabs' of Southern Iraq have seen hundreds of their villages destroyed. They have been subjected to arbitrary killings and forcibly relocated. The mainstay of their ancient culture--the marshes of Southern Iraq--have been drained so that military operations can be carried out against them and other rebels with greater ease. 
In addition to terrorizing his own citizens, Saddam Hussein has unleashed his wrath against Iraq's neighbors on numerous occasions. He used chemical weapons repeatedly during the Iran-Iraq War in clear violation of the 1925 Geneva Convention. His troops raped and murdered with impunity during the occupation of Kuwait. And he has rained scud missiles on the civilian populations of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Israel. 
It is high time that the international community stop looking the other way when presented with these blatant crimes against humanity. It is time to systematically compile the evidence of Saddam Hussein's atrocities and undertake criminal proceedings to deliver the punishment that he so richly deserves. 
Our action in passing this resolution presents a challenge to the international community to join the United States in putting the wheels of justice into motion. 
We should not underestimate the difficulty of physically delivering Saddam Hussein to a tribunal, but it would be unconscionable to abandon the quest for justice. Silence and inaction would be a grave injustice to the hundreds upon thousands of his victims.  
From the Washington Post, Mar. 11, 1998  
Why I Went, What I Saw  
We have all talked so long and so reflexively about `weapons of mass destruction' that the phrase has lost much of its immediacy and meaning. It has become, like `nuclear devastation' and `chemical and biological warfare,' an abstract term of governmental memos, punditry and political debate. For many it calls forth neither visual imagery nor visceral revulsion. 
Two Sundays ago, the TV program `60 Minutes' got a good start on changing that when it broadcast the story of the Iraqi city of Halabja 10 years after its civilian population had been the target of a chemical attack by Saddam Hussein. That population is mainly Kurdish and had sympathized with Iran during the Iran-Iraq war. The gassing of its people was in retaliation for that sympathizing. 
`60 Minutes' has given us permission to make still pictures from the film, which was originally shot, both in 1988 and 1998, by the British film maker, Gwynne Roberts. The `60 Minutes' staff also helped us to get in touch with the remarkable Dr. Christine Gosden, a British medical specialist, whose efforts to help the people of Halabja is documented. Dr. Gosden, who went out to Halabja 10 years after the bombing, agreed to write a piece for us, expanding on what she saw in Iraq. People around the world have seen the evidence of deformity and mutation following from the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It shaped their attitude toward the use of atomic weapons. Maybe if more evidence of the unimaginable, real-life effects of chemical warfare becomes available, a comparable attitude toward those weapons will develop. 
On the 16th of March 1988, an Iraqi military strike subjected Halabja, a Kurdish town of 45,000 in northern Iraq, to bombardment with the greatest attack of chemical weapons ever used against a civilian population. The chemical agents used were a `cocktail' of mustard gas (which affects skin, eyes and the membranes of the nose, throat and lungs), and the nerve agents sarin, tabun and VX. The chemicals to which the people were exposed drenched their skin and clothes, affected their respiratory tracts and eyes and contaminated their water and food. 
Many people simply fell dead where they were, immediate casualties of the attack estimates put these deaths at about 5,000. A few were given brief and immediate treatment, which involved taking them to the United States, Europe and Iran. The majority of them returned to Halabja. Since then, no medical team, either from Iraq, Europe or America or from any international agency has monitored either the short- or long-term consequences of this chemical attack. Gwynne Roberts, a film director, made the award-winning film `The Winds of Death' about the attack in 1988. I saw this film, and it had a tremendous effect on me. Gwynne revisited Halabja in 1997 and was concerned that many of the survivors seemed very ill. He could not understand why no one had tried to find out what was happening to them. He convinced me that this was something I had to do. 
Why would a female professor of medical genetics want to make a trip like this? I went to learn and to help. This was the first time that a terrible mixture of chemical weapons had been used against a large civilian population. I wanted to see the nature and scale of the problems these people faced, and was concerned that in the 10 years since the attack no one, including the major aid agencies, had visited Halabja to determine exactly what the effects of these weapons had been. 
My medical specialty was particularly apt. My principal field of research is directed toward trying to understand the major causes of human congenital malformations, infertility and cancers including breast, ovarian, prostate and colon cancers. I am carrying out studies on a group of about 15 genes called tumor suppressor genes, which include breast/ovarian cancer genes BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 colon cancer genes and the Retinoblastoma and Wilm's tumor genes associated with childhood cancers. When these genes are disrupted or mutate, they have a number of effects. Alterations lead to congenital abnormalities or pregnancy loss. Their role after birth is to try to prevent cancers from forming. Later in life, loss or mutation may lead to infertility and cancers. 
I was particularly concerned about the effects on the women and children. Most of the previous reported exposures to chemical weapons and mustard gas had involved men involved in military service; chemical weapons had never been used on this scale on a civilian population before. I was worried about possible effects on congenital malformations, fertility and cancers, not just in women and children but in the whole population. I also feared that there might be other major long-term effects, such as blindness and neurological damage, for which there is no known treatment. 
What I found was far worse than anything I had suspected, devastating problems occurring 10 years after the attack. These chemicals seriously affected people's eyes and respiratory and neurological systems. Many became blind. Skin disorders which involve severe scarring are frequent, and many progress to skin cancer. Working in conjunction with the doctors in the area, I compared the frequency of these conditions such as infertility, congenital malformations and cancers (including skin, head, neck, respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, breast and childhood cancers) in those who were in Halabja at the time with an unexposed population from a city in the same region. We found the frequencies in Halabja are at least three to four times greater, even 10 years after the attack. An increasing number of children are dying each year of leukemias and lymphomas. The cancers tend to occur in much younger people in Halabja than elsewhere, and many people have aggressive tumors, so that mortality rates are high. No chemotherapy or radiotherapy is available in this region. 
I found that there was also a total lack of access to pediatric surgery to repair the major heart defects, hare lip and cleft palate or other major malformations in the children. This meant that children in Halabja are dying of heart failure when children with the same heart defects could have had surgery and would probably have survived in Britain or the United States. It was agonizing for me to see beautiful children whose faces were disfigured by hare lip and cleft palate when I know that skilled and gifted surgeons correct these defects every day in North America and Europe. 
The neuropsychiatric consequences are seen as human tragedy on every street, in almost every house and every ward of the hospital. People weep and are in great distress because of their severe depression, and suicidal tendencies are alarmingly evident. The surgeons often have to remove bullets from people who have failed in their suicide attempts. In collecting data from the Martyrs Hospital in Halabja, the doctors said that they are not able to see patients with psychiatric and neurological conditions because there is a lack of resources and there is no effective treatment. Many people have neurological impairment or long-term neuromuscular effects. Most people cannot afford even the cheapest treatment or drugs and so are reluctant to come to the hospital. At present, even for those with life-threatening conditions, there is no effective therapy for any of these conditions in Halabja. 
On the first day of my visit to the labor and gynecological ward in the hospital, there were no women in normal labor and no one had recently delivered a normal baby. Three women had just miscarried. The staff in the labor ward told of the very large proportion of pregnancies in which there were major malformations. In addition to fetal losses and perinatal deaths, there is also a very large number of infant deaths. The frequencies of these in the Halabjan women is more than four times greater than that in the neighboring city of Soulemaneya. The findings of serious congenital malformations with genetic causes occurring in children born years after the chemical attack suggest that the effects from these chemical warfare agents are transmitted to succeeding generations. 
Miscarriage, infant deaths and infertility mean that life isn't being replenished in this community, as one would expect if these weapons had no long-term effects. The people hoped that after the attack they could rebuild the families and communities that had been destroyed. The inability to do so has led to increasing despair. Their lives and hopes have been shattered. One survivor described being in a cellar with about a hundred other people, all of whom died during the attack. Not only do those who survived have to cope with memories of their relatives suddenly dying in their arms, they have to try to come to terms with their own painful diseases and those of their surviving friends and relatives. 
For instance, many people have more than one major condition, including respiratory problems, eye conditions, neurological disorders, skin problems, cancers and children with congenital malformations and childhood handicaps such as mental handicap, cerebral palsy and Down's syndrome. The occurrences of genetic mutations and carcinogenesis in this population appear comparable with those who were one to two kilometers from the hypocenter of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs and show that the chemicals used in this attack, particularly mustard gas, have a general effect on the body similar to that of ionizing radiation. 
Ten years after the attack, people are suffering a wide spectrum of effects, all of which are attributable to long-term damage to DNA. A radio broadcast was made the day before our arrival to ask people who were ill to come to the hospital to record their problems. On the first day, 700 people came; 495 of them had two or more major problems. The cases we encountered were extremely sad. 
The people of Halabja need immediate help. There is a need for specialists (such as pediatric surgeons), equipment and drugs. Even more basic than this, though, is the need for heat, clean water and careful efforts to safeguard them against further attacks. We have to realize that there is very little medical or scientific knowledge about how to treat the victims of a chemical weapons attack like this effectively. We need to listen, think and evaluate with skill, since many of these people have had exposures to strange combinations of toxic gases. They have conditions that have not been seen or reported before. We may severely disadvantage a large group of vulnerable people and deny them effective diagnosis and treatment if we are intellectually arrogant and fail to admit that we have virtually no knowledge about how to treat the problems resulting from these terrible weapons, which have been used to more powerful and inhumane effect than ever before. 
The pictures beamed around the world after the attack in 1988 in newspapers and on TV were horrifying. One picture was of a father who died trying to shield his twin sons from the attack. The statue in the road at the entrance to Halabja is based on that picture. This is not a traditional statue of someone standing proud and erect, captured in stone or bronze to represent man triumphant and successful, but of a man prostrate and agonized dying in the act of trying to protect his children. A deep and lasting chill went through me when I entered the town and saw the statue, and it settled like a toxic psychological cloud over me. This proved hard to dispel; it intensified as I met the people, heard their stories and saw the extent of the long-term illnesses caused by the attack. The terrible images of the people of Halabja and their situation persist and recur in my nightmares and disturb my waking thoughts. Perhaps these thoughts persist so vividly as a reminder to me that the major task is now to try and get help for these people.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my good friend, the distinguished senior Senator from Indiana, to introduce important legislation that will benefit all Americans by helping-- in important ways--both our global environment and our global economy. 
I first became interested in this issue almost ten years ago, when the world's attention was focused on an international debt crisis, much of it centered in Latin American countries. At that same time, we were beginning to understand the crucial role that tropical rainforests--all over the world--play in our own lives here in the United States. 
Tropical rainforests are among the most complex and fundamental components of our planet's ecology. These natural wonders affect the global climate through their influence on rainfall patterns, which in turn makes them the sources of some of the world's greatest rivers, which in its turn affects farmlands and coastal fisheries all over the world. 
Tropical rainforests are also the richest environments for all forms of life--they harbor the greatest biodiversity of any ecosystem. With increasing frequency, we find there the chemicals that go into new medicines, more robust food crops, and other direct economic applications of the rainforests' riches. 
We may picture rainforests as among the most primitive environments--with climate and wildlife left over from the beginnings of time. But it is only now, with the accelerating integration of the global economy and the realization that burning fossil fuels can alter our planets weather, that we recognize that rainforests must be preserved if we want to protect our modern way of life. 
The accumulation of over one hundred years of man-made greenhouse gases from the industrial world is now joined by the increasing emissions of industrializing nations, accelerating the threat of global climate change. Rainforests absorb the carbon dioxide that can change our climate, and that would change every assumption we have about how what our future will be. 
But these crucially important rainforests are under increasing threat from fundamental trends in our international economy. As the nations whose borders contain important rainforests take their place in the world market, they face increasing incentives to turn their rainforests into cash crops--cutting them for lumber, clearing them for croplands--trading the long-term global benefits of rainforests for short-term needs. 
Not just the lumber and agricultural markets offer short-term local gains in exchange for long-term global costs. The explosion of international capital flows has brought the benefits and dangers of debt to many nations with rainforests. To manage debt owed to nations such as the United States, these nations turn to their rainforests for quick cash. However appropriate their borrowing may be--who among us here does not use debt to finance a house, a car, an education?--that choice has consequences for the whole planet. 
So we have the convergence of two important global trends--the cutting of rainforests, and the spread of international debt. 
Ten years ago, when these trends were at a much earlier stage, I brought the idea of debt-for-nature swaps to Senator Lugar, who agreed that we faced a classic public policy problem: short-term, local incentives to engage in behavior that has long-term, global costs. That is why we introduced the first legislation that facilitated debt-for-nature swaps. That legislation was signed into law in 1989. 
The following year, we made debt-for-nature swaps part of President Bush's Enterprise for the Americas Act. Since then, $154 million in developing country debt has been restructured into environmental protection programs in Latin America. 
The legislation I am introducing here today, with Senator Lugar, Senator Chafee, Senator Leahy, and my other distinguished colleagues, will expand the techniques of debt-for-nature exchanges to meet a wider variety of financial situations, and will include qualified countries in every part of the world. 
In essence, we arrange for the repayment of sovereign debt owed by qualfied countries to the United States, in exchange for their commitment to use the savings to establish local trust funds to protect their rainforests. We gain the environmental protection that would otherwise not occur, they reduce their foreign exchange and debt burdens. It's a classic win-win deal. 
Two of the options allow us to transform debt owed to the United States into funds to protect the world's rainforests at no cost to the Treasury. The third option, for the poorest nations of the world, provides funds to subsidize the debt exchange--and the rainforest protection--that they could not otherwise afford. 
As we watch with concern the developments in Asia, Mr. President, we see the importance of far-sighted, creative debt management programs for developing economies. The accumulation of unmanageable debt burdens threatens both the stability of the international economy and the health of our planet's ecology. 
At the margin, but in important ways, the legislation we are introducing today addresses both of those concerns, and weakens the link between the burden of developing country debt and the wasting of our rainforests. 
I am pleased to see that the House companion to this legislation is already moving in the International Relations Committee. I look forward to working with Senator Lugar and all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle here in the Senate.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I assume the reason why the Senator thinks that is because what I say is such content that he thinks I have spoken longer. 
Let me be very brief and blunt. The fact is that we have several schools of thought about China on this floor and what our future relations will be. We constantly hear that those of us who are critical of China's human rights policy and proliferation policy should not tie our opposition to their point of view to trade. They say let's keep things in their proper perspective. 
Well, if this is not the place to go, if to go to an organization that is an international organization constituted for the express purpose of discussing and identifying those nations that do not engage in practices consistent with what civilized countries should be doing relative to human rights, then there is no circumstance in which we can criticize China. 
They say we should not criticize China and tie it to trade, and they say we should not criticize China here, we should do it privately. Privately malarkey. We should do it privately; we should also do it publicly. 
We are not treating China any other way than we treat any other civilized nation in the world. As a member of the largest country in the world, they have to grow up and understand that if they take affront at us raising their human rights record in a forum, an international forum, that is constituted for that express purpose, then they have a great deal of political maturation they have to go through in order to be a world power that will gain respect from the rest of the world. 
I will conclude, Mr. President, by saying, I think this is one of those cases where our silence would be deafening. I yield the floor.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in the coming weeks, the Committee on the Budget will begin consideration of the concurrent budget resolution for Fiscal Year 1999. I would like to take a few minutes today to discuss the continuing need for our government to provide sufficient resources for international affairs. Since becoming the ranking Democrat on the Committee on Foreign Relations, I have focused special attention on this question, because I believe that adequate funding for these programs is essential to our national interest. 
With the collapse of communism and the dissolution of the Soviet empire, the United States has emerged as the world's sole remaining superpower. With that position comes a responsibility to take a leading role in international affairs. Around the globe, American leadership is essential to preserving stability and security, and advancing prosperity and economic opportunity. 
The United States cannot remain an effective world leader without devoting sufficient resources to diplomatic readiness. Just as we need to maintain and train robust military forces in order to protect our security, we need a well-trained and well-equipped diplomatic corps to advance our nation's numerous international interests. Indeed, with the reductions in our military presence overseas in the last decade, it is all the more important that we maintain a robust diplomatic presence around the globe, and that our diplomats, who work on the front line of our national defense, have the resources necessary to do their jobs. 
It is sometimes said that, in the modern information age, embassies and the diplomats who staff them are no longer relevant. The assertion is, in my view, absurd. While modern technology has eased communications and travel across the miles, there is no substitute for being physically present in a foreign country. No one can fully comprehend all the intricacies of a nation's politics and government without living in that country. Equally important, diplomacy is about building trust; trust between governments cannot be secured over the phone and fax, but comes, ultimately, from personal relationships that are built over a period of time. In short, the telephone and the facsimile machine cannot replace the on-site presence of well-trained diplomats. 
Unfortunately, in recent years we have short-changed our diplomats, and ultimately our nation's interests, by reducing funding for international affairs. Indeed, by almost every measure, the budget for international affairs has declined precipitously over the past decade. Importantly, Congress is waking up to this problem. In Fiscal 1998, Congress increased funding for the Function 150 account--which encompasses foreign affairs funding--for the first time in eight years. But measured against historical averages, funding for international affairs remains low. 
According to a recent study by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) prepared at my request, the discretionary budget authority for Function 150 in Fiscal 1998--$19.05 billion in Fiscal 1998 dollars--is 22.9 percent below the average of the past two decades ($24.69 billion). Using constant FY 1998 dollars, in only two years in the last two decades (Fiscal Years 1996 and 1997) was foreign affairs funding at lower levels than the current fiscal year. Similarly, as a percentage of total budget authority, Function 150 funding in FY 1998 is 1.129 percent, nearly one-third below the annual average (1.653 percent) for the past two decades. 
An examination of the subfunctions of the foreign affairs budget tells a similar story. Funding for international development activities is 14.7 percent below the average of the last twenty years. Security assistance in Fiscal 1998 is 46.4 percent less, in real terms, than the average of the past two decades. Foreign information and exchanges--this is, the broadcasting, public diplomacy and exchange programs carried out by the Broadcasting Board of Governors and the U.S. Information Agency--are at a level 13.3 percent below the average of the period covered by the CRS study. 
Only the `Conduct of Foreign Affairs' subfunction, which includes State Department operational costs, as well as contributions to international organizations and peacekeeping, is above the twenty-year average. But it should be emphasized that the budget for this category in Fiscal 1998 is the smallest, in real terms, since Fiscal 1990. Moreover, the relative size of this category, as compared to the 1970s and 1980s, can be explained by significant increases in the international peacekeeping account, an account which was small during the Cold War, but has increased substantially since the late-1980s. 
Ethnic conflicts and regional rivalries--long submerged during the Cold War--have led to the creation of more U.N. peacekeeping missions in the last decade than there were in the previous three decades of the United Nations. In Fiscal 1990, for example, U.S. contributions to peacekeeping was $81 million. By Fiscal 1994, largely because of the U.N. operations in Bosnia and Somalia, this account totaled $1.07 billion. The United States bears 25 percent of the cost of these missions, and paid 31 percent prior to 1994. 
I am pleased that the President has recognized the importance of assuring enhanced funding for foreign affairs by requesting $20.15 billion in Fiscal 1999, roughly one billion dollars over Fiscal 1998. I would like to briefly discuss the highlights of this request, and the notable increases within it. 
First, the budget for State Department operations contains two important initiatives. First, the Department seeks authority to construct a new embassy in Beijing, China, and to begin construction on a new embassy in Berlin, Germany. Both projects are essential. Our embassy in Beijing is in deplorable condition, and is barely sufficient given our important interests there. The decision of the German government to move its capital from Bonn to Berlin necessitates the construction of the new embassy there. Several years ago, Congress urged the State Department to fund capital projects of this sort from proceeds derived from sales of existing assets. Because of uncertainties in several foreign real estate markets, however, several anticipated sales have not been realized, thus requiring the Department to seek funding for these construction projects, which I support. 
Second, the State Department seeks an increase in its Capital Investment Fund, which provides resources for modernizing its aging information technology infrastructure. The Department is significantly behind the times technologically. In many important posts and offices, it remains reliant on obsolete and obsolescent computer and telecommunications technology. To give just one example, the Department still has an ample supply of Wang computers; several generations of computer technology have emerged since the Wangs were installed, and it is long past time for the Department to replace these antiquated systems. Information is central to the task of diplomacy; modernizing these systems is essential to enable our diplomats to perform their jobs. 
The foreign assistance budget contains three increases which are critical to American interests. First, the Administration seeks an increase in the assistance for the Newly Independent States (NIS) of the Former Soviet Union, from $770 million to $925 million. These programs are designed to assist the nations of the region, including Russia, to make the transition from communism 
to democratic capitalism. A similar U.S. effort in Eastern Europe has already resulted in the `graduation' of several nations from U.S. aid programs, demonstrating that American assistance to this region need not be permanent. 
Second, the Administration requests $216 million for the Non-Proliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining and Related Programs account, an increase over the $133 million appropriated in Fiscal 1998. This funds a number of key programs, including the effort to keep former Soviet scientists employed on useful projects--a program designed to prevent them from selling their knowledge and skills to rogue regimes. Like the Nunn-Lugar program, which is funded in the 050 account, the Science Center program is a critical element in a strategy of containment--a strategy directed not at a nation or ideology, but at controlling the threat posed by the proliferation of dangerous technologies. 
Third, the Administration seeks a significant increase in the budget for international narcotics and law enforcement at the State Department. Specifically, it requested $275 million, a $44 million increase. These resources are required to continue the ongoing struggle against the narcotics cartels in this hemisphere and elsewhere. 
I commend the President for seeking a 20 percent increase in the budget for the Peace Corps, an increase designed to put the Corps on a path to 10,000 volunteers by the year 2000, well above the current number of 6,500 volunteers. The Peace Corps represents the best of American values and ideals, and advances American interests overseas immeasurably. 
Finally, the Administration has requested a supplemental appropriations legislation for Fiscal 1998 for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and urge passage of legislation to pay off our arrears to the United Nations (UN) and other international organizations. Last year's budget agreement allows for an adjustment in the discretionary spending caps for these important priorities. I hope we will act on this legislation soon--and without linking it to unrelated issues. 
Mr. President, in closing, let me emphasize this: funding for foreign affairs is but one percent of the total federal budget. But as is reflected in the daily headlines and our own priorities here in the Senate, foreign policy comprises far more than one percent of our nation's interests. As our Secretary of State likes to say, it may account for fifty percent of the history that is written about our era. 
This is not to suggest that the foreign policy budget should constitute half of our federal budget; it is to remind us, however, that any reduction in that budget would be symbolic in its effect on the federal fisc, but would be significant in its effect on our national interests. I hope my colleagues will bear that in mind as we begin debate on the budget for the coming fiscal year.

Mr. BIDEN. I rise today to condemn the murderous attacks carried out by Serbian paramilitary units against civilians in the province of Kosovo. 
Mr. President, the immediate cause of the violence was an attack several days ago by units of the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army, which killed four Serbian police. The fundamental cause, however, is the Serbian government s brutal repression of the ethnic Albanians, who make up more than ninety percent of Kosovo s population. 
In 1989, Slobodan Milosevic, as part of his demogogic policy of whipping up Serb ultra-nationalism, abolished the autonomous status of Kosovo, granted by the Yugoslav Constitution of 1974. 
Flooding the province with Yugoslav military units, special police forces, and nationalist militias, Milosevic set up a police state that has prevented the ethnic Albanians from exercising their basic political and cultural rights. 
To their credit, Kosovo s Albanian leadership, led by Ibrahim Rugova, opted for a non-violent approach in their struggle for independence. They established alternative institutions, including a shadow parliament with various political parties, independent schools, and trade unions. 
For eight years Mr. Rugova was able to keep the lid on a potentially explosive situation. Inevitably, however, the weight of Serbian repression had its effect, particularly on younger Kosovars, as the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo are called. 
A so-called Kosovo Liberation Army was formed, and last year began an armed campaign against Serbian officials and ethnic Serb civilians. While this development is understandable, Mr. President, it is regrettable. Aside from causing casualties and deaths, the armed resistance has provided Milosevic the pretext for his brutal crack-down. 
The violence in Kosovo could provide the spark to ignite the Balkan tinderbox into full-scale regional war, which, in the worst case, could bring in neighboring Albania, Macedonia--and perhaps even Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey. 
Immediate action is necessary. Already the Administration is consulting with our NATO allies about an appropriate response. One immediate step should be to extend the mandate of the NATO-led UNPREDEP, the U.N. preventive deployment force in neighboring Macedonia which includes several hundred American troops, beyond its August 1998 termination date. 
The Clinton Administration has already revoked several concessions granted to Milosevic as a reward for support of the new Prime Minister of the Republika Srpska in Bosnia. 
The Bush Administration s Christmas 1992 warning of military action--which meant air strikes against targets across Serbia--unless violence against the Kosovar Albanians stopped, should be restated. 
We should mobilize international pressure on Milosevic to restore the pre-1989 autonomy to Kosovo and to the ethnically heterogeneous Vojvodina (voi-voh-DEEN-uh) province in northern Serbia. 
To coordinate our policy, President Clinton should name a high-profile Special Representative for dealing with the Kosovo Problem. Our current Special Representative for the former Yugoslavia, Robert Gelbard, is simply stretched too thin to devote adequate time to this explosive situation. 
Mr. President, it is difficult to exaggerate the stakes in the current Kosovo violence. A continuation of the Serbian repression and Kosovar Albanian counter-violence could easily spin out of control and endanger the entire Balkan peninsula. 
It could undue the recent progress we have made in Bosnia and endanger NATO solidarity. 
We must act at once to prevent these developments.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, over the last two days we have been debating in the Senate various amendments aimed at curbing drunk driving--a devastating byproduct of alcohol consumption. Today, I want to raise another alcohol-related issue--that of drinking on college campuses. 
In recent years, we have all heard the stories about college students who are dying because of alcohol. A drunk student falls out of a dorm window in Virginia. Students from Massachusetts to Mississippi die of alcohol poisoning--drinking so much so fast that the alcohol literally kills them. In fact, so far this academic year, there have been at least 17 college students who have died in binge drinking incidents. 
Unfortunately, this is not an isolated minority of college students. According to surveys, 44 percent of college students are binge drinkers, and nearly one in every five college students is a frequent binge drinker. This is not what parents expect when they send their kids off to college. 
It is time for the culture on college campuses to change. 
So, today, I am submitting a sense-of-the-Senate resolution calling on college and university administrators to carry out activities to reduce alcohol consumption on college campuses. This resolution--the Collegiate Initiative to Reduce Binge Drinking--was first submitted in the other body by Mr. Kennedy of Massachusetts. I want to commend him for his initiative, and thank him for allowing me to join in this effort. 
Specifically, the resolution calls on colleges and universities to appoint a task force to establish a policy on reducing alcohol and other drug-related problems; provide students with the opportunity to live in an alcohol-free environment; enforce a zero tolerance policy on the consumption of alcohol by minors; and eliminate alcoholic beverage-related sponsorship of on-campus activities. It also encourages colleges to work with local officials in the town in which they are located. 
These activities are very similar to what is happening now at my state's largest college--the University of Delaware--which, according to a study by Harvard University, has had a binge drinking rate 50 percent higher than the national average. But, Mr. President, under the direction of the University's President, David P. Roselle--along with a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation--the University is actively seeking to reduce this rate and to reduce alcohol consumption on campus. So far, it appears to be working. In just one year--from October 1996 to October 1997--there were 30 fewer alcohol-related incidents on campus. 
The lesson is that if we take the problem seriously and seriously address the problem, we can make a difference. The lives of students can be saved. I ask my colleagues to join me in encouraging college administrators to step up to the challenge--before the problem gets any worse.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I listened with great interest yesterday to the comments of the majority leader on the agreement between the United Nations and Iraq. I did so particularly since I had come to the floor in the past and publicly credited him and complimented him for his forceful assertion the night of the State of the Union indicating we would stand united, Democrats and Republicans, in our opposition to Saddam Hussein. That was badly needed at the time. It was a statesmanlike thing to do, and it was applauded by all of us. 
But I must admit I was perplexed yesterday by the majority leader's comments. He seemed, in my view, Mr. President, to rush to judgment to engage in a pessimistic fatalism that I think permeated his remarks and I think are unwarranted. 
The majority leader is correct, based on what I heard yesterday, at least in one important respect, and that is the agreement between the United Nations and Iraq should be judged by whether it furthers American interests from our perspective. This is entirely consistent with the position taken by President Clinton. He and his national security team are in the process of making that judgment, which is: Is this agreement consistent with and does it further U.S. interests? 
The administration is seeking clarifications to the ambiguities in this very general agreement. It is using our formidable diplomatic muscle, Mr. President, to settle unanswered questions in our favor, as I speak. In contrast to the gloomy assessment presented by the Senate majority leader, things appear to be breaking our way so far, as we seek the proper interpretation of that agreement. 
Secretary General Kofi Annan has provided assurances on some of the key questions that have arisen in the accord. 
First, the new special team will be an integral part of UNSCOM and not a separate entity, as some worry. 
Second, the diplomats to be appointed to the new team will act as observers only. UNSCOM will retain operational control of the entire inspection process. 
Third, the head of the new special team within UNSCOM for inspecting Presidential sites will be an arms control expert with a solid track record in arms control. Mr. Jayantha Dhanapala, the current Undersecretary General for disarmament, who has recently completed a tour as Sri Lanka's ambassador to the United States, will be that person. He has played a key role in making the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty permanent. He and Ambassador Richard Butler have known each other for nearly 20 years, and they appear to be able to work together and respect one another. 
Fourth, UNSCOM and the Secretary General, not Iraq, will develop the procedures for inspecting the Presidential sites. 
Fifth, UNSCOM and Chairman Butler will retain their independence. 
Sixth, the reporting lines remain intact. The new team leader will report to Ambassador Butler, who, in turn, reports to the Security Council through the Secretary General, as UNSCOM's chairman has done since 1991. 
Finally, the new representative of the Secretary General in Baghdad will not have a direct role in the UNSCOM inspections process. 
If these assurances pan out, then this agreement will go a long way toward furthering the United States national interests. 
I have personally known the Secretary General, Kofi Annan, for many years, and I regard him as a man of his word. So I have no reason to doubt these assurances that have been made now on the record. 
For the sake of argument, let us assume that the Secretary General is attempting to deceive us, which I know he is not. In that case, I don't see that we have given up any of our options, 
even if that were his intention. 
We are not bound by this agreement. If it provides unworkable mechanisms to let UNSCOM do its job, or if it undermines the integrity of UNSCOM, we can and should walk away from it. 
The critics would have us believe that we are the `helpless superpower,' that we are bound by the terms of an agreement negotiated by an omnipotent United Nations. This simply does not conform with reality or square with the facts. 
We have a formidable armada assembled in the Persian Gulf poised to strike at a moment's notice. That armada can be called into service if the agreement falls short or if Saddam Hussein reneges on his commitments. The agreement does not in any way suspend our right to act unilaterally or multilaterally for that matter. 
Indeed, should the agreement be violated, the use of force would meet with, in my view, much less international opposition than it would have in the absence of an agreement. 
An allegation that I find particularly puzzling is that we have `subcontracted our foreign policy' to the United Nations. Granted, it makes for a crisp sound bite that everybody will pick up, but like most sound bites, it lacks substance. 
Those who make this politically motivated charge seem to ignore that the Secretary General is acting according to specific guidelines issued by the Security Council. They seem to forget that the United States is in the Security Council and our Secretary of State, in particular, played a central role in preparing these guidelines. 
Would the critics have preferred the Russians and the French coming up with an agreement without our input, or the Secretary General acting on the basis of his own instincts? Or would they rather have him act on the basis of the red lines that we drew in the agreement as a member of the Security Council? Or to avoid subcontracting our foreign policy, would the critics have preferred our diplomats traveling to Baghdad? 
The charge also misses the fact that we have maintained support for our policy by acting within the bounds of the U.N. resolutions, which we crafted. We have not subcontracted; we have set the terms for Iraqi compliance. 
Throughout this crisis, the same critics have leveled exaggerated charges that we have precious little international support for our policy; yet, in the same breath they call for a course of action, such as toppling the regime, that would guarantee absolutely no international support and without the willingness to supply our military with the force necessary to do that. It seems to me that this is a glaring contradiction in arguments made by the critics of President Clinton's approach. You can't have it both ways. 
I believe that the Presidents resolve in backing diplomacy with force has been vindicated. It has not been easy. He was subjected to criticism from those who wanted to go farther and those who wished he hadn't gone as far as he did. These critics make some valid arguments, but they fail to put any realistic alternatives forward. They also fail to recognize that their suggested course would entail far greater costs than the President's approach. 
In their rush to criticize the Clinton administration, the critics have gotten lost in the proverbial weeds. They have conjured up worst-case scenarios and portrayed American options as being much more limited than they actually are. 
As the facts come in, the false picture they have painted is gradually being chipped way. The agreement moves us to a far more advantageous position than we were in before the crisis began. If Iraq implements the agreement, we will have access to all suspect weapons sites in Iraq for the first time. If Iraq refuses to comply this time around, then we will be in a much stronger position to justify our use of force, which I am convinced we will exercise. 
The bottom line, Mr. President, is that we have given up none of our options, while the agreement has very likely narrowed the options for Saddam Hussein. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, with the end of the Cold War, the terrible threat of nuclear holocaust has been substantially reduced. But the world is far from trouble-free. The threat of the 90's, perhaps to become the threat of the coming decade, is that posed by weapons of mass destruction in the hands of lesser powers--like Iraq or Iran--or even terrorist groups. 
My esteemed colleague, the senior Senator from Indiana, has written a sobering article in today's issue of The Hill. His conclusion is one to which we should all pay attention: 
Absent congressional support of a U.S. response to this threat as focused, serious and vigorous as America's Cold War strategy, Americans may have every reason to anticipate domestic or international acts of nuclear, chemical and biological terrorism against American targets before another decade is out. 
The Nunn-Lugar and related programs that help countries in the former Soviet Union to guard against diversion of material or technology relating to weapons of mass destruction are an important defense against such terrorism. Last year, I was pleased to co-sponsor Senator Lugar's amendment that restored full funding to these programs. This year, we would all be well advised to seek opportunities to expand these programs, as recommended in a study last year by the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, no one should doubt for a moment the resolve of the United States to respond with force, if necessary, to Iraq's continued flagrant violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions. 
Vigorous diplomacy has been pursued over the past three months, but, thus far, Saddam Hussein has shown that he has no interest in a peaceful solution on anything other than his own terms. We cannot allow this tyrant to prevail over the will of the international community. Our national security would be seriously compromised by a failure to stand up to the challenge he has confronted us with. 
Our strategic objective is to contain Saddam Hussein and curtail his ability to produce the most deadly weapons known to mankind--weapons that he has unleashed with chilling alacrity against his own people. Left unchecked, Saddam Hussein would in short order be in a position to threaten and blackmail our regional allies, our troops, and, indeed, our nation. 
Let me take just a moment to recount how we have come to the point where military force may be employed in the near future. 
For nearly seven years, Iraq has engaged in a cat and mouse game with the international inspectors that comprise the United Nations Special Commission. It has obstructed UNSCOM from fulfilling its mandate to monitor, investigate, and destroy Iraq's capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction. 
In spite of Iraq's tenacious efforts at concealment and obstruction, UNSCOM has uncovered and destroyed more weapons of mass destruction than were destroyed during the entire gulf war. UNSCOM has revealed Iraqi lie after Iraqi lie. 
Last October, Iraq threatened to expel all American members of the special commission. Ambassador Richard Butler, the chairman of UNSCOM, responded appropriately by withdrawing all inspectors rather than having his staff of professionals segregated on the basis of their nationality. 
The ensuing stand-off led to diplomatic intervention by Russia. Eventually, Iraq relented by allowing UNSCOM back into the country. 
But the central issue of unconditional and unfettered access by UNSCOM was left unresolved. Ambassador Butler visited Baghdad in December to try to resolve this issue, but to no avail. 
Then, last month, Iraq refused to cooperate with a team of inspectors investigating Iraq's efforts at concealment. It made preposterous charges that the American head of the team, Scott Ritter, was a spy. 
During a subsequent visit by Ambassador Butler, Iraq struck a defiant note. It vowed never to open so-called `presidential and sovereign sites' to inspection. In a recent speech, Saddam Hussein stated his decision to expel UNSCOM by May 20 if sanctions remain in place. 
The United Nations Security Council has repeatedly condemned Iraq's non-compliance. Since October of last year, on seven separate occasions, the Security Council has demanded that Iraq fulfill its obligations. 
But Saddam Hussein has made clear that it is more important to him to retain the capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction than it is to comply with the resolutions that would allow sanctions to be lifted. Once again he has proven what little regard he has for the suffering of his people. 
The international community has exhibited enormous patience with Iraq. But that patience has reached its limit. 
Time has run out. If Iraq does not comply immediately and unconditionally with United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding unfettered access for U.N. weapons inspectors, I believe that President Clinton will have no choice but to order the use of air power. 
Unfortunately, we have learned over the past several years that the Iraqi Government, and more specifically its leader, only seem to understand the blunt language of force. 
In recent weeks, several questions and criticisms have been raised with respect to President Clinton's policy. I would like to take a moment to respond to some of these comments. 
Questions have been asked about our objectives. The objectives have been defined precisely. They are to curtail and delay Saddam Hussein's capacity to produce and deliver weapons of mass destruction and his ability to threaten his neighbors. We have been told by the Joint Chiefs of Staff that a military plan has been developed that would fulfill these objectives. 
In a sense, the international coalition now assembling forces in the Persian Gulf will accomplish through the use of force what UNSCOM would be doing were it allowed to do its job. Secretary Cohen has told us that there is no substitute for having UNSCOM on the ground, but we are left with little choice if UNSCOM is prevented from carrying out its duties. 
When the objectives have been explained, the next question that arises is what are the next steps. But this question is based upon the flawed premise that the use of force reflects a new policy. In fact, the use of force for the purposes outlined by the President is an integral part of the long-standing policy of containing Iraq. 
Containment is a very unsatisfying policy at an emotional level. It lacks finality and it requires patience and staying power. But it meets our strategic objective of preventing Iraq from threatening our national security interests. 
Containment is the best of three bad options available to us. The other two options would be to do nothing, or to send in several hundred thousand ground troops to occupy Iraq. Neither of these policies is viable. 
Doing nothing would encourage Iraqi defiance and lead to a complete collapse of the constraints that have been placed upon Iraqi behavior since the end of the gulf war. It would be the surest way to rehabilitate Saddam Hussein. 
Just as unpalatable is the prospect of sending in several hundred thousand ground troops to change the Iraqi regime. I believe that there is little support for such an operation in the Congress or the public. It would also raise a series of questions: 
Would we be prepared to occupy and rebuild Iraq over a period of several years? 
Would we be prepared for the real possibility that a march on Baghdad might lead Saddam Hussein to unleash his weapons of mass destruction? 
Would any other nation support us for an action that is clearly outside the bounds of security council resolutions? To this point those resolutions have provided the basis for all U.S. military action against Iraq since the gulf war. 
In the end, the only policy that stands up to scrutiny is that of containment, which the Clinton administration has followed and the Bush administration before it followed. 
Finally, another question that has arisen is whether the President should obtain specific authorization to use force. I believe that the President would be wise to obtain such authorization.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, one of the most important foreign policy issues with which the Congress must deal in the coming months is continued American involvement in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
Last December, President Clinton announced his decision that the United States should maintain ground troops in an international force that will replace SFOR, whose mandate expires in June. Soon, he will ask the Congress for the funding to support this operation. 
I support the President's decision as being squarely in the national self-interest of the United States. As I have said on many other occasions, the stability of southeastern Europe depends on the ability of the Bosnians, working with the international community, to create a self-sustaining, peaceful, democratic system in their country. 
Failure to achieve this goal would inevitably restart the violence that produced the worst bloodletting in Europe since World War II, and would almost certainly ignite the ethnic tinderbox that is smoldering in neighboring countries. Other potential Radovan Karadzics cannot be encouraged to believe that they can get away with similar crimes. The devil's work of the mass murderers, ethnic cleansers, and rapists in Bosnia must not be allowed to stand in that country or, worse still, to be repeated there and elsewhere. 
Moreover, as President Clinton said in his State of the Union address, staying the course in Bosnia is a test of American leadership in Europe in general, and in NATO in particular. It was American military involvement in the fall of 1995 and our diplomatic leadership in crafting the Dayton Accords that ended the carnage in Bosnia. 
Make no mistake about it: we are the indispensable country in the European security equation, as Bosnia demonstrates. Although our alliance partners are shouldering the lion's share of the economic and military burden in Bosnia, without our participation on the ground and in the air, SFOR and any post-SFOR force would be impossible. 
The task in Bosnia is complex and will take several more years to complete. President Clinton himself admitted his error in thinking that nearly four years of horrific violence could be remedied in one year, or even two-and-a-half years. 
But our commitment to assisting the Bosnians, of course, is not open-ended. Rather than tieing our exit to an artificial date, we should--and will--link it to the completion of clearly defined criteria, such as the establishment of a functioning national government and other national institutions, seated elected local governments, free media, and a free-market economy. I have every confidence that the Administration will spell out these benchmark criteria in detail in its request for U.S. participation in the international force after this June. 
I had the opportunity to accompany the President to Bosnia before Christmas--my fourth journey in recent years to that troubled land. The trip confirmed the impressions that I gained in a longer trip last summer: we have made significant progress in implementing the military and civilian provisions of the Dayton Accords. 
I scarcely need to add the caveat that much still remains to be done to put Bosnia back on firm footing. Today I have several concrete policy proposals to further that end. 
To put them into context, I would like to review in some detail the significant progress that has been made in the last nine months in implementing both the military and civilian provisions of the Dayton Accords. 
Mr. President, I believe that even the most skeptical observer has to admit that the situation in Bosnia has improved greatly since Dayton, and with an increased tempo in the last nine months. 
Thanks to our magnificent troops in IFOR and SFOR and those of allied and partner countries, a stable military environment has been created and the warring parties separated. No fewer than three hundred thousand troops from all sides have returned to civilian life. 
Nearly seven thousand heavy weapons have been destroyed, and an additional two thousand six hundred put into supervised cantonments. 
A joint Muslim-Croat Federation Defense Force has been created, although below the top command much more integration remains to be accomplished. The American Train and Equip Program to create a defensive Federation capability is in full swing. I visited its headquarters last summer, and was impressed with its trainers and its Muslim and Croat students. 
Progress has also been made in creating non-political local police forces, both in the Federation and in the Republika Srpska. Integrated police forces are operating in eight major locations around the country, including the pivotal northern town of Brcko, whose future will be determined in March by an international arbitrator. 
The International Police Task Force or IPTF has had its share of problems, perhaps unavoidable given the fact that no fewer than forty countries are contributing officers to it. Recent reforms, however, in which Americans have played a prominent role, have strengthened its professionalism. A new Federation Police Academy has been opened near Sarajevo to train new recruits from all religious groups. 
Last fall, I called for our European allies to contribute forces from their paramilitary formations to create a gendarmerie in Bosnia as a vital middle layer--under SFOR control--between the local police and SFOR. Although there was an initial, predictable negative public reaction from Europe, I am told that several of our partners are now actively considering the idea. These European gendarmes could provide the security for newly elected municipal governments, guarantee safety for minority refugee returns, and take over the lead-role in capturing indicted 
war criminals. 
In fact, slowly but surely the indicted war criminals are already being rounded up. Nearly one-third of the seventy-nine individuals under open indictment have been taken into custody in the War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague. 
Last month, for the first time American SFOR troops carried out a capture operation, seizing a notorious Bosnian Serb who as the sadistic commander of a prison camp called himself the `Serb Adolf' and reveled in his grisly murder of Muslims. He is one of only a handful of individuals in Bosnia indicted for genocide.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to make it absolutely clear: I oppose the cloning of human beings. But, I am voting against cloture on the motion to proceed to the cloning bill because the bill and the issues the bill raises are not that simple. 
I am voting against cloture because there has not been sufficient discussion; there have not been sufficient hearings; there has not been sufficient consideration of what is a very complicated scientific issue. Legislation is supposed to be the end result of a process; not the beginning of it. This bill, Mr. President, is far too premature. 
Yes, hearings were held last year after it was announced that Dolly the sheep was a clone. But, those were generic hearings on the issue of cloning. And, the bill before us is not--I repeat, not--a result of those hearings. This was a bill that was introduced a week ago, has never been the subject of a hearing, and has never been considered by a committee. 
Are the definitions adequate? Or, are they over broad? In the name of preventing the cloning of a human being, are we hindering medical research that might help in the battle against cancer and other diseases? Or, in the name of allowing scientific research, are we opening the door to rogue scientists who will then find it easier to clone a human? 
These are all very legitimate questions that need answers. In the end, there may be significant differences over what the answers should be. But, the problem here today, Mr. President, is that we are not ready to be debating answers to these policy questions because we have not had a thorough discussion of the questions and the implications. 
With the pace of scientific advancement--scientific knowledge is now doubling about every five years--more and more of these extremely complicated bioethical issues are likely to come before the Congress in years to come. Let's not set a precedent here today that we will deal with them willy-nilly--by simply taking a position and voting without having given thoughtful consideration to the issues involved. 
We need to act to ban the cloning of humans. But, before we act, we need more hearings and more discussion on how best to accomplish that. Therefore, I am voting against cloture on the motion to proceed.

Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I am pleased to report a very historic event that occurred today at the State Department at about 12 noon. The President of the United States, the Secretary of State, the Vice President, and the Foreign Ministers of the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary, were in attendance. At this event, the President signed an amendment to the Washington treaty--the NATO treaty--that has been or will shortly be delivered to the Senate asking that the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland become full members of NATO. This ceremony at the State Department completed the formal transmission from the President to this body for its advice and consent of the protocols of accession of those three countries into NATO. 
It was pointed out to me by the Vice President, as we were leaving the State Department ceremony, that it was this very day upon which the Yalta Conference ended some 50 years ago. It seems to me incredible that it is happening, but also that it has taken this long for to us rectify a serious historical error. At the ceremony, there were a number of things stated about why this was so important. 
We are moving very quickly this session to a momentous vote addressing America's security interests in Europe, which will not only affect us, but the next several generations of Americans. I refer to the addition of new allies to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Recognizing that the protocols would be referred to the Foreign Relations Committee for its review, 
The committee, under Chairman Helms' leadership, has been holding a series of comprehensive hearings since October on the pros and cons of enlarging NATO. 
Beginning with Secretary of State Albright, we heard testimony from senior Clinton administration and former executive branch officers, retired ambassadors and generals, and distinguished academics and foreign policy experts--most in favor of, but some in opposition to expansion. 
The Committee also invited public testimony from all citizens concerned with this issue, welcoming veterans groups, scholars, and representatives of the American Baltic, Central and East European, and Jewish communities. Opinion among all witnesses ran four to one in favor of embracing the Poles, Hungarians, and Czechs as NATO allies. 
With the Protocols now in hand, the Committee will hold one more hearing with Secretary of State Albright, Secretary of Defense Cohen, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Shelton on February 24. 
The following week, the Committee is expected to markup and vote on the Resolution of Ratification. I anticipate that the Committee will overwhelmingly recommend consideration of the Resolution by the full Senate. The Majority Leader has indicated that consideration should begin in March, after action on campaign finance reform. 
Mr. President, rather than giving a detailed statement now on the many benefits to America of NATO enlargement, I wish only to enunciate a few central themes upon which I will expand as Senate consideration of these vital protocols approaches. 
The first thesis is that, as NATO's leader, America must ensure the Alliance moves beyond its Cold War mission. The status quo is tantamount to declaring NATO a non-performing asset. 
Internally, NATO is already adapting to address different threats to peace, now that a massive military strike from the East is highly unlikely. The Alliance is placing smaller, smarter, more mobile forces under a streamlined command system with a new strategic concept. This will allow rapid action, including beyond the borders of NATO, such as our current mission in Bosnia. 
Enlargement is part of NATO's external transformation. This transformation is designed to widen the zone of stability, deter new threats of ethnic conflict, eliminate new divisions or `zones of influence,' and promote common action against weapons proliferation and transfer, terrorism, and organized crime. NATO's open door to expansion helps provide the confidence and inspiration for continued democratization and economic development 
in the former Soviet States and in Eastern and Central Europe. 
Admission of new allies is the most solemn in the spectrum of new security relationships NATO has undertaken throughout Europe and the former Soviet Union, since the admission of Spain, and prior to that, Germany, Greece and Turkey. In addition, NATO has developed unique partnerships with Russia and Ukraine, and has drawn former adversaries into a web of cooperation through what we refer to as the Partnership for Peace and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. 
The second thesis that I will be expounding on at a later time is that the costs of enlargement are real but manageable, and represent a bargain for the American people in terms of our security. 
NATO's own study of the Polish, Hungarian, and Czech contributions to our common defense rates them well worth the ten-year, one-and-a half billion dollar price tag. The U.S. share in this price will be roughly four hundred million dollars over ten years, or about forty million dollars per year. 
Most importantly, Secretary of State Albright noted in her testimony, that our Allies stated at the last NATO summit that the resources for enlargement will be found and that she will ensure 
that our allies pay their fair share--a very important requirement to be met in order to gain the support of our colleagues in the Senate. 
In the long-run, America has always found that common defense is cheaper defense. This is true certainly in financial, but even more so in the far more precious human resources the sixty million people and two hundred thousand troops Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic bring to our common security. This is not a question of whether the U.S. will trade Warsaw for Washington, or Budapest for Buffalo, but rather that the Poles, Czechs, and Hungarians are willing to assume the front line in America's forward defense of its shores. 
The third thesis is that our relations with Russia remain solid, productive, and cooperative, notwithstanding enlargement. Prophets of backlash have been disproven. 
Although few Russians are fond of NATO enlargement, policymakers in Moscow have accepted it. Moreover, no Russian with whom I met in Moscow--from Communist leader Zyuganov, to liberal leader Yavlinsky, to the nationalist retired General Lebed--believed that NATO enlargement constitutes a security threat to Russia. 
We have seem Russia ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, renew efforts to ratify START II, send troops under overall U.S. command to implement peace in Bosnia, and work smoothly with NATO as an organization in the new Russia-NATO Permanent Joint Council. 
But ultimately, Russia must understand that it has no veto over NATO actions, nor over the right of former Soviet satellites to freely choose their defense arrangements. I believe their actions demonstrate that they have come to terms--however grudgingly--with this fact. 
My fourth thesis is a caution. The consequences of a failure to embrace the Poles, Hungarians, and Czechs as new allies would be a disaster. 
This century has taught us that when Central Europeans are divorced from Western institutions of common defense, they are vulnerable to pressure and control by the great powers around them, and susceptible to insidious suspicions of their neighbors' intentions. This forces them to nationalize their defense policies, creating tension and instability 
Here, I would like to quote from Dr. Henry Kissinger's testimony to the Foreign Relations Committee on this very point. Dr. Kissinger's testimony to the Foreign Relations Committee on this very point was very, very enlightening, I thought.  
Kissinger warned: Basing European and Atlantic security on a no man's land between Germany and Russia runs counter to all historical experience, especially that of the interwar period. It would bring about two categories of frontiers in Europe, those that are potentially threatened but not guaranteed, and those that are guaranteed but not threatened. If America were to act to the defend the Oder [between Germany and Poland] but not the Vistula [in Poland], 200 miles to the east, the credibility of all the existing NATO guarantees would be gravely weakened. 
Madam President, I will close with a fifth and final thesis, and it is a moral one. 
For 40 years, the United States loudly proclaimed its solidarity with the captive nations of Central and Eastern Europe who were under the heel of communist oppressors. Now that most of them have cast off their shackles, it is our responsibility, in my view, to live up to our pledges to readmit them into the West through NATO and the European Union as they qualify. 
Just as NATO enlargements embraced Turkey, Greece, and West Germany several years before the European Union's precursors were yet in existence, so we should not hesitate to accept Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic now, even before their accession to the European Union. 
The habits of cooperation created by NATO membership can only help these nations as they prepare for economic integration into Europe and the West. 
I thank the Chair for listening and I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I come to floor today to discuss the new juvenile justice grant program contained in the appropriations bill for the Commerce, Justice, and State Departments. Of course, I would have preferred the appropriators to defer to the Judiciary Committee, which considered juvenile crime legislation for over a month and reported a bill to the Senate floor, so we could have a full debate and develop effective, comprehensive juvenile crime legislation. 
That said, I am pleased that the conference report addresses one of my primary concerns by relaxing the mandates contained in earlier proposals that would have required States to try more juveniles as adults to qualify for federal funding. 
Recall that the juvenile crime bill passed by the House of Representatives last spring would have disqualified States from receiving federal funds unless prosecutors had complete discretion to try certain 15-year-olds as adults. Similarly, as originally introduced, the Senate Republican's youth crime bill --S. 10--would have required States to give prosecutors unfettered discretion to try 14-year-olds as adults, even for minor crimes, to qualify for funding. S. 10 as passed by the Committee loosened this restriction substantially, by enabling States to qualify for funding so long as 14-year-olds were eligible to be tried as adults for serious violent crimes, which they already are in almost every State. 
Similarly, the new program contained in the appropriations bill passed by Congress today does not require States to change their laws on trying juveniles as adults. All a State must do to participate in the new program is to certify that it is `actively considering' such changes in policy. So, a State can say, `we're going to think about it,' introduce legislation but not enact it, or even reject legislative changes and still qualify for the new federal youth crime fighting funds. 
I support this relaxation from the earlier proposals because trying more juveniles as adults is likely to be counterproductive. The research shows that juveniles tried in the adult system are more likely to be released on bail, less likely to be convicted, punished more slowly, and incarcerated less frequently than in the juvenile justice system. If we want to get tough on juvenile crime, trying kids as adults is the wrong answer. 
What is more, placing juveniles in adult jails--where they have exposure to hardened criminals--will only make them more likely to commit crimes once they get out. So despite popular opinion, trying more kids as adults may make our crime problem worse, not better. 
Instead of imposing unproven, Washington-based solutions on the States, the best thing the federal government can do is provide local law enforcement, prosecutors, juvenile courts, and community based organizations additional funds to develop creative, comprehensive strategies to address juvenile crime. Such strategies are beginning to bear fruit across the country as juvenile crime has fallen significantly in the past two years. 
The new juvenile crime block grant takes a partial step in the right direction by providing $250 million for juvenile justice system improvements. But this new program is deeply flawed by failing to permit State and localities to use any of these funds for juvenile crime prevention programs. Police chiefs and prosecutors around the country are emphatic that to be effective in combating juvenile crime, we have to combine tough enforcement with effective prevention programs. The new block grant sends the wrong message to our States and localities by requiring that all the funds be spent on enforcement and juvenile justice system improvements. 
I am also concerned that the new program will not result in sufficient funding for juvenile prosecutors. Past experience has shown that block grants that flow through local governments do not result in very much funding for prosecutors offices. In the Senate youth crime bill, we have established a grant program--albeit an underfunded one--that would provide federal funding directly to prosecutors specifically for juvenile crime fighting efforts. I will work to fix these and other flaws in the new program when we consider youth violence legislation next year.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, last year the Senate passed the Federal Law Enforcement Dependents Assistance Act. A law which provides for the education of the spouse and dependent children of Federal law enforcement officers who die or are totally disabled in the line of duty. 
The purpose of the legislation was to remove a significant financial burden from the families of these deceased officers and to allow them to continue on the educational path they would have followed had their parent or spouse not been killed in the line of duty. 
This fall, several young men and women were able to go to college under this program. Unfortunately, this program is only available to the children of Federal law enforcement officers. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Public Safety Officers Educational Assistance Act of 1998. This legislation will extend these same educational benefits to the dependents of all public safety officers--Federal, State, county, and local law enforcement officers, correctional officers, and fire and rescue personnel--who have given their lives in the line of duty. 
Under my bill, the Attorney General will administer a program which will provide up to $4,485 per child, per year to attend a 4-year college. This is the same amount of educational assistance the Federal Government provides to veterans. 
It is critical that we remember the families of those officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our streets and homes safe. This bill is intended to allow the dependents of public safety officers to continue with their education as they would have been able to do had their parent not been killed or totally disabled in the line of duty. 
I have long been concerned about the plight of families of public safety officers killed in the line of duty--this summer, I introduced an amendment to the Budget Reconciliation Act which provides for the favorable tax treatment of survivor death benefits paid to the families of fallen officers. In that vein, this legislation offers assurance to those in the public safety profession--and even to those considering service as public safety officers--that their loved ones will be able to attain their educational goals in their absence.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support this legislation. Included within this appropriations bill is historic legislation, produced on a bipartisan basis in the Foreign Relations Committee, regarding the institutional structure of, and funding for, American foreign policy. This important legislation to reorganize the foreign policy agencies of the U.S. Government and authorize the payment of U.S. arrearages to the United Nations is similar to a bill approved by the Senate last June by a vote of 90-5. Unfortunately, the bill which the Senate overwhelmingly approved has been bogged down in conference with the other body over an issue which has no relevance to this bill. 
I am therefore grateful to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd, for agreeing to include provisions of our legislation in this bill. 
I can assure my colleagues that the decision to include the authorization bill in an appropriations bill was not taken lightly. The Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, and I sought to do so after careful consultation with the Senate leadership. But because two major elements of this bill are so critical to American foreign policy, the Chairman and I believed that we could not afford to delay this bill until next year. I hope my colleagues will agree. 
Specifically, the bill addresses two important issues which were the focus of much heated debate in the last Congress. First, the bill provides for the payment of U.S. back dues to the United Nations, contingent on specific reforms by that body. Second, the bill establishes a framework for the reorganization of the U.S. foreign policy agencies which is consistent with the plan announced by the President last April. 
Importantly, the bill also contains sufficient funds to restore our diplomatic readiness, which has been severely hampered in recent years by deep reductions in the foreign affairs budget. The funding levels in the bill largely mirror the Fiscal 1998 budget request submitted by the Clinton administration. The wide support in this Congress for providing increased funding for foreign affairs is an important achievement, and reverses a troubling trend of the past few years. 
Although the cold war has ended, the need for American leadership in world affairs has not. Our diplomats often represent the front line of our national defense; with the downsizing of the U.S. military presence overseas, the maintenance of a robust and effective diplomatic capability has become all the more important. Despite the reduction in our military presence abroad, the increased importance of `diplomatic readiness' to our Nation's security has not been reflected in the Federal budget. 
The increase in foreign affairs funding contained in this bill could not have come too soon. According to a report prepared at my request by the Congressional Research Service earlier this year, foreign policy spending is now at its lowest level in 20 years. Stated in fiscal 1998 dollars, the budget in fiscal 1997 was $18.77 billion, which is 25 percent below the annual average of $25 billion over the past two decades, and 30 percent below the level of 10 years ago, near the end of the Reagan administration. In fiscal 1997, such funding was just 1.1 percent of the Federal budget--the lowest level in the past 20 years and about one-third below the historical average. 
I should remind my colleagues that the bill is truly a bipartisan product. It began with negotiations involving the Foreign Relations Committee and the Clinton administration early in the year. The Senate subsequently passed that bill overwhelmingly in June, by a vote of 90-5. Since that time, several changes have been made as a result of the conference deliberations with our House counterparts and negotiations with the Clinton administration. These were also undertaken in a spirit of bipartisanship. Because of these changes, I am confident that the bill will be acceptable to the President. 
Enactment of this bill will mark another important milestone in reestablishing a bipartisan consensus on foreign policy. Like our predecessors five decades ago, we stand at an important moment in history. 
After the Second World War, a bipartisan and farsighted group of senators, led by Chairmen of the Foreign Relations Committee such as Thomas Connally and Arthur Vandenberg, worked with the Truman administration to construct a post-war order. The institutions created at that time--the United Nations, the World Bank, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization--are still with us today, but the task of modernizing these institutions to make them relevant to our times is just beginning. 
For example, the Clinton administration and the Senate are cooperating on the first significant expansion of NATO--an expansion to the east which will encompass three former adversaries in Central Europe. The Foreign Relations Committee, under the leadership of Chairman Helms, has initiated a series of hearings on the proposed enlargement of NATO, setting the stage for what I hope will be successful amendment to the Washington Treaty next spring. Similarly, this legislation now before us calls for significant reforms of the United Nations, an important instrument in American foreign policy which has become crippled both by growing U.S. arrearages and an unwillingness within that body to reform. Enactment of this legislation will be an important step forward in resolving both those problems. 
Just as we are trying to revise and reenergize international institutions, we must reorganize our own foreign policy institutions. Two years ago, the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee put forward a far-reaching plan to consolidate our major foreign affairs agencies--the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), the United States Information Agency (USIA), and the Agency for International Development--within the Department of State. In the context of an election cycle, it was perhaps inevitable that the Congress and the President would not come to agreement on it. 
But continued stalemate was not inevitable. With the onset of a new presidential term and the appointment of a new Secretary of State, a window of opportunity to revisit the issue was opened. The Chairman, to his credit, took advantage of this window by urging the new Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, to take a second look at the reorganization issue. And, to her credit, the Secretary did so; the result was the reorganization plan announced by the President in April. Under the proposal, two agencies--ACDA and USIA--will be merged into the State Department. The Agency for International Development will remain an independent agency, but it will be placed under the direct authority of the Secretary of State. 
The legislation now before the Senate closely reflects the President's proposal. The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency will be merged into the State Department no later than October 1, 1998, and the U.S. Information Agency will be merged no later than October 1, 1999. As with the President's plan, the Agency for International Development will remain a separate agency, but it will be placed under the direct authority of the Secretary of State. And, consistent with the President's proposal to seek improved coordination between the regional bureaus in State and AID, the Secretary of State will have the authority to provide overall coordination of assistance policy. 
The bill puts flesh on the bones of the President's plan with regard to international broadcasting. The President's plan was virtually silent on this question, stating only that the `distinctiveness and editorial integrity of the Voice of America and the broadcasting agencies would be preserved.' This bill upholds and protects that principle by maintaining the existing government structure established by Congress in 1994 in consolidating all U.S. government-sponsored broadcasting--the Voice of America, Radio and TV Marti, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and Worldnet TV--under the supervision of one oversight board known as the Broadcasting Board of Governors. Importantly, however, the Board and the broadcasters below them will not be merged into the State Department, where their journalistic integrity would be greatly at risk. 
With regard to the United Nations provision, the bill provides $926 million in arrearage payments to the Union Nations over a period of 3 years contingent upon the U.N. achieving specific reforms. This will allow us to pay all U.S. arrears to the U.N. regular budget, all arrears to the peacekeeping budget, nearly all arrears to the U.N. specialized agencies, and all arrears to other international organizations. 
It is difficult to exaggerate the significance of this achievement. We are finally in a position to lay to rest the perennial dispute over our unpaid dues that has severely complicated relations between the United Nations and the United States. This bill would give our diplomats the leverage they need to push through meaningful reforms that promise to make the U.N. a more capable institution. 
Two important changes were made to the legislation that cleared the Senate last June. First, the bill now allows the crediting of $107 million owed to the U.S. by the U.N. against our arrears. Second, it gives the administration added flexibility by allowing the Secretary of State to waive two conditions. The waiver will not apply to the reduction of assessment rates or the establishment of inspectors-general in the specialized agencies. But report language will make a clear commitment that Congress would, if necessary, consider on an expedited basis a waiver on the condition for a 20 percent assessment rate for the U.N. regular budget. 
Of course, not everyone is happy with the agreements the Chairman, Senator Helms, and I worked out. Some would have preferred to see no conditions at all attached to the payment of our debts. Others are unhappy that the United States is paying any arrears whatsoever. 
I think it is fair to say that the Chairman and I approached this issue from two very different points of view. I make no excuses for my support of the United Nations. I believe that the U.N. is an indispensable arrow in our foreign policy quiver. The Chairman, I think it is fair to say, has been skeptical of the role of the United Nations. 
But despite our differing outlooks, over the course of nearly 8 months of negotiation, dialogue, and old-fashioned bargaining, we each gave something and got something to return. The Chairman got several important conditions attached to the payment of arrears. Among other items, these include important managerial reforms, assurances that U.S. sovereignty will be protected, and a lowering of our assessment rate from 25 percent to 20 percent of the U.N. regular budget. 
For me, it is important that this bill sends a strong signal of bipartisan support for putting our relationship with the United Nations back on track. Restoring our relationship with the United Nations is not a favor to anyone else--it is in our interest. 
The United Nations allows us to leverage our resources with other countries in the pursuit of common interests, be it eradicating disease, mitigating hunger, caring for refugees, or addressing common environmental problems. And as the unfolding crisis with Iraq demonstrates, the United Nations can be a useful instrument in our diplomacy. The United States has played a leading role in the United Nations since its founding, and I believe that this legislation will secure that leadership. 
While the purists on either side may not be happy with the agreement before us, I believe that we have produced a responsible piece of legislation that warrants the support of our colleagues. 
In sum, the bill before the Senate, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, is a significant achievement. I want to pay tribute to the Chairman for his continued good faith and cooperation throughout this process. I want to thank the President, the National Security Adviser, and the Secretary of State, for their support and assistance during the negotiations. I also want to thank our colleagues in the other body, particularly the ranking member of the International Relations Committee, Lee Hamilton, who played an important role in pushing for changes to make this proposal more acceptable to the administration. 
I believe we have produced a good compromise that a large majority will be able to support. I urge its adoption.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to offer some remarks on Drug Director Barry McCaffrey's decision to decertify the Defense Department's proposed antidrug budget for fiscal 1999. 
At the outset, let me state that I support General McCaffrey's decision to request that the Defense Department increase its budget request by $140 million for the antidrug initiatives the General identifies: $24 million to boost antidrug task forces on the border to help implement the United States-Mexico Declaration signed by Presidents Clinton and Zedillo in May, 1997; $75 million for enfocement and interdiction to reduce the flow of cocaine out of the Andean Region; $30 million for boost National Guard drug efforts on the southern border; and $12 million to target drug trafficking criminal activity in the Caribbean. 
Even beyond the specifics of this issue, I am greatly heartened by the fact that General McCaffrey has chosen to exercise this important budget-setting authority. I must admit that I have been frustrated that, until General McCaffrey acted, no drug director had ever used this authority--not William Bennett, not Robert Martinez, and not Lee Brown. 
Let me also be up-front with my colleagues, one of the reasons I so strongly favor this decision is because I wrote this authority into law. For more than a decade, I debated with the Reagan administration and my colleagues to establish the Office of National Drug Control Policy. One of the reasons my legislation was so bitterly opposed for so long was because I put some real teeth into this legislation. And, of all the teeth, it is this budget authority which is the sharpest of all. 
Let me also explain to my colleagues that this so-called Biden Drug Budget Authority not only gives the Drug Director the authority to decertify the drug budget requests of the drug agencies, but it is crystal clear what must happen next. Just read the law: If the Drug Director exercises this authority, `the head of the Department or Agency shall comply with such a request.' 
It does not get much clearer than that. 
To make one more point--now before the Senate we have legislation to re-authorize the Drug Director's office. Yesterday, the Judiciary Committee reported the bipartisan Hatch-Biden reauthorization bill. A bill cosponsored by Senators Thurmond, Coverdell, DeWine and Feinstein. 
It is my hope that not only will the full Senate pass this legislation before we adjourn, but also that the leadership of the House reject the unproductive and partisan approach it adopted a few weeks ago and come onboard the bipartisan Hatch-Biden bill. 
Nothing puts the need for a Drug Director in starker focus than General McCaffrey's action on the Defense Department drug budget. My colleagues should need no other example--though there are many others--to recognize the importance of having a Drug Director. 
I urge my colleagues to support the General's decision on the Defense Department budget, and I urge my colleagues to take the concrete step it is within our power to do--pass the law to keep the Drug Office in place.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased that we finally have before us the legislation we need to give Amtrak a new lease on life. In my remarks this afternoon, I will start with the bottom line. 
When we pass this legislation today, Amtrak will be eligible to receive the $2.3 billion that was provided in last summer's balanced budget plan. This legislation authorizes the continued existence of Amtrak--that authorization expired in 1994--and therefore gives Amtrak access to the capital fund that some of us have worked so many years to establish. 
Agreement on the terms of Amtrak's reauthorization has not been easy, Mr. President. It has taken several years to accomplish, marked by many long hours and more frustrations than I care to recall, as agreements we thought were done unraveled over and over again. 
The bill before us this afternoon has required the best efforts of many of my colleagues, who have persevered in the face of those frustrations. We could not have reached this point without the leadership of Senator Hutchison, along with Senator McCain, and of course, their colleague on the Commerce Committee, the distinguished majority leader, to reach agreement on the many difficult issues that this legislation has raised. 
And I know that without the persistence of Senator John Kerry, along with Senators Hollings and Breaux, we would not have reached this point. 
And if I may say so, Mr. President, the entire Delaware congressional delegation has been a part of this process from the beginning. My good friend Bill Roth, chair of the Finance Committee, and our Governor, Tom Carper, who is on the Amtrak board of directors, both continued to play their key roles at critical moments in this process. 
The result is a bipartisan compromise, that required that everyone give up some of what they wanted to get as much as possible of what Amtrak needs. Those of us who followed these negotiations closely can count many moments when it seemed that this legislation was dead. Only the long-suffering perseverance of the key players made this legislation possible. 
But let's be clear about where we are in the life of Amtrak. As my good friend, Senator McCain, has stressed today, Amtrak is indeed in dire economic trouble. And yes, some of this trouble is indeed due to some of the constraints that we in Congress put on Amtrak's business practices when we created it a quarter of a century ago. That is why the reforms in this legislation are needed. 
But I believe that much of the problem is due to our failure over the years to provide our nation's passenger rail system with the level of financial support that we give to other elements of our country's transportation system. 
As Senator Kerry has argued here this afternoon, we here in the United States rank below some of the poorest Nations on the planet in the level of financial support per citizen that we provide our passenger rail system. 
One result of this has been that during the 25 year life of Amtrak, its employees have seen their wages cut as the cost of living grew 
while their paychecks stagnated. 
In my State of Delaware, we have two of the essential maintenance facilities for Amtrak--at the Wilmington and Bear, DE yards. The workers at these facilities are the best in the business, and are carrying on a tradition that reaches back to the turn of the century in which Delaware has provided essential support for passenger rail along the East Coast. 
The hard work that the men and women of the Delaware yards have put in keeping Amtrak's equipment and tracks safe and dependable has been rewarded with a stagnant standard of living. And our citizens--not just in East Coast urban areas, as we often hear, but in small towns all over the country--have had much less passenger rail service than the citizens of other major industrial nations. 
By failing to support Amtrak adequately, we have been forced to live with a less efficient transportation system, reducing the effectiveness of the more substantial funds we provide for highways and airports, which are crowded with travelers who might otherwise be able to travel by rail. 
We all hope that Amtrak will make the best of the management reforms in this bill to put passenger rail on a healthier financial track for the future. But this legislation entails more than operating reforms and access to a new capital fund. 
As Senator McCain so rightly pointed out, this legislation makes provision for termination of Federal Financial support for Amtrak's operations by the year 2002, something already part of our long-term budget plans. It includes provision for a study of the possibility of Amtrak's bankruptcy and liquidation. For the first time in Federal law, we are contemplating the possibility of shutting down passenger rail in this country. 
So while those of us who put in the hard work that made this moment possible should rightfully be proud of those efforts, we must not lose sight of the big picture. While we have bought a little more time for Amtrak, we have by no means assured that passenger rail--essential to the efficient operation of every other industrial economy's transportation system--will survive in the United States. 
Over the next 5 years, there will be more tough choices as we move toward the twin goals of a balanced Federal budget and the end of Federal operating support for our country's passenger rail system. If we fail to provide Amtrak with the resources it needs to modernize, to attract the ridership and revenues that can advance the goal of self-sufficiency, today's accomplishment will be hollow. 
I am not convinced, Mr. President, that we have chosen the right course for passenger rail in this country. No one argues against reforms that make the best use of taxpayers dollars, reforms that permit Amtrak to make use of the best business practices to attract riders and to expand our country's passenger rail system. 
But by themselves, those reforms will not relieve us of our responsibility to keep passenger rail alive. 
Senator Kerry reminded us today that the European Community has committed to major new investments on top of their substantial contributions to their continent's passenger rails system. As the most productive economy in the world, we should face up to the need to make similar commitments here. 
So many benefits flow from these investments--benefits that can be measured, but not always on the books of any given passenger rail system--that the rest of the developed world is willing to make that kind of commitment. Those benefits include more efficient use of fuel, cleaner air, reduced congestion on our highways and at our airports--real benefits that add up to real dollars saved that can be put to better use. 
In today's world--with balanced budgets and increased economic competition--we must make sure that we capture those benefits and save those dollars. That is why the fight for passenger rail in the United States is far from over today.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Senator Thurmond and Senator Levin, the distinguished chairman and ranking minority member of the Armed Services Committee, for their work in conference to produce a defense authorization bill that will help keep America's military strong and well-prepared for today's multiple threats and challenges. The U.S. leadership role has never been more important than it is now as the world reshapes itself to face a new century. 
In order to lead, America must have strong diplomatic and military tools. As ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign Relations I have worked this year with the Chairman, Senator Helms, to enhance our country's diplomatic readiness overseas. 
Our Nation's defense force is the weight behind our diplomatic initiatives. It is the critical strength upon which we rely when other options, unfortunately, may fail. Good diplomacy is always built upon good defenses and this bill enhances our ability to deal with critical foreign policy and security issues. 
I am pleased that the conferees agreed to fully fund the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program. This program assists Russia and other former Soviet states both to secure and control their nuclear materials and to improve their nuclear safety programs. This bill ensures that the Nunn-Lugar program will continue to protect our national security in a very cost-effective manner. 
The bill also requires the President and the Secretary of Defense to increase their focus on counterterrorism efforts. 
The importance of Asia and the Pacific is highlighted by an expression of congressional support for continuing a minimum troop presence to support our security agreements with countries in that region. 
The bill contains another important provision that expresses the sense of the Congress that any moratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines by U.S. Armed Forces should not be implemented in a manner that would endanger U.S. personnel or undermine their effectiveness. This is consistent with the provisions of S. 896, the Landmine Elimination Act of 1997, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor, as that act includes a Presidential waiver to protect American forces in Korea. 
Like the defense appropriations bill, there are sections in this authorization bill dealing with our involvement in Bosnia. As I have said before, I think that it was a mistake to have set a deadline for a complete American troop withdrawal from Bosnia. Months ago, I called for a combined joint task force with European troops making up the overwhelming majority of the ground forces and Americans providing command and control, intelligence, and logistics assistance, air and naval support, and, if necessary, a ready reserve force in the region. So, I agree with the thrust of this bill's recommendation, but I also think a small, residual American ground force in Bosnia may be necessary to maintain America's leadership role in the operation. 
I am happy to see the commendation for the NATO enlargement process and the sensible reporting requirements contained in this conference report. 
In separate provisions, by authorizing pay raises and barracks construction, this bill takes important steps to enhance the quality of life for our brave men and women in uniform. 
This bill also adds two positions to the Joint Chiefs of Staff to include National Guard and Reserve commanders. This change recognizes the unique and increasingly vital role played by our reservists and guard members in our nation's defense. 
Last, the conferees maintained the U.S. ability to forcefully project power by continuing to fully fund the C-5 aircraft. The C-5 is the military's workhorse plane--carrying heavy weapons like tanks and helicopters all over the world. Its singular value has been shown in conflict after conflict, from Vietnam to Desert Storm. Delawareans are proud to host a significant portion of the Nation's C-5 fleet stationed at the Dover Air Force Base and glad to see that Dover's infrastructure will benefit from the military construction appropriations bill signed by the President and authorized by this bill. 
I am pleased, therefore, to support the work of my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee and vote to strengthen America's leadership role around the world with a strong, well-equipped military.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, David H. Kraus, assistant chief of the European Division of the Library of Congress, died on October 27 in Lanham, MD. In a career at the Library of Congress that spanned a quarter-century, Mr. Kraus played a pivotal role in developing the library's unparalleled European collections and in advising the Congress in a variety of ways, most recently in the training of parliamentarians and librarians from the newly independent, former Communist States of Europe. 
A native of Minnesota, Mr. Kraus received his undergraduate education at the University of Wisconsin and did graduate work at Harvard University. A consummate bibliographer and administrator, he was also a remarkable linguist who attained reading fluency in most of the major languages of Eastern and Western Europe. Mr. Kraus was nationally prominent in library circles and ably represented the Congress at scores of professional meetings. 
David Kraus was a wise and gentleman, possessed with a ready wit to go with his enormous erudition. He served the Congress long and faithfully, and he leaves many friends on Capitol Hill where he will be sorely missed.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the reversion of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China is a historic event, the full impact of which may not be known for years. At midnight on June 30, the world watched as the flag of the United Kingdom came down over Hong Kong, the final chapter of over a century of the British Empire's presence in the Far East. July 1 dawned with the flag of China flying over Victoria Harbor, providing a great moment of pride for the people of China as Beijing recovered a territory lost in humiliating fashion to foreign powers. 
For the cause of freedom, the reversion is a conundrum. 
Some observers warn that China intends to trample Hong Kong's freedoms. After a decade in which millions have cast off the yoke of Communist rule of the Soviet Empire, the subjugation of the people of Hong Kong to the control of a dictatorial government in Beijing is surely a sad anomaly. 
Others predict optimistically that in the end China, not Hong Kong, will be transformed by the new union. They point to the changes already underway in China, and foresee a more prosperous, open, plural, and democratic system for one-fifth of the world's population. 
I believe the future of Hong Kong, like that of China, is not yet written. The actions of the United States will affect the ability of the people of Hong Kong to preserve their democratic freedoms and overall quality of life. 
Visiting Washington recently on his first trip abroad as Hong Kong's Chief Executive, Tung Chee-hwa rightly took pride in the former colony's smooth transition to Chinese rule. But he also candidly acknowledged that preserving Hong Kong's economic vitality and expanding the democratic freedoms enjoyed by its 5 1/2 million residents required not only a steady hand in Hong Kong, but also the sustained interest and support of the international community. 
It is in this context that we must view the U.S.-Hong Kong extradition agreement. 
Approval of the treaty is a risk, for it is predicated on a question which cannot be answered in the abstract. The question is this: will the Beijing Government adhere to its pledge to permit Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for at least 50 years? In other words, will China abide by its promise to maintain `one country, two systems?' 
No one can answer that question definitively today--not the people of Hong Kong, not the British Government, not the Clinton administration, 
not even the gerontocracy in Beijing, which struggles to chart a course for China's modernization in the post-Deng Xiao Ping era. 
Of course, there is always the risk that a treaty partner will prove to be unreliable. That risk is particularly acute here, where the treaty partner--the Hong Kong Government--will be overseen by a government in Beijing which has often failed to adhere adequately to commitments made to the United States. 
Standing opposite that risk are the benefits that flow from having an extradition relationship with Hong Kong. For most of this decade, the relationship has undeniably been in our interests. Since 1991, more than 60 persons have been returned to the United States from Hong Kong pursuant to extradition requests, many of them for serious crimes such as narcotics trafficking. By contrast, we have extradited just seven persons to Hong Kong. 
Moreover, the extradition treaty is a critical component of our overall law enforcement cooperation with Hong Kong authorities--cooperation which has proven enormously successful over the years in combating organized crime, drug smuggling, and international terrorism. 
Finally, this treaty contains extraordinary protections against any attempt by Beijing to meddle with or politicize the extradition process. 
Indeed, the treaty provides several protections against valid concerns that the PRC may renege on its pledge to permit Hong Kong to retain an independent judiciary. The treaty contains several safeguards; these include: First, a provision allowing the United States broad power to refuse to surrender U.S. nationals in cases relating to `the defense, foreign affairs, or essential public interest or policy of the United States' (Article 3); second, a provision permitting the Secretary of State to deny extradition if the request was politically motivated, or the person sought is likely to be denied a fair trial or punished because of his race, religion, nationality, or political opinions (Article 6); and third, a provision barring the retransfer of any fugitive beyond the territory of Hong Kong without U.S. consent (Article 16). 
The Committee has added included two provisions in the resolution of ratification that provide additional protection. First, understanding No. 1 makes it plain that the United States will not permit the retransfer to the People's Republic of China of any persons surrendered under this agreement, unless the person being surrendered consents to the transfer. Understanding No. 2 makes a strong statement in support of the independence of the Hong Kong judiciary, by stating that any effort to curtail the jurisdiction and power of adjudication of the Hong Kong courts may be considered grounds for withdrawal from the Agreement. 
In exercising its power to advise and consent, the Senate must balance the risks that China will interfere with the autonomy of Hong Kong against the likely benefits to U.S. law enforcement that will flow from the agreement. In my view, the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. And the safeguards in the treaty, in addition to the provisions in the resolution of ratification, provide strong protection of U.S. interests and of the rights of those persons who may be surrendered under the treaty. 
By ratifying this treaty, the Senate will send a strong signal to the people of Hong Kong that we have confidence in their ability to make the unique `one country, two systems' formula work. We also send a strong message to Beijing that we will not tolerate any efforts to undermine the traditional autonomy and impartiality of Hong Kong's judiciary. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting ratification of the Hong Kong extradition agreement.  
Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union 
Resolved, (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring therein), That the Senate advise and consent to the ratification of the Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), with Annexes, signed at Geneva on December 22, 1992, and Amendments to the Constitution and Convention, signed at Kyoto on October 14, 1994, together with Declarations and Reservations by the United States contained in the Final Acts (Treaty Doc. 104-34), subject to declarations and reservations Nos. 68, 73 and 82 of the 1992 Final Acts; declarations and reservations Nos. 84, 92, 97, and 98 of the 994 Final Acts; and the understandings of subsection (a), the declarations of subsection (b), and the proviso of subsection (c).

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is today acting on the Extradition Treaties Interpretation Act. I appreciate the cooperation of the chairman of the committee, and the cooperation and assistance of the executive branch, in moving this bill forward. 
The bill is very short, and I will not take the Senate's time to review it at length. In brief, the bill is designed to remedy a disparity in U.S. extradition law and practice. The disparity is this: under certain extradition treaties, the crime of parental abduction--when one parent takes a child in violation of law or a custody order and against the wishes of the other parent--is not extraditable. That is so for two related reasons. 
The criminalization of parental abduction is a relatively recent development in U.S. criminal law. Prior to the mid-1970's, parental abduction was generally considered a family law matter not covered by criminal law. In the last two decades or so, U.S. criminal law has evolved significantly. All 50 states make the act a crime, as does the District of Columbia and the Federal Government. 
As a consequence of this development in the law, a disparity has been created in U.S. extradition law. The disparity occurs in a subset of extradition treaties referred to as `list' treaties--so named because they specifically enumerate, or list, the crimes under the treaty that are considered extraditable. Thus, because the act of parental abduction was not a crime when these older list treaties were ratified, it has been the practice of the executive branch to interpret the treaties as excluding parental abduction. This concern does not arise in more modern `dual criminality' treaties, which avoid the limiting nature of the list treaties by allowing extradition in any case where both countries make a practice a felony. 
Seeking to remove this disparity, the Clinton administration has requested authority to adopt a new interpretation of the term `kidnapping' in the list treaties so that it encompasses parental abduction. The Foreign Relations Committee strongly supports this request, and voted unanimously last month to report the bill to the Senate. 
The chairman and I have offered a substitute amendment which makes several changes to the Committee-reported bill which were recommended by the Justice Department after it gave closer review to the legislation. The changes are modest, and mostly technical. I would highlight only one: the committee-reported bill provided, in the operative section of the bill, section 3, that the Congress authorizes the interpretation of the term kidnapping to include international parental kidnapping. The substitute omits the word `international,' for an important reason: the crime of international parental abduction, which includes as an element the taking of a child out of the country, is a Federal offense. But the practical reality is that most extradition cases will involve crimes prosecuted at the state level, where the offense does not include the aforementioned element of removing the child from the country. Thus, the substitute ensures that the bill has the broadest possible reach. 
Mr. President, the abduction of children by their parents is a heartwrenching crime. This bill will ensure that there is no disparity in U.S. extradition law and practice with regard to this crime, and, I hope, will help lead to the extradition of individuals wanted for this crime. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on Tuesday, Americans from around the country gathered here at the Capitol to hold a rally in conjunction with Brain Tumor Awareness Week. I want to add my voice to those calling attention to this debilitating disease and to the calls for continuing to increase our funding for medical research. 
It sounds wrong to call one debilitating disease more important than another. After all, a life-threatening disease is a life-threatening disease. However, as a society, we often get caught up in the rhetoric and publicity surrounding one of these terrible afflictions and forget that, unfortunately, there are a number of other terminal illnesses. While brain tumors do not receive as much press as other terminal illnesses, their impact on the lives of brain tumor patients and their families is equally devastating. 
One of those people is a constituent of mine, Ms. Kathy Delledonne-Minutola. She and her husband attended the rally on Tuesday because, four years ago, their son Joseph was diagnosed with a brain stem tumor. The roots of the tumor have wrapped around Joseph's brain stem, a condition which makes removal of the tumor impossible. 
Mr. President, there are thousands of people across this country who have been diagnosed with brain tumors, just like Joseph. In fact, each year approximately 100,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with a brain tumor. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer death for children and young adults up to age 34, and they are one of the fastest growing causes of cancer death in the elderly. 
Furthermore, each patient is different, and potential for recovery depends on a number of factors. The type of tumor, its location, the area of the brain involved, and the forms of therapy the patient will receive all contribute to a patient's prognosis. Currently, there is no cure for most malignant brain tumors. Surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are the three most common treatments. However, because brain tumors are located at the control center for human thought, emotion, and movement, both the tumor and its treatment can have devastating effects on a person's physical and cognitive abilities. 
Despite often bleak projections for recovery, however, the community of people who have been affected by this disease has refused to give up. Their courage and support for one another in the face of tragedy is truly inspirational. They are proof that the power of the human spirit can triumph over adversity in even the darkest of moments. 
So, Mr. President, in this, Brain Tumor Awareness Week, I rise today to applaud the tireless commitment that brain tumor patients and their families have made to beating this disease. This is a remarkable group of people. However, they cannot take on the burden of finding a cure on their own. We in Congress need to help, and I look forward to working with my colleagues, as I have in the past, to support medical research funding. While Brain Tumor Awareness Week may only last seven days, our commitment to finding a cure must be a year-round endeavor.

Mr. BIDEN. The second hearing today will feature testimony of distinguished experts who are for and against enlargement. Later in the month the committee will hear examinations of cost and burden-sharing, of the qualifications for membership of the three candidate countries--Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, and of the new relationship between NATO and Russia. The final hearing will be reserved for public testimony from individuals and groups with special interest in the NATO enlargement issue. 
Through these hearings, the Committee on Foreign Relations hopes to inform not only the entire Senate on this critically important issue, but also the American public. 
Mr. President, as my colleagues know, I have spoken many times in some detail on this floor about the issue of NATO enlargement. As the Committee on Foreign Relations launches its series of hearings, I would like briefly to recapitulate why I believe NATO enlargement is in the best interest of the United States. 
Europe remains a vital area of interest for the United States for political, strategic, economic, and cultural reasons. A sizable percentage of the world's democracies are in Europe, and the continent remains a major global economic player and partner of the United States. The European Union, with a combined population a third larger than ours, has a combined gross domestic product that exceeds ours. 
While the United States has a larger and less balanced trading relationship with Asia than with Europe, we invest far more in Europe. Several new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe have highly educated work forces, already boast rapidly expanding economies, and already attract considerable American investment. Moreover, most Americans trace their ethnic and cultural roots to Europe, and millions retain personal ties to it. 
Other than North America, no other part of the world can match Europe's combination of political, economic, military, and cultural power. By any geopolitical standard, it would be a catastrophe for U.S. interests if instability would alter the current situation in Europe. 
Of course no one believes that the Russian Army is poised to pour through the Fulda Gap in Germany--NATO's horror scenario for 45 years. Rather, the threats to stability in Europe have changed, but they are, if anything, even more real than those of the cold war: ethnic and religious hatred as horrifyingly shown in the hundreds of thousands killed, raped, made homeless, or otherwise brutalized in Bosnia, and the well-organized forces of international crime, whose tentacles extend from Moscow and Palermo to New York and Los Angeles. 
Unfortunately, the history of the 20th century has demonstrated that out of enlightened self-interest the United States must play a leading role in organizing the security of Europe. In two world wars and lately in Bosnia without American leadership the countries of Europe have been unable to resolve their differences peacefully. 
Translated into 1997 terms it means that we must lead the Europeans to create a new security architecture to guarantee stability to the areas most vulnerable to disruption, namely Central and Eastern Europe, where newly independent states are striving to create and soldify political democracy and free markets. It is a difficult process, which if not put into a larger framework could spin out of control. 
It is in this context that the enlargement of NATO must be seen. 
During the cold war, NATO provided the security umbrella under which former enemies like France and Germany were able to cooperate and build highly successful free societies. 
It was the framework in which former pariahs like Germany, Italy, and Spain could be reintegrated into democratic Europe. And it was NATO that kept the feud between Greece and Turkey from escalating to warfare. 
The enlargement of NATO can now serve to move the zone of stability eastward to Central Europe and thereby both prevent ethnic conflicts from escalating and forestall a scramble for new bilateral and multilateral pacts along the lines of the 1930's from occurring. 
In fact, it is already happening. In anticipation of NATO membership, several Central and East European countries have recently settled long-standing disputes. 
If NATO were not to enlarge, however, the countries between Germany and Russia would inevitably seek other means to protect themselves. The question for today is not, as is often assumed, enlarge NATO or remain the same. The status quo is simply not an option. 
Finally, there is the moral argument for enlargement. For 40 years the United States loudly proclaimed its solidarity with the captive nations who were under the heel of communist oppressors. Now that most of them have cast off their shackles, it is our responsibility to live up to our pledges to readmit them into the West through NATO and the European Union when they are fully qualified. 
NATO enlargement, of course, like any venture, is not cost-free. Earlier this year the Pentagon issued a study that estimated the cost to the United States to be around $200 million per year for 10 years. Other estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and by the Rand Corp. have varied considerably, according to risk assumptions. At the July NATO Summit in Madrid, the North Atlantic Council directed the Alliance to come up with a definitive cost estimate for the NATO ministerial meeting in December. 
Whatever the final, authoritative cost estimate turns out to be, we must be certain that our current allies, and our future allies, pay their fair share of the enlargement costs. 
Similarly, before we in the Senate vote on whether or not to admit Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary to NATO, we must settle what we plan to do in Bosnia after the expiration of the mandate for SFOR in June 1998. That in itself is an immensely complicated topic, for which there is inadequate time to discuss today. After my latest trip to Bosnia at the end of August, I am more convinced than ever that we are making progress and that we must not abandon the international effort to reach a lasting, peaceful, and just solution for that troubled land. But whatever post-SFOR plan we hammer out, it must be done on the basis of sharing the risks and costs with our European allies and with non-NATO contributors to SFOR. 
NATO enlargement need not adversely affect our relations with Russia. In fact, we must redouble our peaceful engagement with Russia in the hope that its nascent democracy and free market system will mature sufficiently so that some day it may fully join the Western world. The NATO-Russia Founding Act of May 1997 is a significant step in the right direction. 
Enlargement plans have been accompanied by a redefinition of NATO's mission and force posture. The alliance's primary mission remains the same: treating an attack on one member as an attack on all, and responding through the use of armed force if necessary. 
NATO's new strategic concept emphasizes rapid and flexible deployment. The three new members, plus other countries like Slovenia and Romania in the near future, will enhance NATO's ability to project power, if necessary, into crisis areas like the Middle East. 
In addition, in the current post-cold war situation, missions like peacekeeping, sometimes in cooperation with non-NATO powers, have become possible. The SFOR joint effort in Bosnia with Russia and several other non-NATO countries, which I mentioned earlier, is an excellent example. 
NATO enlargement corresponds to America's security requirements in the 21st century. As long as the costs of enlargement are equitably shared among current and future NATO members, and as long as we have agreed upon a fair and coherent plan for Bosina after SFOR, I believe that my Senate colleagues will vote to ratify NATO enlargement when it comes before us next spring.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise very briefly to explain my absence on rollcall vote No. 271. This was a procedural vote to instruct the Sergeant at Arms. I was attending a conference with Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and was involved in a discussion of Bosnia and the enforcement of the Dayton Peace accords. I was unable to return to the Senate for the vote.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, since 1992, when the Senate first voted on the issue of providing private school vouchers, I have consistently voted against spending Federal money to pay for tuition at private schools. I did so again today. But, I rise to let my colleagues know that I am reconsidering my position based on the changed circumstances in American education. I want to give everyone fair notice that in the future, I may vote to allow such a limited experiment. 
I realize that whenever elected officials change their position on an issue, they are subject to accusations of flip-flopping or being inconsistent or trying to have it both ways. It is for that reason that I want to explain my thinking on this matter today. 
Unlike some opponents of vouchers, I have never categorically opposed the idea of public money being used under any circumstances for private school education. Rather--and I think I have been forthright about this from the very beginning--my concerns have been very specific. First, I have questions about whether a private school voucher system, when it involves private religious schools, is constitutional. And, second, I have deep reservations about taking money away from underfunded public schools. 
But, Mr. President, I do not believe that simply because I have always voted a particular way on a particular issue that I should be locked in forever to that position. Circumstances change. Thinking changes. And, I have been giving this issue a lot of thought. 
I have come to the belief that the constitutional issues involved here are not as clear cut as opponents have argued. While lower courts have ruled that vouchers used in private religious schools violate the first amendment's prohibition on the establishment of religion, the Supreme Court has not yet weighed in on the question. 
In fact, the Supreme Court has ruled that State tuition tax credits for private religious school tuition are perfectly constitutional, and the Supreme Court has ruled that Pell grants--vouchers for college students--can be used in private religious colleges without violating the Constitution. Granted, Mr. President, the issues that the Court has adjudicated are not exactly parallel to the issue of private school vouchers for elementary and secondary school students. But, the point is, it is an open question. Even some liberal constitutional scholars have noted that vouchers to parents and children may be constitutional. And, as long as it remains an open question, I do not think I can dismiss the issue of vouchers solely on constitutional grounds. 
With regard to my second concern--that private school vouchers may drain funds away from the public schools--I now think that the issue is more complex. The real issue is not whether money is drained from public schools, but what effect vouchers would have on public schools and the quality of education those students receive. And, yes, I do believe there is a difference. Even if vouchers were to take money away from the public schools--and I should point out that not all voucher proposals do--that does not in and of itself mean that public schools will be harmed. 
When you have an area of the country--and most often here we are talking about inner cities--where the public schools are abysmal or dysfunctional or not working and where most of the children have no way out, it is legitimate to ask what would happen to the public schools with increased competition from private schools and what would happen to the quality of education for the children who live there. 
Most of the opponents of private school vouchers argue that with more kids attending private schools, the support for public education will be drained. To date, that assertion has largely gone unchallenged. I am not sure it should any more. Is it not possible that giving poor kids a way out will force the public schools to improve and result in more people coming back? 
Make no mistake about it. Public education must be our primary focus. And, in considering voting for vouchers in the future, I am not subscribing to the philosophy of many voucher supporters who argue that there should be no Federal role in education or that the Federal Government should not in any way help States fund public education or that we should decrease our commitment to public education. On the contrary, I think we should increase that commitment. But, for those kids who are presently caught in a failed public school, we must start asking--only asking--if public education is still the only answer. 
I do not know the answer to that or any of the other questions I have raised today. But, I believe the questions need to be asked. And, it may be that the only way that we will find out the answers is to create a limited private school voucher demonstration project. 
I say `may,' Mr. President, because I do not know. And, that really is part of the point here. I will continue to ask these questions, listen to both sides of the debate, and ponder the answers. In so doing, however, I want everyone to understand that I may conclude in the end that the only true way to answer the questions is to try vouchers--in a limited fashion for those who need the most help.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this evening, the Senate conducted two rollcall votes--on the conference report to the Defense Department Appropriations bill and on the nomination of Katharine Sweeney Hayden to be U.S. District Judge for the District of New Jersey. Unfortunately, I was not present for those votes. 
Tonight, at my daughter's school in Wilmington is what is called mini roster night. That is what most people know as open house or parents' night--where the parents go around and meet all of the teachers. Because of the Senate voting schedule, I will either have to miss votes or miss mini roster night at my daughter's school. 
On both matters voted on tonight, my position is already on the record, and my vote is not expected to change the outcome. 
With regard to the defense bill, I voted for the bill on July 15 when it passed the Senate by the overwhelming margin of 94-4. There have been no substantial changes in the legislation, and I continue to support it. 
On July 10, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported out the nomination of Katharine Sweeney Hayden to be a New Jersey district judge. I supported her nomination, and I continue to do so. 
Again, Mr. President, on both matters, my vote is not expected to change the outcome, and therefore, I have decided to attend parents' night at my daughter's school. I appreciate the understanding of my colleagues and my constituents.

Mr. BIDEN. I thank my colleague. With the permission of the Chair and my colleagues, I will take about 12 minutes, if I may. 
Mr. President, the purpose of this FDA reform bill we are considering today is obviously to streamline the process for approving drugs so that they are available to people who need them more quickly. I support the bill and I look forward to its becoming law. 
But, Mr. President, I rise today to speak to several amendments and several points that were, quite frankly, made nongermane as a consequence of the cloture vote, so I will pursue this at another date. I rise today to discuss the problem of drugs that do not get to the market, even though we need them desperately, because there are insufficient financial incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop these drugs that we need to get to the market. In particular, I am speaking about medicines to treat addiction to illegal drugs like cocaine and heroin, so-called pharmacotherapies--that is, drugs that would be able to be developed and used to combat addiction to cocaine and heroin and other scheduled drugs. 
Since 1989, when I first offered a comprehensive report, which--I don't know whether I am going to burden the Record with it, but I will point it out to my colleagues. It was a report entitled `Pharmacotherapy: A Strategy for the 1990s.' Since that time, I have argued that a key component of our national drug strategy should be the development of these pharmacotherapies that would act as antigens or antagonists to the effects of the illegal drugs being purchased on the streets. 
These medicines are critical for turning around addicts, particularly addicts who are difficult to treat with traditional methods. Getting these addicts off of drugs is one of the most important efforts we can undertake to reduce the harm done to our Nation by the drug epidemic--because these treatment-resistant addicts commit such a large percentage of the drug-related crime, we would, if we could find some of the answers, significantly impact on and increase the safety of all Americans. 
In my 1989 report, I posed the question: `If drug use is an epidemic, are we doing enough to find a medical `cure' for this disease?' The obvious answer, as the report concludes, is, no, we are not. If, for example, everyone who was victimized by a drug addict who has knocked them on the head or hurt them or robbed them or burglarized their home, and everyone who is addicted to drugs had a rare disease instead of the victims of drug addiction, or of being addicted to drugs, we would have a multibillion dollar national campaign to find a medical cure for it, as we rightfully are attempting to do with AIDS, breast cancer, or cancer generally. But there is precious little going on, although there is a lot of potential in the area of developing medicines, drugs, to combat drug addiction. 
Based on my report, I offered legislation with Senators Kennedy, Moynihan, and others, enacted into law in 1992, which created the Medications Development Program of the National Institute of Drug Abuse and commissioned a major study by the National Academy of Science on pharmacotherapies. 
This study highlighted the promise of the medical research that I referred to. In fact, in recent years, there have been a number of promising advances that give hope that effective medicines could be developed if we dedicated a sufficient amount of energy and resources. 
One example of this promising research is the recent development of a compound that appears to immunize laboratory 
animals against the effects of cocaine. Let me say that again. There is a compound that has been developed in a laboratory that appears--it hasn't gone through clinical trials--to be able to immunize laboratory animals against the effects of cocaine. The compound works like a vaccine by stimulating the immune system to develop an antibody that blocks cocaine from entering the brain. 
Now, this is pure conjecture on my part. Let's assume that that was able to be developed and it worked for human beings. What an incredible impact it would have on the United States of America. What an incredible impact it would have not only on the addicts, but on those of us who are victims of the addicts. I want to remind everybody that over 60 percent of all the violent crime committed in America is committed by people who are addicted. At the moment they are committing the crime, they are high, they are on a drug or a substance. Just think what a difference that would make. 
Now, there are at least eight new medicines with promising potential, beyond the one that I mentioned, to treat drug addictions which are at various stages of research and development. By the way, I commend to my colleagues the report put out by the Institute of Medicine called the `Development of Medications for the Treatment of Opiate and Cocaine Addiction.' 
Now, of the eight promising medicines that are out there, one is LAAM, a treatment for heroin addiction, the first new medicine since methadone was approved in the early 1970's. Others are Naloxone, Naltrexone, Imipramine, Desipramine, Carbamazepine, Burprenorphine, and Diltiazem. These are all medicines identified by the various studies--in this case, by the Institute of Medicine--that in fact have promising capacity to deal with either blocking the effect of the drug when it is ingested by an addict or someone attempting to use it for the first time, or it has the effect of causing that person to be sick and not wanting to take the drug again. Not a silver bullet that cures everything, but every single drug expert I have spoken with indicates that if these could be developed, they would be significant tools in aiding in the recovery of addiction and preventing addiction. 
The National Academy of Sciences study also outlined the key steps we have to take to fully realize the promise of pharmacotherapeutic research. Yet, almost a decade after my original report, almost a decade after Senators Kennedy, Moynihan, myself and others moved to change the law in 1992, despite promising research, despite the tremendously important gains that such medicines would mean for our national effort against a drug epidemic, despite the fact that it's clear what steps we have to take to speed and encourage the research in this area, despite all this, we are still not doing enough to encourage the development of medicines to treat drug addiction. 
That is why I have come to the floor today, Mr. President--to discuss three amendments I had offered to the FDA reform bill. These amendments sought to take three different approaches to addressing our critical need to develop pharmacotherapies to deal with our drug epidemic. 
First, I believe we should reauthorize the Medications Development Program of the National Institute of Drug Abuse and increase its funding to $100 million by the year 2002. I might add, every time we identify serious and pernicious diseases like breast cancer, prostate cancer, or AIDS, what do we do? We all immediately know that if we spend more money on research, we will attract more brilliant women and men into the field to find the answer because they have funding to do their research, and we increase exponentially the prospects that we will find a cure or find something to mitigate against the ravages of the disease. But not all people instinctively reach that conclusion. Why don't we reach that conclusion about drug addiction when the medical community says there are so many promising avenues we could go down? It would be different if the National Academy of Sciences and researchers and experts said, `You know, there isn't any promise here, there is nothing we should bother to do, there is 
nothing we can do. This is like trying to be able to go warp speed in our Challenger.' Well, that would be one thing. But that is not the case. That is not the case. 
Currently, the program I have referred to at the National Institute of Drug Abuse receives about $67 million. Increasing that level by 50 percent over the next 5 years is the very least we should be doing in light of the savings in crime reduction, reduction in health care costs, and other expenses that would be eliminated or diminished if we could effectively treat drug addiction with medicine. 
Yet, despite the progress being made by Government and university researchers, the Federal Government cannot solve this problem by itself, even if the amendment I proposed were not out of order or were accepted. 
Private industry has not aggressively developed pharmacotherapies for a variety of reasons, including a small customer base, difficulties in distributing medicines to the targeted population, and fear of being associated with the notion of substance abuse. 
There are two major, major drug companies in my State--Zeneca and Du Pont Merck. They have a number of brilliant researchers. I have visited their laboratories. 
They say to me what every other drug company says. `OK. Biden, how many addicted drug people are there in all America?' I believe the number is estimated at 5.6 million people. Let's say we spend $200 million, $300 million, $500 million, or $700 million developing it. They say, `Say we go out and spend all this money. And let's say we come up with a cure or a silver bullet. How do we get that to the 5.6 million people who need it? They don't have the money to buy it. Are you going to guarantee us that you will buy it? Are you going to guarantee us they will take it? What are you going to do? Our return on investment is de minimis. We will lose money in all probability, even if we come up with a silver bullet,' which they are not suggesting they will. 
Conversely, if they come up with a silver bullet for prostate cancer, or a silver bullet for breast cancer, the world would beat a path to their door to buy it. That is one of the reasons they don't want to get into the game, even though they acknowledge that these are promising opportunities. 
Second, none of these companies, or anyone I named--Lilly, Squibb, any of them--wants to be known as the company that deals with drug addiction. It is bad public relations. 
So for these and many other reasons, private industry has not really gotten into the fray. We need to create financial incentives to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop and market these treatments. And we need to develop a new partnership between private industry and the public sector in order to encourage the active marketing and distribution of new medicines so they are accessible to all addicts who need treatment. 
My amendments sought to create these incentives in two ways. 
First, I believe we must provide additional patent protections for companies that develop drugs to treat substances abuse. Under my bill, pharmacotherapies could be designated `Orphan Drugs' and qualify for an exclusive 7-year patent. 
These extraordinary patent rights would increase the market value or pharmacotherapies--providing a financial reward for companies that invest in the search to cure drug addiction. 
This provision was contained in a bill introduced by Senator Kennedy and me which passed the Senate in 1990, but the provision was dropped in conference. It was also contained in the pharmacotherapy bill I introduced last year and the youth violence bill I introduced this year. 
In addition, I proposed an amendment which would provide a substantial monetary reward for companies that develop medicines to treat drug addition and shift responsibility for marketing and distributing such drugs to the Government--a `Biden Bounty' as some have called it. 
This approach would create a financial incentive for drug companies to invest in research and development but enable them to avoid any stigma associated with distributing medicine to substance abusers. 
To qualify for the award, a pharmaceutical company would have to demonstrate that the new medicine meets strict guidelines--developed by the National Academy of Sciences--that the medicine effectively treats cocaine or heroin addition. 
At a minimum, the guidelines will require the producer of the drug to conduct a controlled, long-term performance test which demonstrates that: Patients--addicts--will actually take the medicine; addicts will continue taking the medicine for as long as it takes to cure the addition; a significant percentage of those who receive treatment refrained from using cocaine or heroin for at least 3 years; and the medicine has a reasonable cost. 
So, it is real simple--if a medicine meets the National Academy of Science test and it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, then the Government will purchase the patent rights for the drug from the company that developed it. 
So this bounty that would be made available to them is literally a reward. A reward, not unlike if I were a billionaire and say, `I will give any company $100 million if they found the cure for cancer, or for any cancer.' It is the same notion. 
The key reason the Government must not only reward companies with a bounty for developing medicines, but also purchase the patent rights is due to the stigma problem identified by the National Academy of Sciences report. This stigma problem is the legitimate concern of companies that they not be identified as the drug addicts company. 
I would also note, that if a company does want to market and distribute the medicine, they do not have to sell the patent to the Government. But if they don't want to they can sell the patent to Government, and we market it. 
The purchase price for the patent rights is established by law: $100 million for a drug to treat cocaine addiction and $50 million for a drug to treat heroin addiction, figures recommended by the Tufts University Center on Drug Development. 
So the way it works. You develop a patent. You don't want to be distributing it because you don't want to be known as that company. The Federal Government would pay you $100 million for the patent after it has demonstrated that it works, and it was effectively done, and we would be the one engaged in the business of doing it. We can pay all of this money to buy cops, we can pay all of this money for prisons, and pay all of these other moneys for other things. It is a reasonable expenditure for taxpayer dollars, in my view, to deal with the problem and scourge of drug addiction. 
Once the Government has purchased the patent rights, then the Government would contract out the production of the drug and distribute it to the existing clinics, hospitals, State and local governments, and other entities qualified to operate drug treatment programs. 
This is not a radically different process from how our military procurement works: The Pentagon specifies what they want a fighter plane to be capable of--how fast, its stealth capabilities, what kind of weapons, et cetera; then the powers of the private sector are unleased because the Government will buy the best plane which meets the specifications. 
If my colleagues doubt that any such medicine could ever be developed, fine. 
If you are right, the Government will never spend the money. 
But, if I am right--just imagine the promise--in terms of reduced drug abuse; reduced crime; and reduced health care costs. 
The bottom line is that--this joint public/private endeavor I seek will harness the most important engine of innovation the world knows--the private sector. 
The three pharmacotherapy amendments I offered were directly related to the purpose of the FDA reform bill and I hoped they would be accepted. Nonetheless, I understand that for procedural reasons, my amendments were out of order and could not be offered for a vote. 
Still, I urge the Labor Committee to hold hearings on the topic and consider this legislation as soon as possible. And, I put my colleagues on notice that I will be back to offer these amendments on the next appropriate legislation. 
In closing, I would observe that America's drug epidemic is reduced each and every time a drug abuser quits his or her habit. Fewer drug addicts mean fewer crimes, fewer hospital admissions, fewer drug-addicted babies and fewer neglected children. The benefits to our country of developing new treatment options such as pharmacotherapies are manifold. 
Each dollar we spend on advancing options in this area can save us 10 or 20 times as much in years to come. The question should not be--`can we afford to pursue a pharmacotherapy strategy?' But rather, `can we afford not to?' 
I urge my colleagues to join me in promoting an important, and potentially ground breaking, approach to addressing one of our Nation's most serious domestic challenges. 
A lot of the scientific community says that there are great promising medicines out there but which the companies will not move on for the reasons I have stated. We should be doing all that we can for our own safety's sake. 
I thank my colleagues. I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, at the end of October President Clinton will sit down with Chinese President Jiang Zemin to try to put the United States-China relationship on a sounder footing. After 8 years of tension in the relationship, it should go without saying that there is plenty of work to be done by both Presidents. 
With over a billion people and a burgeoning economy undergoing a dramatic transformation from doctrinaire communism to market-driven capitalism, China undeniably is an emerging great power. How we deal with China will be one of the great foreign policy challenges of the next century. 
The forthcoming meeting with President Jiang Zemin is one of a series of important opportunities to advance our relations that will occur over the next several months. 
Today I want to outline some of the objectives that I think the United States should pursue during Jiang's visit, particularly in regard to one of the central issues in our relationship. 
The issues on the agenda are familiar. We have deep concerns about China's human rights record, its trade practices, and most important, from the perspective of international security, its lackluster record of adherence to nonproliferation agreements. 
It is unrealistic to assume that we will resolve all our differences next month, next year, or even over the next several years. 
I am convinced, however, that it is possible to build a mutually beneficial relationship with China. A rising China need not threaten United States interests. In fact, China cannot achieve the economic growth, international respect, and regional stability it seeks without a workable relationship with the United States and close, constructive, integration with global economic, political, and security regimes.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like now to speak very briefly, 8 minutes, to the issue of Bosnia. Last weekend, the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina went to the polls to elect their various municipal governments. I know the President has recently been to Bosnia, as I have. These local elections had been postponed from last year because of tampering with registration, chiefly by the Bosnian Serbs. 
But I am happy to report, and we have all observed, that this year's municipal elections were a success. Despite dire threats of violence against refugees and displaced persons who wanted to cross over to their former homes to vote, over 2 days, not one single incident of violence occurred in the entire country. 
Why? For a simple reason, I believe, Mr. President. Because of the presence of SFOR, the NATO-sponsored troops on the ground led by recently reinforced American troops. SFOR made clear to all parties that violence would not be tolerated and force would be met with force. 
Every single time over the past several years when the West has been forceful in its behavior, the ultranationalists in Bosnia, primarily the Serbs but all ultranationalists, have backed down--every single time. 
The elections were carried out by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the so-called OSCE, in which the United States is an active member, but only one of many. The OSCE observers deserve a great deal of credit for their successful labors. 
The results of the election will not be known for another couple of days. Already, however, some encouraging signs are emerging. In Tuzla, a place I have visited on more than one occasion, the Muslim Party for Democratic Action, the SDA, conceded defeat by Mayor Selim Beslagic, who represented not just the Muslim party but the multiethnic joint group that was running. 
I met the mayor last month. I met with him last month in Bosnia in Sarajevo. When I met with him, he indicated that he represents not just Muslims, but he represents this multiethnic slate and he represents just the kind, in my view, of democratic, tolerant, pragmatic politician that is going to be needed to rebuild Bosnia. But the point is, the controlling party in the area lost. The election was free. 
Until now, three ethnically based parties that profess to represent the interests of the Muslims, Serbs, and Croats have been dominating the airwaves and the patronage system. Tuzla, and perhaps other cities in both the federation and the Republika Srpska, show that if SFOR and the international community guarantee equal access, the monopoly of these parties on power can be broken. 
Moreover, Mr. President, I would argue it represents what I believe to be the majority view of Bosnian Serbs, Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims, who, I might add, lived together in peace for decades and decades prior to this and the majority of whom wish to do that again. But it shows that the monopoly of the parties that are representing purely the xenophobic notions of their particular interests are not necessarily the views of the people of Bosnia. 
Moreover, it is likely that, thanks to the absentee voting and the protection offered by SFOR for returning refugees, the election 
may reverse the vile ethnic cleansing of the war. For example, in the town of Drvar in western Herzegovina, it was 97 percent Serb until the town's inhabitants were driven out in the fall of 1995 by Croats. Last weekend, the Croats who displaced the Serbs did their best to harass returning Serb voters. International election officials from the OSCE, however, insisted the Serbs be allowed to vote, and it looks like there may be a turnaround in that community as well. 
Several other towns, like Jajce and Srebrenica, site of the largest civilian massacre in Europe since World War II, may see their former inhabitants, in these two cases Muslims, forming the governments in those two cities. 
The international community is now faced with the next--and this is an incremental thing, Mr. President--they are faced with the next stark question of whether now we will enforce the election results, whether we will now be part of that. 
I realize that is a dicey deal, but I continue to argue that when we demonstrated force, and given the power of the people in those communities, we, the Western community, have prevailed. 
So now the question is, will we enforce the results of the election by guaranteeing that the newly elected councils not remain governments in exile? Enforcing the election results, of course, means that the right of refugees and displaced persons to return must be honored, which Dayton calls for. In most cases, that would be able to be accomplished only by the international community being present and the presence of SFOR. 
Mr. President, I believe we have no choice in this matter. Both for moral and practical reasons, it seems to me we must move rapidly to enforce the resettlement of refugees as the results of the election will dictate. This will be a difficult task, and the time is short before the onset of the Balkan winter. Most likely we will have to begin with highly visible demonstration returns in one or two selected towns. But, Mr. President, we must keep the democratic momentum going. 
Rebuilding shattered Bosnia is an immense undertaking, and now, for the first time in years, there has been a string of successes. The United States has been the prime mover in these, although not the prime player in terms of numbers. We must continue to exert our leadership on the European Community, and we must continue the valuable and honorable work we have undertaken, for, Mr. President, to do otherwise, I will predict, the result will be disastrous for Europe, disastrous for our interests. 
I will end with a rhetorical question. How can we expect stability in Europe if the ethnic cleansing is able to be justified, and partitioning takes place? How do we then explain that to the other parts of the former Soviet Union who have equally deep divisions that exist? Mr. President, there are 5 million ethnic Russians in the Ukraine. There are 5 million of them. There are millions of people who have ethnic differences living throughout that area. How do we deal with Rumania and Hungary? If we say that this vile ethnic cleansing will be rewarded by us backing out and letting it return to the status quo, you know European leadership will not step up to the ball. Again, I want to make it clear, we play the smallest part relative to the rest of the world in this, in the sense that we are only a small portion of the overall effort, but the overall effort is occurring because of our leadership. 
So, Mr. President, I acknowledge that this is a dicey deal. I acknowledge that it is going to be difficult, but I would suggest that those who have a different view from me acknowledge that there have been recent successes that at least lend hope to the possibility that we can continue down this path. 
I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague. I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise this evening to comment on the tragic news from Bosnia. Earlier today, a U.N. helicopter carrying several international officials crashed 40 miles northwest of Sarajevo. Twelve people are reported dead and four injured. The latest reports indicate that on board were four or five Americans, still unidentified, who were working for the International Police Task Force and the Office of the High Representative for Bosnia. Among the dead was Gerd Wagner, the Senior Deputy High Representative for Bosnia. Ambassador Wagner was well known to many of us in the Congress, since before he took up his post this past summer he was the political counselor at the German Embassy in Washington.

Mr. BIDEN. Last weekend the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina went to the polls to elect municipal governments. These local elections had been postponed from last year because of tampering with registrations, chiefly by the Bosnian Serbs. 
I am happy to report, Mr. President, that this year's municipal elections were a success. Despite dire threats of violence against refugees and displaced persons who wanted to cross over to their former homes to vote, over 2 days not one single incident of serious violence occurred in the entire country. 
Why? Because SFOR, led by recently reinforced American troops, made clear to all parties that violence would not be tolerated. 
Every single time over the past several years when the West has been forceful in its behavior, the ultra-nationalists in Bosnia have backed down. 
The elections were carried out by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [OSCE], in which the United States is an active member. The OSCE deserves a great deal of credit for its successful labors. 
The results of the elections will not be known for several days. Already, however, some encouraging signs are emerging. In Tuzla, the Muslim Party for Democratic Action [SDA] conceded defeat by Mayor Selim Beslagic's multi-ethnic joint list. I met Mayor Beslagic last month. He represents just the kind of democratic, tolerant, pragmatic politician that can rebuild Bosnia. 
Until now the three ethnically based parties that profess to represent the interests of the Muslims, Serbs, and Croats have dominated the airwaves and the patronage system. Tuzla--and perhaps other cities in both the federation and the Republika Srprska--show that if SFOR and the international community guarantee equal access, their monopoly on power can be broken. 
Moreover, it is likely that thanks to absentee voting and to the protection offered by SFOR to returning refugees, the election may reverse the vile ethnic cleansing of the war. For example, the town of Drvar in western Herzegovina was 97 percent Serb until the town's inhabitants were driven out in the fall of 1995. Last weekend the Croats who displaced the Serbs did their best to harass returning Serb voters. International election officials from the OSCE, however, insisted that the Serbs be allowed to vote. 
Several other towns like Jajce and Srebrenica, site of the largest civilian massacre in Europe since World War II, may see their former inhabitants, in these two cases Muslims, forming the governments. 
The international community is now faced with the stark question of whether it will enforce the results of the elections by guaranteeing that the newly elected councils not remain governments in exile. 
Enforcing the election results, of course, means that the right of refugees and displaced persons to return must be honored. In most cases that would be able to be accomplished only by the international community under the protection of SFOR. 
Mr. President, I believe we have no choice in this matter. Both for moral and practical reasons we must move rapidly to enforce resettlement of refugees. This will be a difficult task, and time is short before the onset of the Balkan winter. Most likely we will have to begin with highly visible demonstration returns in one to two selected towns. But we must keep the democratic momentum going. 
Rebuilding shattered Bosnia is an immense undertaking. Now for the first time in years, there has been a string of successes. The United States has been the prime mover in these, and we must continue our valuable and honorable work. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to light recent events in Sierra Leone. This has been a challenging year for democracy on the African Continent, and no where has it been more seriously challenged than in this West African nation. On May 25, 1997, mutinous soldiers overthrew the democratically-elected government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. Lawlessness reigns throughout the country, as jail doors throughout Sierra Leone have been thrown wide, and judges and lawyers who once worked to ensure the rule of law have been forced to flee the country for their lives. 
Ironically, it was only a year and a half ago that Sierra Leone held its first multiparty elections in 30 years, resulting in the transfer of power from the military to the civilian government of President Kabbah. With the conclusion of Sierra Leone's 5-year civil war last November, Sierra Leone was hailed by many in Africa and the West as a model for other African nations. The bloody military coup d'etat that ousted President Kabbah almost 4 months ago is not only an affront to the expressed will of the people of Sierra Leone, but is a direct challenge to the cause of democracy in Africa. I strongly condemn this deplorable action, and call upon the military to return power to the democratically-elected government. 
Now, as a result of the spring coup, the Sierra Leone is largely isolated from the world. Foreign embassies have closed their doors. Foreign aid has been suspended. There is virtually no humanitarian assistance to speak of left in Sierra Leone. Every day that the military junta remains in power more men, women and children needlessly fall victim to senseless violence. 
Meanwhile, the military junta continues its rapacious looting of the country, oblivious to the dire consequences of its actions. Freetown, the capital city, without electricity, sits in darkness. Schools are closed. Most doctors have fled the country and hospitals have been looted. Those who have not already fled the country face both a dwindling food supply and the military leaders' seemingly abject disregard for human life. 
Mr. President, Sierra Leone's West African neighbors have courageously taken the lead in responding to this humanitarian crisis. Upon the outbreak of the coup, regional leaders quickly condemned the coup and imposed regional sanctions. At a recent meeting of West African heads of state those who called for the use of force to end the standoff were resisted, and it was resolved to strengthen the sanctions regime already in place. 
I strongly commend this decision. Although attempts at negotiation with the junta in July were unsuccessful, I strongly believe that the successful road to peace and stability in Sierra Leone leads to the negotiating table instead of the battlefield. Sanctions must be given more time to pressure the military junta to give up its quixotic lust for power. 
While the United States was among the first to condemn the coup, I urge our Government to continue to seek every opportunity to publicly support democracy in Sierra Leone. Those who would subvert the will of the people in Sierra Leone should have no illusion about the United States position. 
The United Nations has already added its voice to international condemnation of the military junta in Freetown. Moreover, the Secretary-General has just appointed a special envoy to Sierra Leone in an attempt to resolve the crisis. I applaud these efforts. I urge the administration to use its influence at the United Nations to initiate a multilateral effort to severely restrict the military junta's ability to purchase arms and fuel. At the same time, I believe it is necessary to try to find a way to address the humanitarian needs of the innocent. 
Mr. President, these are very troubled days for democracy in Africa. Although democracy is beginning to blossom in other parts of the world since the end of the cold war, it has yet to firmly take root in the fertile soil of many African nations. 
Mr. President, as the rest of the world moves toward integration into the global economy, embracing democracy and liberal economic principles, we must not leave Africa behind. It is imperative that we who have fought for our own freedom, and who enjoy the fruits that democracy offer, continue to support others in their fight for the same. I thank the chair and yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, a generation ago, President John F. Kennedy called for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. President Kennedy's visionary appeal met with modest but important success: the treaty banning nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and underwater. 
One year ago today, the world community took a major step toward fulfilling President Kennedy's vision. With the United States once again in the lead, the U.N. General Assembly voted 158 to 3, with 5 abstentions, to endorse the so-called CTBT, drafted by the U.N. Conference On Disarmament. Two weeks later, all the declared nuclear powers signed that treaty. 
Soon this treaty will be submitted to the U.S. Senate for our advice and our consent to ratification. Much work is needed to educate this body and to assure us that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will be effectively verifiable and will not undermine nuclear deterrence. But it is time to begin that effort, and I welcome the administration's commitment to do so. 
The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will not enter into force for some time. This is because all nuclear-capable States must ratify this treaty before it can enter into force, at least during the next 3 years, and India has refused to do that--although I am given to understand that the President will be traveling there, to try to change that view on the part of the Indian Government. 
Timely U.S. ratification is still needed, however, to prevent the CTBT from becoming a dead letter and to maintain the pressure on all states not to test a nuclear device. The 144 states that signed the CTBT are largely bound not to undermine it, even before it enters into force. But nonnuclear states will feel little obligation to ratify or obey a test ban if the powers with admitted nuclear weapons programs fail to ratify it themselves. 
A comprehensive ban on nuclear testing is no minor matter. This is not your father's arms control agreement, Mr. President. You remember that old commercial--I know, the old automobile man that my father was--`this isn't your father's Oldsmobile.' This is not your standard arms control agreement, merely codifying actions already planned by the two superpowers, which most of our arms control agreements were. This treaty will pinch, it will hurt; but the CTBT will pinch other countries far more than it pinches us, and the world will be a safer place for that. 
There is always a risk, of course, that a State Party--a fancy foreign policy phrase for another country--will violate this test ban treaty rather than do without nuclear testing. Last month's so-called--it's amazing the phrases we use--`seismic event' at or near the Russian nuclear test site of Novaya Zemlya is a timely reminder that arms control compliance can be assured only through effective verification. 
Article 4 of the test ban treaty and the treaty's accompanying protocol do include, in fact, some very welcome verification provisions. An international monitoring system will combine seismic, radionuclide, hydroacoustic and infrasound monitoring. This monitoring system will provide States Parties with both raw and processed data, as well as with analyses of those data. 
Article 4 requires prompt clarification by States Parties in `any matter which may cause concern about possible noncompliance with the basic obligations of the treaty.' 
In addition, the United States, if supported by 29 of the 50 other members of the Organization's Executive Council, will be able to force a truly extensive onsite inspection by the CTBT Organization's Technical Secretariat. We would be in a much stronger position to investigate last month's possible Russian explosion if the CTBT were in effect and Russia were required, as a consequence of that, to accept onsite inspections. 
Verification of this treaty will not be cheap, and the United States will be expected to help other countries participate in seismic monitoring, in particular. We have provided such assistance for many years, for a simple reason: not out of our generosity and our charitable instinct, but because it is in our naked self-interest, it is in our national interest, both to monitor nuclear tests by other countries and to obtain timely and accurate data on earthquakes. 
It is important to keep up this effort, whether we eventually ratify the CTBT or not, and I urge my colleagues, as an afterthought here, to support full funding of the international monitoring systems that I am talking about. 
How will this treaty really pinch--I mentioned that at the outset--assuming that the verification provisions deter any violations? For the five countries with a history of nuclear testing, among which we are one, the CTBT will mean an end to that testing. We, and other declared nuclear powers, will need to use other means in order to ensure that our nuclear weapons are safe and are in working order, or to modify those weapons in any way. 
Let me explain the meaning of that. Most people say, `Why don't you have to worry about testing anymore? A nation like ours wouldn't want to test in any circumstance.' To raise a legitimate point raised by others who don't support this treaty, however, in order to ensure that our nuclear arsenal is accurate and working and functioning, you occasionally have to test it, you occasionally have to know what you have. You can't just let it sit there and let the components of it sit there for 20, 30, 40, 50 years and not test it, and still have confidence in its deterrent capacity. That is the reason why even nations like ours that do not have any desire to increase their nuclear capacity, that want to reduce nuclear weapons, might still want to be able to test. 
In our country, the Department of Energy plans to use tests that do not actually cause a nuclear explosion, known as subcritical experiments, as well as computer analyses and simulations to assure the safety, reliability, and effectiveness of U.S. nuclear weapons. Ground was broken just last month for a billion-dollar National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California to do some of that very work. One hoped-for side benefit is further progress toward controlled fusion, an important potential power source for the next century. 
Many of my colleagues question whether this Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program, as it is referred to, will suffice in the absence of nuclear testing. The Energy Department, where the scientists and experts are, says `yes,' while opponents of arms control say `no.' 
I say nobody knows for sure. We can't guarantee that stockpile stewardship will work because this is a new scientific frontier. But the executive branch must take stockpile stewardship--that is, those tests other than actually exploding nuclear devices--seriously, and we must--we must--fund it appropriately, in my view. Senator Domenici has warned that the current funding plan is insufficient for that job. I hope and expect that the administration will take that concern to heart and not just blow smoke at it. 
Mr. President, even if we were not going to sign a test ban treaty, it should be very much in America's interest for us not to test nuclear weapons if we have an alternative that can guarantee the safety, stability, security, and usability of our nuclear stockpile. So, for whatever the reasons, even unrelated to this treaty, it makes sense to follow the admonition of Senator Domenici and give the Energy Department the resources it needs to maximize the chances that the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program will suffice in the absence of nuclear testing. 
Stockpile stewardship, Mr. President, is an opportunity, however, not just a challenge. It is precisely this sort of high-technology activity at which the United States excels. Recent press stories on our improved earth-penetrating nuclear bomb make clear that the United States is capable of maintaining nuclear capabilities, even without nuclear testing, that other countries can only dream of. The truth is that we may well extend our nuclear advantage in a test-free world. 
So let me be clear about this. I do not think we are seeking any greater advantage in nuclear weapons, over other countries in the world, but if we, in fact, move all the acknowledged nations and those we think have nuclear capacity and nuclear weapons to enter into this treaty, then there will be no more testing. 
You hear opponents say, `Well, that will put us at a competitive disadvantage in terms of our nuclear capacity.' My argument would be if the verification is real, which it is in this treaty, we are potentially at a competitive advantage because we would be able to continue to develop and assure the capacity of our nuclear stockpiles and capabilities--thanks to our testing capacity, our ability to measure their utility absent an actual nuclear explosion. 
So this is an argument that I know we will engage in, but I would just like to lay a marker down now. I think our security is enhanced and our capability can be enhanced with this treaty in place. 
But we will not be so likely to develop a whole new generation of nuclear weapons, and that is important. Why? Because there is a deal here between the nuclear weapons `haves' and the nuclear weapons `have-not' states. For the vast majority of countries, those that have never tested nuclear weapons, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will greatly impede any efforts on their part to develop nuclear weapons, but it will also reassure those countries that the nuclear powers will be much more limited in their development of still newer weapon designs. 
Mr. President, think about it. If you are a developing country and you are late into the game of nuclear weapons, you are asked to say, `OK, these other guys got theirs, we don't have ours yet, but let's make sure no one can test any more so that we, in fact, can never develop nuclear weapons.' Well, you sit there and say, `Wait a minute, the other guys have these things, they have these weapons and the only way they developed them is they tested them. Now you are telling us we can never test them, which is synonymous to saying we can never have them.' 
OK, in order for them to give up that, because they then are locked into this inferior status in terms of nuclear capability, we have to give something to them. What they get in return for this is that, although we will maintain that capacity and be able to maintain it without testing, none of the nations of the world will be able to move to whole new generations of those nuclear weapons, which is some reassurance to a nation that knows the argument that I made to such countries and their leaders, which is, `Look, you can never catch up, you can never get ahead of the curve; you may get nuclear weapons, but you're never going to get to the point in your lifetime or the lifetime of your children where you are going to be able to match the capacity of the nuclear powers. So isn't it better for us to freeze or to builddown, in effect, to use an expression that Bill Cohen used to push years ago during the arms control debates of the late seventies and early eighties?' 
How will this test ban impede other countries' nuclear weapons programs? We hope to maintain our nuclear weapons without further testing and non-nuclear powers might hope similarly to develop or obtain nuclear weapons without ever testing them. But developing a new weapon without testing is risky, especially for a country with no experience in nuclear weapons; after all, even the advanced nuclear powers have test failures. 
Military leaders are hardly eager to go into battle with untested weapons, Mr. President. In fact, they get downright cranky about that, and once they start questioning the reliability of their weapons, they begin to think more about the dangers that come with war than about the glory of it all. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty thus may limit the progress that we and other nuclear powers can make in further developments of nuclear weapons, but its greatest benefit will be in nonproliferation by foreclosing nuclear weapons from many countries and making it difficult for new entrants even to approach the sophistication of our existing nuclear weapons. 
The power of the CTBT as a nonproliferation tool explains why Pakistan was unwilling to sign the CTBT if it could enter into force without India's ratification. If their nuclear weapons program is going to be hobbled, they want India to be hobbled as well. And the CTBT's likely effectiveness is probably also a real reason why India has been unwilling to sign the treaty at all. Both of those countries have rudimentary nuclear weapons capabilities, but they know that a ban on testing, which may eventually come into force despite India's objections, will severely hamper their ability to develop those devices into a stable of weapons that they can count on in a real war. 
Just as India and Pakistan appreciate CTBT's power to hamper the development of nuclear weapons, so should we. We rightly value the stability that mutual deterrence has brought us over the last 50 years. That is why we want reassurance that `stockpile stewardship' will be adequately funded and that the experts expect it to succeed. 
But the gravest threat to security of our Nation, Mr. President, may not be from Russian or Chinese missiles, but rather from nuclear weapons in the hands of others--Iraq, Iran, Libya, or North Korea, just to name a few, or even terrorist groups that a rogue state might befriend. 
The biggest risk of nuclear weapons actually being used may not be against us, against Russia or even against Taiwan, but rather by India and Pakistan against innocent civilians in the teeming cities which are within range of each country's bombers or shorter range missiles. 
With U.S. leadership in ratifying this treaty, the CTBT will gain near unanimous international support and keep pressure on India and any like-minded countries to ratify it--or at least to refrain from testing. A comprehensive test ban, once in force, will reduce substantially the threats of regional nuclear wars or terrorist acquisition of nuclear weapons. And that is reason enough, Mr. President, in my view, to support ratification. 
But, Mr. President, as I have said, serious observers are sincerely divided over whether the United States will be able to maintain nuclear deterrence without nuclear testing. Achieving the Senate's advice and consent to ratification depends, therefore, in my opinion, upon careful and intensive education both of the public and of this body, myself included. It is time for the administration to begin the sustained effort that will be required to assure that 67 U.S. Senators will feel that this CTBT is in our national interest. 
The world in which we live today, Mr. President, is, as I said before, not your father's cold war. But there has been no end of history as has been prophesied. Neither will there be any end of arms control. Already this year the Senate has acted on the Chemical Weapons Convention and the `Flank Document' to the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe, referred to as CFE. Measures awaiting Senate action include: the Convention on Nuclear Safety; protocols to the Convention on Conventional Weapons on undetectable landmines, blinding lasers, and incendiaries; and two treaties to establish nuclear-free zones. 
Over the next 2 years, the executive branch will likely submit to the Senate a START III treaty, an extension of the START II weapons destruction deadlines, an amendment or protocol making START I a permanent treaty, a CFE adaptation agreement, a succession memorandum and demarcation agreement regarding the ABM treaty, a new safeguards protocol between the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency, a nuclear liability convention, a nuclear waste convention, and a verification protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention. 
Given that lengthy agenda, Mr. President, I am not in a position to say that the CTBT must be taken up as the next item for the Senate's attention. Indeed, I hope we will approve some of these less controversial measures--such as the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the protocols to the Convention on Conventional Weapons, and a new safeguards protocol with the International Atomic Energy Agency--before we bring this issue to the floor. 
But that need not stop the administration from submitting this treaty and beginning the work of educating us as to its merits. Chairman Helms and I have shown that the Foreign Relations Committee can get things done, and I am confident that we will secure agreement on many more issues, hard ones as well as the easier ones. 
The time has come, Mr. President, to move ahead on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, as well as other arms control initiatives and NATO enlargement. The end of the cold war has made all these both possible and--I would emphasize--also necessary. This is an ambitious agenda for the Senate in the field of foreign relations, and the issues will be difficult. 
But we represent the citizens of the world's greatest country. Or, the best phrase I have heard in my 25 years here to describe us is President Clinton's phrase. He said, we are the `essential nation.' We are the `essential nation.' We represent the citizens of the essential nation. We are charged with the historic task of making the world a safer place for coming generations--not through war, but through fashioning of durable agreements and institutions. We must not--and I am sure we will not--flinch at that challenge. 
This is a rare opportunity that you and I have, to serve at a time when we are setting down a whole new institutional framework for the conduct of world affairs. It has not happened in 50 years; it is happening now. I pray we are as wise as our fathers and grandfathers and grandmothers and mothers were when they did the job at the end of World War II. 
I thank the Chair for its indulgence and for listening to me. I appreciate it very much. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, having just returned from a trip to Bosnia, I would like to describe my impressions and offer my views on American policy there, if I may. 
As many of my colleagues will remember, and some would rather not remember, over the last 6 1/2 years I have been bipartisan in my criticism and my critical statements about our policy toward the states of the former Yugoslavia. I began criticizing the Bush administration early in 1991 and continued to criticize the Clinton administration until September of 1995 when it finally carried out the airstrikes that I had called for 3 years earlier and subsequently lifted the immoral and illegal arms embargo on Bosnia as part of the Dayton accords. 
Now, Mr. President, for the first time I find myself in general agreement with the direction of American policy. My change of opinion does not, however, reflect either complete satisfaction or complacency. We have reached a very critical point in our policy toward Bosnia, Mr. President, as all of my colleagues know. Resolute American action, combined with allied support and local compliance, can turn the corner. But I respectfully suggest, absent any one of those factors--resolute American action, combined with allied support and local compliance--we will not only not turn the corner; I believe we will return to the genocide and chaos that prevailed 6 years ago. 
To that end, we can, Mr. President, and we must, in my opinion, act decisively to bring indicted war criminals to trial before the International Tribunal in the Hague. 
We can, and must, Mr. President, induce the authorities in the Federation and the Republika Srpska to greatly expand the number of refugees returning to their prewar homes. 
We can and must, Mr. President, ensure that the countrywide municipal elections in mid-September and the parliamentary elections in the Republika Srpska in October, are held and that they are free and fair. 
We can and must, Mr. President, guarantee free access to electronic media for all points of view in both the Federation and the Republika Srpska. I hope that the agreement on the television transmitter reached yesterday with the Karadzic forces is a move in that direction. If they go back on the bargain, SFOR troops should reoccupy that transmitter and take it back. 
We can and must continue to support the Republika Srpska's President Biljana Plavsic in her struggle against indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic. 
We can and must, Mr. President, ensure that the decision of the arbitrator on Brcko in March 1998 is accepted peacefully. 
In short, Mr. President, a lot remains to be accomplished in the coming months. But it is critically important for the American people and for my colleagues in the Congress to be clear on one fundamental point: Contrary to what is frequently stated, there has been progress on the civilian provisions of the Dayton accords, as well as on the well-publicized military side of the equation. 
To guarantee that this progress continues and expands, the international community must not withdraw its entire military stabilization force after June 1998. The negative consequences of backsliding into renewed warfare in Bosnia would far outweigh the cost of a continued, if scaled-down commitment with no or much fewer American troops. 
Let me then, Mr. President, discuss the current situation in Bosnia. First, the war criminals issue. The type of operation carried out in Prijedor in July in which British and Czech SFOR troops, supported by American forces, captured one indicted criminal and killed another indicted war criminal after being fired upon, must be repeated against Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic. 
After conversations with leading American military officers in Bosnia, I am confident that such an operation is feasible. No American wishes casualties to occur, but if all other means fail, force must be employed and risk taken in order to arrest these war criminals. I am confident that the opportunity will present itself, and if it is seized upon, the operation will succeed. 
Moreover, I suspect that after an initial angry response, most people in the Republika Srpska would be content to go about improving their impoverished lives, relieved of the plague of the authoritarian extortionists in Pale. Apprehension of the war criminals will not be a panacea for Bosnia's ills, but in my view it is a necessary precondition for the Dayton accords to have a chance of continuing to work. 
I met with opposition leaders in the Republika Srpska. I met for well over an hour with President Plavsic. I met with a Russian military commander. I met with the American military. I met with the French military. In fact, I met with most of the major players in Bosnia during the time I was there. There is not anyone who will privately tell you that Karadzic and Mladic on the loose and continuing to run the Republika Srpska does anything, anything at all positive. As a matter of fact, all will tell you privately, and most will tell you publicly, that these two must be withdrawn from the scene. They will say it in different ways. They will say, `withdrawn, captured, tried and convicted,' or they will say `driven out of the country.' 
But the bottom line is that nobody believes there is any possibility of the Dayton accords being fully implemented if, in fact, the most notorious of the war criminals continue to run the Republika Srpska like a thug operation, undermining free elections in the Republika Srpska within Bosnia and undermining Mrs. Plavsic. Now Mrs. Plavsic is no shrinking violet, is clearly a nationalist, and is not someone we would choose if we could invent a President for the Republika Srpska. But she is, at a minimum, honest and not running the rackets. She has greatly undermined Mr. Karadzic's power by pointing out the corruption he has engaged in and how he is literally robbing the people of the Republika Srpska. 
There is still 90 percent unemployment there. At least in the Federation it has dropped from 90 percent to 50 percent. As I will discuss in a moment, there is progress being made in the Federation, slow as it may be, but there is a gigantic impediment in the Republika Srpska, and his name is Karadzic, an indicted war criminal. I have met him in the past. I told him more than 4 years ago that he was--I will not precisely repeat what I said--but I said bluntly to his face that he was a war criminal and should be tried as one. He looked at me and resumed talking as if he were saying, `Lots of luck in your senior year. No problem; thanks for talking to me.' This guy is a madman, and he is undermining the prospects of any peace for the people of Bosnia--Serb, Croat, or Muslim alike. 
Over the last year, the government of the Federation, comprised mainly of Muslims and Croats, has slowly begun to take meaningful shape. New national, entity, and cantonal governments were chosen in the September 1996 elections and are starting to function. The Bosnian Presidency and the council of ministers meet in regular sessions. 
In Sarajevo, I had a lengthy discussion with Kresimir Zubak, the Co-President of the National Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with many leading figures in the Federation administration and the Cabinet, and with nonnationalist Muslim and Croat opposition leaders. 
No one attempted to gloss over the friction that persists, Mr. President. As a matter of fact, I invited a group--and I will submit the list of people we invited--of leading Muslims, Croats, and Serbs to a dinner the first night I arrived. The first comment made by, I think, Federation Vice President Ejup Ganic, a Muslim, was `Senator, we have not sat down at a table like this for 6 years. You have accomplished something all by itself just by getting 15 of us to show up.' 
I do not want to paint a picture here that things in the Federation are rosy and wonderful. They are not. But everybody agreed on two things: First, enormous progress was being made in the Federation; and second, it is absolutely essential for the international military force to remain in Bosnia after June 1998 to guarantee that progress will continue. 
I made clear that a partnership is a two-way street. Politicians from all three principal religious groups in Bosnia must make redoubled efforts to carry out the terms of the Dayton accords, especially the return of refugees. 
As Americans see evidence of increased success in civilian implementation, our willingness to stay the course in Bosnia will increase accordingly. 
And, Mr. President, there is much evidence to support the view that positive change is already occurring. Approximately 150,000 refugees have returned to Bosnia from abroad and another 160,000 internally displaced persons have returned to their homes, including a few to areas where they will be a distinct minority. 
Meanwhile, the Train and Equip Program, led by private American military instructors, retired military, is molding a Muslim-Croat defense force for the Government of Bosnia guaranteeing the Federation's security in the future. Agreements on the Federation force structure and command have been reached, and over 300 million dollars' worth of military equipment has been procured. 
Remember, Mr. President, the big problem was initially that we could not get the Muslim and the Croats in the Federation to agree to a joint military command. They would not train together. Now we have a joint military command. Muslims and Croats are sitting in the same classrooms. The officer corps and the enlisted men are all training together. There has been solid progress. 
In Hadzici, west of Sarajevo, I visited the headquarters of the Train and Equip Program and spoke with the Federation's Minister of Defense and his deputy, with the commanders of the Muslim and Croat forces, and with soldiers of both armies. The cooperation is excellent, and their American trainers had high praise for their eagerness to learn and their aptitude. 
In the Federation, joint police forces are being formed, including in the city of Mostar, site of the worst warfare between Muslim and Croats. 
Within the framework of this modicum of stability, the economy is beginning to revive. Real gross domestic product has nearly doubled since 1995. As I mentioned, unemployment has dropped from 90 percent to 50 percent. Corruption, though, remains a major problem. 
Nonetheless, if there is continued security, political progress, and international technical and financial assistance, the Federation, I believe, can be a going concern within a few years. 
One of the nonnational opposition leaders with whom I met, Stjepan Kljujic, an ethnic Croat, offered the opinion that the Federation had to be better than the Republika Srpska politically, economically, and morally. Making an intriguing historical parallel, he continued that the Federation should become Bosnia's West Germany against the Republika Srpska's East Germany, even attracting guest workers from the latter as the economic disparity between the two entities widens. In this way, he felt, the two halves of the country could eventually grow together. 
Whatever the validity of this vision, conditions in the Republika Srpska are already quite different from those in the 
Federation because of Mr. Karadzic's heavy hand. The Bosnian Serb member of the tripartite Presidency, Momcilo Krajisnik, an ally of Karadzic, has refused all but minimal fulfillment of the Dayton provisions. As a result, the international community has withheld most of its development aid from the Republika Srpska. 
The economy there remains in shambles with less than 10 percent of the work force gainfully employed. In the midst of this misery, Dr. Karadzic--it is hard to even call him a doctor, but he is a doctor--and his cronies ostentatiously flaunt the wealth they have amassed through smuggling and protection rackets. 
It is no wonder, then, that Mrs. Plavsic's anticorruption message has struck a chord with wide segments of the population in the Republika Srpska. I met with her for an hour and a half in Banja Luka. We must not have any illusions that President Plavsic, who loudly supported Serbian ultranationalists and ethnic cleansing during the war, has suddenly become a Jeffersonian Democrat. She is, however, a realist who understands that the Bosnian Serb entity is in danger of total disintegration unless it rids itself of the lawlessness, corruption, and warped religious hatred of the Karadzic gang and begins to cooperates with the West. 
In all likelihood, by seizing the Banja Luka police headquarters, SFOR prevented a coup d'etat against Mrs. Plavsic last month. Our support of her police forces and television journalists may be turning the tide against the thugs in Pale, at least in the western part of the Republika Srpska. 
Since two-thirds of the population of the Republika Srpska lives in the western part of the entity, there is a good possibility that President Plavsic's supporters can win control of the Parliament in next month's election. If that occurs, we should be able to leverage the promise of reconstruction assistance to induce President Plavsic to begin to cooperate on refugee returns. 
Moreover, a lively antinationalist Serbian opposition exists in the Republika Srpska. In Banja Luka, I met with three of its leaders--Miodrag Zivanovic, Mladen Ivanic, and Milorad Dodik. They feel that democracy is unstoppable and that Mrs. Plavsic, of whom they have been sworn enemies, is only a transitional figure whom they will support during this election as a step toward genuine democracy. 
Actually, the beginnings of refugee returns are already occurring, including some into areas controlled by other religious groups. I visited two such sites, one in the zone of separation near the critical northern town of Brcko, the other in Vogosca, a suburb of Sarajevo which was returned to the Federation as part of the Dayton settlement. 
In the Brcko area, rebuilding is proceeding under the skillful direction of the U.S. supervisor, Ambassador Bill Farrand, and the protection of the local American SFOR contingent, based nearby in Camp McGovern. I might add that I was amazed at how high the morale was in Camp McGovern and how greatly impressed I was by Brig. Gen. Mark Curran and Lt. Col. Bill Greer, the two senior officers, who were doing a phenomenal job there. 
Hostility in Brcko lies just below the surface, as shown by the riots organized by Karadzic loyalists less than 2 days after I left the city. The soldiers from Camp McGovern handled that potentially explosive situation with consummate professionalism, and I am confident they will continue to do so. 
I will digress briefly at this point, Mr. President, to mention that an important feature of SFOR are the Russian troops under the command of General Clark, the SACEUR, the [Supreme Allied Commander Europe]. At Camp McGovern, I met with the commanding officer of the Russian SFOR airborne brigade who was enthusiastic about the cooperation with our forces and totally supportive of our action. 
To return to refugee resettlement, unlike the palpable hostility in Brcko, in the Sarajevo suburb the situation was peaceful. There I saw Muslims, Croats, and one or two Serbs who were returning to rebuild their devastated homes under an imaginative program run by the United States Agency for International Development in cooperation with Catholic Relief Services. 
Mr. President, it is worth underscoring here that not only are our magnificent Armed Forces under the inspired command of Gen. Eric Shinseki playing the largest single role in SFOR, but our United States Government development specialists have won universal respect among the Bosnians for being the international community's most efficient providers of assistance. 
As a matter of fact, one of the Bosnian Serb opposition leaders said to me in Banja Luka that the Europeans are incapable of solving Bosnia s problems. By way of contrast he characterized the Americans as `not always sensitive but very efficient.' That is just what I would like us to be--`not always sensitive but very efficient.' 
In summation, where do I see Bosnia and Herzegovina heading if the United States and our allies stay the course? Personally, I would like to see a multi-ethnic, multireligious society re-emerge like the one that existed in Sarajevo before the war. I fear, however, that too much blood has been shed and too many atrocities committed for that to happen in the near future. 
More realistic, and politically feasible, is the development of a multi-ethnic state, most likely in the form of a confederation with a good degree of decentralization. 
My sense from this trip is that the ardor has cooled in the Republika Srpska for union with Serbia, since President Milosevic is regarded as a betrayer of the Serb cause and as a figure totally incapable of providing the basic material prosperity that the Bosnian Serbs so desperately crave. 
Unreconstructed Croat nationalists in Herzegovina may still long for union with Croatia, but as the leadership changes in Zagreb, the new government there will be more intent on integrating with Western Europe than on annexing provincial bandits. 
In short, for the first time in years, developments are moving in the right direction. As I have outlined, much hard political and economic work remains to be done, most of it by the Bosnians themselves. The United States and its allies can, and must, provide the framework for the Dayton accords to be fully implemented. 
I do not minimize the cost to the American taxpayer of our efforts. Neither, however, can I underestimate the cost of a failure of the Bosnian operation. In the near future, I will indicate in some detail what I think the costs would be to the United States if, in fact, Bosnia were to erupt once again. Suffice it to say now that not only would all that has been accomplished go up in smoke as fighting reignited, but a failure in Bosnia would signal the beginning of the end for NATO, which is currently restructuring itself to meet Bosnia-like challenges in the 21st century. 
Therefore, I call upon the Clinton administration immediately to begin discussions with our allies about creating a post-SFOR force after June 1998. For months, I recommended a combined joint task force with our allies, which the Senate overwhelmingly advocated in July in the 1998 defense authorization Bill. 
The question of whether American participation in a post-SFOR force will be limited to air, naval, intelligence, and communications support with a rapid deployment force in reserve in Hungary, or also might include a greatly reduced ground contingent can be resolved in these negotiations. 
The immediate priority is to begin the negotiations now--to make clear to all parties in Bosnia that, if they cooperate, the security framework will continue for a limited time--and to make clear to the skeptics that the new NATO can and will be the driving force in the European security architecture of the 21st century. 
I thank my colleague from Arizona for his indulgence. I thank the President for the time. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to address a great human tragedy silently unfolding in North Korea and the urgent need for the United States to respond. 
The North is experiencing a severe famine and has asked the world for help. Pyongyang has gratefully acknowledged our past assistance. It is in our interest to respond generously to their plight.

Mr. BIDEN. The United States has a long tradition of responding generously to people in need. By sharing our bounty we have saved millions in Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Angola. 
To date, however, our response to North Korea's famine has been cautious and inadequate. 
Over the past 12 months, the United States has provided a total of about $60 million in food aid, including the recent announcement of $27.4 million for 100,000 metric tons of grain. 
The world, following our restrained lead, has been slow to meet the genuine emergency needs of the North Korean people. According to the World Food Program, the North began 1997 roughly 2 million tons of grain short of what it would need to avoid famine. But as of July 1, the North had received a total of only about 423,000 tons of food aid, It had managed to purchase or barter another 330,000 tons, leaving a shortfall of more than 1 million tons for the remainder of the calendar year. 
The United States has never linked politics with emergency food assistance, and we should not do so now. 
We can do more. 
And we should do more to avert mass starvation and the incumbent risk of political and military instability of the Korean peninsula.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, earlier this month in Madrid the North Atlantic Treaty Organization held a momentous summit meeting, which brought together the heads of state and government of its 16-member countries to discuss the future of the Alliance in the 21st century. 
Mr. President, I was privileged to be a member of a bipartisan, bicameral Congressional delegation to the summit meeting. Today, I would like to discuss the results of Madrid and their important implications for American foreign policy. 
At Madrid, NATO took the historic step of inviting Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary to begin accession talks with the alliance. 
The alliance now has several pressing priorities as a followup to the summit. 
As its first priority, NATO must complete these accession talks this fall with the three prospective new members. Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary have all met the basic alliance membership requirements--democracy, civilian control of the military, the rule of law, no conflicts with neighbors, and the willingness and ability to assume alliance responsibilities. 
NATO and the candidates must now assess the military capabilities of each of the three in detail, and must plainly state each country's responsibilities and tasks within the alliance. 
Of particular importance is that the issues of cost of enlargment must be forthrightly addressed, both by the three prospective members and by all the current members of the alliance. 
The goal is to successfully conclude the talks with Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary in time for the Protocol of Accession to be signed at the NATO ministerial meeting in December of this year. The next step is for each of the 16 current NATO members to begin the process of ratification of amending the Washington treaty. Of course, Mr. President, according to our constitution, it is the U.S. Senate that is responsible for advice and consent to treaties, and we anticipate that we will consider the NATO enlargement treaty amendment next spring. 
NATO's second major priority after Madrid is developing a strengthened cooperative relationship with those countries that were not invited to be in the first group of new members. At Madrid, NATO re-emphasized an `Open Door' policy by which the first group of invited countries will not be the last. Additional candidacies will be considered, beginning with the next NATO summit, to be held here in Washington in April 1999 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the alliance. 
In an important gesture, the Madrid summit communique singled out for special mention the positive developments toward democracy and the rule of law in Slovenia and Romania. As many of my colleagues will remember, I was a strong advocate of Slovenia's being included in the first group of new members. 
I anticipate that both Slovenia and Romania, and perhaps other countries, will be invited to accession talks with NATO in 1999. 
In addition, in a thinly veiled bow to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, the Madrid summit communique reiterated conditions set forth in NATO's 1995 study whereby no European democratic country will be excluded from consideration for membership because of its geographic location. 
Translated into real English that means that NATO will not allow Moscow to give the three Baltic states a double whammy. 
In other words, the Soviet Union's illegal, forcible incorporation of the Baltic states in 1940--which, I am proud to say, was never recognized by the United States--will not be used as a pretext to veto their consideration for NATO membership. 
Mr. President, Ukraine, with an area and population the size of France, is arguably the most strategically important country in East-Central Europe. At Madrid, NATO and Ukraine signed a Charter on a Distinctive Partnership. Ukraine is currently not seeking NATO membership, but under President Kuchma (KOOCH-ma) it has undertaken democratic and free-market reforms in an attempt to move closer to the West. This charter should reinforce this trend. 
In order to keep the enlargement momentum going in the countries not yet ready for membership, a new Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council was inaugurated at Madrid. This body will direct an enhanced Partnership for Peace Program--a program involving more than two dozen countries, which, incidentally, has already far exceeded our most optimistic expectations. 
Of vital importance to the new security architecture in Europe is NATO's new relationship with the Russian Federation. Based on the Founding Act between NATO and Russia, that new relationship has begun to take shape. 
The permanent joint council, whose consultative functions are outlined in the Founding Act, recently held a preliminary meeting, and more are planned for the autumn. 
Rather than being a rival for to the North Atlantic Council, as some critics have asserted, the permanent joint council will be a proving ground where Russia can show its intention to cooperate in a positive spirit with the West. 
I hope and expect that it will act in this manner. If, however, Moscow chooses the old path of propaganda and confrontation, then the permanent joint council will atrophy. But, I re-emphasize, in no way will the permanent joint council usurp the leading role in NATO played by the North Atlantic Council. 
The third and final immediate priority for NATO after the Madrid summit is to finalize the internal adaptation of the alliance. This, Mr. President, is a complex and crucially important issue. 
Beginning in 1991, NATO approved a new strategic concept, which moved beyond the cold war focus on collective defense and toward more diverse tasks in a global context. In order to carry out these new tasks, the new strategic concept emphasized the need for NATO to achieve an effective force projection capability. 
At the January 1994 Brussels summit, NATO agreed to set up a more flexible set of options for organizing and conducting military operations. This goal was, and is, to be achieved through the mechanism of the combined joint task force, known by its acronym CJTF. Although there has been considerable disagreement between the United States and France as to the theoretical details of how the CJTF is to be controlled, in practice both the IFOR and SFOR operations in Bosnia have been unofficial combined joint task forces under NATO command and control. 
Mr. President, I am going into this level of detail because, as I will discuss shortly, the question of post-SFOR Bosnia is inextricably tied in with the ratification of NATO enlargement. 
Another aspect of NATO's internal adaptation concerns reforms in the alliance's command structure. At the June 1996 ministerial meeting in Berlin, NATO agreed that a European security and defense identity--known by its initials ESDI--would be created within the framework of the alliance by allowing European officers to wear a Western European Union [WEU] command hat as well as their NATO hat. 
As part of the restructuring, NATO has already reduced the number of its strategic commands from three to two, and it is also planning to reduce the number of major subordinate commands. It is at this intersection of ESDI and command structure, Mr. President, that the expressed interests of France and the United States have collided. 
The French want to have a European officer take over from an American as Commander of Armed Forces South [AFSOUTH] in Naples. We have rejected this proposal since it would impact upon our Sixth Fleet, even if the Fleet would formally remain under American command. Until now, the dispute remains unresolved, but at Madrid the French agreed to keep talking. In any event, disagreements over internal adaptation will not threaten the enlargement process. 
Mr. President, having been privileged to have been at Madrid and having followed the immediate follow-up to the summit, I find my belief reinforced that NATO is on the right track. There remain, however, two challenges, which if not satisfactorily met, could well torpedo ratification of NATO enlargement by this body. They are, first, burdensharing and, second, post-SFOR Bosnia. 
The first challenge is an existential one for NATO. The heads of state and government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Madrid directed the Council to `bring to an early conclusion the concrete analysis of the resource implications of the forthcoming enlargement.' The coming months will see serious discussion and study on the actual costs of enlargement. 
The Pentagon Report to the Congress in February 1997 was an excellent starting point. Personally, I find its methodology and conclusions convincing, but they have already been challenged by some of our European NATO partners. On other occasions I have discussed the details of the Pentagon study, so I will not take time today to repeat most of them. 
One aspect, though, bears special mention. Because the United States spent considerable sums of money in the 1980's and early 1990's to make our Europe-based forces deployable and sustainable, the Pentagon study calculates our share of the total bill to be less than some Europeans apparently would like. I believe that, in making that criticism, the Europeans are forgetting that in 1991 they signed onto the new NATO strategic concept that emphasizes force projection, to which I referred earlier. 
If our European friends disagree, let them offer an alternative methodology in the cost negotiations that were mandated at Madrid. 
Even if the absolute cost to the United States of NATO enlargement is well within our capabilities--as it is likely to be--we must insist that the costs are fairly apportioned within the alliance. 
I regret that the Madrid summit communique did not specifically call for an equitable sharing of the burden of providing the resources for enlargement. 
Moreover, the immediate post-Madrid statements by French President Chirac who said that France would not spend an extra franc for enlargement, and by German Chancellor Kohl, who said that United States cost estimates of enlargement were exaggerated, were not encouraging. They may accurately reflect Chirac's and Kohl's views, or they may merely be opening negotiating positions. 
In any event, I must emphasize in the strongest possible terms that the North Atlantic alliance is a partnership, not an American charity enterprise. 
While some of our European allies are making significant contributions to alliance multinational military activities, to cost-sharing for stationed U.S. forces, and to foreign assistance--all of which have been listed by the Pentagon as relevant burden-sharing criteria--only Italy, Greece, and Turkey met congressional targets last year on defense spending as a percentage of gross domestic product. And, Mr. President, one might add that the motivations of the last two countries include arming to defend against each other. 
I will be very surprised if NATO's definitive enlargement cost study--to be completed in the coming months--does not call for outlays that will force Western European parliaments to increase considerably their appropriations for defense. 
At that point, Mr. President, we will reach the alliance's moment of truth. Eleven NATO members are also members of the European Union. I have great sympathy for the European Union's strenuous efforts to achieve an ever closer union. Merely trying to fulfill the criteria for launching a common European currency is proving extremely difficult and causing social tensions in several Western European countries. 
But, Mr. President, we in the United States have also been taking painful steps to balance our own budget. The U.S. Federal work force is being reduced by more than a quarter-million, and our appropriations for many worthy social, medical, and educational causes have been drastically pared down on austerity grounds. 
So, Mr. President, I don't think it is too much to ask of our European allies what we have been asking of the American people. If one Europe, whole and free is worth ensuring through an enlarged NATO, then our European allies will take up the challenge and make the sacrifices that we have made. If they feel it is not worth the price, then I fear that the future of the entire alliance will be cast in doubt. 
A corollary of burdensharing in NATO is the responsibility that the United States takes for the entire free world through its military activities outside of Europe, especially in the Pacific and the Middle East. As we proceed with NATO enlargement, we must be certain not to use a disproportionate share of our defense funds in Europe and thereby weaken our ability to carry out our responsibilties elsewhere. I am confident that with equitable burdensharing of enlargement, this will not happen. 
The second looming challenge, Mr. President, is creating a post-SFOR force for Bosnia. I have long called for applying the CJTF concept, to which I referred earlier, to Bosnia, so that our European allies can provide ground forces there after June 30, 1998, supported by awesome American air, naval, communications, and intelligence assets and an over-the-horizon U.S. Ready Reserve Force in the region. 
An amendment to that effect was included in the fiscal year 1998 Defense Authorization Bill passed by the Senate. 
If our European allies follow the logic of their repeated calls for a European security and defense identity within NATO, which has been officially recognized by the alliance, then they should seize the opportunity offered by the expiration of SFOR's mandate next June. 
By taking up our offer of a CJTF they can consolidate the Dayton peace process and remove a major impediment to the ratification of NATO enlargement by the U. S. Senate. 
If, on the other hand, our European allies persist in their in together, out together mantra, oblivious to the Madrid communique's call for--`a true, balanced partnership in which Europe is taking on greater responsibility' then this body will come to the obvious conclusion that the alliance's official policy upon which enlargement is based no longer obtains. Such a development would have the gravest consequences, not only for enlargement, but for the future of NATO itself. 
Mr. President, I sound these warnings in the firm belief that my two doomsday scenarios will not come to pass. For all but the most provincial Europeans and isolationist Americans recognize the need for the United States to remain intimately involved with Europe and will not want to jeopardize that involvement. The history of the 20th century has shown that when the United States absents itself from European affairs, the Europeans--unfortunately--are unable peacefully to resolve their disputes. The result in World War I and World War II was an enormous American sacrifice of blood and treasure. 
In order that we should never repeat that isolationist mistake, the United States in 1949 led the founding of NATO, the most successful defensive alliance in history. 
For nearly half a century it has kept the peace in Western Europe, allowing its European members to rebuild, overcome their own ethnic and national animosities, and eventually to prosper. 
Mr. President, NATO enlargement involves serious policy commitments for the United States, and therefore must be held up to the closest scrutiny. Many of us have been posing relevant questions to the administration for several months, and we have received satisfactory answers. There will, of course, continue to be new issues to be faced as we get deeper into the details of enlargement. But I believe that it serves no useful purpose to repeatedly recycle already answered questions, as if possessed with a need to reinvent the wheel. 
For example, some of my colleagues recently asked, once again, what threat NATO enlargement is designed to counter. But both the Clinton administration and NATO long ago answered that question: the threat is instability in Central and Eastern Europe, the crucible for two world wars in this century. NATO enlargement will extend the decades-old zone of stability eastward on the continent. 
In case anyone thinks that I am only spouting theoretical political science phrases, let me cite an article in the July 28, 1997 edition of The Washington Times, which quotes the head of the Security Policy Division of the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry. Saying that his country was delighted by NATO's decision in Madrid to invite Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary to join, the Lithuanian official explained--`because that extends the zone of stability to our borders.' 
By now we surely know that the addition of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, NATO is not drawing new dividing lines on the continent, as some of my colleagues recently suggested. I think the jubilant crowd that welcomed the President in Bucharest--after the Madrid summit--has laid that myth to rest. The Romanians knew that NATO, by emphasizing its open door policy at Madrid, had once again made clear that its goal is an undivided, peaceful, and free Europe--and an alliance that will welcome Romania as a member in the near future. 
Some of my colleagues would like to come up with a finely delineated taxonomy of ethnic quarrels, border disputes, external aggression, and the like, as a precondition for moving ahead with NATO enlargement. 
But, of course, such theoretical discussions are rapidly being made superfluous by the lure of NATO membership. Since enlargement became a real possibility Hungary and Romania have formally improved their relationship, as have Hungary and Slovakia, Romania and Ukraine, Slovenia and Italy, Poland and Lithuania, Germany and the Czech Republic, Russia and Ukraine, and other European countries that I am probably forgetting. 
Mr. President, these historic reconciliations did not happen by accident. With the notable and sad exception of parts of the former Yugoslavia, the various peoples of Central and Eastern Europe are no longer wallowing in the swamp of ancient, tribal hatreds. Rather, they are attuned to the 21st century and the opportunities that NATO enlargement, above all, can offer. 
Some of my colleagues have asked whether NATO membership will force the new Eastern European democracies to spend too much on arms when expenditures for infrastructure critical to economic growth are more pressing. Leaving aside the rather patronizing tone of the question, the answer has been clear for months: Warsaw, Prague, and Budapest each has no trouble defining its national interest. Pending verification in this fall's accession negotiations, the Polish, Czech, and Hungarian procurement plans fall well within prudent limits of the free-market economic reforms that all three have been implementing for several years. 
Some of my colleagues have asked whether membership in the European Union might be a better option for these countries to achieve economic stability than NATO membership. 
Again, Mr. President, I think we must treat the Central and East Europeans like adults. They know what is vital to them. 
Moreover, why--other than to throw up roadblocks in the NATO enlargement process--would one posit an artificial dilemma? It's not an either or choice: many of these countries are viable candidates for both NATO and EU enlargement. 
In fact, earlier this month the European Union invited the first three NATO enlargement candidates--Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary--plus Slovenia, Estonia, and Cyprus to membership talks for the next round of EU enlargement. 
Some of my colleagues have asked, what have we given up in terms of NATO's own freedom of action to deploy forces throughout the expanded area of the alliance in order to obtain Russian acquiescence to the expansion plan? 
Well, Mr. President, the answer is a simple, nothing. We have known since NATO made crystal clear last March as part of its famous three no's declaration that the alliance has no reason, intention, or plan in the current and foreseeable security environment permanently to station substantial combat forces of current members on the territory of new members. Obviously, if the security environment changes, so too will NATO's troop stationing policy. In short, we have retained our freedom of action and have given up nothing--zero. I hope that issue has been laid to rest. 
While everyone by now admits that Russia's leaders have acquiesced to NATO enlargement, some of my colleagues have asked the unanswerable question: But what of tomorrow's Russian leaders? They wonder whether NATO enlargement will create an incentive for Moscow to withhold its support for further strategic arms reductions. 
First of all, no one can categorically disprove a negative. Some Russian leaders are against further strategic arms reductions for a variety of reasons. NATO enlargement may be one of them, although I seriously doubt that it is one of the more important ones. Ultimately, I believe that the next generation of Russian leaders will see that arms control is in their own national self-interest. 
Additionally, we should not forget that through the NATO-Russia Founding Act the Russians will have the opportunity not only to observe NATO first hand, but will also be able to work cooperatively with it. They may not learn to love NATO, but at least they will see that it does not correspond to the aggressive, rapacious Stalinist caricature that they grew up with. 
Many of us in this body are justifiably concerned about the cost to the American taxpayer of NATO enlargement, and I have talked myself blue in the face to Europeans making clear my insistence on equitable burdensharing. But I would also remind my colleagues that freedom is not cost free. As a deterrerent to aggression, ethnic conflict, or other kinds of instability, an enlarged NATO is far less expensive than conducting a military operation after hostilities have broken out would be. 
Here again the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina is instructive. Had we become directly involved earlier with the lift and strike policy that I advocated as early as 1992, we could have prevented many of the quarter-million deaths and 2 million displaced persons in that tormented country. Moreover, we would not be saddled with the enormous reconstruction costs that the United States and the rest of the world community are now bearing. 
So while we persist in our goal of a North Atlantic alliance of truly shared responsibilities, let us not lose sight of the bigger picture that American expenditures on NATO are the best security investment that this country can ever make. 
Mr. President, I would summarize my thoughts since Madrid in the following way: NATO enlargement is on the right track. It is a vital force in the integration of the new Europe. Tough negotiating and bargaining lie ahead. Several key questions must be definitively answered in the coming months, above all the actual cost of enlargement and how it will be apportioned. We must work out a satisfactory NATO-led, post-SFOR force for Bosnia. The Committee on Foreign Relations, for example, will hold an extensive series of hearings on these topics. But let us not confuse the debate by repeating already answered questions. 
I am convinced that after thorough scrutiny and debate, NATO enlargement will occur on schedule and will contribute to expanding and enhancing stability in Europe, and thereby will strengthen America's security. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990 established a process for developing new discovery and case management procedures designed to reduce costs and delay in Federal litigation. 
My amendment to S. 996 would make permanent one very successful reform from the Civil Justice Reform Act--the requirement that a list of each Federal judge's 6-month-old motions and 3-year-old cases be published and disseminated twice every year. 
According to the Rand Institute for Civil Justice, this public reporting requirement led to a 25 percent reduction in the number of cases pending more than 3 years in the Federal system, even though the total number of cases filed during the 4-year study period actually increased--proving again that Justice Brandeis was correct in saying that `sunlight is the best disinfectant.' 
This very effective reporting requirement will expire in December unless Congress acts. With my amendment, I seek to extend this reporting requirement. 
This amendment marks the first step in implementing the findings of the studies called for by the original Civil Justice Reform Act. The Rand study of the pilot projects set up by the act found that early judicial supervision of the discovery process can both reduce delay and litigation costs. These and other procedural reforms ought to be incorporated into the everday practices of our Federal bench to produced savings for the taxpayers and increase the efficiency of our Federal courts. 
I intend to continue working with my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, as well as the Judicial Conference, to search for and implement improvements in our Federal civil justice system.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. Leader, on the matter of the legislation we just passed, I want to make one comment. It is obvious that the Senator from New Mexico is recognized as an effective chairman. It is obvious that the Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] is viewed as articulate and as one of the brightest people here. It is obvious that everybody knows how effective the ranking member of the Budget Committee is. 
I want to make a personal comment that I never thought I would make, or need to make. I think the single-most underestimated person in this body is one of the single-most effective people, and that is my senior colleague, Bill Roth. He has a style that is so low-key and so quiet that I don't think he gets the credit he deserves. I just want to remind everybody, notwithstanding the fact that everyone sees and hears more about the able leaders I mentioned, this deal would not have been done without Bill Roth. Bill Roth. People in my State love him, but they don't even realize that. 
I just want everybody to be reminded that this quiet guy from Delaware, who has a very different political view on a lot of things than I do, is one of the single-most effective people we have. On last year's welfare reform bill, and every major thing we have done in the past 18 months, he has been at the helm, or has played a major part. 
I want to personally recognize the contribution he makes and state for the record, I think he gets--not intentionally; I think unintentionally--less credit than anybody in this place, and I think he plays the most significant role in all of what we are rightfully celebrating here, which is the passage of the tax bill and the reforms that have taken place in welfare, et cetera. So I want the Record to reflect that the man from Delaware, my senior colleague, deserves a heck of a lot of credit.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of the compromise amendment to S. 39--the so-called tuna-dolphin bill. 
In forging this bipartisan agreement, we have struck a proper balance between resolving the market access problems now faced by other countries and keeping the faith with American consumers. It is a fair deal. 
In short, the bill implements an international dolphin protection regime--known as the Panama Declaration--while maintaining the current dolphin-safe label during the pendency of a study on the impacts on dolphins from purse net tuna fishing. 
In March 1999--after scientists have preliminary determined whether purse net tuna fishing harms dolphin stocks--the Secretary of Commerce is to make a determination as to the appropriate dolphin-safe label, whether that be the current one that Senator Boxer and I wrote into law in 1990, or another protective version. This decision will be reviewed in the year 2001. 
Also included in the bill are provisions requiring Latin and South American countries tuna fishing the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean to enroll in an expanded dolphin protection program, which includes on-board observers. This will enable us to lock-in and improve upon the tremendous gains that we have already made in decreasing dolphin mortalities. 
This amendment represents a compromise on process, not a cave-in on principles. Again, we retain for every letter of the current dolphin-safe label. In 2 years' time the question will be if the label should be changed--not when it should be changed. 
I would also note that I do have some reservations regarding the adequacy of the data that will form the basis of the March 1999 label review. Only one population survey will be available at that time; this will not be an abundance of information upon which to make an informed and unbiased decision. I urge the Secretary of Commerce to err on the side of caution during the preliminary review and not make science conform to political will. 
I would like to recognize and publicly thank my colleagues who worked so hard in crafting this agreement, particularly Senator Boxer, Senator Kerry, Senator Breaux, Senator Snowe, Senator McCain, and Senator Stevens. Each spent a great deal of personal time trying to bridge the gap in this debate, and I am grateful for their efforts. 
In closing, this agreement continues to protect dolphins while keeping our faith with the American people. It is environmentally and economically the right thing to do, and I urge its passage.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this amendment extends the crime law trust fund through 2002 at the funding levels of the budget agreement. 
This amendment has the same effect as the Biden-Gramm-Hatch amendment passed by the Senate 98 to 2 on June 27, 1997. 
Let me point out just one practical effect of my amendment. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported major youth violence legislation last week--this Hatch-Sessions bill calls for $1.5 billion from the crime law trust fund in 2001 and 2002--this is almost one-half of the dollars to fund a new Republican youth violence block grant. 
Now, I do not agree with many of the specifics of this block grant and I look forward to debating these issues on the floor. 
But, the bottom line is real simple--if we do not pass this amendment, there will be no trust fund in 2001 and 2002, and so, there will be no youth violence block grant in 2001 and 2002--no matter what form this block grant ultimately takes. 
And, it is the same for prisons, 100,000 cops, and violence against women. If we do not pass my amendment, there will be no trust fund in 2001 and 2002, and there will be no more funding for prisons and no more to fight violence against women. 
I also want to point out to my colleagues that I believe that there are Budget Act points of order which could be lodged against my amendment. I say that just so all of us are clear about my amendment. I would move to waive such a point of order were it raised. I just want my colleagues to understand this fact as we pass this amendment. 
I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to restore funding for the National Endowment for Democracy [NED]. 
Last month the Senate expressed its overwhelming support for the NED when it passed the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1997--90 to 5. That legislation provided $30 million, full funding, for the NED. 
Even more recently we voted unanimously to congratulate Mexico on its elections. The NED provided critical support to the Civic Alliance in Mexico, a nonprofit election monitoring and civic education group that played a key role in that success story. 
When the Reagan administration proposed the NED, I thought it was a bad idea and voted against it. After seeing all of the good work they have done and are doing, I have been converted to a supporter. 
The NED continues to play a critical role in promoting democracy and democratic values, and is vital to U.S. national interests. 
Mr. President, let me make this clear--NED is not a foreign aid program. This is because it builds self-sufficiency by working with indigenous groups that demonstrate a real commitment to democratic principles. 
NED only receives $30 million, but is very cost-effective. It makes hundreds of grants annually in over 90 countries for civic education, media, human rights, and other organizations dedicated to supporting those who desire democracy. 
NED funds support political party training and the establishment of opposition newspapers, helping to promote an independent press. For example, NED has done important work in China through its support of Chinese human rights activists. 
Another well-known example is Burma, where the NED has strongly supported Aung San Suu Kyi and the pro-democracy movement there. 
Still another important aspect of the NED is that it is rooted in the U.S. private sector, and operates in situations where direct government involvement is not appropriate. 
It is particularly effective in reaching those groups seeking to counter nationalist and autocratic forces that are responsible for so much conflict and instability. 
The NED provides a successful and cost-effective mechanism for spreading our democratic values and enhancing American security. 
This point was made today in a Wall Street Journal editorial that highlights and praises the NED's effective and innovative approach to democracy promotion. 
Elimination of this program could be interpreted as a sign of America's disengagement from the vital policy of supporting democracy around the globe. 
I urge my colleagues to continue to support this critical democracy-building organization.

Mr. BIDEN. Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, this is not the right way to do this. Let me repeat that again. This is not the right way to do this. If the circuit were to be split, we should do it in a way we have done it in the past. 
When some of my colleagues who have argued for the split in the past have come before the committee, they have said some of the following things. The argument is, `Well, the reason we want a split is we don't want to have the court, basically a California-dominated court, making judgments for the folks in my State. We are different.' 
And I point out to my colleagues who say that, you know, it is a funny thing about the circuit courts. Our Founding Fathers set the circuit courts up for a basic fundamental reason. They didn't want 50 different interpretations of the Federal Constitution. It is kind of strange. The whole purpose of the circuit court of appeals was to make sure there was a uniform view as to how to read the Constitution--not a Montana reading, not a Washington State reading, not a Nevada reading, not a Hawaii reading, and not an Alaska reading. Geography is relevant only in terms of convenience--not ideology. 
This is all about ideology at its core. That is what this is about. That is what the attempt to split it is about. 
There is no data to sustain that this should be done. Let the Judicial Conference make a judgment, make a recommendation to us. Let them decide as they have in the past. 
I say to my friends from the South, before I got here, we split up what used to be a giant circuit from Texas to Florida. The Senator's home State was part of the Presiding Officer's home State, was part of this giant district of the circuit court, and it got split. We did it the right way. We got the facts. We heard from the Judicial Conference. We listened to the court. 
This is about politics. It is no way to deal with the court. It isn't how to do this. 
Let's look at what we have. We don't have any data on the operation of the circuit as it is presently configured. So, therefore, it seems to me, we should at least give some weight to those folks who are on the court, and those folks who are litigants argue before the court--the bar of those States. 
With that in mind, let me point out that the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council, the governing body of all the courts in the ninth circuit, is unanimously opposed to this--Republican appointees to that court, Democratic appointees to that court, liberal appointees, conservative appointees, pointed-head appointees, flat-headed appointees. They are all opposed. 
Let's look at the next thing that makes sense to look at--those who litigate before the court. 
The California bar is opposed to this. The Arizona bar is opposed to this. The Hawaii State Bar Association is opposed to this. Big Sky Country Bar from Montana is opposed to this. The State of Nevada's bar is opposed to this, and the State of Idaho. 
Mr. President, I would also point out that splitting the circuit, as proposed, will not guarantee that certain regional interests will be better represented. Keep in mind that is what this is really about--regional interests. 
That is the part that bothers me about how we are going about this. 
Look, I am from the third circuit way back East--Pennsylvania, Delaware. So I am not telling anybody in the other part of the country what their business is. But it offends me that we have argued at least--I have not been here for the debate--in the committee based upon regional bias. There is not a Western Federal Constitution. There is not an Eastern Federal Constitution. There is not a Southern Federal Constitution. There is one Constitution--one. 
Another problem with this legislation that the court will face is the costs incurred. Dividing this circuit requires trading an 
infrastructure to support the new twelfth circuit. The Ninth Circuit Executive Office estimates that the initial startup cost for the establishment of the new twelfth circuit would amount to tens of millions of dollars. Operating costs of maintaining two circuits have been estimated to be more than $5 million per year. 
Look, I think the Senator from California has been eminently reasonable throughout this whole process. By the way, if anybody wonders whether this is not about regionalism, which is the worst thing we could be talking about when we talk about the Federal Constitution, let me remind my colleagues of a point in fact. 
No ninth circuit judge has been appointed to the court for a long time because those who, in fact, are suggesting that this should be split said, `Unless it is split, we are not letting any judges go on the court.' 
Think of that now, Mr. President. Isn't that nice? 
`You won't split the court so we can have a regional division. We are not letting any folks get on the court. And then we are going to tell you that the court is overworked. Then we are going to tell you the court has a backlog. Then we are going to tell you the court has a problem.' 
The reason, if it does, is because they have arbitrarily held up the appointments. 
Republican judges from the circuit have come to my office--Democratic judges from the circuit, Reagan appointees, Bush appointees--and said, `Can't you do something?' I said, `You are talking to the wrong guy. You are preaching to the choir. Go to the guys who are blocking these judges.' 
So, Mr. President, you can make an argument that this court is overworked. You can make the argument that this distribution is but part of the argument. The reason is a self-fulfilling prophesy. You don't put judges on the circuit. You create a problem. 
I can see my time is up. I thank my colleague for yielding. 
This is a bad idea. It is not the right way to go about it.  
Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator from Maryland yield for a brief comment? 
Mr. President, this is the second time we have addressed this issue in the last several weeks. A similar provision was in the State Department authorization bill that we dealt with. We raised the issue then, and the Senator moved to strike a similar provision, a withdrawal provision. It was accepted by a voice vote. This bill went on to pass the Senate 90 to 5, I believe. 
I am surprised this issue has surfaced again. Not only does section 408 depart from the State Department authorization bill, but it is bad policy; it is just simply bad policy. 
I hope my friends, the managers of this bill, will consider the fact that we have been through this once already and maybe allow us just to have a voice vote and move on. We have enough to fight over in this bill. 
I have much more to say on this, but, as the old joke goes, everybody has already said it, so I am not going to repeat it. The Senator from Maryland is absolutely right; it is a repeat of what we did. 
I thank the Senator for yielding to me, and I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. I rise to congratulate the Senate on having adopted Senate Concurrent Resolution 41, which calls for a United States initiative seeking a just and peaceful resolution on the situation on Cyprus. 
Senator Smith of Oregon and I submitted this resolution last week in the Committee on Foreign Relations, where it received speedy and favorable action. I applaud my colleagues for having adopted the resolution today. 
For 23 years Cyprus has been divided, with the northern part occupied by Turkish troops, and the southern part home to the Greek Cypriot community. Tensions remain high, and since Cyprus has become one of the most heavily armed places in the world, the possibility for serious hostilities is high. So, Mr. President, it is clear that the status quo on Cyprus is detrimental to U.S. interests in the volatile Eastern Mediterranean region. 
The resolution declares that lasting peace and stability on Cyprus could best be served by complete demilitarization leading to the withdrawal of all foreign occupation forces, the cessation of foreign arms transfers to Cyprus, and the provision of alternative internationally acceptable and effective security arrangements with guaranteed rights for both communities as negotiated by the parties. 
The resolution also welcomes and supports President Clinton's commitment to give increased attention to Cyprus as witnessed by Ambassador Holbrook's appointment as Special Presidential Emissary for Cyprus. 
Finally, the resolution calls upon the parties to lend their full support and cooperation to United States, United Nations, and other international efforts to promote an equitable and speedy resolution of the Cyprus problem on the basis of international law, relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, and democratic principles, including respect for human rights, and in accordance with the norms and requirements for accession to the European Union. 
This last item is important, Mr. President, giving the naming earlier this month of Cyprus to the first group of candidate countries for final membership negotiations with the European Union, along with Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, and Estonia. 
Mr. President, the intolerable situation on Cyprus must be changed. Face to face negotiations between the two parties have resumed, and there are some grounds for optimism. I hope that this resolution will serve to energize the parties to come to a just and lasting agreement. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I wish to comment on my vote on tobacco farmers' eligibility for Federal crop insurance. I begin by noting that no substance rivals tobacco in its negative impact on our Nation's health: It is estimated that tobacco use is responsible for the premature deaths of 400,000 people annually. 
Caught up in the battle between elected and public health officials and tobacco companies are the tobacco farmers, whose honest labor is spent raising this dangerous but unfortunately often lucrative crop. It is contradictory at best--and irrational at worst--for the American taxpayers to on the one hand pay for the medical costs associated with tobacco use, and on the other, pay to subsidize tobacco production through reduced-rate crop insurance. For this reason, I oppose continuing to provide tobacco farmers with taxpayer-subsidized crop insurance. 
I do, however, believe that tobacco growers ought to be given reasonable warning that they stand to lose their Federal insurance, enabling them to find comparable coverage in the private insurance market. To me, it is simply an issue of fairness. I was troubled by the immediacy of the Durbin amendment's provisions, and, though I supported its objective, voted against it for this reason.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I voted against the resolution offered by Senator Murkowski condemning the Government of Canada for its failure to resolve the blockade of a United States vessel in Canadian waters. 
Canada's inaction clearly was wrong. The M/V Malaspina, a United Stats passenger vessel operated by the Alaska Marine Highway System, was blockaded in port by Canadian fishing boats for 3 days. The Canadian Government not only failed to condemn the blockage of the Ferry boat, it also took no action to enforce an injunction issued by a Canadian court requiring the M/V Malaspina to be allowed to continue its passage. The ferry was able to continue its passage only when the fishing boats voluntarily ended their blockade. 
There is no doubt that the M/V Malaspina has the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea of Canada. Article 17 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea guarantees that right to the ships of all states. 
There can also be no doubt that Canada failed to handle the illegal blockage of the United States vessel responsibly. 
The amendment introduced by Senator Murkowski, however, is overkill. It would grant broad authority to the President and instruct him to compel Canada to prevent any further harassment of United States shipping. The amendment hints at the use of military force to escort shipping through Canadian waters, and offers only vague guidance on how outstanding maritime disputes with Canada might ultimately be resolved. 
I believe that we should not jump to coercive methods to deal with maritime disputes--especially with one of our closest allies and largest trading partners--until all other diplomatic avenues have been tried and exhausted. Moreover, as a general rule, the Senate should avoid granting the President broad authority to accomplish vague objectives. 
Rather than escalating this dispute, the Senate should call on Canada to fulfill its international commitments and provide assurances that the M/V Malaspina episode will not be repeated. We deserve at least that mush consideration from our ally to the north.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, since I released my first annual drug strategy in 1990, I have argued that it was imperative that we needed to act, instead of just talk, in order to confront the problem of drug abuse and drug related crime. This means focusing quickly on the risks confronting our youth, identifying practical steps our communities can take to reduce these risks, and committing ourselves to the hard work and resources needed to steer young people to productive lives instead of wasted lives. 
The administration's 1998 national drug strategy provides significant steps toward these goals. Under the leadership of General McCaffrey, the administration's 1998 drug strategy calls for a 10-year antidrug plan and a 1998 budget request that includes full funding for drug control efforts that have proven to work. 
The administration's budget request includes: $8.4 billion for domestic drug enforcement; $3.3 billion for drug treatment; $2.2 billion for drug education and prevention--including $680 million for Safe and Drug-Free Schools; and $2.1 billion for interdiction and international antidrug efforts--including broad, across-the-board increases for law enforcement agencies like the FBI, DEA, INS, and U.S. Attorneys. 
In addition to funding these existing programs, the budget request establishes a national media campaign of prime-time antidrug television advertisements to stop kids from trying drugs in the first place--funded by $175 million from Federal Government and $175 million from private industry. 
These are all positive steps which I urge my colleagues to pass into law. 
What is more, these positive steps illustrate just how vital the office of the Drug Director truly is. Because, if we did not have an office--a single, responsible office charged with overseeing the Federal antidrug policy we could not even debate whether General 
McCaffrey's drug strategy makes sense. I believe it does. But, there may be others who do not. My key point is that without a Drug Director, we would have lost even the chance to have an informed debate over a specific proposal. 
I remind my colleagues what we faced on the drug policy front when I first began calling for a drug office in 1980: it was pretty simple, there was no drug office, there were more than 50 Federal departments, agencies, and offices putting together a hodge-podge of antidrug efforts with no coherant plan. 
Contrast this to what we have today, General McCaffrey has submitted a strategy and a budget--and we can now all debate what a majority of us favor and what a majority of us oppose. 
This is the fundamental reason why I am today introducing legislation to reauthorize the Office of National Drug Control Policy. I know that the administration, led by General McCaffrey, has worked hard to craft this legislation, and I believe that it deserves speedy consideration--and the votes--of my colleagues. 
One of the important refinements offered in this legislation is to build in some long-term planning while at the same time adding some greater accountability for the drug strategy and all its component parts. 
This legislation does so by calling on the Drug Director to develop a 10-year plan, a 5-year budget coupled with a detailed annual status report assessing the progress on the strategy, as well as a detailed, program-by-program, annual budget. 
In other words, this legislation would keep the Drug Director's key power to develop, define, and submit to Congress a detailed annual drug budget. A process which holds unique powers to focus congressional debate on the topic of drug policy, and which is the strongest institutional power of the Office of National Drug Control Policy within the executive branch. 
In addition, this legislation will enhance a function which too often is ignored--that function: accountability. Here, the Drug Director has called for long- and short-term measureable objectives. In fact, as part of General McCaffrey's on-going efforts at the Drug Office, the General has already identified more than 54 performance targets and another nearly 80 measures of program effectiveness. 
The legislation I am introducing today will help formalize this process. Let me also add, that calling on the Drug Director to provide a 10-year plan will not prevent any future administration--nor even this administration--from changing or refining that plan. It is simply to recognize that we are at a stage in our effort against drugs where we must focus on implementation and results. And, this is exactly what the legislation I offer today is all about. 
I urge my colleagues to support the legislation I offer today.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to explain why I voted against the amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas, [Mr. Hutchinson] calling for a revocation of China's most-favored-nation trading status. Revoking China's nondiscriminatory trading status is not a silver bullet we can fire to address our many legitimate concerns with China. MFN is ill-suited to carry single-handedly the burdens of our complex and multifaceted relationship. 
Yet, simply extending China's most-favored-nation status does little to advance our interests with China. Moreover, it does nothing to address those areas where China's conduct is inconsistent with international norms or in violation of their bilateral commitments. 
In short Mr. President, engagement with China is not a policy, it is just a means to an end. It is the content of the engagement that matters. 
In the area of nonproliferation, for all of our engagement, China's conduct clearly remains unacceptable. 
Just last May, the State Department belatedly imposed sanctions on two key Chinese chemical firms--Nanjing Chemical Industries Group and Jiangsu Yongli Chemical Engineering and Technology Import Export Corp: that knowingly and materially contributed to Iran's chemical weapons program. 
If this case were the lone exception, it would still be troubling. Unfortunately, it appears to be the norm. 
China has knowingly aided the development of weapons of mass destruction, and the means to deliver them, in irresponsible states or in countries located in unstable regions of the world. China has provided nuclear technology, cruise missiles, and ballistic missile technology to Iran. China has also exported M-11 missiles--which can be equipped with nuclear warheads--and missile production know-how to Pakistan. 
These exports appear to be part of a deliberate government policy that traces its roots to the ancient Chinese strategy of balancing one barbarian off against another, and we may be one of the barbarians Beijing has in mind. 
A critical objective of our relationship with China must be to convince Beijing not only to sign up to international nonproliferation regimes, but to follow through on its commitments. 
In general, we should: stick to incentives and penalties we are prepared to deliver; act multilaterally, where possible, to avoid having our initiatives undercut; and replace our once-a-year debate on MFN with a sustained, high-level commitment to improving our overall relationship. 
I hope that diplomatic pressure, international suasion, and targeted sanctions will change Beijing's attitude toward nonproliferation. Chinese compliance with international regimes appears to improve when they are convinced that officials at the highest levels of the U.S. Government are scrutinizing their behavior. 
But my patience is not limitless. 
My vote today should not be interpreted as an expression of my satisfaction with China's behavior or the administration's policy of engagement. Moreover, it should not be viewed as an indication of how I might vote when MFN comes up for renewal next year. 
If China fails to clean up its act, it may leave me no choice but to vote to revoke MFN. Sending a strong message--knowing full well that it won't miraculously bring about positive changes in China--may prove preferable to doing nothing while China makes the world a more dangerous place.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the European Union for its decision yesterday to begin membership talks with six countries, five of them in Central and Eastern Europe. 
Mr. President, as anyone who has followed my numerous statements on NATO enlargement knows, I have frequently criticized the European Union for not moving speedily enough toward its own stated goal of enlargement. The EU's announcement that it will begin talks early next year with Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia is welcome for several reasons. 
First of all, it recognizes that these are the countries that have already made the most progress in meeting the EU's demanding economic and political qualifications. Five other prospective candidates--Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia--now realize that they have more work to do. 
Second, the naming of five Central and East European countries for the next round of EU enlargement in itself will add to the emerging European security architecture, along with the other web of ties connected with EU membership. 
Third, the naming of Cyprus to the list of prime candidates for EU membership should help to move the parties on that island to a final, equitable solution that eliminates the division of the country, which has persisted for twenty-three years. 
I do not underestimate the complexity of accession negotiations as the European Union concurrently moves toward `an ever closer union.' Nonetheless, I hope that the talks with the six prime candidates will move speedily so that they can join the European Union before the end of this century. 
Again, I congratulate the European Union on the step it has taken.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I support the foreign operations appropriations bill now before the Senate, which will provide the necessary funds for foreign assistance programs of the United States in the coming fiscal year. Foreign aid is an important component of U.S. foreign policy. In addition to being a tangible demonstration of American leadership, it is a key instrument in encouraging and supporting American values of democracy, respect for human rights, and free trade. 
In recent years, foreign policy spending has suffered drastic cutbacks. According to a study of the Congressional Research Service, prepared earlier this year at my request, foreign policy spending for the current fiscal year is at its lowest level in 20 years. 
Moreover, the steepest reductions in our foreign policy budget have come in foreign assistance, which at $11.5 billion last year, in fiscal year 1998 dollars, is lower, in real terms, than any year of the last twenty, and some 36 percent below the historical average of that period. 
Mr. President, this year's foreign operations bill thankfully has started to reverse this precipitous decline. It provides $13.24 billion for foreign assistance and export financing programs. I commend the Appropriations Committee for its hard work and applaud the bipartisan effort its members have shown in enhancing the level of funding for our Nation's foreign assistance programs. 
This legislation provides enhanced funding for critical foreign assistance programs, a few of which I will mention briefly. 
The Appropriations Committee has recognized the importance of development assistance programs by providing $1.8 billion, $100 million over the President's request. 
While the $485 million appropriated for the seed program for newly democratizing countries in Eastern Europe is regretfully below the President's request, the Committee's recommendation of $800 million for the nations of the former Soviet Union will allow our Nation to continue its efforts to bring democracy, stability, and prosperity to those former Communist States. 
Mr. President, I am somewhat concerned about the considerable number of earmarks in this bill, and the number of `subearmarks,' that is, designation of funds for specific programs within specific countries in Eastern Europe and Eurasia. 
I am not opposed to earmarks in principle; Congressional priorities often differ with those of the executive branch, and the Congress has every right to protect those priorities by specific earmarks. 
But the proliferation of such provisions unduly limits the administration's flexibility in a region that is constantly in flux. So I hope the committee will consider reducing the number of earmarks in the conference with the House. 
Mr. President, unfortunately it has become popular of late to assert that foreign aid is merely the foreign policy equivalent of welfare--a supposed massive giveaway that yields few benefits to American interests. 
To the contrary, American contributions to these efforts are an important way in which we protect our interests abroad, a fact that the Appropriations Committee has recognized through its enhanced funding levels for foreign assistance programs. 
I wish to congratulate Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy once again for their work on this important piece of legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased the managers of the bill will accept my amendment to the foreign operations appropriations bill. My amendment will apply the same standards for sanctions on countries that harbor Rwandan indicted war criminals as are applied to countries that provide sanctuary for individuals indicted by the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal. 
As the bill is currently written, with the exception of certain types of humanitarian assistance, no foreign aid can be given to any country that provides sanctuary to individuals indicted by the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal. But for those individuals indicted by the Rwandan war crimes tribunal, the bill contains only a discretionary authority to withhold aid. 
Mr. President, the United States was a cosponsor of the U.N. Security Council resolution which authorized the establishment of the Rwandan war crimes tribunal. Accountability for the 500,000 people killed in the 1994 genocide is an integral part of any effort for reconciliation and reconstruction in Rwanda, much like the Truth Commission in South Africa. 
Mr. President, my amendment is not without precedent. The foreign operations bill 2 years ago restricted foreign assistance to countries that harbored both Rwandan and Yugoslav indicted war criminals. I believe this was the right standard, and to do anything less sends the wrong message on war crimes. If we say we are against war crimes in Yugoslavia, we should also equally say we are against war crimes in Rwanda. I don't believe that there's one Senator who doesn't share this belief--but it is important that we say so. 
My amendment makes a strong statement of support for the Rwandan tribunal and for the cause of human rights in Africa.

<TEXT>
Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to speak in a generic sense to this issue and then briefly to the amendment, if the managers do not mind my doing that at this moment. 
Mr. President, we are going to have several amendments that call for cutting off of funds, that call for withdrawal of American forces from Bosnia by a date certain, and so on, amendments like the amendment No. 759 of the Senator from Wisconsin and the substitute amendment No. 802 of the Senator from Michigan. I understand this may be a work in progress here, since I know there are very bright people of all our staffs sitting down right now trying to figure out whether or not we can cobble together a reasonable compromise in this area. That is why I am not going to speak to the detail of any amendment, but I would like to speak to the issue because the issue does not change regardless of how the amendment is crafted. 
In reviewing the history of our policy in Bosnia, I feel like an odd variant of a worker on a decision tree who, instead of taking the best choice available to him, was forced to take the second best one in almost every instance where he had a choice to make. 
It's like that old joke, you know, from Yogi Berra, `When you come to a fork in the road, take it.' 
Forks in the road that we have been presented with have usually involved two bad choices. For most of the duration of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, over the last 4 years I have found myself taking a minority position and sometimes being a minority of one or two or three here in the Senate. As early as September 1992, on the floor of the Senate, I called for lifting of the immoral and illegal arms embargo against Bosnia. I also called for conducting airstrikes against the genocidal Serbian aggressors. 
I went to Bosnia during that period, came back, wrote a lengthy report, which was characterized as `lift and strike,' and engaged the President on that policy. We had significant debates here on the floor of the Senate about whether or not that policy was a sound one. I was told by very knowledgeable people on the floor of the Senate that, `Obviously, airstrikes didn't work,' and, `What was I talking about?' and, `The Serbs would just be more emboldened,' all of which turned out to be dead wrong--dead, flat wrong. Three years and a quarter of a million dead later, we finally conducted airstrikes, which led to the Dayton accords and lifting of the arms embargo. 
What is done is done, Mr. President. After Dayton, we committed our troops to a multinational peace implementation force. But I remind my colleagues that had we followed the lift-and-strike policy when first advocated, we would not have needed to send American troops to Bosnia, either in IFOR or in SFOR. But now our forces are there. 
So, to review the bidding, my original preference was lift and strike. There were European forces on the ground. We would lift the embargo, use our air power to supplement those ground forces that were there, and therefore, there would be no need to have American forces there. But we ended up with a situation that was the next best, but still not good. We waited. We dillied around for 3 years and then finally conducted airstrikes. We finally got the Dayton accords. Since we were now part of the deal, we had to provide ground forces as well. So that was the second-best alternative. Going back to that decision tree I spoke of, we took a route over here that was better than not being on the tree, but it was not what it should have been in the first place. 
So I find myself in the strange position of having argued, initially, 4 years ago, 5 years ago, that there was no need for American ground troops in Bosnia, to now being on the floor defending the presence of our ground troops there. But again I want to emphasize that we made the wrong decision at the outset. We finally made the right decision 3 years later, but by that time we had fewer options once we made the right decision. 
Now our forces are there, and they have been the principal reason for the successes that have been achieved by SFOR. Although many of the provisions of the Dayton peace accords remain to be carried out, absolutely nothing would have been accomplished had it not been for the job that SFOR has done, and its predecessor, IFOR. These men and women from NATO member states and many non-NATO states, led by an American contingent, have successfully separated the warring factions, the Muslims, the Serbs, and the Croats, and have ended at least temporarily the blatant, planned genocide of the Muslims by the Serbs and the direct, immediate involvement of the country of Serbia, led by a war criminal named Milosevic. They have succeeded in putting a substantial amount of heavy weaponry in storage sites. And the carnage--though not the damage--in Bosnia has stopped. 
Yet much remains to be accomplished. There are still incidents of beatings and house burnings, which are inexcusable and must be halted. Most refugees are still not able to return to their homes. And if their homes lie in territory controlled by another of the three main religious groups, in almost every instance they have not been able to return. Most of the indicted war criminals remain at large. 
I have been very critical of the British conduct in Bosnia, but let me say publicly that I compliment them for doing yesterday what all of SFOR should be doing with indicted war criminals. 
These are people who engaged in genocide, and they should be taken to court, an international tribunal, which exists. If they resist, all force necessary should be used to apprehend them. 
Yesterday the British SFOR troops acted. One indicted Bosnian Serb war criminal was taken into custody. Another who resisted was shot and killed. So, hurrah for the British. I hope we are emboldened enough to act in the same way. So, again, most of the war criminals still remain at large, institutions of government, both at the national level and in the Muslim-Croat federation, need to be fleshed out and 
developed, notwithstanding the progress we have made. 
So now, once again I find myself in the minority. I think it was a mistake for the Clinton administration to have set a deadline of the end of June 1998 for the withdrawal of American ground forces from Bosnia, before we were sure that all the tasks enumerated in the Dayton accords will have been accomplished. 
Moreover, as I have repeatedly said over the last half year, I think our West European allies, particularly Great Britain and France, are making a serious mistake by not accepting our offer of United States air, sea, communications, and intelligence assets, plus an American ready reserve force, as they say, over the horizon, in Hungary or Italy, if they would keep their ground forces in Bosnia when ours withdraw. 
I recently attended the NATO summit meeting in Madrid with President Clinton and my colleague, Bill Roth and several others. At that meeting I suggested exactly that course of action. I hope the administration will push our European allies very hard on that point. 
But, once again I find myself in the minority, suggesting that it was a bad idea to set a date of withdrawal once we had put troops on the ground. It would be even worse idea if we mandated that they leave or cut off funds. And it would be a still worse idea, if we do withdraw, if the Europeans withdraw. As I have stated repeatedly over the last half year, I think our European allies, particularly France and Great Britain, would be making a major mistake. 
Our allies talk ceaselessly in Brussels about a European security and defense identity and a European pillar within NATO, but when they get a chance to put their troops where their mouths are, they somehow change their tune. 
Now, once more, we face a Hobson's choice. I wish we had not set a date certain for withdrawal from Bosnia. I want the Europeans to play the military role to which they declare they aspire. But I do not want to give hope to the sordid opponents of Dayton, like Milosevic and Tudjman, who would like to carve up Bosnia after international troops leave. So, I am reluctantly forced, in Mr. Hobson's terms, to take the horse nearest the door; that is to give the Clinton administration the freedom of action to come up with a better plan within the next 12 months. 
Could all the Bosnian horrors of ethnic cleansing, rape camps, and shelling of innocent civilians and children reemerge? You bet they could. In fact, if the international force withdraws before the tasks enumerated in Dayton have been accomplished, you can be sure they all will return--ethnic cleansing, rape camps, shelling of innocent women and children. By locking us into a specific withdrawal date without providing a viable alternative, we will guarantee that all we have accomplished in Bosnia will quickly fall apart and that what remains to be accomplished will never get off the drawing board. It will guarantee that a tinhorn dictator like Milosevic in Serbia, and an authoritarian thug like Tudjman in Croatia, will be able to proceed with their ill-conceived plans to torpedo Dayton and do what they have intended all along--since 1992, I have been saying this--to carve up Bosnia and Herzegovina, with part going to Serbia and the rest to Croatia. 
We have accomplished a great deal in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have made a commitment to the people of that tragic land and to our allies, and to other cooperating partners in SFOR. Largely, though, because of congressional pressure, it is not an open-ended commitment. Some of my colleagues suspect that the President will come back to us with a request for another extension of funding for our troop commitment to SFOR. Fine. If he does, we will have a thorough debate and then decide whether or not to support his request. But to say now, as is being contemplated by some, that we should cut off any funds in the future, to say that now we will dictate what the outcome will be a year from now, is the ultimate in stupidity, in my view. We are micromanaging. We are sending every wrong message we possibly can throughout Bosnia and the rest of Europe. 
What do we accomplish by doing that? Well, we accomplish, I guess, satisfying ourselves and telling people we are withdrawing troops. We have the authority to do that if the President does not withdraw troops by the end of June of next year. That is the operative date. 
So let's give the President an opportunity to jawbone with our European colleagues, to come up with a follow-on plan for what will occur after we withdraw our ground forces from Bosnia a year from now. But let's not do it now. Again, my friend from Michigan is trying very hard to come up with a proposal that basically says the same thing: look, Europeans, stay. We get out but we provide support. 
That is a reasonable approach. But, again, let's not, further on this decision tree, make another bad choice that leads us down the road further to less opportunity and fewer options for peace and security in Europe. 
As I said, I just had the great honor of being in Madrid, Spain, with the leaders of more than 16 European nations. I was playing what was very much a bit role, along for the ride, but there. I find it somewhat ironic that at the very moment some of us are supporting the enlargement of NATO to spread the zone of stability eastward within Europe so we do not end up in a circumstance like we did between World War I and World War II, when several smaller states unable to be part of the West were forced to seek their own bilateral military arrangements and their own attempts to provide their collective security--we, on the floor of the U.S. Senate, are contemplating voting to increase the instability in the most insecure part of Europe. 
To conclude, my hope is that we will not lock the President into a policy straitjacket while the situation remains so unstable. To those who have a philosophic disagreement with me that we should not be involved, that Bosnia is not so important, I say to them: you are not giving up any option, by opposing an attempt to determine the outcome a year before it is required, because there will be American forces there for the next year unless there is a foolhardy amendment that suggests we withdraw all American forces right now from SFOR. 
Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their time, and I yield the floor.  
Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to state for the record that although I voted for the Levin substitute amendment, I did so as one of the second choices that I described in my statement earlier today. 
The Levin substitute amendment, in my opinion, was an improvement over the Feingold amendment in that rather than cutting off funds for United States ground forces in Bosnia after June 30, 1998, it puts our NATO European Allies on notice that we expect them to provide the post-SFOR ground forces, while we provide command and control, intelligence, logistics, and if necessary a ready reserve force in the region. 
My first choice, as I said earlier, would have been to give President Clinton freedom of movement for the next 12 months to carry out the unfulfilled portions of the Dayton accords and to negotiate appropriate international security arrangements for Bosnia and Herzegovina after June 30, 1998. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep concern about the brutal subversion of democracy underway in Cambodia. I urge the administration to condemn the action for what it is: A bloody coup d'etat perpetrated by co-Prime Minister Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party. 
The administration today announced it was suspending for 30 days all assistance provided to the Cambodian Government. All such assistance, including loans provided by the World Bank and other international financial institutions, should remain suspended until the democratically elected Government of Cambodia is restored. 
Programs implemented through nongovernmental organizations--efforts supporting the rule of law, public health, prosthetics for mine victims, et cetera--should be reviewed to determine which ones can continue in light of recent events. 
I applaud the decision taken by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN] to delay Cambodia's membership in that organization. Cambodia's neighbors are under no illusions that Cambodia today is prepared to be a responsible member of the international community. 
BACKGROUND 
A few weeks ago, Cambodia seemed poised to close the book on a bloody chapter of its history by bringing the genocidal Khmer Rouge Leader Pol Pot to justice. But now Hun Sen threatens to plunge the country back into darkness and civil war. 
Dozens of people have been killed. There are reports of mass arrests and looting in the Capital of Phnom Penh. Prince Ranariddh's supporters have been expelled from the legislative assembly. Interior Minister, and Ranariddh loyalist, Ho Sok reportedly has been executed while in the custody of government troops. 
For the long-suffering people of Cambodia--victims of `the killing fields'--Hun Sen's unconstitutional action is a painful blow to their quest for democracy, reconciliation, and national reconstruction. That quest seemed achievable in October 1991 when--after 12 years of civil war--Cambodia's warring factions and all of the foreign parties who had played a role in the Cambodian conflict signed the Paris peace accords. Vietnam withdrew its army from Cambodia and the United Nations established the U.N. Transitional Authority for Cambodia [UNTAC]. 
UNTAC's primary goal was to oversee the creation of a democratic, internationally recognized government in Phnom Penh. UNTAC was the largest, most comprehensive, and most expensive peacekeeping operation in the history of the United Nations. More than 12,000 troops, 4,000 civil police, and 20,000 civilian workers and volunteers from more than 50 countries poured into Cambodia. 
UNTAC supervised the return of more than 400,000 refugees from Thailand and the registration of 5 million eligible voters. The operation cost more than $1.7 billion, with an additional $2 billion pledged by international donors to fund reconstruction of the war-torn country. 
In May 1993, Cambodia experienced its first free and fair multiparty election. Despite terrorist threats from the Khmer Rouge--who refused to participate in the election and shelled some polling places--90 percent of registered voters came to the polls. 
The incredible turnout was a testimony to the enthusiasm of the Cambodian people for democracy and their desire for peace. 
Prince Ranariddh's party won those elections. Hun Sen's party came in second. But when Hun Sen disputed the results and threatened to plunge the country back into civil war, King Sihanouk, with the blessing of the international community, fashioned a compromise. 
A coalition government was established, with Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen serving as co-Prime Ministers. They jointly administered Cambodia until Hun Sen's coup d'etat last weekend. 
The coalition was never an easy one. In recent months, relations between the two Prime Ministers had become increasingly strained as both began jockeying for position in the runup to national elections scheduled for 1998. 
The disintegration of the Khmer Rouge actually exacerbated the tension between the two major parties, as each sought the political and military support of the breakaway Khmer Rouge elements. 
Now the tensions have flared into open conflict. The question for the friends of democracy in Cambodia is how to respond. 
Our first priority must be to ensure the safety of more than 1,000 American citizens--including our diplomatic and military personnel. 
Our very able Ambassador in Phnom Penh, Ken Quinn, has acted with courage and professionalism to provide a safe haven for Americans and to assist those seeking to leave the country. Thailand has been enormously helpful by providing aircraft to transport Americans and other foreigners out of Cambodia, and I want to express my personal thanks to the Royal Thai Government and the people of Thailand for their asssistance.

 Mr. BIDEN. The amendment of Senator Lugar and others will correct a situation that threatens the very security of the United States. Unless recent efforts to cut the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and similar programs of the Department of Energy are overturned, we and our children will all be in greater danger. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this amendment and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
The administration's request for the important Nunn-Lugar program is for $382.2 million. Last week, the Armed Services Committee cut $60 million from that important program. At the same time, the House National Security Committee cut $97.5 million from the Nunn-Lugar account, and reportedly those cuts were from different parts of the program. Thus, over 40 percent of the Nunn-Lugar program is now at risk. 
The Armed Services Committee also cut $25 million from the Energy Department's program of international assistance in nuclear materials protection, control and accountability, as well as all $50 million in its program of international nuclear safety assistance. The former program is vital to protecting the American people against the diversion of nuclear material from former Soviet laboratories to countries like Iran, Iraq or Libya that would like to build or buy nuclear weapons. It also helps keep nuclear material out of the hands of terrorists, who could use it to poison innocent people in Moscow or Tokyo or Tel Aviv--or right here in Washington. Nuclear safety assistance helps guard against future Chernobyl incidents, which pose fallout dangers far beyond the borders of the former Soviet countries in which they might occur. 
The Nunn-Lugar program makes significant contributions to the national security of our country. Through this program, we have helped Russia to remove over 1,400 strategic nuclear warheads from deployment sites to storage areas, to await dismantlement. We have helped Russia to eliminate 64 SLBM launchers, 54 ICBM silo launchers, 61 SS-18 ICBM's and 23 strategic bombers. And we have helped Belarus, Kazakstan, and Ukraine to eliminate their strategic nuclear forces and to repatriate all their nuclear warheads to Russia. 
But the work of the Nunn-Lugar program is far from completed. Over 400 Russian SLBM launchers remain to be eliminated. Nearly 100 ICBM silo launchers must still be destroyed, along with over 190 SS-18 missiles and another 7 strategic bombers. Over 130 tunnels must be closed at a former nuclear test site in Kazakstan. Massive stocks of old, but still very dangerous, chemical weapons must be destroyed. And security must be improved in Russian storage and transportation of nuclear material. 
There are two basic ways to increase our national security. One is to maintain the finest military and intelligence services in the world. We do that, and I am very glad that we do. 
But we do that at great expense, and at some risk. For none of us can guarantee that nuclear deterrence will work forever, especially in a Russia where troops and officers and nuclear scientists go for months without pay--Russia where, within the 
past year, generals and lab directors have closed the door to their offices and put bullets through their heads, out of despair over what has happened to their programs and their personnel. 
The other basic way to increase our national security is to work with potential foes to reduce the threat that they pose to U.S. interests or U.S. forces. We do some of this through arms control agreements, but often we wonder whether other countries are obeying those agreements. 
The Nunn-Lugar program is a way to make sure that Russia and other former Soviet states actually do reduce their bloated strategic nuclear forces. It isn't free. The administration has asked for $382 million for this program in fiscal year 1998. 
But let's put that in perspective. The defense budget reported out by the Armed Services Committee is $268 billion. So a fully-funded Nunn-Lugar program would cost only one-seventh of 1 percent of the defense budget. The Armed Services Committee added $2.6 billion to the administration's request for defense spending. So the Nunn-Lugar program costs only 14 percent of the increase. And the Armed Services Committee's cut in this program could be restored using only 2.3 percent of that increase. 
The Energy Department's program of international assistance in nuclear materials protection, control and accountability--known as MPC&A--is similarly vital to our national security. Just as the Nunn-Lugar program helps the Russian military to improve its security for nuclear materials, the MPC&A program helps dozens of laboratories in the former Soviet Union to improve their security for nuclear materials. 
What are we talking about here? Often it's as simple as bars on the windows, locks on the doors, and doors that will take more than a crowbar to open. Just as often, however, the need is for completely revised accountability schemes so that institutions with nuclear materials will always know where those materials are. That is a complicated task, and it requires a change in mind-set as much as changes in forms or procedures. 
DOD personnel who participate in Nunn-Lugar programs can relate to the military officers who man Russia's strategic nuclear forces. But it takes scientists to build peer relationships at former Soviet laboratories and spread the word about nuclear control. 
Just last month, a committee of the National Research Council [NRC]--an arm of the National Academy of Sciences--reported that the MPC&A program is beginning to have some real success. The NRC committee says: `progress attributable to the joint efforts of U.S. and Russian specialists in MPC&A greatly accelerated in 1995 and 1996' and calls that `a significant political and organizational achievement.'

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed my amendment to make a modest change in current law. A modest change, but one which will make an enormous difference in the lives of some very special Americans--the families of public safety officers--police officers and firefighters--who have given their lives in the line of duty. 
This amendment would forgive Federal tax liability on the annuities received by the families of these fallen heroes. The cost is modest--about $25 million over the next 10 years. 
I would also add that this tax treatment would be the same as that for the families of fallen soldiers. In other words, my amendment gives to those who fight and die in domestic battles to keep us safe the same treatment we give to those who fight and die in keeping us safe from foreign battles. 
Mr. President, again, I welcome my colleagues support for my amendment--we have stood with the cops, stood with the firefighters, and stood with the paramedics who have given their lives in service to all of us.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from Connecticut in sponsoring legislation aimed at preventing the commencement of an arms race in Latin America. 
For the past two decades, the United States has prohibited the sale or transfer of advanced military equipment to the region. The ban, instituted by President Carter, has been generally maintained since the late 1970's, including during the administrations of Presidents Reagan and Bush. The lone exception occurred in 1982, in response to a perceived Cuban military buildup, when the United States sold F-16 fighter aircraft to the Government of Venezuela. 
The ban was instituted during a different era, when many nations of the region were under the rule of military dictators. To be sure, the nations of Latin America have made important advances since that period. Politically, dictatorship has given way to democracy. Every nation of the hemisphere--with the glaring exception of Cuba--is now governed by a democratically chosen leader. Additionally, after the lost decade of the 1980's--a period of negative economic growth in many nations of the region--the region is beginning to recover economically. Indeed, the nations of the region have made tremendous progress in the past few years, shedding the statist policies of past decades and embracing free markets and free trade. 
Although the times have changed, the need for restraint in the sale of arms has not. First, although the region is advancing economically, it is abundantly clear that few nations of the region can afford the high costs that an arms race would impose. Second, an arms race in the region would be destabilizing--not only among nations of Latin America, but within those nations where civilian control of the military is not yet fully consolidated. The Armed Forces remain important institutional actors in many nations of the region; the increased emphasis on arms procurement and arms budgets could undermine the priorities and powers of the civilian leadership. 
In the past year, there has been considerable discussion within the Clinton administration, and among the nations of the region, about the wisdom of lifting the U.S. ban on the sale of advanced weapons. In this respect, it is important to note that many senior figures in Latin America have come down on the side of restraint. In April of this year, for example, the Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government--an organization consisting of current and former hemispheric leaders from leading countries in the region--called on Latin American governments to `accept a moratorium of two years before purchasing any sophisticated weapons.' In the interim, the Council urged governments of the region to `explore ideas to restrain such arms,' and urged governments that sell arms, including the United States, `to affirm their support for such a moratorium.' 
This legislation that Senator Dodd and I introduce today would heed that request by expressing support for such a moratorium, and banning the transfer to the region of highly advanced weapons by the United States, unless such transfer conforms to an international agreement governing sales to, or purchases by, nations of the region. In other words, if a regional arms control agreement is negotiated permitting some sales but prohibiting others, arms transfers by the United States would be allowed, provided such transfers conform to the arms control agreement then in place. 
It should be emphasized that this bill would not ban all sales of military equipment to Latin America. Rather, it would merely continue, in law, the policy and practice adhered to by the executive branch for the past two decades: to not sell sophisticated military equipment such as advanced combat aircraft and attack helicopters to the nations of Latin America. It would permit U.S. firms to continue to sell other military equipment to Latin America--a market in which the United States now holds the largest share, and in which U.S. firms have sold a total of nearly $800 million over the past 4 fiscal years. 
Mr. President, it is the policy of the United States to promote greater hemispheric integration--an objective pursued in the process initiated at the Summit of the Americas, which was hosted by President Clinton in 1994. The policy set forth in this bill advances that objective by honoring the request of several Latin American nations that they pursue a regional arms control approach before advanced weapons are introduced into the region. I urge my colleagues and the administration to support this legislation.

Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, the second-degree amendment I have at the desk is very simple and straightforward. The Senator from New Mexico is introducing a budget process amendment, and what the amendment of Senator Gramm and myself does is, quite frankly, it merely extends the crime law trust fund for the extension of this agreement. 
I am told by the staffs of the majority and minority that in the budget process agreement that was agreed to with the administration, there is a line on page 90 of the concurrent resolution of the budget fiscal year 1998. On page 90, it says, `Retain current law on separate crime caps at levels shown in the agreement tables.' 
All we are doing here is extending the crime law trust fund. We are not making judgments on how that will be disbursed within the trust fund. We are just extending the trust fund to the extent of this agreement. And, Madam President, as I offer this amendment, we are maintaining a commitment to one of the few specific ways the reconciliation package can, by virtue of the type of legislation it is, maintain a commitment. 
The commitment we made was to fight violent crime. And, ironically, it is working. It is working. And so for us now to extend the violent crime trust fund, let it expire 2 years before this budget agreement expires, means we are going to be back at it again in the year 2000 or before, fighting over something we now know works. 
So I realize we can take a long time debating this. But the bottom line is this: We are not suggesting, as the Senator from New Mexico knows, how this trust fund money within the caps will be disbursed; merely that we have the continuation of the trust fund as long as the budget agreement to the year 2002. 
Of all the priorities addressed in this budget package, I believe that none is more important than continuing our fight against violent crime and violence against women. 
The amendment I am offering, along with Senator Gramm seeks to maintain this commitment in one of the few specific ways this reconciliation package can--by virtue of the type of legislation this is--maintain this commitment. That is by extending the violent crime control trust fund will continue through the end of this budget resolution, fiscal year 2002. 
Senator Byrd, more than anyone, deserves credit for the crime law trust fund. Senator Byrd worked to develop an idea that was simple as it was profound--as he called on us to use the savings from the reductions in the Federal work force of 272,000 employees to fund one of the Nation's most urgent priorities: fighting the scourge of violent crime. 
Senator Gramm was also one of the very first to call on the Senate to `put our money where our mouth was.' Too often, this Senate has voted to send significant aid to State and local law enforcement--but, when it came time to write the check, we did not find nearly the dollars we promised. 
Working together in 1993, Senator Byrd, myself, Senator Gramm, and other Senators passed the violent crime control trust fund in the Senate. And, in 1994, it became law in the Biden crime law. 
Since then, the dollars from the crime law trust fund have: Helped add more than 60,000 community police officers to our streets; helped shelter more than 80,000 battered women and their children; focussed law enforcement, prosecutors, and victims service providers on providing immediate help to women victimized by someone who pretends to love them; forced tens of thousands of drug offenders into drug testing and treatment programs, instead of continuing to allow them to remain free on probation with no supervision and no accountability; constructed thousands of prison cells for violent criminals; and brought unprecedented resources to defending our Southwest border--putting us on the path to literally double the number of Federal border agents over just a 5-year period. 
The results of this effort are already taking hold: According to the FBI's national crime statistics, violent crime is down and down significantly--leaving our nation with its lowest murder rate since 1971; the lowest violent crime total since 1990; and the lowest murder rate for wives, ex-wives, and girlfriends at the hands of their intimates to an 18-year low. 
In short, we have proven able to do what few thought possible--by being smart, keeping our focus, and putting our `money where our mouths' are--we have actually cut violent crime. 
Today, our challenge is to keep our focus and to stay vigilant against violent crime. Today, the Biden-Byrd-Gramm amendment before the Senate offers one modest step toward meeting that challenge: 
By assuring that the commitment to fighting crime and violence against women will continue for the full duration of this budget resolution. 
By assuring that the violent crime control trust fund will continue--in its current form which provides additional Federal assistance without adding 1 cent to the deficit--through 2002. 
The Biden-Gramm amendment offers a few very simple choices: Stand up for cops--or don't; stand up for the fight against violence against women--or don't; and stand up for increased border enforcement--or don't. 
Every Member of this Senate is against violence crime--we way that in speech after speech. Now, I urge all my colleagues to back up with words with the only thing that we can actually do for the cop walking the beat, the battered woman, the victim of crime--provide the dollars that help give them the tools to fight violent criminals, standup to their abuser, and restore at least some small piece of the dignity taken from them at the hands of a violent criminal. 
Let us be very clear of the stakes here--frankly, if we do not continue the trust fund, we will not be able to continue such proven, valuable efforts as the violence against women law. Nothing we can do today can guarantee that we, in fact, will continue the Violence Against Women Act when the law expires in the year 2000. 
But, mark my words, if the trust fund ends, the efforts to provide shelter, help victims, and get tough on the abusers and barterers will wither on the vine. Passing the amendment I offer today will send a clear, unambiguous message that the trust fund should continue and with it, the historic effort undertaken by the Violence Against Women Act that says by word, deed, and dollar that the Federal Government stands with women and against the misguided notion that `domestic' violence is a man's `right' and `not really a crime.' 
I urge my colleagues to support the Biden-Gramm amendment. 
At the appropriate time--and I am not quite sure yet when is appropriate--I will ask for the yeas and nays on this. 
But make no mistake about it, what we are voting on here is whether or not we are going to commit now to the extension of the trust fund, the violent crime trust fund, for the extent of this agreement. That is all this does. That is everything it does, but that is all it does. 
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of delaying a World Bank loan to Croatia until that country fully meets the obligations it agreed to when it signed the Dayton Accords in November 1995. 
Two days ago, the Clinton administration announced that it would attempt to block a $30 million World Bank loan to Croatia until Zagreb extradites Croats indicted on war crimes charges and allows Serbian refugees to return to their homes in Croatian territory. 
It appears that we may have difficulty in persuading other countries on the World Bank's board to go along with this postponement, but I believe that the United States should stick to its principles. 
Mr. President, the horrifying wars that took place in Bosnia and Croatia from 1991 to 1995 had many and complex causes. One of them was the thinly disguised desire of Serbian President Milosevic and Croatian President Tudjman to carve up Bosnia and Herzegovina. The revolt and temporary secession from Croatia by the Krajina Serbs--who themselves were led by extremely unsavory individuals who also carried out atrocities--interrupted the planned cooperation of the two rapacious strongmen in Belgrade and Zagreb. 
There is also no doubt, Mr. President, that the Croatian army--trained by private Americans--played a valuable role in turning the tide in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the summer and fall of 1995 as part of its successful campaign to oust the Krajina Serbs from Croatia. 
But, Mr. President, the behavior of President Tudjman since then has been deplorable. He has knowingly coddled indicted war criminals, despite his obligation under Dayton to turn them over to the International Tribunal at The Hague. On numerous other occasions, I have spoken out in this Chamber against the atrocities--murder, rape, and vile `ethnic cleansing'--that were perpetrated against innocent civilians in Bosnia. 
Most expert observers believe that Bosnian Serbs were responsible for the majority of these heinous acts. But several Bosnian Croats and some Croats from Croatia apparently were among the sadists, as were a few Muslims. That President Tudjman refuses to hand over the indicted who are living in Croatia is an affront to civilized people everywhere, and a direct slap in the face of the United States, which brokered the Dayton Accords. 
Moreover, despite pretty rhetoric and laws on the books, Tudjman has thrown up practical roadblocks to the resettlement of ethnic Serb refugees, preferring instead to govern a Croatia that is now much more ethnically homogeneous. I should add, Mr. President, that ethnic Croats who were displaced by Serbs earlier in this decade should also be allowed to return to their homes. Our goal is a peaceful, multi-ethnic, democratic Croatia. 
In Herzegovina, President Tudjman continues to rule through thuggish ethnic Croatian proxies headquartered in Mostar. These lawless types have refused all international attempts to integrate Mostar and have resorted to deadly violence against Muslims. 
In addition, despite their Bosnian citizenship, the Croats of Herzegovina were allowed to vote in Croatia's national elections earlier this month, providing much of the support by which Tudjman was re-elected in a campaign distinguished by his nearly one-sided access to the media and violence against opposition candidates. 
Mr. President, I firmly believe that Croatia will some day re-enter the Western European community to which it alleges it belongs. But Croatia cannot even think of becoming a member of Western institutions like the European Union or NATO until it lives up to its moral and legal commitments. 
Postponing the World Bank loan to Croatia would serve as a useful warning to President Tudjman that he cannot escape the consequences of his authoritarian and duplicitous behavior. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo must bring to an immediate end the systematic search and slaughter of Rwandan refugees, or else face isolation from the international community. Recent media reports allege the methodical execution of Rwandan refugees still hiding in the former Zaire by the Congolese military. Unless these atrocities are halted, Mr. Kabila should not expect ready support in the United States for his efforts to rebuild his country. 
News reports the last several weeks have alleged the existence of mass grave sites of Rwandan refugees. As of yet, we do not know for certain if these reports are accurate, and if so, by whose hands the refugees were slaughtered. A team of United Nations investigators arrived in Congo last week to initiate an investigation of these claims. Media reports of Congolese government directives to hinder this investigation, if accurate, are intolerable. The government of Congo must bring to an immediate end the persecution of the remaining Rwandan refugees, and actively assist the U.N. in its efforts to locate and repatriate these Rwandan nationals. 
According to reports of the United Nations and various nongovernmental organizations, thousands of Rwandan refugees continue to hide in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that between 200,000 and 250,000 refugees are still missing in Congo. While the actual number may be uncertain, what is clear is that a significant number of Rwandan refugees remain within Congolese borders. 
These refugees consist mostly of Rwandan Hutus who fled their country after the 1994 genocide that took the lives of an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. Despite the large numbers of refugees who have already returned to their homes in Rwanda, a considerable number remain in Congo, many of them women and children. Many are exhausted and weak from almost three years of constant movement, malnutrition and illness. 
Clearly there exists the very real likelihood that among the Rwandan refugees who remain in Congo are those responsible for the 1994 Rwandan genocide. If so, they should be returned to Rwanda and held accountable for their crimes before their own countrymen at the International War Crimes Tribunal. There is absolutely no justification for the execution of any Rwandan refugee in Congo. 
Unfortunately, reports of persecution of Rwandan refugees in Kabila's Congo are not entirely new. Such claims have been associated with the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo since its early battlefield victories in eastern Zaire. However, Laurent Kabila earlier this month in a meeting with Ambassador Bill Richardson committed himself to assist international efforts to account for and repatriate Rwandan refugees in his country. The successful resolution of the refugee issue in Congo has serious consequences for the future of his country. 
Failure to follow through on this commitment seriously calls into question the credibility of the Kabila government to deliver on its promises to the world and its own people. The U.N. team in Congo so far has not encountered any difficulties. If Mr. Kabila expects to receive the support of the international community, it is imperative that he fulfill his earlier pledge and secure the access the United Nations needs to locate and repatriate the refugees. If Mr. Kabila does not live up to his existing commitments on the issue of the Rwandan refugees, it's unclear what confidence there will be for his promises of democracy and peace for the Congolese people.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this budget bill--which would put us on a path to eliminating the budget deficit in the year 2002--contains numerous reforms of the Medicare program. In addition, the bill would restore short-term solvency to Part A of Medicare--the part that pays hospital bills and will otherwise be bankrupt in four years. I have no objection to most of the Medicare reform provisions, and I will vote for this bill overall. 
However, I want to talk briefly about two provisions that I oppose and explain why I voted to take them out of this bill. 
First, Mr. President, this bill would raise the age at which a person becomes eligible for Medicare from the current age 65 to age 67. I voted to keep the eligibility age at 65. While this increase would be gradual and would be phased in over the next 30 years--so it would not affect any current seniors--I think it moves us in the wrong direction. What we should be doing is making sure that more, not fewer, people have health insurance. 
Changing the current law so that today's workers will have to wait until they are 66 or 67 before they become eligible for Medicare threatens to add millions of people to the rolls of the uninsured. It is my understanding that 70 percent of Americans who retire between the ages of 60 and 65 will have no health insurance through their employers. If they have health insurance at all, they are paying exorbitant rates to buy it on their own. 
Increasing the eligibility age for Medicare by 2 years would leave most of these people unprotected for 2 more years. This result is totally counter to why we created Medicare in the first place: To make sure that older Americans have access to health care services when they are likely to need it the most. Raising the eligibility age for Medicare without addressing the issue of those who will lose--or those who will continue not to have--health insurance is a glaring gap in this proposal. 
Now, it has been argued by supporters of this change that because the Social Security retirement age will gradually increase to age 67, the eligibility age for Medicare should increase at the same time. But, Mr. President, there is no rational basis for linking Social Security and Medicare. They are two separate and distinct programs. If it is good policy to raise the Medicare eligibility age to 67--which I do not think it is at this time--then those arguments need to be presented. It is not good enough simply to say, `Well, that's what we're doing with Social Security.' And, I should note, that even when the Social Security retirement age increases, people will still have the option of early retirement at age 62. That is not the case with Medicare. It is all or nothing. And, we should not tell people between 65 and 67 that they get nothing. 
The second provision that I opposed would have--for the first time--imposed means testing on higher income seniors. Under the plan, the monthly premiums for Medicare part B, which pays for doctor services, would have been based on how much income a person has. Now, I have long said that I believe it is not unfair or inappropriate to have wealthy seniors pay more for their Medicare coverage. So I support means testing in principle. But I am not sure that the means testing scheme in this bill is either fair or appropriate--and I think we ought to be sure of both before we make such a significant change in this program. 
This legislation was just drafted last week. Until noon yesterday--Tuesday--this bill would have charged wealthier seniors higher deductibles under part B. But, then at midday, just a couple of hours before we voted on this issue, the bill was changed so that retirees with greater income would pay higher premiums, not higher deductibles. The fact that this last minute change was made just exemplifies the problem of trying to address this issue with haste. 
The premium increases in this budget bill are very substantial, and they would hit individuals with incomes over $50,000 and couples with incomes over $75,000. But we really do not know yet what the effect of these increases would be on these families, or on the Medicare system itself. This is why we need to proceed with greater caution. 
What we do in this budget bill--and what we must do--is what we have done many times in the last 30 years: Make the changes necessary to ensure the solvency of the Medicare Hospital Trust Fund over the next 10 years. To address the long-term concerns once the baby boom generation reaches retirement age, I have previously called for the establishment of a bipartisan commission to study the situation and make recommendations. This bill establishes just such a commission, and instructs it to report back to Congress in a year. 
My point is that neither the increase in the Medicare eligibility age nor means testing are necessary to solve the short-term financial problems of the Medicare system. Instead, these are issues that the new commission should look at. In making significant changes to the Medicare program--among the most successful Federal programs ever--we need to do so with great thoughtfulness and deliberation. 
These changes have no immediate impact on the Medicare trust fund or on our general goal of balancing the overall Federal budget by 2002. In short, there is no reason why we cannot wait until we have the benefit of the recommendations of the bipartisan commission--within the next year--before we take action of this nature. That is why I supported taking these changes out of the budget bill, and why I supported Senator Reed's alternative Medicare proposal to make only those changes needed to make sure that Medicare remains financially solvent.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Feinstein-Biden anti-bomb-making amendment. The bill would make it a Federal crime to teach someone how to use or make a bomb if you know or intend that it will be used to commit a crime. 
As my colleagues know, I fought to pass nearly identical legislation last year. Senator Feinstein and I tried several times to have it enacted as part of my anti-terrorism initiatives. The bill passed the Senate on two occasions, but unfortunately, it was rejected by the House both times. 
Critics of the bill claimed that it was unnecessary, unconstitutional, and would outlaw legitimate business uses of explosives. 
To respond to these claims, we asked the Justice Department to examine each of these questions. The report supports Senator Feinstein and my position on each and every criticism. 
So now that we have cleared away the basis for some of the opposition, I hope we can quickly enact this important legislation. And let me tell you why. 
I think most Americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind of criminal information is making its way over the Internet. This information is easily accessible. It's proliferating by leaps and bounds. 
Let me give just one example. A guy named `War-Master' sent this message out over the Internet about how to build a baby food bomb. Here is how his message goes:  
These simple, powerful bombs are not very well known even though all the material can be easily obtained by anyone (including minors). These things are so [expletive deleted] powerful that they can destroy a car. The explosion can actually twist and mangle the frame. They are extremely deadly and can very easily kill you and blow the side of the house out if you mess up while building it. Here's how they work. 
And then the message goes into explicit detail about how to fill a baby food jar with gunpowder and how to detonate it. The message observes that the explosion shatters the glass jar, sending pieces of razor sharp glass in all directions. The message continues with even more deadly advice: 
Tape nails to the side of the thing. Sharpened jacks (those little things with all the pointy sides) also work well. 
As a result, the message concludes: 
If the explosion doesn't get 'em then the glass will. If the glass don't get 'em then the nails will. 
I am not making this up. And this is only one small example. 
Mr. President, we hear about this happening time and time again: A bomb goes off. People are killed. A criminal is apprehended. And we learn that the criminal followed--to the letter--someone else's instructions on how to make a bomb and how to make it kill people. 
Indeed, the Justice Department report indicates 
that numerous notorious terrorists--including the World Trade Center bombers and the murderers of a Federal judge--have been found in possession of bomb-making manuals and internet bomb-making information. 
And there is another situation that we are hearing about more and more frequently. We read about it in our local papers across the country. These bomb-making instructions are having an ever increasing impact on children. 
In Austin, TX, a boy lost most of one hand and part of the other after following bomb-making instructions he found on the internet. This boy once had plans to serve in the Marines. But that dream is now gone. 
And in Massachusetts, several boys--in separate incidents throughout the State--were maimed when they tried to mix batches of napalm on their kitchen stoves. These experiments were direct results of kids finding a bomb-making recipe on the internet. 
And what is even worse is that some of these instructions are geared toward kids. They tell kids that all the ingredients they need are right in their parents' kitchen or laundry cabinets. 
These stories illustrate what can happen when the literally millions of kids today sit in front of their computer and type `explosive' on their keyboard. In minutes, they can have instructions for making all sorts of explosive devices they never knew even existed. 
I know that some say that going after people who only help other people make bombs is not the way to go. They say that bomb-making instructions are protected by the first amendment. And I agree--to a point. 
I take a backseat to no one when it comes to the first amendment. I have always argued that we must take great care when we legislate about any constitutional right--paticularly our most cherished right of free speech. 
But let's not forget the obvious. It is illegal to make a bomb. And there is no right under the first amendment to help someone commit an illegal act. 
Our bill says you have no right to provide a bomb-making recipe to someone if you know that person has plans to destroy property or innocent lives. You have no right to help someone blow up a building. 
The Justice Department has concluded that our legislation--with some minor modifications which we have incorporated into this bill--is entirely consistent with the first amendment. 
I am glad that the Senate voted last year to join Senator Feinstein and me in making this type of behavior a crime. I hope this time around, we can pass this legislation through the full Congress and send it on to the President so he can sign it into law.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this Sunday, numerous students, parents, and alumni of my Alma Mater, Archmere Academy in Claymont, DE, will be gathering to honor the Rev. Joseph P. McLaughlin, O. Praem. who, during his 26 years as a teacher and headmaster at Archmere, has been more than a pillar of the academy. He has been a vital part of Archmere's spirit, and a tremendous influence In the lives of thousands of young women and men. 
One of the cliches that teenagers hear again and again is how their teen years are `the best years of your lives'. Well, with all due respect, for most kids, it is not that simple. Too many adults have forgotten how those years are often filled with uncertainty and discomfort, as teenagers undergo tremendous physical and emotional changes, have their values frequently called into question and their judgement tested beyond their experience, and must make major decisions which will impact the course of their entire lives and careers. At no other time in their lives are they forced to make so many major choices with so little experience and information upon which to base those choices. It is a time when guidance, understanding, and friendship are critical. 
For more than a quarter-century, young men and women of Archmere Academy, have counted upon Father McLaughlin for that guidance, understanding, and friendship. And he has always been there for them, guided by his own deep faith, sincerity, and lifelong experience in dealing with young people. Of course, we will never know many of the specific instances of Father McLaughlin's intervention, because he is the soul of discretion and modesty, but there are countless Archmereans who will tell you that when they needed an advisor, a mentor, a friend, Father McLaughlin was there for them. 
I graduated from Archmere before Father McLaughlin arrived, but my two sons attended the school during his tenure, and my daughter is currently an Archmere student. Each has had the utmost respect for his commitment, his wisdom, and his generosity of spirit, and all have benefitted from his years of dedicated service. 
Having been involved with the school as an alumnus and as a parent, I have seen firsthand Father McLaughlin's tireless efforts result in Archmere's becoming one of the premier high schools--not only in Delaware and the surrounding region, but nationally. It is obvious that he has succeeded splendidly. The school is truly the academic beacon on the hill envisioned by the school's founders, the Norbertines. Archmere historically has attracted students of all backgrounds, and turned out promising young scholars, and, most importantly, fine young men and women with solidly-rooted values and well-placed priorities. 
In the longstanding tradition of the late Father Justin E. Diny, Headmaster Emeritus, Father McLaughlin has long recognized that a school's success can not be measured solely by the test scores of its students, or by the number of graduates moving on to prestigious universities--though by either of those standards Archmere is 
unquestionably an unqualified success--but also by the character of the young men and women who pass through its gates. With his keen sensitivity for the Academy's rich history and tradition--`The Archmere Way', as it is known on campus and throughout the community--Father McLaughlin saw to it that Archmere graduates were solid, civic-minded citizens with commitment and compassion as well as being outstanding scholars. 
As headmaster, Father McLaughlin has been admired for his personal decency, his quiet and gentlemanly way, his ability to listen to all sides before coming to a decision, and his vision for Archmere's mission and its future. He has long recognized that Archmere's future lies in its past, in terms of both history and tradition. In his belief that Archmere alumni--those who have had such a tradition imbued in their characters--should play a vital role in sustaining and nurturing the Academy's atmosphere, Father McLaughlin has uniquely enriched the lives of all those students who attended Archmere during his tenure. As a result of Father McLaughlin's genuine commitment to maintaining the unbroken chain--from Archmereans to Archers to Auks--past and present Archmere alumni continue contributing to the school community long after their campus years are over. It is my fervent hope that this tradition--the one for which Father McLaughlin worked so hard to perpetuate--the idea that an Archmere education is but the first step in a lifetime of involvement, will be a cornerstone of the Academy for all succeeding generations of Archmere students. 
Father McLaughlin will now redirect his tireless energies and many talents to his new position as novice master and formation director for the Daylesford Abbey, where he will continue in his familiar role as mentor and counselor, as he matures new members of his order, thus ensuring that his enthusiasm, dedication, and legacy of service to the community will be instilled in yet future generations of teachers, students, and community-minded men and women of faith. As he embarks upon that challenge, all of us who love Archmere and the traditions our alma mater stands for, wish our friend Father McLaughlin him well, for his service should be held up as an example and an inspiration for all who accept the challenge to teach America's youth.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I admire the Senator's tenacity, and I admire his commitment to save the American taxpayers money. His tenacity on this score has exceeded his savings. Let me explain what I mean by that. He won. If this is about deficits, he won. He was right. He saved the taxpayers millions and millions of dollars. He, through his leadership, changed the way in which we used to deal with all these radios. He has won. 
If I wouldn't be taken out of context--he would understand the humor in this--I wish he would take that old speech and send it home and say, `I won.' I mean, take credit for what you did. You did a wonderful thing. You really did. You did a wonderful thing. But their ain't no more money to save. You saved it. This doesn't cost another penny. 
That is No. 1. 
This is not about deficits. It was about deficits, but you won. You did a good thing. You reorganized the radios. 
It is like that famous line, I guess it was President Reagan's, `The Russians just do not know how to take yes for an answer.' You won. And I am not being solicitous when I say the Nation owes you a debt of gratitude. 
Now, on the second point, your tenacity: Your tenacity is well known, but I think in this case it is misplaced. This isn't about deficits anymore. Let's talk about what it really is about. 
It is about whether or not Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty are anachronisms or still have a relevance--no matter how well run they are, no matter how streamlined they are, no matter how efficient they are, no matter how cost effective they are. 
That is the core of the debate between the Senator and I, although I suspect he would characterize it differently. I think they are vitally important. 
It is not communism now. It is chaos now. It is not communism. It is the threat of totalitarianism. It is not communism. It is freedom, market economies, and it is about journalistic integrity and independence. 
Everything the Senator said is factually correct except one thing. How do I explain it? I think the rhetorical question is: Tell me how these are independent? I will tell you: Forty years of history. All of Eastern Europe said, `When I hear VOA, I hear the State Department. When I hear Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe, I hear an independent voice.' That is literally how it worked. 
I don't presume to compete with my friend from Wisconsin--and I am not being solicitous when I say this--who is a Rhodes scholar and a man of significant accomplishment, with my knowledge of history. I am not trying to play games and educate him, except I suggest to him that he ask those Eastern European freedom fighters of the past 40 years. They knew that the Federal Government paid for Radio Free Europe or Radio Liberty. Why did they listen to it and take what it said as gospel and not the Voice of America, or other pronouncements that came out? The reason was the same reason that exists today in China. We set up a thing called Radio Free Asia, the same category Radio Free Europe used to be in--still is in. 
What is the difference? Our Ambassador in Beijing can say with all honesty--and the Chinese Government knows that it is true--`I can't control those guys.' 
What do they do? Let me give you an example of what would not happen if these radios, as we call them, were within the State Department where we moved the USIA. They would not at this moment be able to read on air the memoirs of Wei Jing Sheng, one of China's leading dissidents who is in prison. It is driving the Chinese Government crazy that the people of China can hear unobstructed his memoirs being read on air. 
Do you think the Secretary of State--this one or the last 
one--would have the nerve in the mix of negotiations with the Chinese on everything from proliferation to trade to upset the apple cart? I can see it now. Beijing picking up the phone, and saying, `Stop, or we do the following with regard to these other negotiations.' We have seen it happen a hundred times. But Beijing knows that the way we have set this up means that the President cannot control it. He can come up to us and say, `Don't fund it any longer.' Or he can try to stack the board to get people on the board who will not allow journalistic independence. 
But the reason why it works is that we have 40 years' experience--40 years of watching it work. The bona fides of these radios have been proven. 
So the Senator is correct. Absent this history, one would say this is a veil. There are only four or five veils between the radios and independence and they are nothing but veils. History indicates that they are walls, and that they brought walls tumbling down--the Berlin wall. 
I acknowledge that I probably feel more strongly about the radios and their independence than a majority of my colleagues. But I truly believe, Mr. President, if they were needed during the cold war, they are needed in this decade of chaos as much as they were then. 
Look, what happens in China, in large part, is going to be a product of what the people of China know is happening. 
My friend, Senator Kerry, who shares the view of my friend from Wisconsin, says, `Look, we have CNN.' That is true. `Look, we have the Internet.' That is true. They are all very positive and they are real and they are genuine, but I would argue they make my case. Because really what my friends are saying--I will speak for Senator Kerry--is that, although the radios are independent, we don't need this other independent voice now because we have this independent thing called CNN and we have this thing called the Worldnet. I say to you, things are better than they were because we do have CNN. I say to you things are better in the world in terms of the access to information throughout China because we have the Worldnet. But I say to you, we will be, in the ultimate sense, penny-wise and pound-foolish if we take what also is a proven, genuinely important, worldwide, respected vehicle called the radios and do them in. 
And what for? What money are we going to save? What are we saving here? Let us get this straight--not that the Senator has not been straight; he has been. But, for me, because I am kind of simple-minded, let's reorganize this and lay it out. For me, it is important to understand the pieces. The first piece of this is, the Senator says that there is all this bloated bureaucracy in this board that used to run the radios. He is right. There was leadership. We changed that. We cut these bloated salaries. We cut out the fat. We made them use the same transmitters. We consolidated the ability to transmit these messages over the air. We literally moved our operation in Europe into Prague from Germany. We did a lot of things. This bill does not change one single solitary bit of the reform that has taken place. 
Then my friend says we are going to spend more money. We put caps--through his leadership--on the amount of money that could be spent in these functions. We maintained these caps. If I can find my place in my notes here, I will find out exactly what the caps are. What page am I on? The caps for RFE/RL are $75 million a year; Radio Free Asia, $22 million a year. These caps are kept on this legislation. 
My friend says we have created this new bureaucracy. We have created no new bureaucracy. We created this new board in 1994 through his leadership. It upsets my friend that I am not sucking that board into the State Department. There is USIA. It is sitting out here and it has, within USIA, that board. In the reorganization, led by the Senator from North Carolina, we take all the agencies that are sitting outside there and bring them into the State Department. So we take all of the USIA out except for one thing: We leave this board sitting there. We do not recreate it. We just leave it where it was, independent. But still with all the strings attached as to how much money it can spend, all the requirements for RFE and RFL regarding privatization. They all remain, but what also remains is the journalistic integrity, the inability of the Secretary of State to say, hey, don't--don't broadcast those memoirs. 
I am not suggesting this Secretary would say that. I do not know what she would say. But there is nothing she can do about that, or that a future Secretary can do about that. 
The Senator suggests there is going to be a new bloated bureaucracy. We have a thing in the law that exists right now called the Economy Act, which means that any lawyers that are needed by RFE/RFL, any lawyers needed by the board that is going to conduct overseas radios, can be lawyers that can be borrowed from the existing lawyers in USIA. There is no requirement to hire anybody new. And you have caps on what we can spend on them anyway. 
That is how it works right now. VOA--my friend always talks about RFE and RL, Radio Liberty. There is the Voice of America, Radio and TV Marti, and Radio Free Asia. They are sitting there. We have to privatize, under the law, RFE and RL, by the same date required in the original legislation. We kept that in. But we still have these other three major pieces out there. So the notion of the board's responsibilities rests in the management of those as 
well, even when privatization occurs. 
The other rhetorical question I would ask my friend is, he says this undermines privatization, that this proposal to privatize the European radios, which we urged in the sense of Congress in 1994, would be undermined. This provision remains intact. Moreover, the Senator is sponsor of an amendment asking for periodic reports toward this objective, which the committee included in this bill. And, as I said, the board oversees more than the European radios, so they will have plenty to do after privatization. The others are not part of the privatization scheme. 
Keep in mind the overarching rationale for privatization. It is, hey, we don't need this message going into Eastern Europe or Central Europe or the former Soviet Republics. 
I want to tell you, I sure would like that message going into Byelarus. I am glad it is going in now. I sure like the idea the message is going into Bosnia. I sure like the messages going into these former Soviet states or Soviet-client states. But I acknowledge that is a debate for another day, whether or not these radios make sense anyway. I think they make a great deal of sense. 
But make no mistake about it, that is the core of the distinction between what the Senator from Wisconsin and I view to be the right course of action. You notice that the Senator is always painfully honest. He points out and acknowledges he had the privatization language still in here, but he presumes it will not be privatized now that the board is sitting out here and staying out here. I would argue that the likelihood of privatization occurring is in direct proportion to how much light is shed on the process. When you have this board sitting out here by itself, justifying its existence and its actions, it is a lot more likely that we are going to pay attention to it, particularly when we have to confirm the head of the board. As a matter of fact, the whole board requires Senate confirmation. 
The Senate worries about the radios not going toward privatization. How many members of the board are there, eight? He is going to have eight shots, plus Mr. Duffy, who is going to be the new Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy. He has plenty of chances. He has nine chances in confirmation hearings before our committee. Put the board inside and it's a different story.

Mr. BIDEN. This is just one paragraph from it. 
. . . the Board believes that a transfer of existing broadcasting support costs and personnel from USIA to the international broadcasting entity would be a `cost neutral' transaction within the foreign affairs budget function. Such a transfer could cover space costs and management support services currently provided by USIA, including security, accounting, payroll, training, and procurement. 
This notion that salaries would explode isn't realistic. We can't even get a raise for judges here, which most of my colleagues tell me we should get. They have to come with an appropriation every year. You think these salaries are going to explode and that this is going to be a sitting duck? 
My view is, if I can see it, if I can feel it, if I have to confirm it and it is not buried in an organization, I have a lot more impact on it. Look, as I said, there is a lot to say, but the former VOA directors, the Voice of America directors, they do not argue, Democrat and Republican, that we should put the radios and VOA into the State Department. They say keep it where it is. 
So, I really admire the Senator. I will say again, the people of Wisconsin should be thankful and appreciative that he kept his commitment. He saved them money. Like in that movie, `Show me the money.' You saved them the money. Now, move on, Senator. There ain't no more money to save unless you are eliminating all of the radios. And if you move them into the State Department, which your amendment would do, that will be the effect. 
I asked my colleague, because we are good friends, I asked, how long are you going to go on this? He said, well, I am going to make my points and then go as long as required to have to respond to your responses. I said, you mean if I don't keep responding, you won't respond? 
I think he implicitly said yes. So I am going to stop responding to his responses in the hope that he will stop responding and we can get on with the vote. Hopefully, the vote will be like it was in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, overwhelmingly, a majority of Democrats and majority of Republicans staying committed to the savings he has initiated and staying committed to the radios. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, again, the Senator is always straightforward. He indicates he worries that this is a scenario for reenacting a set of circumstances, putting in place a set of circumstances, that will allow the abuses that took place before to come around again. I am not being smart when I say this, but you, Senator Feingold are going to be here. The likelihood of that happening with you sitting here in this Chamber and with it sitting out there by itself is zero, unless all of a sudden you go back to Wisconsin and decide that you don't like your--and I mean this positively--your crusade for fiscal responsibility anymore. 
I pointed out in the beginning, one thing I have found out about you is your tenacity. I can't believe there is any reasonable prospect that the scenario you fear has any prospect of occurring while you are here. I don't think it is occurring period, but in terms of what is likely to happen, I don't want to be a board member when they come back and tell you, `By the way, we're not privatizing,' and `By the way, we want more money,' and `By the way, we're increasing our salaries,' all of which would have to come through here. 
I will argue again, if it is buried inside the State Department, you have a much better chance of it occurring there than if it is sitting out in the cold light of day, and I mean that sincerely.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I really have no question, just a statement. 
I thank the Senator from Alaska for the way he is handling this. I literally just got off the phone with the Secretary of State, who said, knowing you were speaking now, that when you finished, or at any time that is convenient for you, she is willing to personally assure you, and authorized me to tell you as well, that she makes a personal commitment that she will coordinate more closely with you and any Member of the Senate on Taiwan policy in a contemporaneous fashion. She is willing to assert that to you. 
I know no one here doubts her word. But I realize time is close in terms of the schedule here. But she is prepared and ready and willing to take your call and anxious to personally make that commitment to you. But she authorized me to be able to say what I just said on the floor. 
I thank the Senator for the way in which he has concluded to handle this matter, and I appreciate the Secretary's willingness to be available and contemporaneously discuss these issues with the Senator from Alaska, who, obviously, along with the Senator from North Carolina, I do not know of any two people that have shown a greater interest in Taiwan than those two of my colleagues.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, while we are waiting for Senator Murkowski to have his conversation, I would ask if the Chair will indulge me for just 2 minutes here. 
It is remarkable, quite frankly, that we have made the progress that we have as rapidly as we have. I want to publicly thank the chairman, for we both stuck with this compromise notwithstanding there are individual amendments we would have liked to have voted for. I want the record to show that the chairman did the same thing. 
But there is one issue which I realize we cannot resolve now, and that is this issue of whether or not we could work out the ability of the administration to negotiate how to handle the $107 million that is owed from the U.N. We cannot do that now, I agree. 
I just want to suggest to the chairman that although I will not change anything, that between now and the dance, now and the conference, we will be working hard with the chairman and his colleagues to see if we can figure out some solution to that. But I understand there is no commitment to that at all. 
As we move toward final passage, Mr. President, of this bill, I would like to acknowledge the tremendous work and help that the chairman and I have received from the staff of the Foreign Relations Committee. 
On the chairman's side--he will obviously thank people; and it is usually the tradition for us to thank our own staff--but I must tell the chairman that everything he ever advertised about Admiral Nance is correct, and more. I hope he will forgive me for thanking his staff first on this, but Admiral Nance and Tom Kleine, who has been sitting with the chairman the whole time, Patty McNerney and Chris Walker of his staff have been a pleasure to work with. I guess when staffers come up to the Hill they wonder whether or not they are going to get to deal with the principals. I am probably one of the principals they hope they do not have to deal with. They have seen more of me than their families over the last 4 months, but I want to thank them for their consideration. 
I would also like to thank the minority staff. Especially I want to thank my staff director, Ed Hall, who has had--and this is the way it works here. It is not sufficient here that the Members have a good relationship. It is also important that the corresponding staffs have a good relationship. I know that Ed Hall has an inordinately high regard for Admiral Nance. I know the feeling is mutual. I want to particularly thank Ed Hall, if you excuse the point of personal privilege here, for agreeing to stay on. He was the former chairman's and former ranking member's staff director. And I asked him to stay in that capacity for me, and he was incredibly useful to me, and, thankfully, he decided to stay on. 
I also want to thank my minority counsel, Brian McKeon. Brian came to work with me, I might point out, Mr. President, right out of college, I guess almost 18 years ago. While he was working with me, he went to law school at night. He was a first-rate student at Georgetown, went off to the Court, clerked for the Court, was going to practice law, and I talked him into coming back here. And I just want to thank him. He handled all of the details of this bill. 
I was kidding the other day, if we have an MVP on my side, it is Puneet Talwar. Puneet was the guy who, along with Tom on your staff, Mr. Chairman, got stuck with the detailed negotiations on chemical weapons, on the U.N., on everything else. And on my team, if there is an MVP, Puneet is going to get it. 
Mike Haltzel, a professor, has been invaluable to me on European matters. Frank Jannuzi, Munro Richardson, and Ed Levine of my staff, and Diana Ohlbaum, Nancy Stetson, and Janice O'Connell on my colleagues' staff--that is, Dodd, Kerry and Sarbanes--have been incredibly helpful to me. 
I also want to thank Dawn Ratliff, Kathi Taylor, and John Lis, who is one of our fellows, and also thank Ursula McManus and Erin Logan, and our interns who have given up their valuable time. 
Let me conclude--and I will do it now while we are waiting so that I do not take the time of my colleagues. For my colleagues who are listening, I am not holding up your plans. We cannot move anyway until the distinguished Senator from Alaska finishes his conversation with the Secretary of State. 
But, Mr. President, the passage today--and I am hoping and expecting that we will pass the Foreign Relations authorization --represents a significant bipartisan commitment to the United States' continued engagement in the world. 
First, the basic authorization legislation for the Department of State, the U.S. Information Agency, the Arms Control Disarmament Agency and the Peace Corps marks a bipartisan commitment to restore funding which will enhance our diplomatic readiness abroad. 
We all know that funding for foreign policy spending is the lowest it has been in 20 years. Today's action by the Senate is a heartening expression of bipartisan support for our diplomats on the front lines of American engagement abroad. 
We have restored full funding for the State Department's core missions, fully funded the education and cultural exchange programs, the National Endowment for Democracy, the Peace Corps, and international broadcasting. We have increased the funding for Radio Free Asia at a critical time in that region's history. We have done a great deal. 
Second, the Senate has passed landmark legislation that provides a framework for reorganization of the foreign affairs agency that is totally consistent with the plan announced by the President of the United States on April 18. Like the President's plan, this bill provides for integration of ACDA within the State Department within 1 year, the integration of the USIA within 2 years, and the partial integration for the Agency for International Development in the State Department. 
Additionally, it maintains the current structure for U.S.-sponsored international broadcasting but keeps it outside the Department of State so as to ensure its journalistic independence. 
Finally, Mr. President, the Senate enacted a bipartisan comprehensive package--is about to, I hope--which provides for payment of $819 million in U.S. arrearages to the United Nations. This proposal, Mr. President, will go a long way toward restoring the fiscal health of the United Nations while spurring needed reforms for that world body. 
Equally important, this agreement, a bipartisan plan supported by the administration, will allow us to get a very difficult and contentious issue behind us so we can move forward on the important issues on the foreign policy agenda. Ideally, we should not have attached the conditions, but I am a pragmatist and I recognize, as does the administration, that there will be no approval of U.N. arrearages in Congress absent some conditions, and the conditions which the chairman has asked for are reasonable. 
So we had a choice. We can continue to press unconditional payment for arrearages and let this issue fester for another Congress or agree to a reasonable set of conditions that permits us to pay our debts. I believe the action the Senate is about to take will be a correct decision, one in the best interests of the United States. It has been a long time and it is time to end the long-festering feud between the United Nations and Washington and our unpaid back dues, and it is time to bring up needed reform to that world body so it can more efficiently perform its missions. It is time to move forward together to restore the bipartisan commitment to the United States which has been part of that Nation's proud heritage for 50 years. 
Mr. President, the people in my State--small, I acknowledge--are used to bipartisanship. Senator Roth and I are close political allies and friends. Our lone Congressman Mike Castle, who is a Republican, our Democratic Governor, we are all used to getting things done in a bipartisan way in my State. I have always felt if that tradition could be carried back to the Senate, it would better serve our Nation. 
I want to say I did not doubt it, but I am sure a number of neutral observers would have doubted it, the Secretary of State is not only a friend of the chairman, so am I. The idea that Joe Biden, a Democratic Senator from Delaware, and Jesse Helms, a Republican Senator from North Carolina, could operate in this way does not surprise either of us, but I am sure it surprises the living devil out of an awful lot of other people. 
I am reminded of something that was said to me once by Jim Eastland. It is a true story. I was in a difficult campaign fight in the late 1980's, and I saw Chairman Eastland. I was flunking, you might say, what I call the slope-of-the-shoulder test. When you ask a candidate how they are doing in a race and they go, `Oh, I am doing fine,' you know they are not doing very well. I guess I had that look like I'm losing. The Chairman pulled me aside and said, `Joe, what could Jim Eastland do for you in Delaware?' I said, `Mr. Chairman, in some places you would help and some you would hurt.' He said, `I will make a commitment. I will campaign for you or against you, whichever will help the most.' 
I realize my saying nice things about the chairman may not help him, but I mean it sincerely when I say that he has been an absolute gentleman. He has kept his commitment, which I never doubted he would, and this is evidence of the fact that if reasonable men are willing to sit down and talk--we had a real sit-down meeting, when I took over this committee for the Democrats, with the chairman of the full committee, and we agreed on the broad outlines of each of our agendas. The most important one was to make the committee work and make foreign policy function and be a positive force. He has kept every one of those commitments. He has won some and lost some. I have won some and lost some. But I think the Nation is better served for it. 
I conclude, Mr. President, with this last comment. If Senator Helms and I had come to the floor in January and said to this body, `By the way, by midsummer we will present to you a bipartisan plan on the floor of the five most contentious issues to face the U.S. Senate in foreign policy,' I think you would have thought that it was time for both of us to leave because we might have been certifiable. We knew we could do that, and with the great help of the staff that I have mentioned, we have been able to do that, and with the cooperation and assistance of the administration. 
So I want to thank the President for committing his administration to deal forthrightly and in detail with us, and I 
want to thank the chairman and his staff for accommodating an arrangement by which we hammered these things out. We produced a significant package here. Neither one of us are naive enough to suggest we know what will happen, if and when it passes here, with any degree of certainty, but we each kept our commitment to one another. I think the body, based on the votes we have seen today, I hope it reflects the feeling on the part of our colleagues that we have, that a bipartisan foreign policy is in the best interests of the United States. 
I again thank the chairman, and I yield the floor. I will not say any more at the end of the process after Senator Murkowski comes out.

We have $819 million in our bill, which you don't like, nor do I, and the fact that we make the United Nations meet benchmarks before it is released. But assuming it was released, how does the Senator's amendment provide any more money to pay the arrearages that the Senator believes that we owe?

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, to state the obvious, there are no two Senators of whom I have higher regard than the two Senators who are proposing this amendment. We use those kinds of phrases around here, but I know they both know that I mean it. 
Now, I have a little difficulty with their approach here, not the principle that they are proposing, because, as I said from the outset and as the chairman will tell you repeatedly, and I suspect the Senator from New Hampshire, who is on the floor, may tell you, and I know our new colleague from Nebraska will tell you, I am not one who thinks we should be attaching conditions. I am a minority in that view, along with my two colleagues, but I am not one who thinks we should be attaching conditions. So I agree with them on that. 
But I do think they overplay the point a bit in making it appear as though the Senator from North Carolina has in effect co-opted the Senator from Delaware into signing on to these conditions and that this is something totally new. Let me remind people of a few historical facts about conditions.

I get $107 million from the money the United Nations acknowledges they owe the United States for peacekeeping, and I get $27 million for money that the United Nations owes the United States for tax equalization. 
That is how I get it. It is not out of the $819.

Mr. BIDEN. You find it in acknowledgments. It does not have to be in the bill. They owe us $107 million for peacekeeping and $27 million for tax equalization. That is money the administration has to use to meet its obligations.

Mr. BIDEN. Absolutely correct, but I was making the point in response to the question will there be enough money to pay our allies in the first 2 years? And the answer is yes because of the $575 million out of this bill and roughly $134 million that is owed to us.

Mr. BIDEN. The reason is because, just like when the bank owes you money, they owe you money--the question is how much we owe them. You are saying we owe them $1.370 billion. My time is running out. Maybe later the Senator from North Carolina might yield me a few minutes. 
I reserve the remainder of my time for my friend from Virginia, Senator Robb. I am out of time. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to offer a perfecting amendment to Senator DeWine's amendment No. 383. I offer this amendment on behalf of Senator Dodd. It amends the pending amendment to add two additional categories of individuals who may be excluded under this amendment: First, members of the Haitian high command; and, second, members of the paramilitary organization known as FRAPH. 
Both of these organizations were responsible for serious human rights abuses during the coup regime from 1991 to 1994. 
I ask unanimous consent that the DeWine amendment be so modified to include the amendment which I send to the desk from Senator Dodd.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Senator from North Carolina has been kind enough to give me the minute to respond. 
The Lugar amendment does not have one single penny more in it than this bill. We do pay all of our allies the arrearages that we owe them with the bill in the way it is drawn up. The administration has supported this compromise we have come up with. 
This basically is the way to get the job done. But I emphasize, there is not one additional penny in the Lugar amendment. There is no distinction in how we get paid. The principle is, should there be any conditions placed on the United Nations? This bill does place conditions they can meet. The Senator, on principle, says none should be there. If you wish to put conditions at all, you should vote with us. If you want no conditions, vote with him. But it is the same amount of money. 
I urge that you vote `no' on the Lugar amendment.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, last Thursday, 55 of us joined Senators Leahy of Vermont and Hagel of Nebraska in cosponsoring the Landmine Elimination Act of 1977. This landmark legislation will bar, as of January 1, 2000, the use of any U.S. funds for new deployments of antipersonnel landmines. 
I am proud to be one of the cosponsors of this legislation, which addresses a subject of terrible urgency. Every hour, more innocent civilians are killed or wounded by landmines in Angola, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Cambodia, Ecuador, and elsewhere. The scourge of landmines is so great that the United States and other governments have special aid programs to help locate and destroy landmines left over from the wars of the past. 
The United States is pursuing many avenues to battle this plague. We are a signatory of the antipersonnel landmine protocol to the Convention on Conventional Weapons, which I would hope the Senate will give its advice and consent to ratification of that protocol sometime this year. That protocol bans undetectable mines, such as the toy-like plastic butterfly mines that maim so many children. The United States is well on its way toward converting all its nondetectable mines, so there will be very few costs associated with ratification of this protocol. 
We are also engaged in negotiations in Geneva and working with the Government of Canada on the projected Ottawa convention in hopes of obtaining a worldwide ban on antipersonnel landmines. But those negotiations have left the United States in a quandary. Russia and China--the world's major suppliers of antipersonnel landmines--have refused to participate in the Ottawa process to achieve an immediate ban on these mines. And Mexico has blocked the U.N. Conference on Disarmament from opening the formal negotiations in which Russia and China are willing to participate. 
Nobody is clear on whether Mexico's step reflects frustration with the idea of gradualism in eliminating antipersonnel landmines, or a desire to continue using such mines in Mexico's own war against the domestic guerrilla movements. What is clear, however, is that bold steps are needed to regain momentum in the crusade to end this most horrendous aspect of modern warfare. 
Two years ago, two-thirds of this body voted for a moratorium on new antipersonnel landmine deployments, beginning in February 1999. The Landmine Elimination Act of 1977 will go a giant step further, by committing the United States to just say no to these mines on January 1, 2000. This action will put the United States on a higher moral plane than ever before on this issue. With a legally binding commitment to end our own role in sowing needless destruction, perhaps we can more effectively influence Russia and China and Mexico to step up to the responsibility of protecting the innocents even when we make war on our enemies.

Mr. BIDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the legislation before us. Today, the Senate begins consideration of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, comprehensive legislation regarding the institutional structure of and the funding for America's foreign policy. This bill contains much more than the usual 2-year authorization and funding for our foreign affairs agency which we attempt to bring to the floor out of the Foreign Relations Committee. It addresses two important issues which were the focus of much-heated debate in the last Congress. 
Specifically, this bill provides for the payment of U.S. back dues to the United Nations--I need not say a very controversial and hotly debated subject in this body--contingent, I might add, on specific reforms in that body. 
I note parenthetically that I spoke on Friday with the Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and he indicated to me that it was his hope and expectation that the Senate as a whole, that I in particular and the chairman of the full committee, Senator Helms, would be pleased with a number of the reforms he has initiated consistent with what he indicated he would do. Hopefully, they will be acted upon by the General Assembly this summer. But whether they are or not, the back dues are contingent upon specific reforms in that body. 
Additionally, the bill establishes a framework for the reorganization of U.S. foreign policy agencies, which is, in my view, totally consistent with the plan announced by the President of the United States in April. The bill, Mr. President, that we have before us is not only complex and wide ranging, in that it covers more than one specific subject, but it is also the product of what I think most people would acknowledge is a serious bipartisan effort on the part of the chairman of the full committee, members of the subcommittee in the majority, members of the subcommittee in the minority, and me as the ranking member of the committee representing the Democratic position. In addition to that, the administration has been part of this lengthy and very detailed negotiation for the past several months. 
Last Thursday, after a markup that lasted less than 3 hours in the Foreign Relations Committee, the Committee on Foreign Relations voted overwhelmingly, 14 to 4, to report this bill, with a majority of the members on each side of the aisle voting in favor of it. I am grateful to the majority leader, Senator Lott, and to the chairman of the full committee, Senator Helms, for working together to bring this bill to the floor so promptly. The bipartisan cooperation on this bill thus far is a testament to the commitment of both the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the Republican leadership, along with the administration, to attempt to construct what we all talk about a lot but seldom occurs: a truly bipartisan consensus on American foreign policy. 
This bill is quite detailed, so with the indulgence of my colleagues, I will take, which is the norm around here and the requirement, a few moments to explain, as the Democratic manager of the bill, what its major provisions are. 
First, the bill contains the basic authorization legislation for the Department of State, or, put in everyday parlance, money, the money for running the Department of State and our suggestion, as all authorizers do, to the appropriators as to how much money we should be spending. 
First, it contains the basic authorization legislation for the Department of State, the U.S. Information Agency, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the Peace Corps. 
The funding levels in the bill closely reflect that of the 
President's budget. The total amount authorized for fiscal 1998 is $6.1 billion, as compared to the President's request of $6.2 billion. In fiscal year 1999, and this is a 2-year authorization, the amount provided in this bill is $5.9 billion. This modest reduction represents the reduction in the international organization account consistent with the administration's commitments. During debate on this legislation, I will explain that in more detail. 
Within this framework, we have provided, first, full funding for the Department of State's core activities; that is, the diplomatic and consular programs, salaries and expenses, and protection and maintenance of our embassies--full funding. It provides 99 percent of the funding for the U.S. Information Agency's diplomatic programs; full funding for our exchange programs, the Fulbright program and others; and full funding for international broadcasting. It provides full funding for the National Endowment for Democracy, a bipartisan operation that has had very great success; full funding for the Peace Corps and the Asia Foundation; and $819 million over 3 years to pay our U.N. arrears. 
After several years of reductions in spending for diplomatic readiness, I am heartened we are restoring funds to the international affairs account, particularly to the core activities of the State Department. Although the cold war has ended, Mr. President, the need for American leadership in world affairs has not. Our diplomats often represent the frontline of our national defense, and with the downsizing of the U.S. military presence overseas, the maintenance of a robust and effective diplomatic capability has become all the more important, in my opinion, and in the opinion of a vast majority of people who study the issue. 
Despite the reduction in our military readiness abroad, the increased importance of diplomatic readiness to our national security has not been reflected in recent Federal budgets. According to a study of the Congressional Research Service prepared earlier this year at my request, foreign policy spending is now at its lowest level in 20 years. Stated in 1998 dollars, the budget in the current fiscal year is $18.77 billion, which is 25 percent below the annual average of $25 billion over the past 2 decades, the past 20 years, and 30 percent below the level of 10 years ago, which was very near the end of the Reagan administration. 
Mr. President, I emphasize, again, that this is a lot of money, but out of a $1.7 or almost $1.8 trillion budget and in light of the fact we are the world's only superpower it is a small percentage. To continue to reduce our commitment to foreign affairs at a time when we are necessarily reducing our military activity abroad, our military presence abroad, seems to me to be counterproductive. It seems to me that in the former Soviet Union, the former Soviet states, the newly independent states, we should be having an increased diplomatic presence there. We should be opening consulates; we should have a robust economic presence there; and yet, as a matter of fact, we have been cutting back. This bill reverses that trend. 
Let me put it another way. This halts the trend of downward movement and recognizes our need to engage the world with diplomacy and our foreign policy, not with our military. 
So I am pleased that we are reversing the hemorrhaging of funds away from foreign policy, according to this bill. 
Second, the bill provides a framework for the reorganization of the foreign affairs agencies that is consistent with the President's announced plan on April 18. The backdrop for this, I know the Presiding Officer knows very well, is that the world has changed drastically. The world has changed drastically, as we all discuss and talk about, but we have not reorganized the foreign policy establishment in our country. We have not reorganized our foreign policy apparatus. 
Although it made a great deal of sense, in my view, in the past years to have, for example, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency separate and apart from the State Department and our Agency 
for International Development separate and apart, and other departments separate and apart, it seems to me, and it seems to most observers, including the administration, that it no longer makes sense. Here the credit must go to the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He has been consistently advocating a major overhaul of the State Department, as well as these other agencies, in terms of consolidation. 
I might add that there are provisions in this legislation that, obviously, I should have said at the outset that I don't like. There are provisions I would like to change. For example, I think we should be funding more money for the United Nations, although I acknowledge the amount we funded can get the job done. I think we should be making additional changes and giving greater flexibility to AID than we do in this legislation. The fact of the matter is, this is a product of a compromise on three major, major, major initiatives. As a consequence of that, neither Senator Helms nor I got all that we bargained for in this. That is the nature of compromise. So this has been a very important element of this whole package for the chairman of the committee. 
Like the President's plan, the bill that we bring to the floor today provides for integration of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency within the State Department within 1 year and ensures that the arms control function is maintained in a position of prominence within the Department of State. 
When I went months ago to negotiate or lay out how I would like to proceed and was willing to proceed with the chairman of the full committee, I indicated to him that I would work in a bipartisan way to deal with the reorganization, deal with the United Nations and deal with the funding of the State Department, assuming that he was not using this reorganization and other methods as merely a means for us to withdraw from the world. He not only indicated that it was not his objective, he has followed through and has shown it was not his objective, evidence the fact that we essentially fully fund the State Department for the next 2 years and he has agreed to significant latitude for the State Department in the bill and its reorganization efforts, compared to the bills he has introduced for the last 2 years. 
So, like the President's plan, the bill we bring to the floor today provides for the integration of not only ACDA, but also the U.S. Information Agency [USIA], into the State Department. It provides for a 2-year transition for that to occur and creates a position of Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy. 
Again, I indicated that my concern was that as we bring these specialized agencies of significant consequence into the State Department, where they have never been before, that they be brought in at a level commensurate with their significance, that they not be subsumed in the State Department and essentially lose their visibility and significance. 
It seems to me, Mr. President, arms control will be the single most important element of American foreign policy over the next two decades. For it to be taken out of its independent status and subsumed into the State Department would be a mistake. What we do is we establish in this bill a position of prominence for the person who heads ACDA, as well as for USIA, and we create the position of Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy. There is only one difference in that it integrates the Office of Public Liaison and Legislative Affairs into the State Department within 1 year. 
The reason for that is, we think, quite simple. It is nothing complex. We think it can be done quickly and that it saves bureaucracy and it saves money. 
Additionally, this bill puts some flesh on the bones of the President's plan with regard to international broadcasting. The President's plan was virtually silent on this question, stating only that `the distinctiveness and editorial integrity of the Voice of America and the broadcasting agencies would be preserved.' 
That is just what we have done here. 
This bill just holds and protects that principle by maintaining the existing Government structure established by Congress in 1994 consolidating all U.S. Government-sponsored broadcasting. I might add, this was a money-saving effort led by the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold. He has succeeded, at least in large part, in one of his objectives, which was to save the American taxpayers a great deal of money. We have eliminated a bloated bureaucracy. We have consolidated services, we have consolidated technical capability, and we have preserved the integrity of the radios. 
By radios I mean Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty--the things that Lech Walesa said helped bring down the Berlin Wall more than anything else. We established Radio Free Asia and Radio Marti and TV Marti relating to Cuba. All of these maintain their journalistic integrity because of their editorial integrity. 
So we have done, I believe, what the administration indicated it wished to do; that is, maintain the distinctiveness and editorial integrity of these radios as well as the Voice of America. This bill upholds and protects that principle. 
As I said, what we have done is consolidated from 1994 all the U.S. Government-sponsored broadcasting, that is Voice of America, Radio and TV Marti, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and Worldnet TV, under the supervision of one oversight board known as the Broadcasting Board of Governors. That has been done. 
Importantly, however, the board and the broadcasters below them will not be merged into the Department of State where their journalistic integrity would be questioned and greatly at risk. The radios will, however, continue to play an important role in advancing U.S. foreign policy objectives. 
The board will have what I call a dotted line relationship with the State Department in that the new Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy, the same function now performed by the Director of USIA, will have a seat on the board. Additionally, the Secretary of State will provide foreign policy guidance to the board and will be consulted about additions or deletions of language services currently performed by the radios. 
Like the President's plan, the bill maintains the Agency for International Development, that is AID, as a separate agency, but provides for its partial integration into the State Department. 
This has been the most controversial part of all of this, I might say, Mr. President. There is a constituency that has a very solid case to be made--I think a very strong case to be made--suggesting that the expertise buildup by AID, headed now by Brian Atwood, and by many other distinguished persons before him, is unique in that it is the outfit that literally goes out and provides for digging the wells, bringing the water, and bringing the new projects to those areas that need the help. 
It was very important that we not take that expertise and merge it into the State Department, get it lost with every other GS-15 or 17 or 12 and lose the distinctive nature of those experiences. There is a difference between those who do foreign policy and those who dig wells. It is this distinctive nature--the ability to produce and deliver services--that says we, the United States of America, through our aid program, are going to assist populations in need. 
But it has been, I think, a legitimate concern, in light of the new world we now face, that there be more policy sway on the part of the person dealing with the foreign policy of America--the Secretary of State. We have tried to accommodate that, Mr. President. Just as the President announced, the AID administrator will be placed under the direct authority of the Secretary of State and, consistent with the plan's objectives of improving coordination between the regional bureaus at State and AID, the Secretary of State will have authority to coordinate this aid policy. 
This is causing a bit of a flap, though. This has been the single biggest thing that, to the average American and I suspect the average Senator, sounds merely like a giant bureaucratic snafu 
in that somebody's turf is being stepped on and somebody else's turf is not being accommodated, et cetera. It is more than that. It is more serious than that. But I suspect we have not heard the end of what we attempted to do in this legislation. 
The concept of aid coordinators, that is, having aid coordinated by the State Department, is not new in this legislation. Since the early 1990's, the State Department has had such coordinators that have supervised the aid programs in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. 
Under the leadership of President Bush and, prior to that, under the leadership of the Democratically controlled Foreign Relations Committee, we first had a thing called the SEED program and then the President expanded that, President Bush expanded it into the Freedom Support Act. That aid program involved deciding how much aid would go to the Ukraine, how much aid would go to Russia, et cetera. And we set up a special coordinator within the State Department to do that. 
So this is not a new notion we are applying here. This legislation, quite frankly, is modeled on that concept. Indeed, the language we use here is borrowed directly from the Freedom Support Act. But nonetheless we are going to hear more about this because some of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, have very, very strong views about this. I suspect we will be debating this aspect of the reorganization more than any other. 
Two other issues bear emphasis and belie any charge that we are micromanaging the reorganization of the State Department. 
First, unlike the bill reported by this committee in the last Congress, this reorganization bill does not--and I thank the chairman for doing this because it is one of the major disagreements he and I had--this bill does not, as the last bill introduced in the Congress did, mandate specific reductions in budget or personnel. Instead, it requires only a periodic report on savings that are achieved. 
Second, the committee has provided no directives--none--on the promised reinvention of the State Department itself. 
Let me be clear about this. The President's plan stated that a central element in the plan would be an `intensified, comprehensive internal reform program at State.' In other words, the reorganization of State by itself. 
Again, for my colleagues listening to this, there are basically three pieces to this reorganization. One is you have the State Department sitting here and then you have these very important agencies, USIA, AID--I think those are the acronyms --U.S. Information Agency, the Administration for International Development and the Arms Control Disarmament Agency. 
For historical reasons, they had all been, if you will, satellite agencies outside the direct, immediate control of the State Department, although all related to the State Department. That is one big piece. What do you do about that matrix? 
There is a second big piece here. The second big piece is, within the State Department, how many Undersecretaries of State do you have? How many Assistant Secretaries of State? What do you do in terms of how they relate to one another? How many personnel should be in the field and not in the field? How many consulates should you have and not have? These are all very important decisions. 
That is part of this $6.1 billion we are giving them to run this year and $5.9 billion in the second year of this 2-year authorization. We do not fool with that. We do not micromanage that. We respond to the concerns of the last administration and this administration. We say, `Look, you present us with a plan. You come up and you go ahead and reorganize that. We're giving you authority to go out and do it. You do it.' 
We are not micromanaging, but we are going to deal with this big, controversial subject that has been sort of rattling around for the last decade. We are going to take AID, ACDA, and USIA, and we are going to merge them in varying degrees into the State Department. 
There are those who are going to come out on the floor and say that Senator Helms and I are into micromanaging the State Department's day-to-day activities. That is simply not true. That is not what we are doing. But we are tackling the one issue no administration has really been able to successfully deal with. And that is, what do you do about these three very important agencies that have very important constituencies and very important functions? We are taking them--they have been out there by themselves now for a number of years, with good reason--and we are merging them, in light of this changed world, into the State Department. We are doing that. We are doing that, in my opinion, for several reasons. 
I will tell you my motivation for doing it. First, internally handled, I am not sure how it would ever get settled in the administration. The constituencies are significant. The bureaucracies are real. They are important. Second, I worried that if we were essentially just going to use this as an excuse to eliminate their functions, we would be doing a great disservice to the Nation. Senator Helms agreed. Senator Helms said, let us bring them into, in commensurate positions of responsibility and authority, the State Department. So we are doing that. But even within that, we leave a great deal of flexibility for the Secretary of State and the President of the United States. 
Mr. President, I believe I speak for the chairman when I express my hope that the type of reform effort that the President has indicated he wishes to undertake--that is the actual reorganization of the State Department itself, which we do not do--my sincere hope that he will in fact vigorously pursue the long overdue internal management reform needed because the State Department's problems could be compounded by the absorption of two new agencies unless reforms are made. 
So the irony here is, Mr. President, we are subsuming these organizations into the State Department, and now it is real important that the internal management and reforms within the State Department take place because, if there is difficulty in terms of organizational structures at State now, they are going to be compounded by bringing in these additional agencies. 
We leave all of the aid personnel outside here. We take policy and we put it in, but the personnel, the people who actually go out and make sure the water goes to the village, their unique capability stays out here as an independent agency. 
So the point is that we are giving the State Department and the President ample opportunity to do what they say they needed. And I believe the administration--the administration; Freudian slip--my administration, in effect, on the floor that I have to deal with is the majority party. The majority party, led by Senator Helms, has given a great deal more flexibility than they intended to give for the administration to be able to do that. Obviously, the administration would prefer, as a matter of principle, passage of legislation that delegates broad authority to the President to reorganize the whole shooting match. 
Well, in a perfect world I would prefer that as well. The truth of the matter is, it is not a perfect world. My team does not control this place. The other team controls this place. They have very different views. And I think we have worked out, in light of that, a very, very important compromise that is consistent with the overall objective the President has stated. 
But under the administration's approach, which is basically just delegate, the only moment for congressional action would be a resolution of disapproval of a plan. What the administration wanted, and if I could have waved a wand--put it another way; if I had 51 votes--I might attempt to accommodate their wish. 
But what the administration wanted was that they send a plan to us when they have the opportunity to go through it and vet it. They will say, `This is our reorganization plan, including the whole shooting works. Now, you, the Congress, either approve or disapprove it.' You can only--excuse me, you have to disapprove it. If you do not disapprove it, then it becomes law; 
it is changed. If you disapprove it, it has the benefit, if you are a President, of allowing you to get your plan passed with only one-third of the Congress plus one voting for it, because we can come along and get 51 votes and say, `No; we don't like the plan you submitted,' and disapprove it. The President then vetoes our disapproval of his plan. Now we have to override his veto. So we come back up here and we have to find a supermajority if we do not like the plan. 
So it is not something Congress would usually buy on to, any more than administrations like to buy on to giving up any prerogative, and one of their prerogatives is to reorganize the executive branch. They do not like the fact that we are doing part of that for them, which is understandable. If I were President, I would feel the same way, or if I were the Secretary of State, I would feel the same way. Conversely, Congresses are not real crazy about offers made to them that allow Presidents essentially to control the agenda, control the outcome by only getting one-third of the Congress plus one person to vote with them. 
So here we are. I now am joining the chairman of the full committee in preferring that Congress should place its positive stamp on the President's plan rather than having the chance only to give a stamp of disapproval and to be overridden by one-third plus one. 
In general terms, the committee's approach does not provide any less flexibility to reorganize. To be sure, the committee locks in the date for ultimate integration of the two agencies in question. And we are only fully integrating two agencies, USIA and ACDA. And it speeds up the partial integration of AID into State. 
Within those broad outlines the administration has considerable flexibility to implement the thousands of decisions required under reorganization. Ultimately, Mr. President, the administration will have to return to the Congress for certain authorities to carry out the complicated integration of two large agencies into the State Department. However, I would be surprised if the administration contends that this requirement to return to Congress is unduly burdensome. 
I hope the administration will work with the committee on this procedure. If the administration is committed to the reorganization outlined by the President's April 18 statement, as I believe it is, then it should have no trouble implementing the legislative framework laid down in this bill. 
Finally, Mr. President, the bill provides for the payment of U.S. arrearages to the United Nations. Now, in my almost 25 years of being a U.S. Senator, there is little that generates as much enthusiasm for debate than when we talk about paying arrearages to the United Nations. Maybe when we talk about the question of abortion more vigor is displayed on this floor, but only abortion and a few other issues raise the combative instincts of my colleagues more than paying back U.S. arrearages. 
Now, the proposal contained in our bill, this bipartisan proposal, led by my friend from North Carolina, I believe will serve three important purposes. One, it should finally end the long festering feud between the United Nations and Washington about our unpaid dues. Second, it should bring much needed reform to the world's body so that it can more efficiently perform its missions, missions which we acknowledge in this legislation that we support. Third, it should, I hope, restore some of the bipartisan support in Congress for the U.N.'s system, support that has existed for most of the U.N.'s 50-year history. 
The agreement before the Senate will allow us to pay $819 million in arrears to the United Nations over a 3-year period contingent upon the United Nations achieving specific benchmarks, to borrow Chairman Helms' expression. 
Now, the payments are broken down as follows: In year 1, we will pay $100 million. I might add, even if we wanted to pay more, the budget agreement we passed does not accommodate us paying any more than that, so even if we wanted to pay all the rest, the Congress and the President have limited us to what we can pay under that budget agreement. Now, in year 2--and this was a significant compromise, and he is on the floor, and I want to publicly thank him for accommodating my request on this--in year 2, we pay $475 million, assuming the benchmarks are met. In year 3, we will repay the remaining $244 million. 
The significant feature of this payment scheme is that it will allow the administration to pay off virtually all our arrears in the first 2 years for the two most important accounts, which are the regular and peacekeeping budgets. With these two accounts current, our diplomats will have the leverage they need to push through the tough reforms that are needed. 
Let me mention a few of the particularly noteworthy benchmarks, again using the chairman's term. The plan calls for a two-stage reduction in our regular U.N. assessment rate from 25 percent to 20 percent. Now, I have been criticized a great deal for going along with this, as my friend from North Carolina, I suspect, has been criticized for going along with paying the arrears. I am told, `Joe, as a supporter of the United Nations how can you possibly insist that the U.S. portion of the United Nation's regular dues be reduced from 25 percent to 20 percent?' And I say I would rather just pay our arrears and then negotiate that. But on the issue of what should we pay, Mr. President, I would respectfully suggest that if the meeting in San Francisco organizing the U.N. were today rather than 50 years ago, we would not be sitting down with economic giants like Japan and the European countries and others and saying, `By the way, we should pay 25 percent.' 
I argue it made sense after World War II when we were the only economic power left standing in the world. We are not the only 
economic power left standing in the world. I want to pay our fair share. I do want to carry our burden. But I am hard pressed to see why I am doing such a terrible thing, siding with the chairman, saying our numbers should get down to 20 percent from 25 percent. 
As I said, I challenge anyone to tell me why you think there would be a consensus in the world that we should pay 25 percent if we were starting from day one. Now, agreed, admittedly, the chairman and I do not agree on how we should go about this. I would like to pay the arrears, not make it conditional and negotiate our dues because this is a little bit heavy handed, but I am a realist. Politics in the best sense of the word is the art of the practical. We have to get 51 votes to get this thing moving. The chairman and I have to make compromises. He has come a long way. I am willing to go a long way because I think this meets the most important requirement. 
I hear people telling me now, and I see my friends on the floor, saying, `Joe, this is great. You worked out this compromise with Senator Helms, but if you got him to compromise this much, if you were just a little tougher you would have gotten a billion 300 million for U.N. arrears.' First, they do not know my friend like I do. We have worked together for almost 25 years. We came here at the same time. Second, it is amazing how people in hindsight say, `Hey, this is great, this is great. We are moving along in the right direction.' This is the end of the road, this direction. 
As I told the chairman, he came up to that $819 million, and the administration says they can get the job done with that--it is a bottom-line number with me. If we go to conference and the House cuts that number, I am not voting for this. And the chairman did not like going up that high but he is sure going no higher, unless I misread him. So people say, `Well, Joe, you are forcing the United Nations to make these decisions. It is not fair.' Well, I remind them, can the United Nations take another year, can we handle another year of nonpayment without doing permanent damage or additional damage to our status within that agency, which I think is an important agency? Everybody tells me it is important this get done. I asked those folks who now are saying this is not enough, I asked them, you figure out how to get 51 votes for something more than that, and if you do not get 51 votes and this carries over for another year, what damage have we done? If damage would be done by not paying the disputed amount between $819 million and what others say we owe, if damage would be done by that, how much damage would be done if this thing goes over another year? I respectfully suggest, a lot more damage by not acting. And, by the way, I have had this conversation with the President of the General Assembly and with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. They both want action now because they say what our fellow nations in the United Nations are wondering, are we ever going to pay? Do we think we have an obligation? This, at a minimum, establishes that. It is very important, very important. 
We may have a slight disagreement, my friend from North Carolina and me, but I see the United Nations as a valuable tool. I do not want to be sending U.S. troops everywhere in the world where there is a need for international action, where there is a need for the world to respond so it does not blow out of control. I do not want to do that. The United Nations can be and is a very valuable adjunct and tool. I do not want to see it come apart. To me, this is the single best way to meet our foreign policy needs now. It is important we act now. 
Let me mention a few of the particular noteworthy benchmarks beyond moving from 25 to 20 percent. The plan also requires that the United Nations make a commitment that the United States be reimbursed for support we provided for the peacekeeping operations, something that is very important to the chairman. Some of my colleagues, all of whom I respect, will come to the floor and say, `Well, you know, Joe, look at what our share of the world's resources are and look at what our share of the world's economy is and look at what our share of our involvement in the United Nations is, and it really should be 25 percent.' I say, does the rest of the world take into 
consideration the billions of dollars American taxpayers are paying to keep peace in the world? How about Korea? How about Japan? How much do they pay? How about the billions of dollars we have committed in Bosnia? How about the billions of dollars we have committed around the world? Now, I am not asking the United Nations to credit us for that. I do not know how they would calculate that. I am asking them to recognize it. 
I am asking, by us coming up with these arrearages, to stop the bashing, to stop the U.S. bashing, as well as, hopefully, to stop the U.N. bashing. This is a time for us to take advantage of the institutions in the best sense of the word that exist to maintain world peace without our having to be the world cop. 
In addition, the plan calls for a number of budgetary and oversight reforms that promise to improve the efficiency both at the U.N. Secretariat and in its largest specialized agencies. 
I say again to my friend who is on the floor, he may have been off the floor earlier, I spoke with Kofi Annan on Friday. I suspect the Senator may have, as well. He indicated he appreciated our efforts. Obviously, he would like more. He said something interesting. He said that he was hopeful that you, Mr. Chairman, and I would be pleased with the reforms he has already suggested and that he hopes the United Nations will act upon this year prior to--prior to--commitments mandated by us in these benchmarks. He did not get specific about each, but I am sure, knowing him as I do, he is committed to reasonable reform just like every other major business in the world is reforming and every major governmental institution is reforming and streamlining. I believe that it is the intention of the Secretary-General to do the same thing. The end result will be to increase the efficacy of the United Nations and the fairness of those nations that contribute to its function. 
There are many of my colleagues that will look at the list that I mentioned here today and wonder why such detailed restrictions are attached to the payment of this money. In an ideal world, as I indicated in committee, I indicated to the chairman, and I indicate now, I would prefer far fewer restrictions. I support the United Nations with all its flaws because I believe, more often than not, it advances our national interests by providing a forum for combating problems that no single nation can address on its own, or at least no single nation can efficiently address on its own. We should not have to be the nation to address problems solely on our own. Placing conditions on U.S. payment is not unprecedented. Congressional pressure has often been an important catalyst for change in New York. 
For example, were it not for the efforts of our former colleague, Nancy Kassebaum--and everybody thinks of Nancy Kassebaum as a supporter of the United Nations and looks to Senator Helms as the person who stopped all these payments to the United Nations, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, now Nancy Kassebaum Baker, when she was a leader on this floor--her efforts required that the U.N. system would have to adopt a consensus-based budgeting process. Were it not for her efforts, that would not have occurred. Were it not for the initiative of Congress in 1994, then under Democratic control, in fairness to the chairman, there would be no inspector general at the United Nations. That was a condition we placed. That was a Democratically-controlled Senate, that was a Democratically-controlled committee. 
So this notion of benchmarks is not an unprecedented notion. What is unprecedented is the Senator from North Carolina saying, `I will sign on to pay our arrearages.' That is the unprecedented part, from my standpoint, and the benchmarks that he has insisted upon, I cannot look him in the eye and say that they are not reasonable. I would prefer not to have them, but they are not unreasonable. I would prefer to do it another way, but they are not unreasonable, and consequently I am supporting him because this is all part of an overall agreement to deal with the entire foreign policy of the United States of America. 
Mr. President, the achievements I mentioned earlier, the inspector general and others, were reasonable conditions. So, too, are those contained in the Senate bill now before the Senate. 
The original plan offered by the majority, in my view, did not meet the same standard, but as a result of good faith negotiations with the majority, we now have a set of conditions, which the administration, including our Ambassador to the United Nations, our former colleague and now Ambassador Bill Richardson, believes are achievable. 
Mr. President, I am often asked what it takes to be a U.S. Senator, and I say it takes two very important things: One, you have to be an optimist. If you are not, you are in the wrong business. It is not the place to be. The second thing it requires, I think, is that you be a pragmatist, because we have to achieve a consensus in this body. We represent over 250 million people with very different views. We represent very different constituencies and very different ideologies. Pragmatically, we have to get to the point where we get 51 votes. 
I recognize that no plan to pay our U.N. arrearages can get through a Republican-controlled Congress without some of the conditions that are on here. Again, I think the ones that remain are not unreasonable. I believe it is important to get this issue behind us and move toward a bipartisan foreign policy. This legislation should contribute considerably to straightening out our relations with the United Nations. 
For those colleagues on my side of the aisle who remain unconvinced, let me state clearly that the administration was involved every step of the way in the U.N. negotiations, and it has signed off on every element of this U.N. package and supports the proposal as the best deal that can be achieved, because they believe, as I do, that we must put this behind us. So I don't want to hear that the chairman did this by fiat, or the chairman--which he is capable of doing--got the ranking member in and convinced him, or has mesmerized him into changing his view. That is not true--possible, but not true. That is not what happened. The administration was either in the room or informed of everything we have done on this point. They, like me, believe that this is the best we can get and that it can get the job done. 
Now, I say to some of my colleagues, very bluntly--I will state it on the record--they say that they think the administration is wrong as well. Well, look, I have to sign on with some team here, you know. They are the ones running the show. They are the ones with the expertise. They know a lot more about what is needed to satisfy the 150 some nations of the United Nations. I take their word for it and I believe they are correct--substantively correct--that it can be done. The administration doesn't love this; I don't love it; the chairman doesn't love it. But that's what this legislation is about. That is why we have a Congress. That is how it is supposed to work to arrive at a consensus. 
Let me conclude by saying, Mr. President, that I have been here a long time. I have worked on a lot of big bills. I have been, like the chairman of the committee, in the majority and the minority. I like one better than the other. I have been both places, and I have been in both places twice. As I said, I have had the responsibility on my side of the aisle of shepherding through some very comprehensive legislation, not the least of which was the crime bill. But I think if the chairman of the committee and I stood here in January, the first week we were in session, and said that Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Joe Biden of Delaware are going to sit down in a room over the next 5 or 6 months and work out an entire package on how to deal with all this--when is the last time we passed an authorization? It was in 1994. That was the last time we passed any legislation to pay arrearages. It was the last time we got any consensus on how to reorganize. Well, we have done that. We both may be wrong, but we have done it. 
We have brought to the floor a comprehensive package. So that I don't confuse anybody, the most important thing to me is, first of all, to maintain my principle, and, second, to maintain the commitments I make. There are going to be amendments on this floor that I would like to vote for. For example, my friend from 
Indiana, Senator Lugar, one of the most informed men in the United States of America on foreign policy, believes, as I do, that we should dedicate more than $819 million toward paying our arrearages. As a matter of fact, I am the guy who called him when I thought my friend from North Carolina and I could not work out an agreement, and said, `If I introduce an amendment to raise the arrearages, will you vote for me in committee?' But then the chairman came along and said, `I will agree.' I ended up voting against my friend from Indiana in the committee to raise the number higher. I did that because I made a commitment. 
This is an overall package, all of this. It is not fair for me to say to the ranking member or to the chairman, who has made significant concessions from his former positions, I want to take this one piece out of the overall agreement and still keep the agreement, any more than it would be fair for him to go into a committee and vote to reduce the number from $819 million to $600 million. He will not do that to me, and I will not do that to him. This is not a matter of us making a personal deal. This is meeting the commitment given to us by the Senate: Can we put together a bipartisan consensus on this? 
I want to announce to everybody that I am probably going to be casting votes here, and I will state why at the time--they may say, `How can Biden vote that way?' If it stood all by itself, I probably would not vote that way. But I believe the package we brought for the Senate's consideration is serious, balanced, important to the foreign policy of this Nation, and workable. I will stick with it. It is not a perfect bill. Like any document that is the result of negotiations between two opposing parties, it represents compromise and it contains some elements that neither of us like. But it represents, in my judgment, an incredibly constructive compromise. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. President, unless my friend from North Carolina wishes to take the floor, I have nothing further to say. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will say at the outset I will cease if anyone comes to the floor. I am acting in a bit of a dual capacity here. I am comanaging the bill that is before us. We are waiting for some of our colleagues to come over with amendments. But in the meantime let me before the Senator from Alabama leaves the floor acknowledge and thank him for his acknowledgement of my efforts in this area and thank him for the knowledge he has brought to this body as a former prosecutor, an attorney general in his State, and as a former U.S. attorney running a Federal operation in his State as well, and for the vigor with which he has attacked the obvious problem. It is only of late that most people are acknowledging we should be focusing on juvenile crime. He in his capacity within his State both as a Federal official and a State official has been focused on it for some time. He and I have some outstanding disagreement on how to approach this, but we are substantially in agreement.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, with your permission, rather than immediately comment on the same subject matter, I ask, as we used to say in the Senate, a point of personal privilege. I would like to comment on a story that was published in my hometown newspaper that is the antithesis of problems relating to juvenile delinquency. It is a story about a family I am very close to. 
I should say at the outset I am prejudiced in this regard. I have a very close relationship and high regard for the father and mother of this family, and three of the four children in this family have worked with me and are friends of my children. One of them is in this Chamber today at my request as an employee of one of our colleagues from Florida. 
Mr. President, I want to tell this story because we rarely get a chance to share with our colleagues the kind of story I am about to share and, I might add, that in my almost 25 years in the Senate I have only done this on one other occasion, but I think it is just remarkable. 
The story is about a family named Kimmel, the Kimmel family. Going way back, I didn't practice law with but practiced law in adjoining suites to Mort Kimmel and knew his wife Marsha. We go back now about 30 years. 
Mr. President, it is the kind of story which I rarely share but my reluctance to discuss this in a public forum was increased initially because the individuals involved were such close personal friends, Mort and Marsha Kimmel and their family. I have known Mort and Marsha, as I said, for 30 years and the children have worked with me on my campaigns and have been friends with my children as well. They are among the most giving and caring people I know.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I know there are thousands of other families who made the same kind of sacrifices. When we talk about family values, this is what I mean by family values, family values that reflect a common consensus about sacrifice to make things better for everyone else in the family. 
Mr. President, I am proud to know the entire Kimmel family, and I am proud that one of the young children in that family--not quite so young anymore, she is still very young by our standards--is down here making her contribution to her Nation by working on the staff of one of our colleagues from Florida. 
Mr. President, with the Chair's permission, I would like to move onto a different subject, the subject spoken to by my friend from Alabama. If my friend, Senator Durbin, is ready to move on his, I will withhold that until the next lull we have and respond to my friend from Alabama on the issue he raised regarding youth violence. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I agree, but if he will yield for me to make a comment, if I may, to my friend. The Senator has made the case for the Baltics and for Romania. As to the Baltics, it seems to me, the case is obvious. With regard to Romania, that important country has made significant strides in the last 6 months. 
I want to make clear so that we all know, what we are talking about is the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act, which was passed in 1996. Basically, what the act does, Madam President, as you well know, is that it says there are newly independent states, which formerly were satellite states of the Soviet Union, who are seeking membership or may seek membership in NATO. It is kind of a two-stage process. We did the same thing for Hungary, we did the same thing for Poland, we did the same thing for the Czech Republic, and last year we added Slovenia. We basically said, look, we, the Congress and the President, will come up with some money to help you begin to organize yourself to meet the criteria for admission into NATO. This is not a club that you join because you like it, or join because you simply want to join. This is a deal where everybody has to carry their own weight proportionately within the club, and we are not going to admit anybody who cannot do that. But it requires some expenditure of money on the part of these countries to essentially do the political, economic, and military inventory they need to be able to determine whether or not they can meet the criteria. This is what it is. This is prep money to get them up and running to make their case. 
So, we are going to be doing here for the Baltics--and I share my friend's view--and for Romania, what we did for Slovenia, for Hungary, for the Czech Republic, and for Poland. 
I respectfully suggest, now that our friend from Washington is on the floor as well, that there be consideration of amending their amendment to add Bulgaria. Let me explain why. 
I stated earlier on this floor that I was pleased that the Clinton administration decided to support the first three countries mentioned in the first round. In our meetings we had an opportunity to make our case to the President as to who we thought should be invited to final accession negotiations at Madrid next month. I was disappointed, quite frankly, that the administration decided not to push Slovenia in the first round. After discussion with the President and his advisers, however, I am absolutely confident that Slovenia will make it in the second round, and I am confident that Romania will too. 
For everybody to understand, we are not just talking about a one-time event. NATO enlargement is an evolving process. Every European democracy, theoretically, is eligible. Probably the Baltics elicit more support than any other area of Europe, for the reasons stated by my friend. 
With that in mind, the Senator's amendment designates Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Romania to join Poland, the Czech 
Republic, Hungary, and Slovenia to be eligible for receiving assistance to prep them for future membership in NATO. They have established democracies, made courageous reforms to create free-market economies, are putting their armies under civilian control, and deserve our support. 
Another Eastern European country that deserves inclusion in this amendment to let them get prepped and make their case is Bulgaria. After having gotten off to a very slow start toward democracy after the Wall came down, it has now voted the post-Communists out of office. The new Bulgarian administration has begun free-market economic reforms, and recently the Bulgarian Parliament went on record as naming NATO membership as its primary foreign policy goal. 
Madam President, over the centuries, Bulgaria has been the most pro-Russian country in Europe. So these changes are truly noteworthy. Bulgaria is not as far along the path to NATO membership as the other four countries named in Senator Durbin's amendment, but they have made a definitive break with the past, and the democrats in Sofia, I think, deserve our support and encouragement to move further. 
I will not push my second-degree amendment now. Before we vote on this, however, or before the chairman makes a decision, I would like them seriously to consider, while the Senator from Washington is making his case, whether or not we should include Bulgaria. 
As the Senator found in traveling to the Baltics, what I found, whether I was in the Balkans or whether I was in Central or Eastern Europe, that the prospect of becoming a member of NATO has a significant positive impact on whether they establish a market economy, whether they move away from the Communist-controlled apparatchiks who are left over, and whether or not they embrace a foreign policy that looks to the West rather than to the East. 
So I would ask for his consideration.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I think the point my friend makes is a valid one. I don't think it was our intention to have this blanket exemption. As I understand the Senator's amendment--and, obviously, the chairman is checking this out himself for his position--from my perspective, it seems to make sense. 
I want to ask a question. Where there is the potential for a direct conflict--that is, if I were representing the employees on one side of the table, then I were to shift to a policy position or a management position that had jurisdiction over the very issues I was negotiating, I would still be precluded from taking that management position; but if I were to go off to be the economic counselor to the Embassy in Paris, or in Beijing, I would not be precluded, is that right?

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I, myself, am in the strangest position I have found myself in, probably, in the 25 years I have been here. I don't disagree with a single thing that my friend from Indiana has stated. 
Let me review the bidding, as I understand it, very, very quickly. No. 1, we have to decide, is the United Nations useful? Is the United Nations an important instrument in dealing with crises and conflicts in the world? Should we be a part of it? Does it augment our foreign policy? Is it important? Is it vital? 
In my view, the answer to every one of those questions is a resounding yes. As a matter of fact, I went so far, as the fellow with whom I engaged in a political campaign last year repeatedly pointed out--I wrote a very long paper, not too long ago, about 4 years ago, where I wrote that I believed we missed an opportunity for making the United Nations the centerpiece for the architecture of peace well into the next century. I think it has a capacity far beyond that which we are asking of it, and I think it has a capacity that is unparalleled by any other potential organization existing or one that I can contemplate. 
I think we do not spend nearly enough time pointing out what my friend from Indiana has, that 80 percent of the U.N.'s work is helping developing countries help themselves. The fact of the matter is, their work includes promoting and protecting democracy 
and human rights, developing effective food distribution and food cultivation strategies, assisting disaster victims, helping nations avert military threats by providing a diplomatic floor for dispute resolution. Who else does that besides the United Nations? Where else in the world--where in the world can we possibly go to have any of those functions undertaken? 
Some would say the United States should do that. The very people who say the United States should do that are the very people who, when the rubber meets the road, say, `No, no, no, no, we should not be involved. We, the United States, should not be involved. We can't be the world's policemen. We can't be expected to do everything.' I find it ironic, the same people say the United Nations isn't worth the powder to you know what. 
So much--all of what the United Nations does, frankly, even though it is exasperating and time consuming and frustrating sometimes, is clearly in our interest. We rely on the United Nations to provide humanitarian assistance to millions who otherwise would have no source of food or shelter. We rely on the United Nations to eradicate disease and improve health around the world. And particularly, it is the United Nations that leads the world in helping children by providing food and shelter and by protecting them from the scourge of disease that threatens their health in many parts of the world. 
We, the United States, rely on the United Nations to handle the increasing flow of refugees across borders and to prevent refugees from devastating and destroying neighboring economies, security, and the environment. We rely upon the United Nations to counter global crimes. The United Nations coordinates the international cooperation to fight terrorism, to counter drug trafficking. We rely on the United Nations to facilitate and maintain peace. In short, we rely on the United Nations in a way that we rely on no other organization. It is indispensable. 
So, that is the place from which we both start. I think it is fair to say our voting records for the last 20 years or so have been almost identical relative to the United Nations. I have not been one who has voted to cut the United Nations. 
The point that the Senator has made repeatedly and I have made repeatedly is the average American thinks, when we talk about arrearages we owe the United Nations, they think we owe money to a bloated bureaucracy out there that is wasting our money with all of these ghost employees who are doing nothing but subsidizing the economy back home and wasting our money and then voting against our interests, and that is where the money goes. 
Hardly any of the money that we owe goes to the Secretariat, goes to pay salaries at the United Nations, or goes to turn the heat and light on. The bulk of the money we owe, we owe to our friends for the reason my friend said. We said: Hey, we ain't sending GI Joe. You send your guys. You send your guys. We can't be expected to be everywhere. And we vote. We have a vote in the U.N. Security Council. If we don't want to vote to send anybody there, we can say no, and they don't go. But we vote yes because we view it to be in our policy interests, our foreign policy interests. So, who do we owe? We owe France, we owe England, we owe Belgium. I have a list right here. I will repeat it. It bears repeating: France, Great Britain, The Netherlands, Pakistan, Germany, Belgium, Italy, India, Canada. That is where the bulk of the money is we owe--for peacekeeping. 
I say to my friend from Indiana, one of the things I tried to note in negotiating this is: I'll tell you what, why don't we just pay all the peacekeeping stuff up front? We can sell that to the folks here. Even the those that don't like the United Nations, they like Great Britain, they like Germany. Even the folks that don't like the United Nations acknowledge France is an ally. Why don't we just pay them, no strings, nothing, pay what we owe, bingo. 
I even tried to put in an amendment. The Senator used the phrase, `pass through.' In a sense, the United Nations is passing through that money to them. I even came up with language--I should say this young man on my staff came up with language--to say: Guarantee that the money just passes through, cannot be diverted to go anyplace else: Pass through, pay France; pass through, pay Belgium, pass through--et cetera. 
Tried that route. As was pointed out accurately by my friends with whom I was negotiating, `Hey, look, we realize if you pay our friends, then the pressure is relieved. The pressure is relieved. We're not likely to get these changes we want in the United Nations.' 
So you are right, this is pressure; you are right. We finally, after all these negotiations, which included the administration, said, `OK, what do we do? Do we end up essentially emasculating the United Nations, causing its further'--talk about resentment--`further resentment?' 
Let me back up. I apologize to my friend for him having to hear this for the third time from me. I have heard from him as well three times, and I welcome hearing 10 more times, because he is right on the merits. I was asked if I would have a meeting with the President of the General Assembly. I forget how many people he brought along with him, three or four folks representing their countries in the United Nations, their Ambassadors. 
They came down to see me--I am paraphrasing as was stated by the spokesperson for the President--as a friend of the United Nations seeking my help. We sat around the conference table in my office for, I don't know, an hour, hour and a half. I listened to what they had to say. 
I said, basically, `You're right.' I said, `Let me get this straight now. You are saying three things to me: One, you acknowledge the United Nations needs some reform and you want that reform to take place anyway and you're going to initiate it. But if we even request, if Senator Helms' benchmark includes any of the reforms you have already contemplated you want to do, if it did, then it would make it harder for you to do them because people would resent the fact that we were telling you you had to do them.' I said, `Do I have that straight?' 
They said, `Yes, that's right.' 
I said, `Let me get the second point. The second point is you desperately need a demonstration of the board of findings of the United States that we're going to pay our debt, and that you can't wait another year on promises. It is no longer good enough you have a President who says he is with you and you have a minority of Senators who say they are with you, you need something tangible right now.' 
`Yes, that's my second message, Senator.' 
`But your third message is: Give us the money with no strings now, even if it is not all of it, in order for us to be able to get things underway to demonstrate we will reform in order for you then to have enough votes to produce the rest of the money.' I said, `So you acknowledge it is going to have to be staged, right?' 
`Yes.' 
I said, `I agree with you, but before you leave, let me ask you a question. Given your choice, no money and no conditions this year or conditions that are consistent with the things you say you want to do anyway and you are willing to attempt to do, and significant money this year with a significant commitment for the bulk of the money the next year and the remainder the third year, which do you pick?' 
They said, `We pick the conditions and money rather than no money, no conditions.' 
So I sat down with the administration and I said, `OK, folks, you sent up here a proposal for over a billion dollars in 1 year. Got anybody to support it besides me?' 
`Yeah, we got some other people to support it,' and named, I believe your name was taken in vain, I say to Senator Lugar, and a few others. 
I said, `Do you think you have enough votes to get that done?' 
They said, `No, we don't think so.' 
`What do you want me to do? Well, let's see what we can get done.' 
So I met with the Secretary, and I met with our U.N. Ambassador, our former colleague from the House. I said, `You have to tell us your drop-dead number'--excuse the expression. `What is the bottom line on this? If I can't get all you need, what is 
the bottom line on all this? And I want to tell you what the conditions are here that Senator Helms wants. I don't want any of those conditions, but what ones can you live with and what can't you live with?' And we began a long, long process of negotiating. 
The end result is what you see here. The end result is the administration, whether they are right, wrong or indifferent, told me on this part of the U.N., they want more. They don't like the conditions. They believe the minimum number should be $1.21 billion. They don't believe we owe, by the way, 1 billion 4. They don't agree with that. They don't think we owe that, which is the number everybody uses. They say we don't owe that. 
When the day was done, the Senator from North Carolina made some significant concessions. That left the Senator from Delaware in a position to say, `OK, the U.N. says, bottom line, they would rather run the risk of not risking another year of nothing,' notwithstanding the fact it will cause them serious problems. In turn, I think the Senator is right; it is going to cause us additional problems. The administration says we can do it on this amount of money and we can make those conditions work if you stagger the conditions to the end. `Give us the bulk of the money upfront and make the hard conditions at the end.' That is what they said. 
So we go back to the threshold question: Is the United Nations in our interest? I believe deeply that it is essential--essential--to the ability to carry a sound foreign policy for this country into the next decade and beyond. OK. 
Now, what is the best chance of the U.N. continuing to be viable? Take a chance on something that the President of the General Assembly doesn't like but acknowledges, given two bad choices, would rather have, take the position the President does not like, our U.N. Ambassador does not like but believes can get the job done if that is what it has to be, or go back to square one, which is debate this on principle--and I am not belittling and I am not being a smart guy saying that--debate the principle of this for another 4 months or 2 months or 6 months or a year and leave Ambassador Richardson totally empty-handed, with no money, not give the Secretary General anything to demonstrate that we have other than a minority of us and the President saying we will pay, the check is in the mail, or go ahead and do what is proposed in this legislation? 
I honestly believe, unless the administration is fundamentally wrong in their calculation, this is in the absolute best interest of the United States of America and has the greatest prospect of continuing to have the United States viable than any other alternative I can come up with. 
The next question, it seems to me, is reasonable to ask: OK, Biden, geez, you agree with Senator Lugar, he is your ally, you are in the same boat on this thing, you agree with the principle he is saying, you got this much, why not go along with him and raise it? Maybe if you speak up now, you may get enough votes to get 51 people in this body to vote up that number. 
There is a simple answer to that. It may not be a good answer in the minds of most people. The editorial boards of the New York Times and others won't like it, but if I do that, there is no deal. Then we go back, not negotiating between 819 and 1 billion 21 or whatever the Senator's amendment is going to say precisely, or saying we pay all the 819 without any conditions and whether we pay the 819 with conditions, we go back to zero versus 1.021, or zero versus 819 and no conditions. 
I don't suggest that I know any more than my friend from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, and my friend from Indiana, Senator Lugar, but I do suggest I don't know any less about how this place works. I do suggest that paying this over 2 years will be better than over 3, but the issue is whether it is over 5 or none when we started this. I do suggest it is better to have no conditions than the conditions we have in here, but I suggest it is much worse to have the original conditions than the conditions that are in this bill. 
I have a vast amount of respect for both my colleagues. As my friend from Indiana will tell you, when I thought that the Senator from North Carolina was unwilling to raise the level to the amount that the administration said they needed, I picked up the phone and I called the Senator from Indiana, and I called two other of my Republican colleagues on the committee, and I said, `If I offer an amendment to fully fund this,' or if we offer it, `can we get it adopted?' 
In the case of two other Republican Senators, I said, `If I offer it, will you vote for it?' 
In the case of the Senator from Indiana, I said, `If we offer it, what do you think our chances are?' 
In the meantime, the Senator from North Carolina, the chairman of the committee, said, `All right, I will go to the minimum number that the administration says they need, but I won't go any further.' 
In addition to that, we also were able to get the number up for the international organization account for this year's State Department authorization and a lot of other things that the administration wanted. 
So here we are. I will end where I began, where the Senator from Indiana began. This is one of the most important decisions we are going to make. The viability of the United Nations and our influence on that organization is critical to American foreign policy interests, to the interests of the United States over the next several decades. 
Strategically, we have not one bit of difference. Tactically, is it better to get what the administration says they can make work, what the Secretary General says he appreciates--the attempt we are making and doesn't know if he will get funding from, but thanks for the effort, and what the President of the General Assembly says he would rather have, given two bad choices. Is it tactically better to go that route, to `save the U.N.' and us in it, or is it tactically better to not go this route, go the route of the amendment of my friend from Indiana, and if we win, hope that my friend from North Carolina says, `Well, I lost here on the floor, that's OK by me'? I choose the first tactical option for the same strategic reason the Senator from Indiana chooses the second. 
I had one of my colleagues say, `You know, you got the chairman to go up to 819. The trouble with you is you just didn't have a tough enough bargain. You could have gotten him to go higher. If you just held faster, he would have gone higher.' 
I respectfully suggest, name me someone else who got the chairman up to 819 or even remotely close. 
There is one other provision I am almost reluctant to raise here, but one of the provisions the chairman has in this mark is that we get paid money for our peacekeeping. 
The administration believes there are moneys owed us as well and believes the U.N. owes us about $107 million. That is not part of this legislation, but it is part of the calculus. It may end up being a fight between OMB and the administration--I mean, within the administration. It may be a fight in some other place if the administration really cares about this. Do not come to me and tell me it is easier to get another $107 million from my good friend here and a majority of his colleagues, our colleagues who are his allies, if they cannot work out an internal problem within the administration. 
So we are at least theoretically talking about $925 million versus $1.021 billion. We have all been in this business long enough. If, in fact, our Ambassador to the United Nations--probably the most skilled negotiator we have ever had in that spot in the history of the United Nations--if he cannot figure out the difference over 3 years for roughly $90 million, then he is not the fellow I worked with in the last decade and a half. 
Like I said, as one of my colleagues said to me, `Joe, I've been here too long. I'm not doing this on anything other than on pure principle anymore.' Well, that is great. That is great. My honest opinion--and that was not said by my friend from Indiana, although he is an incredibly principled guy--in my view, tactically, this is the single best thing that can happen to enhance and give the greatest prospect for the outcome that I desire occurring, and that is, a viable United Nations, with the United States playing a vital role and the United Nations playing a vital role. 
Again, every argument made by my friend from Maryland in the committee and my friend from Indiana in the committee, and here, is accurate as it relates to whether or not we are imposing on the United Nations. We are. I might add, I do not know how they voted, but we voted on legislation that imposed on the United Nations an IG, an inspector general. We imposed that on them. I did not hear anybody standing on the floor then saying, `We are imposing on the United Nations.' Maybe somebody did. It sure did not reach this level. It is not new. 
Some may recall in a previous Republican administration, the Secretary General discussed with us reducing our share to 20 percent--actually, below 20 percent, between 10 and 15 percent --and the then Republican Secretary of State said, `No, we don't want to go that low. It will diminish our influence.' So it is not like we are coming out of the blue with a number that cannot possibly be met. 
Agreed, I do not like doing business this way. If I sign on to a contract, even though the terms turn against me, I stick with the contract until--as our friend from Mississippi, Senator Stennis, used to say every time you would look at him--I have one of his letters he sent me. He said, `You got to plow the field to the last furrow, to the end of the road.' Well, that is how I think contracts work. You plow the field to the last furrow, to the end of the road, then negotiate next year's crop, then negotiate how many furrows next year. That is the better way to do it. That is how I am used to doing business. 
Personally, as a Senator, as a legislator, as a man--as a man--this field is not going to have any crops. It is not going to grow anything because there is no plow in the field right now. We may not have enough of a plow to plow the field to the last row, to the last furrow at the end of the row, but, boy, we have 99 percent of the field covered. 
Then, as I said earlier--and I will yield the floor with this--in a slightly different context today I said, you know, I am a Senator. That means I am an optimist. To be a Senator, it seems to me, you have to be an optimist. You would not choose this job knowingly if you thought things were not going to turn out. 
Well, look, 3 years is a long time. Kofi Annan, the Secretary General, called me on Friday. I realize that is nothing unique. I am not the only guy that has spoken to him. But he called me. I happened to have known him in his former incarnation in the 
United Nations. He is one heck of a guy. And he called and said, `Joe, I want to thank you for the try.' He did not say, `I called and said I think it is a good deal.' He said, `I want to thank you.' I do not recall whether he said it or I said it, but he will hear it, so he will correct me if I am wrong. My recollection was that one of us said off the other's sentence, `Three years is a long time.' And then he said, `I hope by the end of this year many of the very proposals and reforms you're asking for will already be done and maybe that will change some people's minds.' 
The administration only asks for $100 million in fiscal year 1998, and this gives them $100 million in fiscal year 1998. The conditions they have to meet are basically zero. They have to promise our sovereignty is not in jeopardy, essentially. The second year, the $400 million and some, the conditions get a little tougher--not very tough. The third year, the last $244 million, that is where the rubber meets the road. 
The Senator did not want to do it that way. The Senator wanted the rubber to meet the road the first date. 
Is that a fair statement, I say to my friend from North Carolina? 
He has actually made some genuine, serious concessions. I said, let us keep this ball in play. That is my plea. Let us keep the U.N. in play. Get them money now. Start to pay back our debts now. Get it underway now. As I am one of those guys that thinks once you put the ball in play, we win--we will reach the appropriate outcome. 
My concern with the approach taken by my friend from Indiana--and he, as I said, has been here almost as long as I have; he is a skilled politician in the best sense of the word, as well as a principled, knowledgeable legislator--he could be right that the route I am taking you down tactically will not get us to the strategic objective, and maybe the way to do this is call the bluff, call the bluff. But I doubt whether or not even he believes that if we were to prevail, or if I were to abandon this fairly reached deal, that we would likely, at the end of the process, be any further along than we were the end of last year. 
Keep in mind--I want to say it again because I have been absolutely, completely straight with my friend from North Carolina--if we go to conference and they have no money--by the way, unless something happened in the last couple days, they have zero, nothing, for the U.N., zero--if this means we go to conference and Biden is expected to go from $819 million to $408,500,000, they have the wrong guy. My bottom line is $819 million. 
So we may not get to there from here even if we do it my way--not my way, the way suggested in this legislation. But I respectfully suggest no one has laid out for me, and I am anxious to hear it, how we get from here to there. And the `there' is preserving the United Nations, our position within it, its viability, credibility, and ours as well. 
I cannot believe, if the Senator from Indiana were President--and he would have made a good one--and I were the Secretary of State--I doubt he would have picked me--I cannot believe, if he said, `Joe, you go see Chirac, you go see Blair, you go see Kohl, you work out something on this arrearages deal with them.' I cannot believe I could not get that done for him without damaging my relationship with them and figuring out a way at the end of the day--the end of the day, whether that means 3 years or 5 years or 7 years--to pay what we owe. 
But I do not know how to get from here to there. Were he President and I Secretary of State, and he said, `Joe, go work out a deal with those guys. And, by the way, you have no money. We can't come up with a nickel. You go work it out.' I do not know, folks--I do not know. I think I have a little bit of a greater faith in this administration than my colleagues do, and a little greater faith in the ability of our Ambassador to the United Nations to make this work without suffering the consequences that could and may be suffered if this were to pass. But like I said, I have not heard any other idea. And I have been working with this 
too long to fall on my sword. 
I again close where I opened. I think on the merits--my friend from North Carolina knows how I feel--I think on the merits my friend from Indiana is correct. But I think the merits and the friendship of the Senator from Indiana may get me into the girls State championship basketball game in Indiana, maybe, but it will not get me much further--probably will not even get me there. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, having recently returned from Paris and the signing of the NATO-Russia charter, I rise today to discuss what is one of the most important foreign policy questions facing the United States--and facing this body: The enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include several new democracies of Central Europe. 
Mr. President, I know that what I have just said will at first seem counterintuitive to many Americans. Why is NATO enlargement so important? After all, the Soviet Union is but a bad memory, communism in Europe lives on in stunted form only in Serbia and Belarus, and no military threat in Europe is in sight. 
Moreover, some will correctly point out, the Pacific Rim has become the world's premier area for economic growth, and Latin America, while also a prime opportunity for trade and investment, is vitally important to the United States because of problems like illegal immigration and drug trafficking. 
So why are we bothering with Europe, much less tinkering with a hugely successful alliance like NATO? 
Mr. President, these are legitimate questions that must be answered. I would submit, first of all, without minimizing the importance of Asia and Latin America, that Europe remains a vital area of interest for the United States for political, strategic, economic, and cultural reasons. A sizable percentage of the world's democracies are in Europe, and the continent remains a major global economic player and partner of the United States. 
The European union, composed of 15 vibrant free-market democracies, has embarked upon an ambitious program to create an ever closer union with greater political, economic, and social integration. Most of Central and Eastern Europe has gone through several free elections, and democracy is putting down firm roots. 
In economic terms, the European union, with a combined population a third larger than ours, has a combined gross domestic product that exceeds ours. While the United States has a larger--and, I might add, less balanced--trading relationship with Asia than with Europe, we invest far more in Europe. 
Several new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe have highly educated work forces, already boast rapidly expanding economies, and already attract considerable American investment. 
Moreover, most Americans trace their cultural roots to Europe, and millions retain personal ties to it. By any geopolitical standard, it would be a catastrophe for U.S. interests if instability would alter the current situation in Europe. 
How might that instability occur? Well, no one believes that the Russian army is poised to pour through the Fulda Gap in Germany--NATO's horror scenario for 45 years. The Russian army is in such pitiful shape that it could not even reconquer little Chechnya, a part of the Russian federation. 
No, the threats to stability in Europe have changed, but they are, if anything, even more real than those of the cold war. We all know what they are. They are ethnic and religious hatred as horrifyingly shown in the hundreds of thousands killed, raped, made homeless, or otherwise brutalized in Bosnia. 
They are the well-organized forces of international crime, whose tentacles extend from Moscow and Palermo to New York and Los Angeles. 
True--but some might ask why the Europeans can't take care of their own problems? Mr. President, life is not fair. Unfortunately, the history of the 20th century has demonstrated that the United States must play a leading role in organizing the security of Europe. In World War I, in World War II, and lately in Bosnia and Herzegovina, without American leadership the countries of Europe have been unable to resolve their differences peacefully. 
While American idealism has certainly played a role in our various interventions to rescue Europe, enlightened self-interest has been the dominant motive. Put simply: It is in the vital interest of the United States that stability be preserved in Europe. 
How does that translate into 1997 terms? It means that we must lead the Europeans to create what is called in current policy jargon a new security architecture to guarantee stability to the areas most vulnerable to disruption. 
To no one's surprise, I am talking about Central and Eastern Europe, where Newly Independent States are striving to create and solidify political democracy and free markets. It is a difficult process, which if not put into a larger framework could spin out of control. 
It is in this context that the enlargement of NATO must be seen. During the cold war, NATO provided the security umbrella under which former enemies like France and Germany were able to cooperate and build highly successful free societies. 
It was the framework in which former pariahs like Germany, Italy, and Spain could be reintegrated into democratic Europe. And it was NATO that kept the feud between Greece and Turkey from escalating to warfare. 
The enlargement of NATO can now serve to move the zone of stability eastward to central Europe and thereby both prevent ethnic conflicts from escalating and forestall a scramble for new bilateral and multilateral pacts along the lines of the 1930's from occurring. 
For if NATO were not to enlarge, the countries between Germany and Russia would inevitably seek other means to protect themselves. The question for today is not `enlarge NATO or remain the same.' The status quo is simply not an option. 
In fact, we already have clear evidence of how NATO can act as a stabilizing influence in the region. Two years ago, NATO listed friendly relations with neighbors as one of the core criteria for joining the alliance. Merely the possibility of attaining membership rapidly induced centuries-old enemies like Hungary and Romania to bury the hatchet, conclude a treaty of friendship, and even begin intensive military cooperation. The same is true to a lesser extent between Hungary and Slovakia. 
Italy and Slovenia have settled a long-festering property dispute. The Czech Republic and Germany have formally come to terms with the Nazis' war-time atrocities and with Czechoslovakia's post-war expulsion of 3 million sudeten Germans. I submit that none of these highly encouraging developments would have occurred without the carrot of admission to NATO having been offered. 
Mr. President, there is one additional argument for NATO enlargement: The moral one. For 40 years the United States loudly proclaimed its solidarity with the captive nations of Central and Eastern Europe who were under the heel of Communist oppressors. Now that most of them have cast off their shackles, it is our responsibility to live up to our pledges to readmit them into the West through NATO and the European Union when they are fully qualified. 
Let me be precise in my policy formulation. I believe it would be in our national interest for NATO to extend invitations to final negotiations for membership at its July summit in Madrid to Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovenia. 
All of these countries have fulfilled the basic criteria for NATO membership--Political democracy, free-market economy, civilian control of the military, peaceful relations with neighbors, and a commitment to NATO principles and Trans-Atlantic security. 
In each of these countries democracy and free-market capitalism are on sound footings. All four are able to assume the political, military, and financial responsibilities of membership. 
Mr. President, this morning the administration announced that it will only support the candidacies at Madrid of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. I regret the omission of Slovenia from this list, but I recognize the political realities--especially among the current European members of NATO--that argued for this decision. 
After my discussions last night with the President and his advisers, I am convinced that Slovenia will be the No. 1 candidate for membership in the second round of NATO enlargement--and in a short time. 
For me, the logic of enlargement is inescapable. But because the issue is complex and remote from the daily lives of most Americans, I also believe that it is critically important immediately to initiate a national debate on NATO enlargement. 
No foreign policy, no matter how well-formulated, can be sustained without the informed consent of the American people, which is why we need to launch a national debate to explore the costs, obligations, and benefits to the United States of NATO enlargement. I have asked Chairman Helms to hold hearings in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; I believe they will be an essential part of this debate. 
Meetings in non-governmental forums across the country are likewise essential if our people are to understand the profound importance of the issue before us. 
I believe that when they have examined the facts, the American people will support us in our effort to enlarge the alliance and build the new European security architecture. 
For 40 years after World War II, NATO bound together the democracies of Western Europe and North America in a military alliance to counter the threat of Soviet communism. The statesmen who crafted the Washington treaty of 1949 bequeathed their successors an alliance of unparalleled effectiveness, one that deterred aggression for four decades until its adversary collapsed from internal weakness. 
Ironically, within the fruits of NATO's success lie the seeds of its possible demise. Alliances are formed to fight wars or to deter them. Once the adversary is gone, unless they adapt to meet changing threats, they lose their reason for being. My good friend from Indiana, Senator Lugar, recognized this fact when he said that NATO must `go out of area or go out of business,' and I wholeheartedly agree with him. For this reason too, the status quo is simply not an option. 
Enlargement must be accompanied by a redefinition of NATO's mission. The Alliance's primary mission as outlined in article 5 of the Washington Treaty of April 4, 1949, remains the same: Treating an attack on one member as an attack on all and responding through the use of armed force if necessary. Now, in the current post-cold-war situation, non-article 5 missions like peacekeeping, sometimes in cooperation with non-NATO powers have become possible. 
The SFOR joint effort in Bosnia and Herzegovina with Russia and several other non-NATO countries is an excellent example. 
But what about our erstwhile adversary, Russia? Many ask whether enlarging NATO will not rekindle the cold war and strengthen the hand of hostile nationalists and communists in Russia. Again, this is not only a legitimate question to ask, but a necessary one. 
Mr. President, I firmly believe that NATO enlargement need not adversely affect United States relations with Russia. I came to this conclusion on a trip to Moscow and several central European capitals earlier this spring. My observations are contained in greater detail in a Foreign Relations Committee report that I wrote entitled: `Meeting the challenges of a Post-Cold War World: NATO Enlargement and U.S.-Russia Relations.' 
Although few Russians are fond of NATO enlargement, policymakers in Moscow have accepted it. Moreover, no Russian politician whom I met--from communist leader Zyuganov, to liberal leader Yavlinsky, to the nationalist General Lebed--believed that NATO enlargement constitutes a security threat to Russia. 
In fact, nearly all politicians and experts whom I met understood the non-aggressiveness implicit in NATO's `three no's" --the Alliance's declarations of having no reason, intention, or plan in the current and foreseeable security environment permanently to station nuclear weapons or substantial combat forces of current members on the territory of new members. 
Rather, the Kremlin's public opposition to enlargement is largely a psychological question connected with the loss of empire, wounded pride, and--most importantly--an uncertainty about Russia's place in the world of the 21st century. 
As part of this uncertainty, most Russian leaders are worried about their country's being marginalized, and as a result they are eager to move forward with its bilateral relationship with the United States. 
Mr. President, let us not kid ourselves. Never is a long time, and Russia's current weakened condition is sure to improve. We must continue to engage Russia politically, militarily, and economically. 
The Clinton administration, together with our NATO allies, has already begun to do so. As I mentioned earlier, 2 weeks ago in Paris, the heads of government of the 16 NATO members and President Yeltsin signed the so-called `Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security Between NATO and the Russian Federation.' President Clinton asked me to accompany him to represent the United States at the signing ceremony. 
Time does not permit me to go into detail about this lengthy document, except to say that it is a good start at binding Russia closer to the West and soothing its bruised feelings, without giving Moscow a decision-making role in NATO's core structures. 
It creates a new body called the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council, which will serve as a forum for consultation on matters such as peacekeeping operations, conflict prevention, and combatting terrorism. 
But let me reemphasize to my colleagues that the Alliance will not in any way be subordinated to the NATO-Russia Joint Council. 
When NATO members gather to discuss alliance policy, no outside country will have any right or privilege to prevent NATO from doing what is best for its member states. And no outside country will have any say in whether new countries are admitted to NATO. 
Its purely consultative mandate, however, does not mean that the Joint Council cannot evolve into a truly valuable mechanism for promoting mutual trust. 
As Russian officials better understand that NATO is not the rapacious caricature of Soviet propaganda, but rather a defensive alliance and force for security and stability in Europe, their animosity toward the organization may dissipate. 
And by working together in the Joint Council, Russia can prove that it is a responsible partner for the West. 
Through this mechanism and others, over time Moscow can come to realize that the enlargement of NATO by moving the zone of stability eastward to Central Europe will increase Russia's own security. 
One problem, however, requires immediate attention. There needs to be a mechanism by which the countries invited at Madrid can participate in NATO before their full accession to membership. 
I would suggest in this regard making the candidates observers to the North Atlantic Council. 
I am pleased that the chairman of the Subcommittee on European Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations, my friend from Oregon, Senator Smith, plans to hold a hearing on the NATO-Russia Founding Act to examine these issues in detail. 
Mr. President, it is also essential that arms control agreements with Russia be ratified and expanded. Of special importance is getting the State Duma to ratify the START II Treaty and then, together with the United States, to move on to further reductions in START III. Despite recent press commentaries, I do not believe that the NATO-Russia Founding Act or NATO enlargement will substantially affect START II's ratification prospects in the Duma. 
Moreover, as the NATO-Russia Founding Act recognizes, the treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe [C.F.E.] must be adapted to reflect the changed environment. The overwhelming Senate ratification last month of the C.F.E. Flank document, together with its approval by the other twenty-nine states parties to the C.F.E. Treaty, augurs well for the C.F.E. adaptation negotiations. 
In addition, it is vitally important that the United States continue its economic engagement with Russia, not through massive infusions of money, which Moscow, especially if it cleans up its corruption, does not need, but more through broadened investment and trade, expanded grassroots partnerships, and some targeted technical assistance. 
Significantly, not a single senior official in Warsaw, Prague, Budapest, or Ljubljana whom I met wanted to isolate Russia from the West. 
In order for NATO enlargement to proceed, both our current allies and the candidate countries invited to join at the Madrid Summit next month must agree to shoulder their fair share of financial costs and all mutual obligations. An agreement on sharing these costs is essential not only to enlargement, but to the continued viability of NATO itself. 
The candidates for membership in NATO must assume the financial burden of making their armed forces interoperable with those of NATO members, in addition to meeting the costs of modernizing their militaries, which they must undertake in any event. 
Other obligations are political and military, such as agreeing to come to the aid of allies, as described in article 5; allowing basing of NATO troops on their territory, if necessary; and allowing overflights of NATO aircraft, if necessary. 
The February 1997 Pentagon study on NATO proposed a distribution of direct costs of enlargement whereby 15 percent would be assumed by the United States, 35 percent by the new members, and 50 percent by the other current members of NATO. 
Calculating these ratios begins with the estimate that about 40 percent of direct enlargement enhancements could be nationally funded, and 60 percent common funded. 
Estimated direct costs of enlargement total between $9 and $12 billion over 12 years, through 2009. Let me point out to my colleagues that it is only these direct costs that the United States would help pay for. Additional costs not directly related to enlargement will have to be paid for by our current allies and our new allies. 
The central European countries must modernize their militaries--a cost they will incur whether or not they join NATO. Those costs are estimated at $10 to $13 billion through 2009. And the responsibilty for bearing these costs rests solely with the governments of the four leading candidates. 
Another pivotal issue is that our current allies must develop power projection capabilities, which the United States achieved in the 1980's, if they are to contribute to the new missions of the alliance. 
While these capabilities will allow them to help defend new members, they are necessary even if NATO were not to enlarge. As a result, these costs of $8 to $10 billion over 12 years are, likewise, not a direct cost of enlargement, but they are essential to the future of NATO, and they must be borne alone by our current allies. 
The expected U.S. contribution of $150 to $200 million per year for 10 years, although a small fraction of our total defense budget, is nonetheless not trivial, given our mandate to balance the U.S. Federal budget by the year 2002. 
Mr. President, prospective new NATO members must keep that basic political fact of life in mind, lest they get the erroneous impression that their accession to the alliance would be a painless, free ride. 
The candidate countries must make the financial means available if they expect current members to ratify their accession to membership. As I told one Polish military official, `If you want to fly first class, you have to buy a first class ticket.' They must realize that freedom isn't free, and security isn't cheap. 
Having given this warning, I fear that the 50 percent share of direct enlargement costs allocated to the Western European NATO partners and Canada may, in fact, be politically more difficult than the 35 percent allocated to the new members, particularly after our current allies pay for their power projection enhancements. 
One of the complicating factors is that the 11 European NATO members who are also members of the European Union are currently engaged in painful budget cutting in order to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria for Economic and Monetary Union [E.M.U.] on January 1, 1999. Those who qualify may be held to rigid fiscal discipline thereafter, if a stability pact is enforced without `political' criteria. 
Resentment against this belt-tightening played a key role in the defeat of President Chirac's conservative coalition in the French elections on June 1st. 
As a politician, I empathize with the challenge our European friends face. But we all have to make difficult choices, and if our European allies want continued American involvement in their security, they must step up to the plate. 
In order for NATO to remain a vibrant organization with the United States continuing to play a lead role, the non-U.S. members must assume their fair share of direct enlargement costs and for developing power projection capabilities. 
To do otherwise would cast the United States in the role of `the good gendarme of Europe'--a role that neither the American people, nor the Senate of the United States, would accept. 
Mr. President, there is one more dark cloud looming on the horizon of European-American relations. I fear that a coincidence of events in the late spring of 1998 may make Senate ratification of NATO enlargement problematical. Just when the Senate is likely to be voting on amending the Washington Treaty to accept new members, American ground forces will be completing their withdrawal from Bosnia. 
As it now stands, our European NATO allies will follow suit, repeating an `in together, out together' mantra, despite a United States offer to make air, naval, communications, and intelligence assets available to a European-led follow-on force, with an American Rapid Reaction Force on standby alert `over the horizon' in Hungary or Italy. 
Many of my colleagues, mindful of the repeated calls by some European NATO members, led by France, for more European leadership in the alliance and a sturdier `European pillar' within NATO, may see in the european refusal to maintain troops in Bosnia evidence of inequitable burden-sharing or--worse still--may question the worth of NATO altogether. 
Therefore, I believe that our European NATO partners, especially France and the United Kingdom, should reconsider their unwillingness to lead a post-SFOR ground force in Bosnia after mid-1998. 
Mr. President, international organizations other than NATO also have meaningful security components and should be encouraged to intensify their efforts. 
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [O.S.C.E.], which during the past few years has undertaken conflict-prevention, crisis management, and electoral missions in Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, Chechnya, Bosnia, and Albania, will likely continue to grow in importance. The United States is playing an increasingly important role in the O.S.C.E. And should continue to do so. 
The European Union also plays a profound role in stabilizing the continent. The E.U.'s immense economic clout has made it vital to the development of central and Eastern Europe, and it is therefore virtually inconceivable that even a non-NATO E.U. member state would be the object of aggression.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in 1981, the Senate Judiciary Committee had a new chairman, and a new ranking member, and there were more than a few folks who were eagerly looking forward to the fireworks. With the election of a new, conservative Republican administration and a new Republican majority in the Senate, The Judiciary Committee seemed destined to be a battleground for many of the great philosophical questions which divided us then, and which divide us now. And to many `Washington Insiders,' there was little prospect that Strom Thurmond--the veteran conservative Republican chairman from South Carolina who first made his mark on national politics as a principal advocate of States rights--and Joe Biden--a northeastern democrat still in his thirties whose interest in politics was sparked in large part by the civil rights movement--could ever find common ground as we grappled with many of those fundamental questions. 
I never shared those doubts, because by that time, Senator Thurmond and I had served together for 8 years. I knew that Strom Thurmond's personal strengths, which I admired greatly regardless of our political differences, would guide the committee toward responsible consensus rather than divisive gridlock, and establish an atmosphere of civil and constructive debate rather than divisive and meaningless partisan rhetoric. 
In his 6 years as chairman, and for several years after we switched roles in 1987, Senator Thurmond exceeded my expectations in every way. While the Judiciary Committee did indeed go through some heated debates and contentious hearings--weathering the kind of controversy which I have seen poison the well for other committees for years afterward--Senator Thurmond and I worked together to ensure that the committee's business, the Nation's business, would go forward once the day was done. That would not have happened had it not been for the strength of character of our chairman. 
First and foremost, Strom Thurmond is an absolute gentleman, unfailingly courteous and respectful of each individual's dignity. Throughout a lifetime spent in the political arena, he has never forgotten that those who disagree with us are nonetheless entitled to being heard out and treated with dignity. Indeed, that is an important reason that his lifetime in politics has been such a long and productive one. 
Here in the Senate, and--as I have seen firsthand--back home in South Carolina, Strom Thurmond's honesty and integrity are the hallmark of his public and private reputation. His word is his bond, and each of us--even the most partisan of political opponents--knows that through the heat of political debate, regardless of the intense pressure that may be upon him, Strom Thurmond can be trusted to keep that word; not when it's politically possible or expedient, but always. 
Here in the Senate, our integrity is, ultimately, our most valued possession, and Senator Thurmond is a living example of the value of personal integrity. 
Throughout our service on the Judiciary Committee, `The Chairman', has distinguished himself by his commitment to absolute fairness; to Republican and Democrat, political ally and philosophical opponent, alike. During the years when I held the gavel--and Strom will always be `The Chairman' to me--I tried to match the example of fairness that he set. Indeed, it is a legacy which I hope every committee chairman--and every senator--now and in the future, can strive to follow. 
Long before he was a committee chairman; indeed long before he came to the Senate so many years ago, Strom Thurmond was the consummate public servant, dedicated to the proposition that the political system is not an end in itself, but an arena for doing the public good. To that end, he has been committed to getting things done; to meeting the challenges facing our Nation and our people; and to accomplish those goals regardless of partisan politics. Though he holds the record for the Senate's longest filibuster, Strom Thurmond is a doer rather than a talker, and his long list of accomplishments here in the Senate is a testament to his determination to serve the people of South Carolina and this Nation. 
`Patriotism' is a word that is used often in the course of political debate, sometimes by those seeking to further nothing more than their own personal or political agendas. But patriotism has always been at the core of Strom Thurmond's being, whether in the fields of Normandy or in the Halls of the United States Senate. Senator Thurmond has epitomized the notion that patriotism is neither an outdated value nor a term for scoring political points; but a living principle that challenges us daily and refuses to let us rest on our laurels when it comes to doing the public good. 
Today, we commemorate Senator Thurmond's record-setting tenure here in this body. In recent weeks, because I am his friend in spite of our ages and differing political philosophies, I have been asked numerous times to explain the secret to his long tenure. The truth of the matter is that--in addition to the fact that he is a testament to healthy living--the secret to Strom Thurmond's political longevity lies, not with his considerable political skills or with any local anomaly in South Carolina, but deep within Strom Thurmond himself. 
It lies in his strength of character, his absolute honesty and integrity, his strong sense of fairness, and his commitment to public service. None of those things are skills which you learn; they are qualities deep within you which, when people know you well, they can sense. That is the secret to Strom Thurmond's success. 
Strom Thurmond's ongoing legacy is not the number of years, months, and days he has served in the U.S. Senate. Rather it is his many accomplishments and the good that he has done during those years. 
I have been honored and privileged to serve with and work with Senator Thurmond for many of those years. I am proud of the work we have done together on the Senate Judiciary Committee. And I am proud to call him my friend. 
Mr. President, I join my colleagues in honoring this important benchmark in Senator Thurmond's long career in public service, knowing that he still has much to give and looking forward to working with him as we confront the challenges of the 21st century.  
Mr. FRIST, Mr. President, on May 25, this Congress made history. On that day, we became the Congress to have the longest sitting Senator in the history of the United States. Our distinguished colleague and friend, the senior Senator from South Carolina--Strom Thurmond--set the Senate longevity record, serving his State and Nation for 41 years and 10 months. And like that little bunny, he just keeps going and going and going. 
However, as impressive as Senator Thurmond's legacy of service are his record of successes and the example of leadership he has achieved during his tenure. Today he serves as President pro tempore--a constitutional office that places him fourth in line to the Presidency. He has served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the senior member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and he now serves as chairman of our powerful Armed Services Committee. 
Senator Thurmond has been elected to eight consecutive terms since winning his seat as a write-in candidate back in 1954. 
We know of his breadth of experience: teacher, soldier, lawyer, judge, administrator, Governor, and even Presidential candidate; and we have been inspired by his example. 
We see in his life the values and possibilities that still distinguish our great Nation. Small town virtues, selfless service, a sense of duty--roots buried deep in lifelong membership in the local Mason Lodge, the Lion's and Rotary service organizations, the community church and hometown businesses. These all give Strom an authentic quality--a richness of character--an accessibility that's felt even by those who don't know him as well as we do. 
I cherish Strom's friendship. I count myself fortunate to have served the many years I have served with this great Senator, and I can say that I know of no one in this Chamber who doesn't look to him as I do--as a friend. And when you think about it, Mr. President, that's quite a remarkable thing to say about a man who started his political career when Calvin Coolidge was in the White House. 
During this special time--as Senator Thurmond continues to bring distinction to himself and to the U.S. Senate through his historic service--I want to be counted among those who recognize and appreciate all that he has offered to South Carolina and to the United States of America.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to compliment my esteemed chairman, Senator Hatch, for forging a consensus on this complex issue. As my colleagues know, I was engaged in negotiations on the Chemical Weapons convention resolution of ratification for months, and I know first hand how many deeply held views this treaty implicates and how difficult it is to bring the parties together. 
But we succeeded on the treaty and now, with the help of many Senators on both sides of the aisle, have succeeded on the implementing legislation. 
I supported this compromise measure in committee and will do so again now because it takes the important steps necessary to implement the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
As required by the convention, this bill will enact tough criminal sanctions for possessing, stockpiling, transferring, and using chemical weapons. It will also require U.S. companies to report on their production and use of potentially dangerous chemicals and submit to inspections of their facilities. 
Taking these steps will demonstrate to the rest of the world that the United States is committed to continuing its leadership role in arms control and other issues of global importance. 
I want to make clear, however, that I do not support some of the provisions in this bill and have very serious concerns about their impact on the convention. 
In particular, I do not believe we should be granting the President discretionary authority to deny a CWC inspection based on national security grounds, as would be done by section 401. By signing and ratifying this treaty, the United States--with the advice and consent of 74 Members of this body, given less than a month ago--agreed to allow certain inspections, subject to our constitutional requirements. With few exceptions, denial of a duly authorized inspection would violate the convention. 
Even if the President never exercises this authority, the mere inclusion of this provision in the legislation will encourage other countries to deny inspections on national security grounds. If we should enact to so-called national security exception, we can be sure that the Chinese will seize upon the precedent we set and use it to undermine the effectiveness of the entire certification regime. 
I have similar concerns regarding section 403, which would exempt from reporting and routine inspection requirements unscheduled discrete organic chemicals that are coincidental byproducts and are not isolated or captured for use or sale. While waste streams are not, in themselves, a threat to the object and purposes of the CWC regime, monitoring of such streams does afford one of the most convenient and nonintrusive means of determining whether a facility is worthy of concern in the first place. 
The drafters of this provision are concerned that CWC implementation would otherwise require paper manufacturers to undertake costly monitoring of their waste streams, and that is an understandable concern. There is no need, however, to grant such a broad exemption as is currently contained in this section. 
I am also troubled by: 
The broad compensation scheme in section 103 that does not even require a plaintiff to prove its case by a preponderance of the evidence to receive taxpayer funded compensation for the loss of trade secrets; and 
The limitation in sections 102 and 308 on the Government's power to require contractors to submit to CWC inspections. 
I hope to work with other Senators and the administration to ameliorate these concerns prior to enactment of this measure. Treaties are solemn obligations, and the Chemical Weapons Convention, with all its faults, is our best hope for exposing violators and mobilizing the world so as to put a stop to chemical weapons. We must resist the urge, therefore, to enact provisions that could conflict with our treaty obligations and do damage to the effectiveness of the treaty regime.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to commend President Clinton and congressional leaders on both sides for bringing before the Senate a balanced budget. 
I also believe that this budget goes a long way toward protecting the key priorities I believe must be protected. 
But, of all those priorities, I believe that none is more important than continuing our fight against violent crime and violence against women. 
To a great extent, this budget resolution meets this test--but, in at least one area of this crime front, I believe the budget resolution must be clarified. 
The amendment I am offering, along with Senators Byrd and Gramm does exactly that--by clarifying that it is the sense of the Senate that the violent crime control trust fund will continue through the end of this budget resolution, fiscal year 2002. 
I am particularly pleased that Senator Byrd--who, more than anyone, deserves credit for the crime law trust fund. Senator Byrd worked to develop an idea that was simple as it was profound--as he called on us to use the savings from the reductions in the Federal work force of 272,000 employees to fund one of the Nation's most urgent priorities: fighting the scourge of violent crime. 
Senator Gramm was also one of the very first to call on the Senate to put our money where our mouth was. Too often, this Senate has voted to send significant aid to State and local law enforcement--but, when it came time to write the check, we did not find nearly the dollars we promised. 
Working together in 1993, Senator Byrd, myself, Senator Gramm, and other Ssenators passed the violent crime control trust fund in the Senate. And, in 1994, it became law in the Biden crime law. 
Since then, the dollars from the crime law trust fund have: 
Helped add more than 60,000 community police officers to our streets; 
Helped shelter more than 80,000 battered women and their children; 
Focussed law enforcement, prosecutors, and victims service providers on providing immediate help to women victimized by someone who pretends to love them; 
Forced tens of thousands of drug offenders into drug testing and treatment programs, instead of continuing to allow them to remain free on probation with no supervision and no accountability; 
Constructed thousands of prison cells for violent criminals; and 
Brought unprecedented resources to defending our southwest border--putting us on the path to literally double the number of Federal border agents over just a 5-year period. 
The results of this effort are already taking hold: 
According to the FBI's national crime statistics, violent crime is down and down significantly--leaving our Nation with its lowest murder rate since 1971; 
The lowest violent crime total since 1990; and 
The lowest murder rate for wives, ex-wives and girlfriends at the hands of their intimates to an 18-year low. 
In short, we have proven able to do what few thought possible--by being smart, keeping our focus, and putting our money where our mouths are--we have actually cut violent crime. 
Today, our challenge is to keep our focus and to stay vigilant against violent crime. Today, the Biden-Byrd-Gramm amendment before the Senate offers one modest step toward meeting that challenge: 
By confirming that it is the sense of the Senate that the commitment to fighting crime and violence against women will continue for the full duration of this budget resolution. 
By confirming that it is the sense of the Senate that the Violent Crime Control Trust Fund will continue--in its current form which provides additional Federal assistance without adding 1 cent to the deficit--for the full duration of this budget resolution. 
The Biden-Byrd-Gramm amendment offers a few very simple choices: Stand up for cops--or don't; Stand up for the fight against violence against women --or don't; Stand up for increased border enforcement--or don't. 
Every Member of this Senate is against violent crime--we say that in speech after speech. Now, I urge all my colleagues to back up with words with the only thing that we can actually do for the cop walking the beat, the battered woman, the victim of crime--provide the dollars that help give them the tools to fight violent criminals, standup to their abuser, and restore at least some small piece of the dignity taken from them at the hands of a violent criminal. 
Let us be very clear of the stakes here--frankly, if we do not continue the trust fund, we will not be able to continue such proven, valuable efforts as the Violence Against Women law. Nothing we can do today can guarantee that we, in fact, will continue the Violence Against Women Act when the law expires in the year 2000. 
But, mark my words, if the trust fund ends, the efforts to provide shelter, help victims, and get tough on the abusers and batterers will wither on the vine. Passing the amendment I offer today will send a clear, unambiguous message that the trust fund should continue and with it, the historic effort undertaken by the Violence Against Women Act that says by word, deed and dollar that the Federal Government stands with women and against the misguided notion that domestic violence is a man's right and not really a crime. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Biden-Byrd-Gramm amendment.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, last week a bipartisan budget agreement was successfully reached between the Administration and Congressional leaders of both parties. 
This is a seminal achievement that will lead us to a balanced budget for the first time in 28 years. 
I would like to congratulate the budget negotiators on this important accomplishment. 
I would like to call particular attention to their leadership in funding international affairs. 
In February, I wrote the Budget Committee asking that the President's budget request of $19.45 billion for international affairs spending be regarded as the absolute minimum essential to effectively carry out the national interests of the United States. 
Yesterday, the Budget Committee reported a resolution establishing these enhanced levels of funding as a priority for fiscal year 1998. 
I commend the Budget Committee for recognizing the importance of funding this year the full amount of the President's request for foreign affairs. 
This was an important first step. 
I look forward to continue working with Chairman Helms on the Foreign Relations Committee and with the Appropriations Committee to insure that sufficient funds are authorized and appropriated to restore our resources for diplomatic readiness abroad. 
But it was only the first step. In recent years, funding for international affairs has plummeted in real terms to its lowest level since World War II. 
Yet all the while, due to the downsizing of U.S. overseas military forces, diplomacy has become more important than ever as a vital front-line defense of American interests. 
Although the cold war has ended, challenges to our security remain. 
We live in an age in which international threats such as terrorism, narcotics trafficking, and nuclear proliferation continue to imperil our Nation's security and prosperity. 
American diplomats in the field and on the ground are essential to understanding complex political and economic forces affecting our allies and adversaries alike. 
Despite the reduction in our military readiness abroad, the increased importance of diplomatic readiness to our Nation's security has not been reflected in the Federal budget in recent years. 
To the contrary, international affairs funding has suffered drastic budget cuts, a point which I will demonstrate today. These cuts have already begun to have noticeable effects on our Nation's diplomatic readiness. 
Thus, this year's budget agreement must be seen as only the first step toward restoring and enhancing America's diplomatic preparedness. 
Before discussing the decline in resources for foreign affairs, it is worth pausing to address a threshold question: What kind of foreign policy do we want to have? 
Stated more bluntly--are we prepared to remain engaged in the world, or are we headed down the path of isolationism? 
For it is only after we answer this fundamental question should we make decisions about the budgetary resources for foreign affairs. 
Mr. President, how we fund our diplomatic resources abroad presents another test for American leadership--whether the growing forces of neoisolationism or those favoring engagement are going to prevail in this congress. 
It is commonly asserted these days that the American people are weary of international involvement, and want us to cut back from our commitments abroad. 
Over the course of the last 50 years we have seen an enormous technological revolution take place in the areas of information, communication, transportation, medicine, manufacturing, and world trade. 
For better or worse, this revolution--at least for large segments of the world--has fundamentally transformed the way we live. 
Within and among nations, people today are more closely connected than ever by fast and affordable travel, instant electronic communication, and standardized products. 
For americans, who for much of our history enjoyed a sense of separateness from the world, global interdependence is no longer an academic abstraction; we experience it daily. 
The lesson of the two world wars in this century--that we cannot preserve our own well-being in isolation from the world's problems--has now been compounded by technology. 
For the last 50 years, the major threat to our Nation's security was the global spread of communism. Today, a host of other threats--no less dangerous--to our future security and prosperity exist: the proliferation of dangerous weapons; the threat of terrorism, narcotics, and international crime; the spread of deadly diseases; the degradation of the environment; and increasing economic competition. 
On every continent, we face many challenges, new and old: 
In Europe, we work to reinvigorate the NATO alliance by engaging in new missions and expanding to the east; 
In Eurasia, we seek to build a constructive relationship with a newly democratic Russia still armed with thousands of nuclear weapons, and to nourish democracy there and elsewhere in the New Independent States; 
In the Middle East, we endeavor to sustain a peace process that has brought Israel and her neighbors within sight of a final agreement that could end decades of conflict; 
In Asia, we seek to strengthen the bonds of cooperation with old allies in Japan and Korea, and to build a cooperative relationship with a growing economic and military power in China; 
In Latin America, we seek to sustain and strengthen our ties to the new democracies which are enjoying unprecedented economic success, and to help them contain the threat of the narcotics trade; 
In Africa, we are helping the new South Africa take its rightful place as a leader of the world community, and we seek to encourage the spread of democracy across the continent, where the seeds of freedom and free markets are slowly taking root. 
These multiple challenges may not call for a single construct--as the challenge of communism yielded the policy of containment--but they clearly affect American interests, and cry out for active American leadership. 
I believe that the American people understand this reality; and precisely for that reason, they expect to see the strong hand of the United States in world affairs. 
It is often stated, sometimes with excessive triumphalism, that we are the world's lone remaining superpower. Unfortunately, when it comes to devoting adequate resources for our diplomatic efforts, we rarely act the part. 
Indeed, our ability to continue our leadership role is threatened by the severe decline in funding for international affairs. 
And although some members of this body may contest the need for such funding, there can be no dispute that spending for international affairs has fallen significantly in recent years. 
Allow me to elaborate. In budgetary terms, nearly all funding for international affairs programs are found in the category known as function 150. In this category are all major foreign affairs activities: diplomacy conducted by the Department of State, foreign aid administered by the Agency for International Development; information and exchange activities carried out by the U.S. Information Agency; The work of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; U.S. contributions to international financial institutions such as the World Bank; and support for the United Nations and related agencies ranging from the International Atomic Energy Agency to the Children's Fund. 
By every measure, spending for these activities has been cut to the bone in the last few years. 
According to a study of the Congressional Research Service prepared at my request, foreign policy spending is now at its lowest level in 20 years. 
Stated in fiscal 1998 dollars, the budget in the current fiscal year is $18.77 billion, which is 25 percent below the annual average of $25 billion over the past two decades, and 30 percent below the level of 10 years ago, near the end of the Reagan administration. 
This is a recent phenomenon. The decline commenced at the beginning of the decade. But the most significant reductions came in the past few years. 
Spending dropped by 3.8 percent in fiscal 1994, by 5.6 percent in fiscal 1995, by 10.2 percent in fiscal 1996, and finally by 3.7 percent in fiscal 1997. In short, the reductions in this decade began with a trickle and have turned into a hemorrhage. 
Taken together, let me repeat, these budget cuts brought spending in 1997 to the lowest level in the past 20 years, and a full 25 percent below the average for that period. 
These reductions are also historic in two other respects. For the past two decades, international affairs spending, as measured against the rest of the discretionary budget, held reasonably steady. The average was 4.1 percent, but it rarely deviated much from that average. 
In fact, the trend, from 1987 to 1995, was virtually a straight line. But then the line started to take a dive in 1996, dropping to 3.7 percent; and in 1997, it fell still further to 3.6 percent. 
The story is largely the same when foreign affairs funding is compared to the total budget, including mandatory spending programs. 
Over the past two decades, international affairs funding comprised, on average, 1.7 percent of the entire Federal budget. In fiscal 1997, such funding was just 1.1 percent of the Federal budget, the lowest level in the past 20 years and about one-third below the historical average. 
It should be pointed out here that I am not using fiscal year 1985 as a base year for comparison. That was an extraordinary year because there were two special supplemental appropriations to meet foreign policy crises: a special aid package for the Middle East, and a relief bill for famine in Africa. 
Spending that year, in constant fiscal 1998 dollars, was $36.3 billion, or nearly twice current funding. 
I recognize that such an anomalous year would skew the comparison, and instead I have chosen to look at current funding based against a 20-year time period. 
This period, I might add, embraces the tenure of both Presidents Carter and Clinton--that is, the two most recent Democratic administrations--as well as those of Presidents Reagan and Bush. 
In sum, Mr. President, the data do not lie. No matter how you slice it, spending for foreign affairs has been severely cut. 
There's another part of the story that needs to be told, however, and that's how these cuts in international affairs spending, on both programs and people, have impacted American interests. 
Let us start with the State Department. Since President Clinton assumed office, funding for the Department's core activities has fallen by 17 percent in real terms. 
Although the current level is slightly higher than the historical average of the past 20 years, the cuts in the last few years have had a dramatic effect on the Department. 
First, we have closed 36 missions overseas, in locations such as Zurich, Switzerland, Stuttgart, Germany, and Lubumbashi, Zaire. 
At the same time, 24 new posts have been opened, 15 of which are in the nations that once comprised the Soviet empire. We now have 249 overseas posts, the lowest level since 1980. 
Now, I am not objecting to cuts made in the interest of efficiency. I agree that we should eliminate duplication and waste. 
What I am concerned about, however, is whether these reductions may have left our interests unevenly protected overseas. 
Just as one example, the closing last year of the American Consulate in Medan, Indonesia, has left us with no American diplomatic presence in the second most important commercial center in that country. 
Unlike Britain, Russia, Japan, Germany, and a host of other countries which all have diplomats in Medan, our presence is limited to the American Embassy some 800 miles away in Jakarta. 
Medan is located in a part of Indonesia that is a key entry-way for arms smuggling into the country, and historically has been a hotbed of pro-independence political activity. Moreover, there are significant private American economic interests in Medan. However, instead of protecting our interests in the region--both economic and security--we have been reduced to sending someone from the Embassy up to Medan about once every 4 months. 
Second, the Department is suffering from what might be called an infrastructure deficit. Replacement and modernization of basic equipment has been long deferred, and renovation and repair of overseas buildings has been delayed. Let me state it at the most basic level: Many diplomats, both here and abroad, still use Wang computers. When purchased in the early 1980's, the Wang was state-of-the-art, and the State Department was the envy of the Federal Government; today, the obsolete computers that pervade the Department make it the laughing-stock of Washington. Similarly, over 40 percent of the Department's overseas telephone switchboards are obsolete, so old in fact, that spare parts are unavailable, and to keep the older systems working, we cannibalize ones that have been replaced to fix those still in operation. The same is true for over 80 percent of all our radio equipment overseas. 
In the same vein, thousands of repairs to embassies and other facilities remain unmet because of the lack of funds. Our embassy in Beijing--one of our most important posts--is literally falling apart. Numerous other facilities, on every continent, require extensive repair work. 
At other foreign affairs agencies, the story is much the same. At the U.S. Information Agency, funding is 13 percent below the average in the past 20 years. Two programs which are among our cheapest and most cost-effective foreign policy tools--exchanges and international broadcasting--have been particularly affected. 
For example, budget cuts and a consolidation of all international broadcasting have forced reductions in programming on the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. During the Cold War, services like Radio Free Europe provided a steady breath of truth to those trapped behind the Iron Curtain. 
Today, their mission, and the mission of the new Radio Free Asia, is no less important. During my recent visit to Moscow, a leading member of the Russian legislature pleaded for the continuation of Radio Liberty, which is regarded as a critical tool in a country where the media remains under strong influence of the government and the ruling classes. 
The steepest reductions in our foreign policy budget have come in foreign assistance, which at $11.5 billion last year--again, using fiscal 1998 dollars--is lower, in real terms, than any year of the last 20, and some 36 percent below the historical average of that period. 
Foreign aid spending has been steadily falling since the early 1990's. Reductions of this magnitude have undermined American influence and interests around the globe. 
It is popular to assert that foreign aid is merely the foreign policy equivalent of welfare, a supposed giveaway of massive dimensions that yields few benefits to American interests, and that if we merely ended the program, our problems with the budget deficit would be over. Wrong on both counts. 
Through our foreign assistance programs we help to combat the scourges of drug trafficking, international crime, terrorism, and arms proliferation. For example, our contributions to the International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest, Hungary, has helped to train nearly 3,000 foreign law enforcement personnel in fighting organized crime, drugs, and international money laundering. American contributions to these efforts is an important way in which we protect our interests abroad. 
To state the obvious, if we ended all foreign aid--both economic and military assistance--we would not end our deficit problem. And the programs are far from a giveaway; they are an investment in our security. 
Mr. President, I am not the only one who feels that reductions in foreign affairs spending have put American interests at risk. 
A recent independent, bipartisan blue ribbon panel jointly sponsored by the Brookings Institution and the Council on Foreign Relations came to the same conclusion. 
They concluded that `the cuts already made in the international affairs discretionary account have adversely affected, to a significant degree, the ability of the United States to protect and promote its economic, diplomatic and strategic agendas abroad. 
`Unless this trend is reversed, American vital interests will be jeopardized.' 
Mr. President, we cannot let this trend continue. It is a delusion to believe that America can remain actively engaged in the world if we continue to deny the President and the Secretary of State the resources necessary for the conduct of American foreign policy. 
An important first step in the right direction has been taken by funding in full President Clinton's international affairs budget request for fiscal 1998. 
Yet, as I have demonstrated here today, after several years of drastic cuts, continued funding is critical to restoring and enhancing America's vital diplomatic capacity. 
As it has been reported, the President has decided to reorganize the many foreign affairs agencies of the Federal Government. 
I support the President's reorganization plan, and believe that we should eliminate duplication and waste in our foreign policy programs. 
However, we in the Congress must keep in mind the needs of the next century and the importance of our diplomatic presence abroad. 
I also want to make clear that our reform efforts should be driven not by the imperative of budgetary savings--as important as that is--but by the need to ensure that we have a robust diplomatic presence around the globe in order to protect the gains of our cold war victory. 
Let me also unequivocally state that any savings realized from reorganization of our foreign policy agencies should not be diverted elsewhere but re-allocated to enhance our diplomatic readiness. 
Moreover, in acting to ensure adequate funding for American foreign policy, we should also end the false distinction--in both our thinking and our budgeting--between foreign policy and national defense. 
For years, we have distinguished between the two as if they were separate and unrelated aspects of our national budget. 
But that is hardly the case. Quite the opposite: The two are closely linked, and should be similarly conceived as part of a broader national security budget. 
This is far from a radical concept. More than most Americans, members of the U.S. military well understand that diplomacy is the front-line of our national defense. 
Both our diplomats and our soldiers work on a daily basis to protect our national security, and their missions overlap frequently. 
When American aircraft carriers are deployed to the Taiwan Straits, they are not only showing American military power, they are demonstrating the United States commitment to security and stability in East Asia. 
When American diplomats negotiate nuclear and conventional arms control agreements in Europe and Eurasia, they are strengthening European security, a vital national interest which has long been central to our defense planning. 
In short, just as the projection of military power is a diplomatic tool, diplomacy is a weapon in the arsenal of our national defense. Both are vital to our national interest; both should be protected. 
Mr. President, the debate over the form and substance of our Nation's foreign policy comes down to this--will America lead? 
I believe our interests call for it. The sacrifices of our grandparents and parents require it. The future of this great country demands it. 
Mr. President, the end of the cold war and the approach of a new century provides a historic moment for the United States to play a decisive role in world affairs--to bend the course of history slightly. Such moments are rare. 
The last such time, after the conflagration of the Second World War, saw an active American leadership role in shaping the institutions that were central to world history in the last half of this century--institutions such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the World Bank. 
Like the choices made by Presidents named Roosevelt and Truman and Senators named Connolly and Vandenburg a half century ago, the decisions we make now could affect the course of world history for generations to come. 
Congress needs to reinforce America's leadership in the world, and provide the resources necessary to protect our interests overseas. 
We bear a responsibility to the American people to make the case and show the benefits for these investments, as well as the costs of not pursuing them. 
I, for one, will do everything I can as ranking minority member on the Foreign Relations Committee to make sure that we do. 
Rather than resting on our laurels after winning the cold war, we must be even more resolute, lest we squander an opportunity to bring peace and democracy to even more people across the globe.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to condemn in the strongest possible terms recent comments that have been attributed to Mr. Freih Abu Medein, the Justice Minister in the Palestinian authority. 
In a May 17 article in the Washington Post, journalist Barton Gellman reported that Mr. Medein stated last month that `five Zionist Jews' are running the United States' Middle East policy and, in the words of the article, he `added that it is implausible that a nation the size of the United States can find no one else to maintain diplomatic contacts with Palestinians.' 
This statement, if quoted correctly, is deeply offensive on two counts. First, it is patently anti-semitic, or more properly, anti-Jewish. Its conspiratorial overtones reflect the worst traditions of hate-mongering that characterizes classical anti-semitism. 
Second, it is a thinly veiled attempt to manipulate our sovereign right as a country to choose whoever we wish to represent us diplomatically. It also evinces complete ignorance of the American system. 
I am confident that the individuals to whom Mr. Medein refers were not chosen for their religious beliefs, but rather on the strength of their qualifications for the jobs for which they were selected. Anyone who thinks otherwise has great deal to learn about this country. 
If Mr. Medein or anyone else in the Palestinian Authority has difficulty meeting with American representatives who happen to profess a particular religious faith, then that is their problem, not ours. 
I would submit, Mr. President, that we have the right to choose a person of any faith, any gender, and any race to represent us in any place. Should we choose an American who happens to be a Muslim to represent us in Israel, a Hindu to represent us in Pakistan, a Jew in Syria, a Roman Catholic in Yugoslavia, a Greek Orthodox in Turkey, or a Buddhist in China, then that is our sovereign right as a nation. The only criterion should be that the person be qualified for the job for which he or she is selected. Religious affiliation should have absolutely nothing to do with it. Zero. Zilch. 
That is what distinguishes us from the rest of the world. For unfortunately, Mr. Medein's views are not isolated ones. They reflect an all-to-common obsession with race, religion, and ethnicity that plagues much of the world. 
We may not be perfect, but our guiding ideals are unassailable. And we have successfully put those ideals into practice, with the result that many others seek to emulate us. 
Mr. President, the day we pause even for a fraction of a second to contemplate the possible validity of remarks such as Mr. Medein's is the day that we abandon our most fundamental beliefs. 
Bigotry must be denounced, whether it is at home or abroad. American representatives who are the object of bigoted attacks deserve to know that their country stands four-square behind them.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague for his reference. I think it should be made clear that without the chairman's strong and wholehearted support and initiation here, we would not be where we are. I want to, just in a very brief time, review the bidding here a little bit. 
Let me remind everybody that this was in the crime bill, the original Biden-Hatch crime bill, and ended up having some other iterations before it was over. But we had provisions in there for prevention. 
One of the things that happened was on both sides of the aisle, left, right, center, was we got into this great debate about whether prevention works and whether or not the prevention money in the crime bill was to support prisoners in pink tutus dancing in ballet style, and all that kind of stuff. We got into big fights about midnight basketball, and all that. 
I am not suggesting we reengage those fights except to make this following point. The reason why in the original bill a while ago I specifically singled out Boys and Girls Clubs--I want to be up front about this--was real simple. It was the one place I knew that we could get consensus among Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, because this is prevention that works. And it was my view at the time that, if we singled out Boys and Girls Clubs--and we did, which is kind of unusual to do in a crime bill to single out a specific nonprofit to make sure they get money. That is a bit unusual. The reason to do it was, the statistics are overwhelming. Let me give you a few reasons why this works. 
There was a study done by Columbia University that demonstrated--and I am going to be brief--that public housing sites where there are Boys Clubs and Girls Clubs, compared with public housing sites without these clubs, there was a drastic difference. Let me make it clear now, this study was done, no one disputes--they took public housing sites with the same demographic makeup, same cities, same populations, same racial composition, put a Boys and Girls Club in the basements of one, not in the other. 
Here is what the study confirmed. Those public housing projects that had a Boys and Girls Club in the basement, or wherever they were in the building, had 13 percent fewer juvenile crimes, 22 percent less drug activity, and 25 percent less crack presence. This is in the crack epidemic. Still a big problem. We have other things to worry about, too. But the bottom line, Mr. President, is it works. 
I know the Presiding Officer from Montana has done a lot of work with kids over the years. He has been involved in things that have to do with everything from 4-H to rodeos to Lord only knows what. I hear all these stories he tells me about Montana and about how these kids are involved. The truth of the matter is you get a kid involved, you have less chance that kid is going to get involved in something bad. 
My mom has an expression that I am sure every one of our moms have said in different ways, the expression is: `Remember, Joey, an idle mind is a devil's workshop.' The bottom line is you give a kid nothing to do, he is likely to find trouble. Give a kid nothing to do in an area where there is nothing but trouble, he or she becomes part of the trouble. Give a child something to do, an alternative, an escape, a way out where there is nothing but trouble, give them a safe haven, and you increase the prospects that they are not going to be in trouble. 
So that is why we proposed and passed through the Senate in 1996 $20 million in spending for the first year of a 5-year effort to create 1,000 new Boys and Girls Clubs. Ultimately we got $11 million in the final appropriations bill. 
Senator Hatch and some of our colleagues, Senator Leahy and others that are mentioned, worked together to provide the second year of funding in last year's appropriations bill. 
If it were not for the fact that Senator Hatch in the majority party, the leader of the committee, jumped in at that point, I believe the appropriation would not have been anything. He used his influence and his weight, got this up on the radar screen and continued to save this program. So the second year of funding in last year's appropriations bill came through. 
Senator Hatch also worked to pass legislation supporting this concept, the whole notion, last year. The bottom line is, we are working together so that we can have a total of 2,500 Boys and Girls Clubs by the year 2000. This bill does a very important thing. It simplifies--let me emphasize, it simplifies--the application procedure. 
So, although it does not provide additional funding beyond that already authorized, the simplification is important, letting Boys and Girls Clubs go straight to the Justice 
Department. They do not have to go through their Governors, do not have to go through their State legislature, do not have to go through their city council. They go straight to the Justice Department and seek the funding. 
This is the simple, straightforward approach that I have always supported in the Biden crime bill and why I am so pleased that my colleague, the chairman of the committee, has in fact been so supportive and led on this. 
Last year's bill provided for consultation with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, an unnecessary requirement. I have nothing against HUD, but I believe we must get these important prevention dollars out to the Boys and Girls Clubs throughout the country as quickly and as efficiently as possible. And this bill well help do that. 
Let me conclude by saying, if we are able to fund 2,500 Boys and Girls Clubs, it could not come at a more important moment in our history from a demographic standpoint. There are 39 million children, Mr. President, under the age of 10 in the United States of America today, the largest cadre of young people about to enter the crime-committing years that we have had since the baby boom of those of us born in the 1940's. 
It is a big deal, Mr. President. If we through our police efforts, through our present efforts, hold the percentage of crime committed by young people to the same percentage it is now, without one one-hundredth of 1 percent increase in the amount of crime that is committed, as a percent of the population, we will in fact still have about an 8 percent increase in violent crime in America. You know why? That is how many more kids there are going to be. We better figure out now before this so-called baby boomlet--that's what the demographers are referring to--before this baby boomlet hits those crime-committing years. 
I can think of nothing--nothing--that the police can do, nothing that we can do, that can solve the problem alone without providing safe havens and alternatives for these children. boys and Girls Clubs are a proven--a proven--safe haven. A proven safe haven. 
So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to adopt this legislation. I hope this bill is a sign that we will continue to work together to deal with those prevention efforts that work. Another thing all our moms said to us, `An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.' `An ounce of prevention.' This is 2,500 ounces of prevention that will prevent tens of thousands of pounds of crime. This is a big deal. 
I thank my colleague for his support and allowing me to participate in this effort. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I supported and still support the partial-birth abortion bill. I voted for it in 1995 and voted to override the President's veto last year. The bill was a step in the direction of ending late-term abortions. But, it was not a perfect solution. It did not, as I would have liked, ban all post-viability abortions. 
There is no dispute that under the Supreme Court's Roe versus Wade decision, the government can ban post-viability abortions. But, I was and still am concerned that in banning only partial-birth abortions, we do not go far enough. In fact, there is a legitimate concern that in banning partial-birth abortions, not a single abortion would be prevented. The result would be merely to shift the type of procedure used in performing an abortion. 
Today, Mr. President, we have a better solution--a solution that goes beyond the ban on a single procedure by actually banning all late-term abortions. The Daschle proposal would make all post-viability abortions--regardless of the method used--illegal, except in very limited circumstances consistent with Roe versus Wade. As an article in The Washington Times put it--and the Times is one of the most conservative newspapers in America--`Mr. Daschle's plan would go further in restricting abortion than the . . . partial-birth plan.' 
If the goal is to reduce the number of abortions in America and to eliminate late-term abortions consistent with Roe versus Wade--and that has been my goal from day one--then the Daschle proposal is the answer because the Daschle proposal bans all post-viability abortions. The only exception is when an abortion is necessary to save the woman's life or in the small number of cases where continuation of the pregnancy would, to quote the amendment, `risk grievous injury to her physical health.' 
Now, I wish to address for just a minute the health exception. Critics often claim that a health exception is a gigantic loophole--a loophole so big, some have said, that it would allow a teenage girl to get a late-term abortion just because she could not fit into her prom dress. That is an outrageously untrue claim to begin with, regardless of the language of the health exception. But, the rhetoric aside, the health exception under the Daschle proposal is extremely narrow. It must be a severely debilitating disease caused by the pregnancy or it must be a case where a woman cannot undergo necessary treatment for a life-threatening condition as long as she is pregnant. This is not mental health. This is not a minor ailment. This is grievous physical injury. 
There are some, Mr. President, who simply do not believe that there should ever be a health exception no matter how narrow. I disagree. There needs to be a narrow health exception. Take, for example, a woman who, during pregnancy, is diagnosed with breast cancer. Her life is not directly endangered by the pregnancy, but her long-term prospects for survival are. Early detection and treatment of breast cancer can increase survival rates by 30 percent. But, a pregnant woman cannot undergo chemotherapy treatment unless her pregnancy is terminated because the chemotherapy can result in permanent damage, even mutation, of the fetus. And, a continued pregnancy will weaken her body's immune system, making it harder for her to fight the cancer. That decision should be between the woman and God, not the government. 
Cases such as these are tragic situations--rare and tragic. But, it would be even more tragic to say that ipso facto a woman cannot have an abortion unless her life is threatened by giving birth. That is why the Supreme Court has required a health exception and why the Daschle proposal includes a very narrow health exception. 
Mr. President, I admit I am faced with a dilemma here. I can vote to ban one particular abortion procedure that I find repugnant--but in the process, allow late-term abortions to continue. Or, I can vote to eliminate more abortions, by banning all late-term abortions--but in the process allow the so-called partial-birth abortion procedure to continue under limited circumstances. I wish we were not faced with the choice of one or the other. I would like to do both. But, I must cast my vote now for the proposal that I believe will result in fewer abortions. In my view, that is the Daschle proposal. But, let me also be clear. If the Daschle proposal fails, I will again vote for the bill to ban partial-birth abortions.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me begin by acknowledging what the Senator and chairman of the committee said, and that is that this treaty has been around a long time, and all of a sudden it came popping up here. Some of us, like the Senator from North Carolina and the majority leader and others, myself included, have felt it is a Senate prerogative to determine whether or not this flank agreement should be agreed to. It is an amendment to the treaty. The administration for a long time concluded it was not a prerogative of the Senate, and it was not necessary to submit this treaty. 
Some have asked, why are we acting so expeditiously on this treaty? Why is there this deadline? Two reasons: One, we waited a long time to agree we had the responsibility to accede to this or it could not occur, and, two, there is a real May 15 deadline by which all 30 nations must ratify this agreement. If, in fact, they do not, the agreement will have to be reviewed by all of them. 
We are right now dealing with the enlargement of NATO, we are now dealing with the NATO-Russia Charter, and if it looks as though the United States is reneging on this flank agreement, it can just create a lot of confusion. 
Having said that, had I been chairman of the committee rather than the ranking member and had it been a Republican President, I probably would have spent more time chastising the administration than the distinguished Senator from North Carolina. He just rolled up his sleeves and said, `OK, this is a necessary and important treaty,' and didn't spend a lot of time in recriminations about why it took so long to get here. I thank him for that, and I thank him for the way in which he moved this. I doubt there is any treaty or change in a treaty as significant as this that has moved as rapidly through the Foreign Relations Committee with as studied an approach as under the leadership of my colleague from North Carolina. 
Mr. President, nearly 6 years ago, as chairman of the Subcommittee on European Affairs, I managed the ratification of the original CFE agreement for the then Democratic chairman of the committee. The treaty was, I believe then and I believe now, a monumental achievement, capping some two decades of negotiations between NATO and Warsaw Pact countries to establish a secure conventional military balance in Europe. I would argue, it was sort of the prelude to the undoing of our adversary at the time, the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. 
Mr. President, the treaty has succeeded as few other arms reduction measures have. Since 1992, it has fundamentally altered the military landscape from the Atlantic to the Urals, dramatically reducing the number of pieces of equipment that could be used to wage war. 
In the last 5 years, the CFE Treaty has resulted in the removal or destruction of more than 53,000 pieces of heavy equipment, including tanks, artillery, armored combat vehicles, attack helicopters, and combat aircraft. 
Since 1991, of course, the political face of Europe has changed dramatically. These developments had an impact on the relevance and potential durability of the CFE Treaty. Particularly effective were the so-called flank limits. To the average citizen out there, a flank limit is not much different than a flank steak or flank cut. The fact of the matter is, it has real significance; it is very important. 
The flank limits were included to prevent military equipment that was removed from Central Europe from being concentrated elsewhere. We set limits on how much equipment could be set on that inter-German border, which we necessarily focused on for so many years. As that equipment was removed or destroyed, what we did not want to have happen is to have the Soviets take that equipment and move it into the flanks, moving it on the Turkish border or moving it up by Norway and having a predominance of force accumulated there. 
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia began to argue 
that the treaty, particularly the so-called flank limits, did not adequately reflect its security needs in the flank zone. We had placed limits on what type of equipment and how much could be placed in these flanks. Had I a map, I would reference it, but the fact of the matter is, we put limits on this. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia began to argue that the treaty, particularly the flank limits, did not adequately reflect its security needs in the flank zone. 
Put another way, all those folks in the Caucasus and Transcaucasus are now independent countries. When this was negotiated, they weren't part of the deal. They weren't part of the deal, and it was some Soviet general in Moscow deciding what could and could not be done in those countries. 
Now the Russians come back and say, `Hey, wait, this isn't the deal we signed on to.' Russell Long--a great Senator who the Senator from North Carolina remembers well, but not nearly as well as the Senator from West Virginia sitting behind me--one of Russell Long's many expressions used to be, `I ain't for no deal I ain't in on.' All of a sudden, the Russians realized that they had signed on to a deal that, in a strong way, they were no longer in on, as it related to what was left of the Soviet Union. 
Consequently, the NATO alliance agreed to negotiations on revising these flank limits, and the result was the agreement before us now known as the Flank Document that was signed by 30 states parties--a fancy term for saying 30 countries--to the treaty in Vienna on May 31, 1996. Reiterating the point made by my friend from North Carolina, this was signed a year ago, 1996. I believe that our negotiators, while meeting some Russian concerns, did an excellent job of protecting the interests of this country and the democracies on the northern and southern flanks of the former Soviet Union. 
The CFE Flank Document removes some areas from what we call the old flank zone, but maintains constraints on equipment both in the new flank zone and in the old one. There are also limits on armored combat vehicles in each area that were removed from the old flank zone so as to prevent any tremendous concentration of equipment in any one place. 
We all are concerned about Russian troop deployments outside its borders, Mr. President. We cannot allow Moscow to coerce its independent neighbors into accepting the presence of foreign forces on their soil or into giving up their own rights to military equipment, which would now be folded into this total limit. 
But I believe the Flank Document and the resolution of ratification now before the Senate addresses these concerns and recognizes that sovereign countries must have the right to refuse Russian demands. Indeed, the chairman and I have found common ground on most of the issues in this resolution. 
There are a total of, if I am not mistaken, 14 conditions, Mr. President. Two of these conditions of ratification, however, I think are extraneous and give me some concern. Of the 14, there are only two that I would flag for my colleagues, and I am not going to move to strike either one of them. I am not going to move to do anything about it. I just want to make the point of why I think they are unnecessary or counterproductive. 
The first is condition 5, which includes a provision calling for a special report on possible noncompliance of the CFE Treaty by Armenia. I regret that this provision was included in the resolution at the insistence of the majority, but I am pleased that we have reached an agreement through the efforts of Senator John Kerry and Senator Sarbanes--and I am sure if they reached an agreement they must have run it by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia or it would not have been agreed to--to mitigate the one-sided nature of this original agreement. 
More troubling, though, is condition 9. I will not speak more about condition 5 in the interest of time. Condition 9 also is insisted upon by the majority, and I note from a brief discussion, 
while working out yesterday out of the Senate environs with my distinguished friend from Virginia, that he feels very strongly about, and I happen to disagree with him on it. 
Condition 9 requires the President to submit an agreement which will multilateralize the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to the Senate for advice and consent. Put another way, there is a condition placed on here, very skillfully, I might add, by my friends who have concerns about the ABM Treaty that has nothing to do with this flank agreement. I was of the view it should not be included as part of a condition to this treaty. I did not have the votes. I must say to my friend from North Carolina, it is not merely because I hope I am a gentleman that I am not attempting to remove the condition, I do not have the votes to remove the condition, so I am not going to attempt to do something that I know will not prevail. But, I would like to point out, the condition is titled `Senate Prerogatives.' The title is interesting but, I think, inaccurate. 
I take a back seat to no one when it comes to Senate prerogatives. As a matter of fact, it was the Byrd-Biden amendment attached to the INF Treaty. We have been jealous of the protection of our constitutional obligations and responsibilities. With all due respect, and it sounds self-serving, but I take a back seat to no one in the Senate in terms of protecting the constitutional obligations and responsibilities of the Senate. But in this case, I do not think we have a prerogative to exercise, notwithstanding condition 9 is called `Senate Prerogatives.' 
The issue involves two powers: recognition of successor states and the power to interpret and implement treaties, both of which are executive functions. 
Mr. President, it is undisputed that the President has the exclusive power, under the powers of article 2 of the Constitution, to recognize new states. I am not going to take a long time on this, so don't everybody worry I am in for a long constitutional discussion; I am only going to spend another 3 or 4 minutes, but I want to make the point for the Record. Under article 2, section 2 of the Constitution, the President and the Senate have a shared duty to `make treaties.' But once the treaty is made, it is the law of the land, and the President, under article 2, section 3, has the duty to take care that it is faithfully executed. 
In exercising this duty, it is for the President to determine whether a treaty remains in force, a determination that, of necessity, must be made whenever a state dissolves. 
So what are we talking about here? We had an ABM Treaty and CFE Treaty with the former Soviet Union. The Soviet Union dissolved. And the question remains, all those constituent countries that are now independent countries, is the President able to recognize Ukraine, for example, and, as a consequence, recognize the Ukrainians' assertion that they want to be part of the ABM Treaty? They were part of it when they were part of the whole Soviet Union, but as the constituent parts broke apart, the question was: As each individual country within that whole signs on to the continued commitment to ABM, does that require ratification by the United States Senate with each of them again? I would argue, and I will argue at a later date--I am sure we will hear more of this--that it does not require that. It is not a Senate prerogative. 
In the case before us, the ABM Treaty, the President has the power to declare whether Russia and the other New Independent States inherit the treaty obligations of the former Soviet Union, provided those states indicate a desire to do so and provided that the succession agreement effects no substantive change in the terms of the treaty. 
Both the Bush and Clinton administrations exercised this power following the breakup of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Ethiopia as it relates to other issues, not as it relates to ABM. Moreover, it bears emphasis that the two arms 
control treaties, the CFE Treaty and the INF Treaty, were multilateralized by the executive action without the advice and consent of the Senate. By definition, we are all here, we are not asking for multilateralization of the flank agreement. It is somewhat curious that we say ABM requires the Senate to have a treaty vote on every successor nation, but on CFE, which we all like and we have no substantive disagreement on, we are not asking for that. 
So the point I am making is that this condition has nothing to do with CFE and it is more about whether you like ABM or do not like ABM, not about who has what constitutional responsibility, I respectfully suggest. 
I agree with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the other side of the issue in one respect, that this is the subject of legitimate debate. But the debate, which I am confident we can win on the merits, can readily be conducted at another time on a more germane subject than a treaty that it has nothing to do with. Nonetheless, the majority insisted upon this extraneous condition, and I think I can count votes. 
I will never forget going to former Chairman Eastland as a young member of the Judiciary Committee asking for his support. He sat behind his desk, I say to the chairman of the committee, and said, `Did you count?' I didn't understand what he said. 
I said, `I beg your pardon, Mr. Chairman?' 
He took that cigar out--I was asking to be chairman of the Subcommittee on Criminal Laws, because Senator McClellan had just passed away and, for years, it had been his job. It was a contest between me and another Senator. 
I was looking at him, and he said, `Did you count?' I seriously did not understand what he was saying. `I beg your pardon?' I said. I tried to be humorous. I said, `Mr. Chairman, I don't speak Southern very well.' He smiled and looked at me, and he took the cigar out of his mouth, and said, `Son, when you have counted, come back and talk to me.' 
Well, I learned to count. The reason I am not contesting this now, as I said, I counted. I do not have the votes at this moment to remove condition 9 and still get this treaty up and out of here in time. So I will reserve that fight for another day. 
Despite the inclusion of condition 9, I will strongly support the flank agreement because of its integral role in protecting American interests in maintaining security and stability in Europe. Indeed, the Flank Document we will be voting on is an important bridge to the broader revision of the CFE Treaty now under discussion as we talk about the enlargement of NATO. Those talks will allow us to achieve further reductions in military equipment in Europe and ensure that the confidence-building measures embodied in the CFE Treaty remain in place. 
Mr. President, the CFE Treaty is just one component of the architecture of arrangements, including NATO, the Partnership for Peace, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, all of which are designed to ensure that in the post-cold war era, the European nations remain free and independent and are partners in a zone of security and prosperity. 
But by maintaining the integrity of the CFE Treaty, we maintain the forum in which an enlarged NATO will make clear to Russia that our objective is stability in Europe, not military intimidation. Ratification of the flank agreement is a modest but important step toward the new European security system. 
I urge my Senate colleagues to do two things--thank the chairman of the full committee for expediting this, and when we get very shortly to a vote on it, to vote their advice and consent to ratification. 
I thank again the chairman of the full committee. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. BIDEN. The Senator makes a valid observation. The truth is, it was not necessary, but I would like to give the explanation why it was included, and the majority can speak even more clearly to it. 
The concern on the part of the majority was that the Clinton administration would use the Biden-Byrd language to justify sending a modification of a treaty for a two-House approval by majority vote rather than to the Senate for a supermajority vote when, in fact, it was a modification that constituted an amendment to the treaty. 
You never intended it for that purpose; I never intended it for that purpose. The concern was, I think it is fair to say on the part of the majority, that the Clinton administration might have attempted to read it to allow them to avoid submission to the Senate for a supermajority vote under the Constitution and just go to each House for a majority vote.

Mr. BIDEN. Yes, it is. If I may say, Madam President, to the distinguished leader, that in a November 25, 1996, memorandum for Alan J. Kreczko, Special Assistant to the President and Legal Adviser to the National Security Council, from Christopher Schroeder, Acting Assistant Attorney General, there is this phrase on page 14 of that memorandum. It says: 
Because the Senate took the view that such `common understandings' of a treaty had the same binding effect as express provisions of the treaty for the purposes of U.S. law, the Biden condition logically supports the proposition that the President may be authorized to accept changes in treaty obligations either by further Senate advice and consent or by statutory enactment. 
The next paragraph: 
In light of these judicial and historical precedents, we conclude the Congress may authorize the President, through an executive agreement, substantially to modify the United States' international obligations under an arms control (or other political-military) treaty. 
So the purpose, again, was to make it clear what you and I, as we understood at the time that condition was added--I might add, I get credit for it being called the Biden-Byrd condition, of which I am very proud, but the truth of the matter is, after having suggested such a condition early in the ratification process, I spent the next 7 months in the hospital during the remainder of the whole ratification process, and it was the distinguished leader, the Senator from West Virginia--it really should be the Byrd-Biden condition. Nonetheless, that is the reason. You and I never thought a majority vote in both Houses as a simple piece of legislation would be sufficient to approve an amendment to a treaty, and that was the concern expressed by the majority that it be memorialized, if you will, in condition (8).

Mr. BIDEN. Let me say, this all came about--and they are, obviously, as usual, very good, incisive and insightful questions. 
I think it is unnecessary because I think it is a given. But let me explain, in fairness, why we got to this point and why I thought it was--speaking only for myself--a clarification, although in some sense I thought it was a demeaning clarification. Let me explain. 
During the negotiations on the flank agreement, there was concern about what became referred to as a `side agreement.' That was, there was an issue that came up during the negotiations where a diplomatic note was passed, which is classified--I am not able to give you, but I can tell you from the committee testimony what it said--a note that was passed to the Russian representative dealing with the issue of the stationing of Russian troops on the soil of the countries you named. 
The Under Secretary of State, Lynn Davis, who appeared before the committee on April 29, was asked to explain. He went on to explain why a statement was made to the Russians. The statement made was that we would--this is the quote, in part--`the United States is prepared to facilitate or act as an intermediary for a successful outcome in discussions that could take place under the flank agreement and the CFE Treaty between Russia and other Newly Independent States.' 
The worry expressed by my friends in the Republican Party was that this reflected a possible inclination to try to mollify Russia and put American pressure on Moldova or Georgia or other states to 
accept Russian deployment of Russian forces on their soil. 
The concern was that the assertion made by the U.S. negotiators was a way of saying, do not worry, we are going to help you to get Russian troops placed in those regions. 
Lynn Davis, the Under Secretary said, no, that was never the intention of that `side agreement,' as it became referred to. 
I will quote what he said at the hearing to my friend from West Virginia. He said: 
We see this particular statement of our intentions as part of the reassurance that we can make so that those countries will feel that this is an agreement that continues to be in their security interests. This statement of our intentions makes clear that the commitment is predicated on an understanding that any agreements between Russia and the Newly Independent States must be done on a voluntary basis with due respect for the sovereignty of the countries involved, and our role here is indeed to reinforce that and ensure that it is carried out. 
This was the concern that was expressed by my friends on the Republican side, that the United States intention to level the playing field between Russia and other Newly Independent States had not been seen that way by all concerned. 
So what was done--and the administration signed on to the condition--was to make it crystal clear that this offer of an intermediary role was not for the purpose of using our influence or power to coerce them into accepting a demand or a suggestion from their Russian brethren. 
That is the context, I say to my friend, in which it came up. You used the phrase `the committee became alarmed.' Some in the committee were alarmed because of the wording of the `side agreement.' This was done to clarify what the administration says was their intent from the beginning but now locks in the stated interpretation by the administration of what that whole thing was all about. 
I hope I have answered the question, and I hope I have done it correctly.

Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, the Senate has always been served well by the talent of the Senator from West Virginia and, most importantly, in making sure that we do our job responsibly. 
I would make only one 20-second explanation of why I think this treaty got less of a cover than any others. 
One was the way in which it was delayed and being presented and the timeframe. But a second reason is that people who followed this, which is a mistake to assume everyone should, people who follow this have been aware of what the terms of the agreement were since May of last year. 
I think many of us fell into the routine on Foreign Relations and Armed Services of thinking that its terms were well known. And it was widely accepted, the broad outlines of the treaty. But I think the Senator makes a very valid point and I, too, as ranking member of this committee, do not want to be party to these expedited efforts to deal with very significant security issues relating to the United States.

Mr. BIDEN. I would like to publicly comment and compliment the Senator from Mississippi. The truth of the matter is that this treaty would not be before the Senate today as a treaty without the efforts of the majority leader. The executive believed that they can do this by executive agreement. They did not think they needed to submit this to the Senate, although I had been for several months explaining that I thought it should be treated as a treaty. It was not until the distinguished leader from Mississippi said, if it is not treated as a treaty, we have a problem. 
The truth of the matter is the reason it is here is because of the distinguished Senator from Mississippi. I thank him for that.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today marks the publication date of a remarkable compilation of letters from a remarkable man, imprisoned Chinese political dissident Wei Jingsheng. His book, `The Courage To Stand Alone: Letters From Prison and Other Writings,' should be required reading for anyone who takes for granted the freedoms enshrined in our Constitution and Bill of Rights. Wei is currently serving 14 years for the crime of advocating democracy in a country where freedom of speech does not extend to criticism of government authorities. 
An electrician by training, Wei lacks the formal education of some other famous 20th century champions of democracy and civil rights--Vaclav Havel, Andrei Sakharov, or Martin Luther King--but whatever he may lack in sophistication, he more than makes up for with his blunt eloquence. 
Just days before the Chinese crackdown against pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square, Wei offered some candid advice for China's top leaders from his prison cell, urging them to `take great strides to implement a democratic government as quickly as possible.' A great tragedy might have been avoided if Beijing's gerontocracy had heeded Wei's call. 
Wei was first imprisoned from 1979 to 1993 on charges of `counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement,' the result of his participation in the Democracy Wall Movement. During this brief flowering of officially authorized political dissent in China, Wei had the nerve to argue that China's modernization goals could not be met without democratic reform. For this affront, he was severely punished. 
In 1993, on the eve of the International Olympic Committee's decision about whether to award the 2000 Olympics to Beijing, China briefly released Wei in an effort to strengthen its Olympic bid. On April 1, 1994, just days after meeting with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, John Shattuck, Wei was detained once more. 
He was subsequently sentenced to 14 years for trying to `overthrow the Chinese Government.' The actions cited as proof of Wei's `counter-revolutionary' intent included publishing articles critical of the government and raising funds for the victims of political persecution in China. 
Wei has spent most of his last 18 years in solitary confinement, enduring a variety of physical and psychological hardships. He is now widely reported to be in very poor health, suffering from heart and back ailments that require urgent medical attention. Attention he is currently denied. 
Today, I join with my colleagues to urge the Chinese Government to take all necessary steps to release Wei Jingsheng from prison on humanitarian grounds. Chinese authorities should ensure that Wei immediately receives the medical care he requires. Wei's imprisonment comes as a result of his peaceful advocacy of democracy and basic human rights. His words warrant our admiration, not a death sentence.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to both of these amendments, notwithstanding my great respect for the Senator from Wisconsin, and I mean that sincerely. I have great respect for him. But I think this is another in a series of bad ideas this floor has produced over the last 5 years with regard to Bosnia. 
Mr. President, I echo the sentiments expressed by my friend from Connecticut. Let me say it in a slightly different way. In my view, we could have avoided the tragedy, the extent of the tragedy in Bosnia, had we the courage, the foresight to lift and strike 4 years ago, had we stood up to that war criminal Milosevic in Serbia and had we made clear to Tudjman in Croatia that we would broker no alternative but their ceasing and desisting. Every time America has spoken and followed up its speech with action, we have produced the results that we suggested would occur. 
It is a sad commentary, Mr. President, that there is no leadership in Europe. There is no leadership in Europe. And the ability of the Europeans to get together and solve the problem in their own backyard and keep it from spreading into other people's front yards is nonexistent based upon their actions for the previous 5 years, 
until the United States led, but led at a moment and a time when our options were reduced relative to the ones that existed a year or two earlier. 
The Senator from Connecticut and I initially never argued that American troops should be put on the ground in Bosnia. We felt very strongly that could have been avoided had we used our airpower, had we lifted sanctions to allow the Bosnian Government--that at that moment was still multi-ethnic--to have a chance to fight for itself. But that is water under the bridge. That is past. We are left with Dayton, which was making the best out of a bad circumstance. The end result of Dayton is that we will have invested about $5 billion by September of this year, plus America's prestige and American forces on the ground in Bosnia. 
I must tell you straight up, I am opposed even to the administration's announcement that we withdraw and have a drop-dead date for June 1998. But I think it borders on the ridiculous for the U.S. Senate to instruct the President that we must withdraw as early as the initial proposal called for, in September.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alaska. He is absolutely correct. What he has said, as I translate it, is this amendment does not mean anything in the legislative sense. 
But I promise you, I promise you, if this amendment passes today, it will mean something to the Republika Srpska; it will mean something in Mostar; it will mean something in Belgrade; it will mean something in the Balkans; it will mean something in Paris; it will mean something in Moscow. It will mean something where it matters, and what matters is what the rest of the world believes our resolve is. 
We sometimes do not focus closely enough, and I acknowledge I do not, as well. But we have a situation in Croatia right now where the President of Croatia is very ill. To call him a very strong man is putting it mildly, and it connotes everything that goes along with strongman, a guy who is no box of chocolates. There is already a battle for succession going on in Croatia between the nationalists, those who to this day wish to see the partition of Bosnia, and those who are democrats, who want to become part of the West. 
If we announce now that the U.S. Senate want American troops out of there, either this September or next June, we give succor to those in Croatia who will argue the following: `With the United States gone, no peace can hold, partition is the answer, and we are going to get our piece.' 
The same is taking place in Belgrade. Milosevic is a war criminal. He is a thug. Remember the history of why this war took place in the first place. What happened there was, in effect, a referendum as to whether or not Bosnia would stay part of Yugoslavia. There was a vote. The voters said we want to set up an independent nation-state. They set it up, recognized by the United Nations, and Milosevic sent the Yugoslav National Army across the river. He supplied and gave cover for the use of force against the Muslims and Croats, and he instituted a war of aggression. He and his cronies instituted a policy of ethnic cleansing, a phrase I do not think any of us ever thought we would hear again. They actually talked about it out loud. That was their policy. 
Mr. President, our good friend, Mr. Milosevic, is on his last legs in Belgrade. Why, at this moment, are we going to indicate to him that there is a consensus in this country that the United States should walk away? Why are we going to do that now? What 
possible good would that do? 
Secretary Cohen, a man we all respect, has guaranteed we will be out of Bosnia in June 1998. He has said this in private meetings, in private arguments with me, and in public discussions. The President has said it. Madeleine Albright has acknowledged it. As I said, I think that, in and of itself, is a mistake. For us to come along now and announce to the world that we are not going to appropriate moneys is a mistake--and I acknowledge these are moneys we could not appropriate anyway. But they are not going to understand all that. All they are going to understand is that the United States of America, the U.S. Senate, has told the President he has to get out of there. 
I echo the phrase my friend from Connecticut used. He said, when has it ever made sense for us, in a circumstance where there is the potential for or the immediate past presence of war, to announce that we are going to leave and give a lead time to that announcement? When has that ever benefited us? 
Our only hope for the peace process is to continue to have an international force remain in Bosnia through June 1998. At least through June 1998. By then, several things will have shaken themselves out, one of which is the political situation in Croatia and the other is the political situation in Serbia. 
I am going to refrain from doing what I want to do, speak in more depth about this, because my friend from Alaska is technically right. He is right that this does not mean anything legislatively. I just want it to be known that there are voices in the Senate that think this is a very bad policy. When this amendment is written about, when this is discussed in other capitals of the world, they should understand not all of us share this view. 
This is not a sound policy. At this moment, it is my hope and expectation that the administration is leaning on our European allies to make it clear to them that we are willing to support a European-led follow-on force in Bosnia, composed of European troops, after the SFOR mandate ends. Remember what we said: We are going to remove American forces from Bosnia. We did not say we are disengaging in every military sense from Bosnia. The President did not say that, thank God, and I hope he will not say that. 
What we should be doing now, and what I hope we are doing now, is meeting with our NATO allies to explain to them that we are willing to have a forward force based in Hungary to back them up. We are willing to use our airpower and our intelligence apparatus to assist them. We are willing to use the capacity of our naval forces in the Adriatic to help maintain peace and security in Bosnia. This takes time. This amendment undercuts every possible option that exists between now and June 1998 by announcing now that the U.S. Senate does not support the continued presence of the United States of America in that part of the world. 
I do not fully understand what both my friend from Wisconsin and the Senator from Texas are saying. I acknowledge the Senator from Alaska is correct. This is meaningless in a legislative sense. But I do not understand what my two friends hope to accomplish here. Their amendment says, `Provided further, that none of the funds made available under this Act may be obligated or expended for operations or activities of the armed forces relating to Bosnia ground deployment after June 30, 1998.' 
Does that mean we cannot use our intelligence apparatus? Does that mean we cannot have forward deployment in Hungary? Does that mean we cannot use our airpower? Maybe it does. Maybe it does not. But I tell you one thing: To merely suggest that we are going to pull out U.S. ground forces is a bit disingenuous as well. 
So, again, I do not want to take any more time of the Senate except to say that this is a well-intended, very bad idea. It is a very bad idea. It does not serve U.S. interests. It does not serve us or aid us in our ability to lead an alliance in carrying out its responsibilities in Europe, in Bosnia. And it does not lend any support to those in both Serbia and in Croatia who are trying to change the political landscape of both those countries, which will have an impact upon the circumstance in Bosnia. 
So, again, I say as I yield the floor, with due respect to my friend from Wisconsin, I think this is a serious mistake. I hope the Senate will not go along with this suggestion. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to reintroduce President Clinton's proposal, the Presidential Honors Scholarship Act of 1997. I first introduced this bill on behalf of the administration last September--and I have included a very similar proposal in my own comprehensive higher education legislation, known as the Get Ahead Act. I am honored to have the opportunity to reintroduce this measure for the President, who continues his endless efforts at improving American education and making sure that college is affordable to all Americans. 
Most people are probably not familiar with Presidential Honors Scholarships, but I think many people have heard of the idea of merit scholarships. It is pretty simple. Under the bill, all students in public and private schools who graduate in the top 5 percent of their class would be designated as Presidential honors scholars and would receive a $1,000 scholarship to college. The scholarship could be used during their freshman year at the college of their choice, and the scholarship would not be used in determining eligibility for other financial aid. 
I strongly support merit scholarships for two reasons. First, we need to start rewarding excellence in educational achievement. Under the leadership of President Clinton, 4 years ago Congress passed legislation that encourages States to set high academic standards for their students. This proposal builds on that idea by rewarding those students who meet those high standards. Students who work hard and succeed ought to be recognized and rewarded. 
Second, by providing scholarship moneys, this bill will help thousands of students in paying for the costs of a college education, which, I might add, is becoming more and more difficult for middle-class families. I realize that $1,000 does not go a long way in paying for a public college education, not to mention the costs of a private college. But, it will be of some help, and for those who choose to go to a community college, it will pay for about two-thirds of the cost. 
Mr. President, I suspect that we will be debating higher education more than once this year. There is much to be done. We need to provide a tax deduction for the costs of college. We should allow penalty-free withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts to pay for college. We should make permanent the employer-provided education tax exclusion. We need to expand the Pell Grant Program. And, we need to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. 
In that process, however, let us not forget merit scholarships. It is not the answer, but it is part of the answer. It is a piece of the puzzle. And while some would say that it is a small piece, it plays an important role in being the one piece that rewards those students who reach for excellence. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues and with President Clinton in seeing that this proposal becomes law.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Zaire must seize the current moment to avoid further bloodshed and negotiate a peaceful resolution to its current crisis. A tentative agreement for a meeting on Friday between President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel Alliance leader Laurent Kabila has been reached. This meeting is critical to avoid further loss of human life in Zaire. I applaud Ambassador Richardson's presence in Zaire and fully support his important and courageous efforts to facilitate a peaceful settlement to the current political turmoil. 
The current crisis in Zaire has reached a critical fork in the road. In one direction lies the peaceful path of democracy and economic reform. In the other, the well-worn road of violence, bloodshed, and political instability. President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel Alliance leader Laurent Kabila at this moment hold the fate of their country in their hands. 
I strongly encourage President Mobutu and Mr. Kabila to earnestly engage in a critical dialog on the future of Zaire. I urge them to put the interests of Zaire and their countrymen first, and resolve the current political crisis without further unnecessary loss of life. 
I have been deeply troubled by recent reports of wide-spread human rights abuses and mass killings of refugees and displaced persons in rebel-controlled Zaire. There are numerous accounts of desperately ill and malnourished women and children being indiscriminately slaughtered and maimed. 
Recently 55,000 refugees have inexplicably disappeared from a refugee camp outside Kisangani. Of these refugees, some 9,000, including 2,500 severely malnourished children, had only days earlier been deemed medically unfit to travel by visiting relief workers. 
After a week of repeatedly denying the United Nations to care for and repatriate refugees in rebel-controlled territory, today's news reports indicate the rebel Alliance is once again allowing the United Nations to care for the sick and the dying. Refusal to have given access to the United Nations over the past week, resulting in the maltreatment of refugees and displaced persons has been nothing short of deplorable. 
I call upon Mr. Kabila to put a permanent end to the bloodletting of innocents in Eastern Zaire. All impediments to humanitarian relief efforts in Zaire must be permanently removed. 
The United Nations must be permitted continued full access to these refugees and allowed to repatriate them to Rwanda without interference. Furthermore, the slaughter of those refugees suspected of responsibility for the 1994 Rwandan genocide must cease, as it is neither justifiable nor defensible. These people must be returned to Rwanda where they can stand trial in an appropriate court of law and rightly be held accountable for their crimes. 
It is time for President Mobutu and Mr. Kabila to signal their willingness to set Zaire on the path to peace and democracy. Zaire is a country of enormous potential that has suffered untold tragedies. Failure to seize this critical opportunity to negotiate peace in Zaire will only set that country woefully back. 
The fighting in Zaire must stop. The crisis in the country cannot be resolved by force. Replacement of the Mobutu regime with yet another authoritarian regime is a recipe of further political instability. I strongly urge both President Mobutu and Mr. Kabila to seize the current opportunity to avoid further bloodshed and choose the constructive path of peace and democracy in Zaire.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am obviously very pleased with the decision the Senator from Nebraska made, but I want to state on the record that I would have been comfortable with whatever decision he made, and I say that for the following reasons. I have been here for 24 years. It has been a long time since I have been a freshman Senator, but I remember how overwhelming it was and the pressures that are exerted, legitimate pressures, when major issues confront someone. I have watched the Senator from Nebraska from the day he got here, because we serve on the same committee, attack with a seriousness of purpose I have seldom seen one of the most complicated issues that is going to come before this body this year. It was not merely determining what groups, what party, what factions of parties were for and against the treaty. He wanted to know what article X meant in the language. He wanted to know whether article I trumped article X. He wanted to know the details 
of it, and he addressed it. 
He indicated that this is the eve of an anniversary. It seems appropriate and totally consistent, I am going to say for the record--I hope I do not embarrass him--what I said to him privately. I have also observed another feature about him. This is a man whose conduct on the battlefield is mirrored by his conduct in politics, in that when he thinks he is right he is not afraid to do whatever it is he thinks he should do. And that comes through. That is what I mean when I say I would have been comfortable and assured that he had given it every consideration had he concluded to vote the other way. I want to publicly compliment him, not for the decision he made, but the way he made the decision. I hope that does not cost him politically, for someone on this side of the aisle to compliment my colleague. 
There is another freshman Senator I serve with, Senator Gordon Smith, who may not come to the same conclusion, but he has addressed it with the same kind of alacrity and commitment. So I just say it is a pleasure to serve with the Senator and our colleague, Senator Smith. But as I said, I am happy he came out the way he did. Regardless of how the Senator came out, I would have been comfortable. 
I yield the floor.

<DOCNO>105-biden-de-9-19970424</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this is condition No. 30. As was indicated at the outset of the unanimous-consent agreement, the Senate has now agreed to 28 of the 33 conditions that were attached to the treaty that is before us today. 
As I indicated at that time that I would be moving to strike five of the conditions, any one of which--at least four of which--if adopted, would essentially vitiate the treaty; would make our ratification useless. 
They are killer amendments. This is one of those amendments. Mr. President, condition No. 30 would hold hostage our joining the Chemical Weapons Convention to the condition that rogue states--several rogue states, such as Iraq, Libya and North Korea--would have to sign and ratify the treaty before we became party to the treaty. 
This has a very perverse impact. The first impact is we wouldn't be in the treaty. We would not have ratified the treaty, if we ratified this condition. Second, it has a perverse impact. It would prevent the United States from participating in the convention until a band of 2-bit regimes that specialize in flaunting norms of civilized behavior decide for us when we should be a member of this treaty. Seventy-four nations have already signed onto it. 
This condition turns the present global arrangement on its head. Instead of the civilized nations of the world setting the rules, this condition effectively let's the villains determine the rules of the road and American policy. This condition ignores the critical fact that regardless of what the rogue states do, regardless of whether we join the CWC, or not, we have decided unilaterally to destroy our chemical weapons stockpile. 
We will not use chemical weapons to respond to a chemical weapons attack. That is a judgment our military and our last Commander in Chief and this one has made. Instead, we will rely on what General Schwarzkof said, and General Powell, General Shalikashvili, and others will rely upon our overwhelming nonchemical military capabilities to deter and retaliate against the use of chemical weapons. 
The best way to affect the behavior of these rogue states is to bring to bear the combined weight of the civilized nations of the world to isolate, sanction, and target those nations who would continue to produce chemical weapons in defiance of the creation of this international norm. But, Mr. President, first we have to establish the norm. If the United States of America says we will not join unless the bad guys join, then there is no reasonable prospect that such a norm will be established. 
As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has noted, to say that we should not have a CWC because there will be people out there who will continue to produce chemical weapons, or who will cheat, is a little bit like saying we should not have laws because people will break them. We should not have laws against murder because we know people are going to murder people. So have no laws against murder. 
The point is that today there is nothing illegal--let's get this straight--under international law about producing chemical weapons, developing chemical weapons, or stockpiling chemical weapons. The purported Libyan chemical weapons program is completely legal today. The Iraqi chemical stockpile is completely legal today. In fact, there is nothing in international law that prohibits the use of chemical weapons internally. Like Saddam Hussein's poison gas attack against the Kurds within Iraq, there is nothing illegal about having or using these weapons in your own country. That will change once the CWC is in force. 
To quote Gen. Colin Powell, `For us to reject this treaty now because there are rogue states outside that treaty is the equivalent of saying that we should not have joined NATO because Russia wasn't part of NATO.' That is former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Colin Powell--not me. 
This treaty will establish standards by which to judge others. If it is violated--that is, if the treaty is violated --it will provide the basis for harsh action to punish and bring violators into compliance. The opponents will say that norms are meaningless unless there is a will to enforce those norms. They are right. But on that point, I would point out that without a norm there is nothing to enforce. 
The bottom line is this: With the treaty we will have more tools and greater flexibility to act against those countries that threaten us and their neighbors. Should we choose military action we would be able to justify it as a measure taken to enforce the terms of a treaty to which we and 160 other nations who are signatories--only 74 ratified--are parties. North Korea is not. Libya is not. But 160 other nations have signed, and we are going to say that we will not join unless North Korea joins. As Gen. Colin Powell said, I am glad these folks weren't around when NATO was starting up to say we are not going to have NATO because Russia can't be a part. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.

Ken Adelman--although I disagree with him most of the time, he was an able member of the administration. He was viewed as a hawk at the time he was here. For the record, I am sure there was no intention to do that?

Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator for making clear what he meant. I didn't think that's what he meant. I was hoping that is not what he meant, but it is what he meant. That could be said about almost everybody who testified before our committee, for and against this treaty, and I really, quite frankly, think that the leaders for and against this treaty in the last two administrations are men and women of integrity who would have no conflict. They are consistent with what they did within those administrations. 
Let me point out a few things. It seems interesting to me that here we are, the very people--our very colleagues who want to have a provision saying that we want all these rogue nations in the treaty before we get into the treaty, argue in the alternative, that these nations in the treaty mean the treaty is worthless. Translated, very simply, they are not for this treaty under any circumstance, whether or not these nations are in the treaty or out of the treaty. I also point out that--in the interest of time, I will not be able to point it out in detail--every argument against this treaty made thus far on the floor today, I respectfully suggest, is made worse by not being in the treaty, by not having the treaty. I find it, quite frankly, interesting. 
My time is up. I hope my colleague will not move to table. We agree not to attempt to amend any of these conditions. I hope we will have a vote up or down. Apparently, it is not in the agreement. If he chooses to do it, I guess he has the right.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. I apologize because I may have to augment this. Although it is a very good idea to do it now, I was preparing to do it later, so I may leave somebody out, and I may amend this. 
Let me begin by thanking a young man, who came over from my personal staff to the Foreign Relations Committee and I think maybe Mr. Billingslea may have thought he was his cousin, they spent so much time together in the last couple of months, and that is Puneet Talwar. He has done a great deal of the heavy lifting for me on this, along with Ed Levine, from the Intelligence Committee, who is now working with me. Ed Hall, the minority staff director; John Lis; the young man--well, he has been with me so long that he is getting old--Brian McKeon, who is counsel for the minority; Frank Januzzi; Dawn Ratliff; Kathi Taylor; Ursula McManus, who we kept up late at night writing memos and other things on our behalf; Casey Adams; Bill Ashworth, a former long-time staff member of the Foreign Relations Committee and Senator Pell's staff; David Schanzer, who worked with me on the Judiciary Committee; Mary Santos; Kimberly Burns; Jennette Murphy; Larry Stein; Randy DeValk; Sheila Murphy, all leadership staff persons who have worked with me. 
I have left out some, but I will augment this with the staff members of the Intelligence Committee, the Appropriations Committee, the Judiciary Committee, and the Armed Services Committee. They all played major rolls. 
The hearings that the distinguished chairman had on this treaty this time around were, I think, among the best hearings--even though I didn't always agree with the witnesses--that I have participated in in my 25 years. The cast of characters were the luminaries of previous administrations, as well as this administration. We had the who's who of the foreign policy establishment, literally. These people were particularly helpful to me, which is going to sound strange. He was up in the gallery, but I am referring to General and former Ambassador Rowny, a close friend and, I think, neighbor of the chairman. I know he is much more philosophically compatible with the chairman than with me, but we found ourselves on the same side of this issue. Everybody wondered why Bob Dole changed his mind--not changed his mind, but why Bob Dole concluded that the conditions that were added to the treaty sufficiently corrected its defects. It is my understanding that General Rowny bumped into Bob Dole in a coffee shop at the Watergate Hotel. I can see the distinguished Senator from Arizona wishing he had been at that coffee shop. But there was Gen. Brent Scowcroft, one of the most respected people in this town, Adm. Elmo Zumwalt; John Deutch; Fred Webber and his staff at the Chemical Manufacturers Association; Gen. Colin Powell; Amy Smithson of the Stimson Center; John Isaacs; Brad Roberts, Institute for Defense Analysis; Barry Kellman, DePaul Law School; Ron Lehman of the Reagan and Bush 
administrations. I am leaving a number of people out who I will add later. 
I thank them all for contributing to this debate. I want to make a personal thanks, if I may, Mr. Chairman and Mr. President, to one of the most competent staff people I have ever dealt with in the administration, Bob Bell, who works for Sandy Berger and who also, I think, did an incredibly good job here, and Lori Murray, also of that staff. Bob Bell is a walking encyclopedia, who negotiated with the Lott committee. He is a man who has the ability to understand very complex notions and put them into language everybody can understand. He has done an admirable job. There are other people to thank.

Mr. BIDEN. The answer is I would absolutely like to do that. The statement I was going to introduce has a paragraph about that. 
I express my deep appreciation to Senator Lugar, with whom I have talked every day for the past few months as we have tried to move the ball forward in this treaty. He was very committed. He is truly the Senate's leading expert on the treaty and, I think, one of the leading experts in this country on foreign policy. We would not have gotten this far without his efforts. Perhaps the reason he is as good as he is that he has a father and son team working for him, Kenneth and Kenny Myers. I envy Ken Myers, Senator Lugar's long-time staff aide, because he gets to work with his son, Kenny Myers, every day. The only thing I found, Mr. Chairman, in my meetings with them is that, like with my sons, I occasionally observe that the son knew more than the father. So my compliments to both of them. 
The bottom line of all this--and I assume this was one of the intentions of the Senator from North Carolina, the chairman--is that regardless of the final outcome of each of these remaining amendments and the treaty, this has been done fairly and honorably. Everyone has kept their word. We said we would negotiate in good faith; we both did. All of the staff members involved acted in the same way. 
Lastly--and I hope this doesn't come out the wrong way--I want to thank the chairman of the full committee for the honorable way in which he has dealt with this entire matter. I mean that sincerely. 
I yield the floor.

It is my understanding that the Senator from Delaware has the option to move to strike three more conditions--one relating to intelligence verification, one relating to inspectors, and one relating to articles X and XI.

This amendment strikes a condition in the treaty that sets a verification standard that, if it were in the treaty, would not be able to be met; therefore, it would kill the treaty. I will not speak more at this time. 
I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let's get this straight. Verification is about whether or not we can know whether or not our security interests are going to be put in jeopardy. A useful chemical weapons capacity requires a lot more than just whether or not you can produce illicit chemical weapons. It requires a delivery system, infrastructure, storage, and use of chemical weapons. It includes defense preparations, extra security around the storage areas, and training and exercising of troops who will use those weapons. It goes on and on. 
The ability to put together a chemical weapons capability to go undetected that will diminish our security is not real. 
I yield back the time and ask unanimous consent that we defer a vote on this amendment at this moment, that we turn to my next motion to strike, which will relate to inspectors, condition 31, that there be 10 minutes equally divided on condition 31, that vote on condition 33 and on condition 31 be stacked after the conclusion of the debate on condition 31, with 15 minutes on the first vote, 10 minutes on the second vote, and with 1 minute intervening.

<TEXT>
Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me also say for the benefit of my colleagues that we are trying to accommodate schedules. I thank the Senators from Arizona and Georgia, who were running around trying to get their agreement. At the completion of the two rollcall votes--we are trying to get additional time on one amendment relating to articles X and XI, and we have an hour set aside for it now and we hope to reduce that time. At the conclusion of that vote we would then go to final passage, although there probably may be a few minutes intervening because each has some time left. That is the objective. Some are trying to catch planes and trains and the like. 
Mr. President, let me suggest quickly what this does. The amendment that I sent to the desk strikes a condition which unilaterally says at the front end we will not allow any inspector from such states as China, Iran, and Iraq, et cetera, if they are signatories to the treaty. If they have deposited their instruments of ratification, now they are in the deal. We are saying, if they are in, we will not allow any inspector from their countries to be any part of a team that would inspect U.S. facilities. 
The intention is obvious, and it is laudable. The intention is to keep the bad-guy inspectors out because we are worried that what they would do is send over an intelligence officer as part of that inspection team, learn all secrets from us and take them back home. It is not likely that can happen anyway. But let's assume it did. 
The intelligence community says this is a very bad idea. The reason it is a bad idea if we do that, Mr. President, is every other country will issue a blanket rejection of any U.S. inspectors. We are the class of the field. You have heard all day--and in the closed session--my colleagues expressing their concern about verification. The more we have American inspectors involved, the more likely we are to be able to detect wrongdoing because we are the class of the field. We don't want to be excluded across the board from being on any inspection team. So, therefore, this is intended to do something good but is extremely counterproductive. It is counterproductive, and the intelligence community says so as well. 
But beyond that, it is unnecessary. There is a provision. In the interest of time--we were going to have an hour of debate; I was going to put all of this out to you--but in this treaty there is a provision now that says the United States, or any other country, can at any time strike an inspector. The way this works, as most of our colleagues know, is when there is going to be a challenge inspection, or a routine inspection, there is a list of inspectors. They give the names. As few as 3 and as many as 15 inspectors are going to show up on the doorsteps of X, Y, Z company, and they list their names and their country. Guess what? Our intelligence community from the time those names are given--it is like a jury pool. The Presiding Officer was a Federal prosecutor. It is like a grand jury. Every country submits inspectors that they want participating. Their committee picks inspectors from each of the countries. They sit in one town and one city. When an inspection comes up, they say `You, you, you, and you, go and inspect.' They have to submit those names. Our intelligence community, when that pool is picked, will do a background check on every one of those guys and women. They know their names. So they can, in fact, go out there and say--we can say, or the intelligence community can say--`Look, he is on that inspection group. Strike him. We don't want him.' You can do that. The only time we can't strike is when--I have a smart staff here. In the late hours they think they are humorous. 
You are fired. 
[Laughter.] 
I am only kidding. That is a joke; a little levity at this time. 
As my distinguished friend on the Intelligence Committee, formerly of my staff, wrote, `They can't strike when they are on the plane.' You have to give 24 hours notice you don't want So and So in there. 
So the point is you can already strike anybody. We do this in a blanket way. We knock the class of the field out of the inspection process. We don't want to do that. With all due respect, this is not a thoughtful amendment. This is counterproductive. 
I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, two very quick points. The companies named by my distinguished friend, including Hercules, which is headquartered in my State, that are supposedly worried, they support this treaty. Hercules supports this treaty. They are not worried about this being trouble. 
Second, this is not a killer, but it rips the heart out of our inspection regime, and I would not be objecting, I say to the majority leader, I would not be seeking to take it out if it gave the President the option. It gives the President no option. It requires him--it requires him--to ban. And what it does again, I say to my colleagues, it then says they will ban us. We have the class of the field doing the inspection. It is not a smart thing to do, in my humble opinion. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the purpose of my amendment is to strike a provision in the bill that requires the President to disallow an inspector from any of a number of countries, from Russia to Iran. 
There is in the treaty already the ability of the United States to strike any inspector. The inspectors must be named before an inspection takes place. The reason why we do not want a blanket exemption is, if we blanket exempt all those folks, they will blanket exempt any U.S. inspector. 
We want inspectors in the bad guy's country. We do not want to do this. It is counterproductive.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes and I ask to be informed at the end of those 5 minutes. I am not 
going to take the time to speak to why this is a killer amendment and why this is so important, because I could not improve upon what the Senator from Indiana said. I mean that sincerely. 
It is real basic. This gets down to real basic considerations. Anybody who has the capacity to transfer technology can do that right now. They can do it right now. If they are in the treaty, the treaty does not require them to transfer that technology, but they, theoretically, could transfer technology. If we are not in the treaty we are not there to modulate their attitudes, their activities. We are out of the game. 
This seems to me to be so simplistic and basic. But let me put on the hat I have been wearing for the past 5 years. I have been teaching constitutional law at Widner University on Saturday mornings, a three-credit course. You know the old joke is, if you want to learn a subject, teach it. If I had spent nearly as much time studying it when I was in law school, as much time as I have spent teaching it, I would have ended up in the top of the class, not the bottom. I don't think I would have the record the Senator from Indiana had, but it would be better.

<TEXT>
Mr. BIDEN. I yield myself 2 additional minutes under the bill. 
Mr. President, what are we talking about here? Do you know what this debate on article X and article XI reminds me of, speaking of law school? The only thing I ever did do well in law school was moot court. I won that. Does that surprise you all? But I did. 
It reminds me of what we used to do--maybe when my friend from Indiana was at Oxford. You would walk in and you would be presented a question. The question before the court or the question before the House is--and you got assigned a side and you came up with the best arguments. 
This reminds me of that, as if we all got together earlier today and said, OK, one side has to argue that article X and article XI do all these terrible things. I am glad I did not get that side to argue. The reason is, it is much harder to make the case. My friend from Arizona, who is an able trial lawyer, is doing a very good job. But, look, you cannot avoid the central purpose of the treaty and that is: Never, under any circumstances, can any party assist, encourage, induce in any way anyone to engage in any prohibited activity. 
I yield myself 2 more minutes on the bill. 
So we are in a position here where I really understand the worry. But, even if there was any merit to the reading that is given by my friends, we have, in the conditions that we did support, we have two conditions which cover this--double cover it. We promise we are not going to transfer anything that is not medical in nature. 
Mr. President, a party cannot do something in the treaty by transferring material which would have the effect these Senators are worried about, because if it had the effect they were worrying about, then it would be assisting, encouraging, inducing or in some way engaging in activity prohibited by the treaty. Chemical weapons are prohibited by the treaty. 
To reiterate, Mr. President, this is a killer, pure and simple. This will prevent the United States from joining the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
The condition requires the President to certify that he has achieved the impossible: that he has been able to substantially rewrite the treaty. 
There is no chance--none--that he can achieve this by April 29, and it is highly unlikely that he can ever do so--because amendments may be blocked by any State party to the convention. If a party wants to keep us out--and thus render the treaty ineffective--it can easily do so. 
Aside from the practical difficulties of rewriting a treaty that took nearly a decade to negotiate, there is no need to do so. 
Let me start with article 10. The Senator from North Carolina wants to get rid of it completely. 
Article 10 contains two paragraphs at issue. Paragraph three provides that: 
[E]ach State Party undertakes to facilitate, and shall have the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, material and scientific and technological information concerning means of protection against chemical weapons. 
Note that this paragraph contains ambiguous terms like `facilitate' and `possible.' There's a reason for that--the negotiators did not want us to make a concrete commitment. 
And the Administration has made clear that it interprets this paragraph to mean that it will have the flexibility to decide what exchanges, if any, will occur under this paragraph. 
On April 15, Sandy Berger wrote to me to say that: 
. . . any exchange which does occur is limited to that which we determine would be appropriate and permitted under the Convention and consistent with our national export controls on these heavily regulated items. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-biden-de-62-19970424</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. BIDEN. Moreover, as with any treaty, this paragraph must be read in light of the object and purpose of the convention. The purpose of the treaty, quite obviously, is to ban chemical weapons. 
And any nation which provides technology to a country of concern would find itself in violation of the overriding obligation of Article One of the treaty, which requires states `never under any circumstance * * * to assist, encourage, or induce, in any way, anyone to engage in any activity prohibited to a state party under this Convention.' 
This is an overriding obligation. It governs everything you do under the treaty. 
Ronald Lehman, the head of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency during the Reagan Administration, stated during a recent Foreign Relations Committee hearing that: 
We made it very clear throughout the negotiations that all of this was subject to [A]rticle I, which is the fundamental obligation [under the Convention] not to assist. So we reiterated that again and again and again. But the most important, I think, telling factoid in support of the U.S. interpretation is the fact that after the Convention was done so many of the usual list of suspects were so unhappy that they did not get what they wanted in these provisions. 
On this point, I would also like to refer to a letter submitted to me by a group of eminent legal scholars, including Abe Chayes of Harvard Law School, former State Department legal adviser, and Elliot Richardson, former Secretary of Defense and former Attorney General. 
They write that the language in paragraph three which discusses that each State Party has the right to `participate in exchanges of equipment' is axiomatic--that is, it `merely reaffirms current trade policies that allow nations to exchange goods and services. Each State Party retains the right to participate in this trade at the level of its own choosing, including not to trade at all. There is no affirmative duty to trade * * *.'

<DOCNO>105-biden-de-63-19970424</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. BIDEN. More to the point, even if we were obligated--which we're not, we maintain export controls on chemical defense equipment. In other words, we do not allow it to be sold to the rogue states. 
The only specific obligation contained in Article Ten is in paragraph seven, which is where you provide assistance to nations facing attack by chemical weapons. 
This provision also has much flexibility--it allows a nation to choose one of three methods for providing assistance. 
But to ensure that this paragraph does not become a loophole, we have added a binding condition, condition number fifteen, which limits the type of assistance we will provide--at least when it comes to countries ineligible for economic or military assistance, which includes the rogue states--to medical antidotes and treatment. 
Let me now turn to Article Eleven. The proponents of this condition contend that this article requires us to weaken our export controls under the CWC. 
There is nothing in the CWC that requires us to weaken our export controls. But just to ensure that there isn't any doubt, we have agreed to a binding condition that addresses the problem. 
Condition seven requires the President to certify that nothing in the Convention requires us to weaken our export controls, and that the Australia Group--an informal group of potential supplier states to which the United States belongs--will continue to maintain controls over chemical weapons precursors that are equal to, or exceed, those in effect today. 
the Australia Group has already indicated, as a group, that it would maintain its export controls. On October 17, 1996--a little more recently than the statement read by the Senator from Arizona--the Australia Group stated that the `maintenance of effective export controls will remain an essential practical means of fulfilling obligations under the CWC.' 
But just to be sure, I asked the administration to ask each country--individually--whether it intended to maintain existing levels of controls. The answers have come back--all in the affirmative--as the president stated today in his letter to the majority leader. 
Finally, the President committed today, in the event that either Article Ten or Article Eleven to legitimate trade in a manner that endangers our security, the President will consult promptly with Congress on whether we should withdraw from the Convention. 
This is an extraordinary commitment. So I hope it resolves everyone's concern. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time on the bill. I think I have used up all the time on the amendment.

In this context, the maintenance of effective export controls will remain an essential practical means of fulfilling obligations under the CWC and the BTWC. 
Translated into ordinary English, it means that we adhere to the commitment we made in the Australia Group with export controls. We believe it is consistent with the CWC and required by the CWC.

Mr. BIDEN. I yield myself such time as I may consume under the 7 minutes. I do not plan on using it all. 
Mr. President, it has been a long road to this spot, this point. We have had not only extensive debate in the last 2 days, we have had an extensive debate on this floor, in committees, in the press, among foreign policy experts, think-tank types, for the past 3 years. We reached the point where we are constitutionally required to fulfill a duty of either giving our consent to ratification or withholding it. As both leaders have pointed out, it is maybe the most significant responsibility delegated to the U.S. Senate 
I realize that we sometimes stand on this floor, particularly when any one of us and all of us have invested a significant amount of time in one issue or another where we feel that we have spent most of our waking hours for the past month, two, or three--everyone has experienced that on this floor--and we tend to think that since we put so much time into the passage of a piece of legislation, or in this case, a treaty, that maybe it is the most important thing that the Senate has done or could do because I guess we say to ourselves we would not invest that much of our time, our energy, our mind, our soul, into the effort if it was not so important. 
Acknowledging that we all err on that side of thinking what we do is sometimes more important than what it is, I respectfully suggest that the vote each of us is about to cast on this treaty is likely to be the most significant vote any of us cast in this Congress. 
Twice today I have been referred to as the senior Senator from Delaware. I want the record to show, I know I am the junior Senator. I am the second most senior junior Senator in the United States. I have been here 25 years, but that young man in the back there is the most senior junior Senator, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, because the most senior Senator of senior Senators is his colleague, Senator Thurmond. 
Mr. President, I am not sure that there is any vote that I have cast in the last 4 or 5 years that I think is as significant for the future of the United States as this treaty. 
And as I said, and I will conclude with this, not merely because of what the treaty attempts to do--and that is, for the first time in the history of modern man, ban even the possession of an entire category of weaponry--but that is not the reason why this is the most important vote. We are at a juncture in our history, Mr. President, in my opinion, where the United States has an opportunity, which rarely comes to any nation in its history--it has come to us, in my opinion, on two occasions--where our actions and our leadership can literally, not figuratively--and it is not hyperbole--can literally shape, at least on the margins, the future of the world. 
After World War II, we stepped up to the plate. My father's generation and my grandfather's generation and grandmother's and my mother's generation stepped up to the plate. They did things, when we look back on them, that must have taken incredible courage. Can you imagine having over 10 million men still under arms and standing up as a Senator, or as a President, or as a Secretary of State, and saying, by the way, I want us now to send billions of dollars to those people who killed our sons and daughters? That was the Marshall Plan. Can you imagine the foresight it took and how difficult it must have been to cast a vote to set up an outfit called NATO, of which Germany, our sworn enemy that killed our sons and daughters, were members? Those people had courage. But they did what the Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, said: They led. 
This is about leadership. This is about the role of the United States in leading the world. If we refrain from exercising that opportunity--and we will if we do not vote for this treaty--we will have passed up an opportunity that, as I said, rarely comes to any nation in the history of the world. We can affect, if we are wise, the behavior, activity and actions for a generation to come, not for what is contained in this treaty, but because of the leadership that was demonstrated in drafting this treaty, in ratifying this treaty and enforcing this treaty. 
So, Mr. President, I realize that all of us--myself included--tend to engage in hyperbole and rhetoric that doesn't mean the substance of what we are talking about. But I honestly believe this is one of the most important votes, in terms of the future of this country and its ability to lead at a moment in history that seldom comes to any nation, that may be the most important vote that any of us will cast. If we embark on this path of continuing to engage the world and lead the world, we maintain the reasonable prospect that we can make the world--the world--a better place in which to live. 
I yield the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. I would like to thank the Vice President for being at the ready the whole day, and I would like to thank my colleagues for not making it necessary. I am glad they deprived the Vice President of the United States the opportunity to vote on the five conditions and on final passage. But I want to point out to my colleagues who are being very nice and solicitous about my efforts in this regard, the Vice President of the United States, who is in the Chair, played a critical role in pushing this, making sure that we kept it before the Nation, generating the interesting debate so this could not be left untouched, and I want to publicly thank him. 
There is that old expression in politics that politics makes strange bedfellows. I have had the distinction and the honor of having been the ranking member and/or chairman with the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond, and when I got that assignment I think most of my colleagues looked at me and said, this is going to be an interesting time, Biden and Thurmond. We turned out to be very good friends. This is the first occasion after 25 years that I have had to work as closely as I have with my new chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, on which I rank, and that is Senator Helms. I want to publicly thank him. He kept his word at every stage of this long, arduous, and for me ultimately rewarding negotiation. I want to acknowledge how much I appreciate it. 
I conclude by saying, because I do not want to turn this into some litany of people to thank, what a pleasure it has been to work with and receive the guidance and encouragement from the Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar]. He has served this Nation well on this occasion, as well as Senator McCain. I hope I am not hurting their credentials in the Republican party by acknowledging how closely I worked with both of them. However, I think it should be noted that without the two of them weighing in on this treaty I not only doubt, I know we would not have passed this. 
I conclude by saying I truly think this is a very important moment in the Senate, and I do think the vote we just cast will be within the next hour heard around the world. Had we voted the other way, it would have been a louder, more resounding sound than the one now. It will be heard around the world, and it will reaffirm American leadership. 
I thank the Vice President for being here again and I am also thankful we did not have to have his vote, but I knew where it was if we had needed it. 
I yield the floor.

I, like he, on five occasions --four here and one in a hospital--raised my right hand and swore to uphold the Constitution. We have both done that, to the best of my knowledge, for the past 24 years. 
Let me just say that just as beauty is in the eye of the beholder, security and upholding the oath of office, how to protect and defend the United States of America, is in the eye of the Senator. I do not doubt for one single second that my friend from North Carolina believes what he says, that he does not believe this treaty is in the interest of the United States of America and, by inference, he would not be upholding or defending the Constitution 
of the United States were he to vote for it, other than with the killer amendments attached to it that would effectively end the treaty. 
I think it is important for the listeners to put in perspective a little focus here as to how much verification is necessary to defend our interest and how much is enough and what tradeoffs constitute our interests. 
Let me just say that my friend and I have worked together for years and years. As I said, we came here together, 1972. We got elected in the same year. To the best of my knowledge, my friend has not voted on the floor for an arms control agreement, ever. 
Although the Senate overwhelmingly passed the START Treaty negotiated by Ronald Reagan--`trust but verify' Reagan--my friend from North Carolina voted against it because he did not think it was verifiable. Ronald Reagan thought it was verifiable. Ronald Reagan, who said `trust but verify,' he negotiated the treaty. He sent it to the U.S. Senate. We voted for it. Senator Helms did not. 
I do not say this as a criticism but an observation. Because if you listen to Senator Helms, it makes it sound as though he is just like Ronald Reagan. Well, he is not like Ronald Reagan. Bush finally concluded the START I agreement, but it was Reagan who had negotiated it. Reagan supported the START I agreement. President Reagan, I understand, supported the START II agreement. Senator Helms voted against both of them because he did not believe they were--and I believe he meant it--he did not believe they were in the security interests of the United States of America. 
So again the reason I mention it is that you will hear a lot of appeals to authority today. You will hear a number of ad hominem arguments and a number of infallible arguments invoked on the floor of the Senate today by all of us. It is a debating technique. But I think one of my objectives today is going to try to be sort of the truth squad here, to make sure we are comparing apples and apples and oranges and oranges and we remember who did what. 
So before the day is over, someone probably will invoke the name of George McGovern, somehow. I do not know how George McGovern will get into this, but I promise you that will happen as evidence that these arms control treaties are bad things that just soft-headed liberals do. Ronald Reagan is no soft-headed liberal. 
My friend from North Carolina is a staunch conservative, but he parted company with other staunch conservatives who thought START I, START II and the INF agreements were all bad treaties. We negotiated the INF agreement when Senator Helms and I were here. Ronald Reagan proposed that. I do not know how he voted on that. But I would not be surprised if he voted against that. And `trust but verify' Reagan not only negotiated it, but submitted it. 
Mr. President, the debate we are commencing today is not only about a global treaty--it is important, it is global, and it addresses the chemical weapons threat. Quite frankly--and my distinguished friend from Indiana, Senator Lugar, will speak to this at length because he is so articulate when he does--it is about nothing less than America's leadership in the post-cold-war era. I mean, it really is that simple. 
It is above and beyond the issue of merely the chemical weapons treaty, which I will speak to in detail, and why this treaty is such a good treaty. But it is well beyond that. It is well beyond that. 
Over the course of two decades and three administrations, the United States of America has led--has led--the world in developing a comprehensive treaty designed to outlaw chemical weapons. Now, less than a week before this treaty goes into effect, with or without the United States of America, the world watches to see what the world's greatest deliberative body is going to do. I mean, it sounds a bit melodramatic, but it is literally that serious. It is that fundamental. 
This treaty is going into effect no matter what happens, because the way the treaty is, if over 65 nations signed on to it, 
it automatically goes into effect 6 months later. So whether we vote for it or not, a total of 74 nations of the world have now said, `This is a good treaty. We sign on to it. We commit to it.' So it is going into effect. 
What is it going to look like, as the world watches us--and, believe it or not, they watch us; the American public may not watch us a lot here in the Senate but the rest of the world is watching--when the possessor of the one of the two largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world, who unilaterally agreed to destroy those weapons--us--when we do not ratify a treaty that 74 nations have already ratified? 
But there are the anti-arms controllers who believe there has never been an arms control agreement that is worth having. I respectfully suggest that the Senator from North Carolina is among them. 
He stood up on the floor when we were debating this before it came on the floor, and he said, quoting someone, that America `has never lost a war, nor has it ever won a treaty.' 
Remember, that is what this is about. This dividing line is between people who believe that there is no way in the world you can multilaterally sign on to anything because you cannot trust anybody; the only thing we can trust is ourselves. Therefore, whatever we do, do it unilaterally. Senator Helms has never voted for an arms control treaty on the floor of the U.S. Senate, including the ones negotiated by Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush. We have all been here for all those Presidents. 
I am not being critical. I just want to make you understand the dividing line here. This is not about the little pieces. This is about whether or not you think we can have any kind of multilateral agreements relative to controlling any kind of arms. 
Our friend from Arizona, the distinguished Senator, Senator Kyl, introduced a unilateral effort to stem chemical weapons. It was great, but it does not affect any other nations. No one else signed on to it. That is sort of the mantra you get from our friends who oppose arms control--we can do it ourselves. But how can we control the rest of the world unless they are part of an agreement that we are part of? 
The real issue is, will we remain in the forefront of the battle to contain weapons of mass destruction, the preeminent security threat of this era, or will we retreat from the challenge and be lulled into believing we can combat this scourge of chemical weapons on our own? I know what the answer to that is. The answer is: We cannot do it on our own. I hope the Senate will answer in the affirmative that we have to do this globally. 
But before we face that moment of decision sometime tomorrow evening, we are going to spend 2 days in debate here, and we are going to vote when I move to strike five specific conditions on the Helms proposal that is before us. 
As we commence this debate, I think it is instructive to briefly trace the history of the problem of poison gas and the efforts of the world community to address the threat. 
Today is April 23. And 82 years ago, almost, today, 82 years ago yesterday, April 22, at 5 o'clock in the evening, a green cloud boiled up out of the east near the town of Ypres in Flanders. 
The modern use of chemical weapons had begun. On that day, the use of chlorine gas achieved a significant tactical advantage for the German attackers in World War I. But within 8 days, gas masks were made available to the allies and, thereafter, in World War I, the use of poison gas as a method of warfare was not especially effective as compared to the primary weapons of artillery and machine guns. But `terrible beauty had been born,' to paraphrase Yeats--poison gas had been used. 
As a weapon of terror, poison gas continued to be exceedingly effective in World War I and had an appalling effect on its victims along the front lines. Soldiers in trenches knew all too well the terror and horror of gas. Wilfred Owen, who was killed in action in 1918 described the terror in his poem, `Dulce et Decorum Est.' I would like to read from that poem.  
Gas! Gas! Quick, boys!--An ecstasy of fumbling, 
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time, 
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling, 
And floundering like a man in fire or lime. 
Dim through the misty panes and thick green light, 
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning. 
In all my dreams, before my helpless sight. 
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. 
If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace 
Behind the wagon that we flung him in, 
And watch the white eyes writing in his face, 
His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin; 
If you could hear, at every jolt the blood 
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, 
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud 
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, 
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest. 
To children ardent for some desperate glory, 
The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est, 
Pro patria mori. 
Translated, it means: It is sweet and fitting to die for the fatherland. 
The international revulsion against the use of poison gas in World War I led the United States, once again, to press for an international agreement banning the practice. The result, in 1925, was the Geneva Protocol, which prohibits the use in war of poison gas and bacteriological weapons. For much of this century, with a few exceptions, this norm was honored. During the Second World War, where restraints were hardly the rule, no party saw fit to violate the norm. Even Adolf Hitler obeyed it, although presumably not out of any sense of honor, but out of fear of allied retaliation. Hitler's restraint on the battlefield, unfortunately, did not carry forward to the concentration camps where he used gas to slaughter defenseless innocents, millions of them. 
The norm contained in the Geneva Protocol eroded considerably in the 1980's, when both parties in the Iran-Iraq War employed gas during a war of attrition that ended in stalemate. The use of chemical weapons in that war provided no significant breakthroughs on the battlefield, but it did give Saddam Hussein an idea, and that idea was to use poison gas against defenseless civilians in Iraqi Kurdistan following a cease-fire in the war with Iran. 
In August 1988, Saddam launched his final offensive against dozens of villages, killing hundreds and causing tens of thousands to flee to neighboring countries. A staff report prepared for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by our present Ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith, was based on interviews with survivors. He described the atrocities in vivid detail in that report: `The bombs'--meaning the chemical bombs--`did not produce a large explosion, only a weak sound that could be heard, and then a yellowish cloud spread from the center of the explosion. Those who were very close to the bombs died almost instantly. Those who did not die instantly found it difficult to breathe and began to vomit. The gas stung the eyes, skin, and lungs of the villagers exposed to it. Many suffered temporary blindness. After the bombs exploded, many villagers ran and submerged themselves in nearby streams to escape the spreading gas. Many of those that made it to the streams survived. Those who could not run from the growing smell--mostly the very old and the very young--died. The survivors, who saw the dead reported that blood could be seen trickling out of the mouths of some of the bodies, a yellowish fluid could also be seen oozing out of the noses and mouths of some of the dead. Some said the bodies appeared frozen. Many of the dead bodies turned blackish blue.' 
Saddam's outrageous act, unfortunately, prompted only muted response from the world community. One of the few sounds of protest came from this body, where Senator Claiborne Pell, now retired, and the chairman of the committee, Senator Helms, promptly introduced legislation to impose sanctions against Iraq. The bill sailed through the Senate on a voice vote the day after it was introduced. Unfortunately, the Reagan administration, at that time still operating under the delusion that it could deal with Saddam, denounced the chairman's bill as premature and later succeeded in blocking its enactment in the final days of the 100th Congress--a fact we tend to forget. 
Saddam's atrocities, although not a violation of the Geneva Protocol--you know, it wasn't a violation of the Geneva Protocol. That Geneva Protocol only banned the use of chemical weapons in war. This was not a war. So the irony of all ironies is that the first guy to use poison gas since the Italians in Ethiopia in the 1930's, didn't even violate the Geneva Protocol. It was used in the Iran-Iraq War, which was a violation because that was international war. 
The Geneva Protocol bans the use of chemical weapons in warfare, and the extensive use of gas in the Iran-Iraq War was banned but still occurred. Ironically, it had a positive effect,

Mr. BIDEN. I will just take a few more minutes and reserve the remainder of my time. But let me answer the question. As the Senator from Arizona stood up to tell me that, my staff just handed me the news release. I was not aware until he just told me, but it does not surprise me and it pleases me a great deal. You and I worked with Senator Dole for a long time, I for 24 years, and have great respect for him. I was absolutely convinced that the conditions that we agreed on would take care of every conceivable problem he had with the treaty. I think it does for everyone, frankly. 
I know my friend from Arizona was very concerned about several provisions of this treaty. He has been deeply involved in the negotiations relating to this, and I think we have taken care of every condition that can possibly be dealt with, without killing the treaty. 
The remaining five conditions are conditions that cannot be met and will kill the treaty. So the reason we could not agree to the last five is they are what we call, in the parlance of the Senate, `killer amendments,' or `killer conditions.' 
But I am very pleased, as I say, not surprised. Because in all the years I have worked with Senator Dole I have had the greatest respect for him and I have no doubt that he has thought about this long and hard. I am glad to see he has spoken out, now, which is very important. 
As I said, 
as provided for in the unanimous-consent agreement reached last week, we will consider two sets of conditions. The first is a group of 28 conditions, upon which all parties to the negotiations agree. The second is a set of five conditions that remain in disagreement among the parties; these five will be the subject of a separate debate and vote tomorrow. 
The 28 agreed conditions are the product of hours of negotiation that occurred in two complimentary phases. The first involved discussions between the administration and a task force of Republican Senators established by the majority leader. The second involved extensive negotiations between the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and me. 
At this point, I would like to express my personal appreciation to the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and his able staff, for engaging in hours of discussions with me and my staff. Throughout the past few months, we held over 40 hours of meetings. Although we did not always agree--obviously, we would have been here on the floor a lot sooner if we had--the discussions were carried out in good faith, and the Senator from North Carolina was always a gentleman. 
I would also like to pause here to express my appreciation to the majority and minority leaders, who spent many hours on this over the past few months, and to the President, the National Security Adviser and his dedicated team, and the Secretary of State, for all their efforts in trying to forge common ground and narrow the issues. 
And we have narrowed the issues considerably. The negotiations succeeded in addressing many key issues of concern. Let me elaborate briefly on these conditions. 
Among the 28 agreed conditions are the following: 
A condition [No. 28] ensuring that fourth amendment rights will be protected by requiring search warrants in cases where consent to search a facility is not granted. 
A condition [No. 26] providing for the continued use of riot control agents by U.S. troops to save lives when rescuing pilots or when attacked by both combatants and civilians. 
Several conditions which augment existing protections for industry, including: No. 9, which requires an annual certification that the CWC is not significantly harming legitimate commercial activities; condition No. 16, which adds teeth to the convention's provision on protecting confidential business information by withholding U.S. contributions to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons--the body that will implement the treaty--if an employee discloses information that results in financial loss to a U.S. firm; the money will be withheld until the immunity of that employee is waived; and condition No. 18, which prohibits samples collected from U.S. firms from being taken to foreign laboratories, thus reducing the risk of the loss of proprietary information to foreign espionage. 
Conditions No. 2, 3, and 4, which hold down U.S. costs under the convention and require establishment of an inspector general for the body that will implement it. 
A condition [No. 5] which establishes strict standards for the sharing of U.S. intelligence information. 
And a condition [No. 14] which rejects any attempt by Russia to link its own ratification of the CWC to the receipt of U.S. assistance for chemical weapons destruction. 
Some treaty opponents have attempted to characterize these achievements as relatively minor. That is hardly the case. 
For example, throughout the debate on the convention, opponents have contended that it would violate the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. Though this was never the case, condition No. 28 makes it explicitly clear that search warrants will be required whenever consent is withheld for an inspection. 
Similarly, CWC opponents have frequently criticized the Clinton administration's decision to interpret the convention as requiring modifications to U.S. policy, codified in Executive Order 11850 of April 8, 1975, on the use of riot control agents by U.S. forces in certain situations. 
Condition No. 26 states, unequivocally, that Executive Order 11850 shall not be altered or eliminated. 
In short, many arguments about the treaty's perceived flaws are simply no longer valid in light of the agreed conditions contained in Senate Executive Resolution 75. 
Unfortunately, our success in addressing so many concerns has not been enough for some treaty opponents. They insist on voting on five extreme conditions, which, if adopted, will prevent the United States from ratifying the convention or will significantly undermine the convention. 
An opportunity to vote on these extreme conditions was coupled with a refusal to give the supporters of the treaty an opportunity to offer any substitutes. 
So we will be left with one course--to vote against the conditions offered by the opponents of this treaty. I regret that outcome--but that is the hand we have been dealt. 
During the next 2 days, we will debate these five conditions, and at an appropriate time, I will discuss them in detail. Let me now address a few of them briefly. 
First, the opponents of the convention will argue that we shouldn't join the convention until Russia, as well as several countries with offensive chemical weapons programs, do so, too. We will have 2 hours of debate on these issues tomorrow, but for now let me just say this: this approach holds American policy hostage to the decisions of other nations, which is not only bad policy, but it also undermines our claim to international leadership. 
Opponents will also say that even if the rogue states join, the treaty won't be worth much because they will cheat. To this charge, there is an easy answer, provided by our Secretary of State: to say that we shouldn't try to make chemical weapons illegal because there will be cheaters, is like saying that we shouldn't have laws because people will break them. 
Next, you will hear the argument that we must amend article XI of the treaty, or else it will lead to the end of export controls on dangerous chemicals. This argument is based not only on a flawed reading of the treaty text, but on a willful ignorance of commitments already made. 
The CWC is completely consistent with continued enforcement of existing controls enforced by the Australia Group, an informal alliance of supplier countries. 
Moreover, the 30 nations that comprise the Australia Group have specifically stated their intention--individually and collectively--to maintain export controls that are equal to, or exceed, those in place today. 
Finally, we have added a condition--condition No. 7--which makes clear our interpretation that we may maintain export controls, and which requires the President to certify annually that the Australia Group continues to control the trade in vital chemicals. 
Even after all of this debate--and all of the voting--I suspect that the opponents of this treaty will still not be satisfied, even if they succeed in attaching killer conditions. That is because, at bottom, they have a theological opposition to arms control. That is defensible position. I respect it. But I strongly disagree with it. 
In essence, opponents of arms control fear that a treaty like this will lull us into a false sense of security. This proposition, I concede, has considerable force. But I am not persuaded. 
There is, of course, always a risk that a nation will lower its guard in the face of a reduced threat. But today's debate is not the end of our efforts on the chemical weapons problem. To borrow a phrase from Winston Churchill, it is not even the beginning of the end; it is the end of the beginning. 
From this day forward, if we approve this convention, as I sincerely hope we will, both the Senate and the executive must remain ever vigilant against the threat of chemical weapons--and ensure that we have an effective convention. 
We have added several conditions to the resolution of ratification to advance this objective. We have made a commitment, in condition No. 11; that requires the Secretary of Defense to ensure that U.S. forces are capable of carrying out military missions regardless of any foreign threat or use of chemical weapons. We have required, in condition No. 10, an annual report on compliance issues. We have established, in condition No. 13, a mechanism for ensuring that the President promptly pursues potential violations that threaten our national security interests. 
Aside from these concrete conditions, however, our experience with other arms control agreements demonstrates that the political commitment remains, and that the dangers of complacency are greatly exaggerated. 
Nearly 30 years ago, we signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty amid predictions that dozens of states would have nuclear weapons within a decade. Today, we are more concerned than ever about the threat of nuclear proliferation, the Non-Proliferation Treaty has been extended permanently, and just a handful of states have the bomb. 
During the 1980's, we had constant debates about whether the Soviet Union was complying with its obligations under the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Not once did we let down our guard against the Soviet threat. 
The thesis that we will be lulled into a false sense of security applies not to the convention, but to the alternative: to doing nothing other than strengthening our domestic laws against chemical weapons--which was all the Senate achieved last week in passing S. 495. 
Revision of our domestic laws to criminalize possession and stockpiling of chemical weapons is necessary--with or without the treaty. But it is a delusion to believe that merely enacting domestic legislation will suffice to combat an international problem of this magnitude and gravity. Rather, it will take close cooperation by the civilized nations of the world to enforce the new international norm set forth in the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
Mr. President, as I stated at the outset, the world--and this is no exaggeration--is watching the U.S. Senate today and tomorrow. They are waiting for the answer to the question, will we, the United States, remain in the forefront of the battle to combat proliferation of weapons of mass destruction? We must answer that in the affirmative. Put it another way, does anybody believe that 74 nations would have signed onto this treaty if they believed the United States of America was not going to support them? We have led people down the primrose path, if in fact we do not sign onto this treaty. 
I see that my friend from Indiana, who probably knows more about the chemical weapons treaty than anyone in the U.S. Senate, or maybe anyone in the country, has risen. I will be happy, if he is seeking recognition, to yield as much time to him as he believes he needs.

Mr. BIDEN. That `four month' comment reminds me of a joke about the two guys who were cheering at the bar, clapping their hands. A guy walks into the bar and says, `What are they so happy about?' Another guy says, `Oh, they just put together a jigsaw puzzle, and they did it in 3 hours.' The guy walks up to them and says, `Congratulations, but why is that so special?' They showed him the box, which said `2 to 4 years.' At any rate, it will take a while for that to sink in. A little bit of levity in the chemical weapons treaty is worth the effort. 
The junior Senator from Arizona complimented me on the limited success that we have achieved here. I thank him for that. Now I am going to yield to a man of unlimited capacity to prove to everyone that there is no limit to the success we are about to achieve in this treaty. 
I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Arizona, my good friend, John McCain.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I found it fascinating, the statement of my friend from Idaho. He made a very compelling case, from his perspective, as why we cannot verify the treaty and therefore why we should be against the treaty--because we cannot verify it. We cannot verify it because, he says, we cannot inspect sufficiently well. And that is why he is against the treaty. Then he says one of the other reasons he is against the treaty is because the verification regime is so intrusive that it will allow the opposition--allow rogue states to get access to information in the chemical industry. 
So, if we correct one problem, which is to make it more verifiable, then he would argue he is against the treaty because it is verifiable. If you do not make it more verifiable, he said, he is against the treaty because it is not verifiable.

He also said the intelligence community says, `They have never found anything that is successfully hidden.' 
I do not know how many of you are golfers. That is like saying you cannot sink a putt if it is short. Obviously, a putt will not go in if it does not get to the hole. Obviously, you cannot uncover something that is successfully hidden. 
The last point I would make is the chemical industry, the outfit that represents the bulk of the chemical industry has strongly endorsed this treaty. I am just responding to the last point that the chemical industry is the target. The chemical industry, coincidentally, is for this treaty. 
But I would be happy, now, on Senator Helms' time, to yield back to my friend from Idaho.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I might take, and I am only going to take a few minutes. 
Mr. President, the reason I mention the Chemical Manufacturers Association is not that they should determine the foreign policy. My friend from Idaho is saying that the target of this kind of espionage, or stealing secrets, whatever, is going to be the chemical industry. All I am pointing out is, just as they should not determine the foreign policy, I respectfully suggest my friend from Idaho does not know anything about their secrets. The chemical industry knows about their secrets, and they believe that this treaty fully protects them in maintaining their secrets. That is the point I was making. 
You know that play and movie that is out, `Don't Cry for Me Argentina,' well, don't worry about the chemical companies, they think they can take care of themselves in terms of their secrets. 
One last point. The Senator raised, as others have raised, the 1 ton of weapons and 2 tons that could be amassed, et cetera. I want to point out what John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, and he is not quoted by the Senator from Idaho, but others. Everyone quotes John Shalikashvili as saying that 1 ton of chemical weapons is militarily significant and that we cannot effectively guarantee we could uncover 1 ton. Let me read what General Shalikashvili said: 
A militarily significant quantity of chemical weapons is situationally dependent. Thousands-- 
Thousands-- of tons of chemical agent would be required to significantly impact on a large scale engagement while a mere ton of agent could be effective as a weapon of terror. 
He went on to say: 
In certain limited circumstances-- 
I emphasize `in certain limited circumstances'-- even 1 ton of chemical agent may have a military impact, for example, if chemical weapons are used as a weapon of terror against an unprotected population in a regional conflict. 
He went on to say further: 
The United States should be resolute that the 1-ton limit set by the convention will be our guide. 
He did not mean, however, that 1 ton was an appropriate standard for what constitutes effective verifiability. Rather, General Shali meant that the 1-ton limit in the CWC on agent stocks for peaceful purposes--that is the context in which he talked about it--was appropriate and that any country's stock in excess of 1 ton would likely be for offensive military purposes. 
So what he is saying--the 1 ton that keeps being used--he is saying if you detect that there is more than a ton of chemical weapons out there, they are probably doing it not for peaceful purposes, they are probably doing it to gain some military advantage. But it would take a lot more than 1 ton to have a major effect on a battle, a major effect on our security. He said it would take thousands of tons. 
Other people may think in this body that 1 ton is militarily significant and if you can't effectively verify 1 ton then there is no verification in terms of our strategic interests. They may think that, but that is not what the Joint Chiefs think. The 1-ton reference was for the purpose of determining whether or not a country was trying to do more than use those chemicals for peaceful purposes. He says, if you have more than 1 ton, it is a pretty good sign that these are bad guys and they are trying to do something worse, but they are nowhere near being militarily significant in terms of U.S. security. 
I see my friend.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, just as my friend from Idaho knows a lot about mining and knows a lot about potatoes and knows a lot about apples, because they are big issues in his State, I assure you, being a Senator from Delaware, if there was any genuine opposition from the chemical industry for this treaty, since most of those companies are incorporated in my State and it makes up 56 percent of my State's economy, I assure you, I would hear about it. 
Now, there may be some companies that do not like it, but I want to tell you, to use the expression, there may be reasons why for this in the minds of my colleagues, but none of the big boys, none of the outfits that do this as a big business, none of the outfits with multibillion-dollar operations, none of them, that I am aware of, are opposed to this treaty. They strongly support it. 
I yield 7 minutes to my friend from Ohio.

Mr. BIDEN. In 30 seconds, I will yield 12 minutes to my friend from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. President, I am holding up in my hand here a declaration form for those firms that face reporting requirements for production of discrete organic chemicals, which applies to about 1,800 firms. It is three pages long. I will at a later time read into the Record what it asks for to show you how non-onerous it is. 
On one of the pages of instructions, on the bottom of the page, it says, 
You do not have to declare unscheduled discrete organic chemical plant sites that produce explosives exclusively, produce hydrocarbons exclusively, refine sulfur-containing crude oil, produce oligomers and polymers, whether or not containing PSF, and produce unscheduled discrete organic chemicals via a biological or bio-mediated process. 
This eliminates thousands of firms, hundreds of firms at least. And so this is not nearly as onerous as it was made out to be in my humble opinion. 
I now yield with the permission of my colleagues 12 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr Specter.

Mr. BIDEN. Further, Mr. President, before I yield the floor to my friend from Washington State, we are trying to work out a unanimous-consent agreement on the total 10 hours. I am not propounding such an agreement. But we are hoping we can work out an agreement, whereby in the closed session tomorrow, the so-called secret session that will take place tomorrow, which will be a 2-hour session, that that time not be counted against the 10 hours in the UC for debate on chemical weapons. 
Again, I will leave it in the able hands of my friend from Arizona to determine whether the Republican leader is amenable to that, but colleagues who may be listening hopefully were able to do that. The reason I stand up to say that, if they are not, each of us only have about 55 minutes left tomorrow in this process. So for the colleagues who wish to speak, I want them to understand that I am not going to have the time to give them if in fact this doesn't happen. This is by way of disclaimer this evening, so tomorrow morning my colleagues won't come in and say: Joe, you promised me time. 
I think we can work it out. 
Mr. President, we now yield a total of 7 minutes, 3 1/2 from each side, to the distinguished Senator from the State of Washington.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as we close the first day of debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention, I wanted to insert into the Record an explanation of the 28 conditions to the resolution of ratification that we adopted this afternoon, so we can create a legislative history. 
Mr. President, the Chemical Weapons Convention is a fine arms control agreement. It can stand on its own. 
But the U.S. Senate has a constitutional duty to consider carefully all the implications of treaties submitted for its advice and consent to ratification. Such careful consideration often enables us to spot aspects of an agreement that merit clarification, or implementation matters on which we would be well advised to require particular executive branch policies. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention is no exception to this rule. Over the years since its signing over 4 years ago, near the end of the Bush administration, we have identified several areas in which clarifying the convention's intent or establishing requirements regarding executive branch implementation would be useful. 
In addition, there were several areas in which some of my colleagues wanted assurances that went beyond those that the executive branch or I could give them, even though we thought that such reassurances ought to suffice. In many such cases, the easiest way of providing the needed assurances was to codify them in a condition to the resolution of ratification. 
The convention enters into force on April 29, with or without the United States. To be an original state party, therefore, the President must deposit the instrument of ratification by midnight on April 28. As a technical matter, the Senate's vote is not the final word, because the Senate does not `ratify' a treaty; it provides advice and consent to it. Once that occurs, the President then must formally ratify--an indication to our treaty partners that the United States is consenting to be legally bound to its terms--by signing an `instrument of ratification.' The President then directs the Secretary of State to deposit that instrument at a central location designated by the convention; then, once the convention enters into force, the United States is bound under international law to abide by its terms. 
The Senate's role in providing consent to a treaty is not that of a rubber stamp. The Senate may attach amendments or reservations to the treaty--essentially changing the terms of the original bargain between the United States and its treaty partners, or it may adopt conditions, which are, in effect, a binding contract between the Senate and the President which will govern how the treaty will be implemented or interpreted under U.S. law and practice. 
In the case of the Chemical Weapons Convention, no amendments to the convention's text have been, or will be, offered; the Senate has already moved beyond the stage in its consideration of treaties in which such amendments would be in order. Neither have any reservations been put forth--although article XXII of the convention purports to prevent a party from doing so. The Senate has gone on record several times, and does so again in condition 17, that the President's agreement to such a prohibition cannot constrain the Senate's constitutional right and obligation to give its advice and consent to a treaty subject to any reservation it might determine is required by the national interest. 
Instead, we have a set of 28 conditions which were agreed to by those involved in the negotiations to date, and which the Senate approved by voice vote earlier this afternoon. These conditions, as stated before, are binding upon the President. 
Several conditions will be debated tomorrow which are tantamount to killing the treaty. For example, any condition which requires a renegotiation of the treaty--as condition 32 does--is a killer, plain and simple, because there is no way that this treaty can be renegotiated. Additionally, any condition which requires the President to make impossible certifications before depositing the instrument of ratification will prevent the United States from formally entering the convention. 
As I described earlier, there have been several stages of negotiation to work out agreed conditions to the resolution and to narrow our areas of disagreement. The Senator from North Carolina and I engaged in many hours of negotiation as part of this process. 
The end result of our negotiations, of the negotiations between the White House and the task force established by the majority leader, and of discussions directly between the White House and the majority leader is a set of 28 agreed conditions to the resolution of ratification. I would like to summarize and comment upon those agreed conditions, so that my colleagues may understand what we have achieved. 
For I think that we have achieved quite a lot. I also think that Members should study the many agreed conditions that the Senator from North Carolina was able to propound. Frankly, virtually all of the concerns that have been raised regarding the CWC have been addressed in these agreed conditions, in a manner that should substantially ease those concerns. 
So I would like to summarize, Mr. President, what the Senator from North Carolina and I, along with other Members and the executive branch, have been able to achieve.

Mr. BIDEN. I have colleagues who have planes to catch, so I will try to be brief. 
Let me be very, very blunt, as the Chair knows I usually am, much to my detriment on occasion. This is not about anything, this vote. This vote is really designed to try to come up with a substitute for the chemical weapons treaty--to give people who want to say they voted against chemical weapons an ability, then, to vote against the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
I know we are supposed to be more diplomatic than that, and I know all that, and I am not suggesting that things in the bill are not worthwhile. They are. But this is what happens after we pass the treaty, that is, the implementing legislation. The way treaties work is, if we pass a treaty like the Chemical Weapons Convention, then we will come back here and pass implementing legislation. Just today, Senator Lugar and I have introduced legislation called the implementing legislation. That is, how do we domestically implement what we have just signed on to internationally. 
Now, this bill does some of those things. Some of the things in here, in this bill--and I have great respect for my friend from Arizona, I really do. I always kid him and say my problem with him is he is too bright. I always prefer people who I am usually in disagreement with philosophically that are not very bright. He is very bright. That is a problem. So he is more effective. But I hope he will not be offended. I think he would be willing to tell you not only does he believe in what is in here, he also hopes it has the political benefit of gathering enough votes to allow people the option to vote against the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
So, when I give this short shrift, I am not giving short shrift to the ideas, please understand. But the Record should note that this is not the norm; nobody that I am aware of, at least as long as I have been here, is usually willing to allow, without any hearings, a major bill to be brought up that is 64 pages long that most of us have not had a chance to read. 
I just want the Record to reflect why I am going to truncate this a great deal because this debate is not really about the substance here but about the treaty. I will tell you why we need a treaty and why this legislation, even if I knew all that was in it, and even if I agreed with all that was in it, would not get the job done. 
First, the treaty addresses two flaws in the Geneva Protocol which focused on a single wrong. It said we would ban the use of chemical weapons. The Chemical Weapons Treaty says you cannot produce chemical weapons, you cannot own chemical weapons, you cannot stockpile them. This legislation does nothing to affect any other country. Nothing we do in here in any way puts or imposes a prohibition on other countries other than as it relates to how we will deal with them on a bilateral basis. 
Second, we need a Chemical Weapons Convention because it will strengthen the ability of nations of the world to cooperate in placing strict global controls on trade and chemicals. We want to be able to trace the precursor chemicals that go from one country to another country, from one country or company to an individual, because that is the thing that will allow us to trace down and see whether the bad guys, whether they be terrorists and or countries 
at large, are doing bad things. That is, possessing, building, or designing chemical capability. This does nothing on that score. 
Third, we need a Chemical Weapons Convention because we have decided to get rid of most of our chemical stockpile, and that decision was jointly made by the Congress and the President in the 1980's. After the Gulf War, George Bush announced we would destroy the rest. 
The fourth reason is we need a treaty because it greatly enhances our ability to detect and deter a chemical weapons program. This will do nothing to affect anybody else's chemical weapons programs. 
In sum, the CWC will be a powerful instrument. This, at best, you could say, would be something along the line of implementing legislation, if we had that treaty passed, which I hope we will. 
I might add, I agreed to allow this bill to come up before the treaty, which is a very unusual way to do this because, quite frankly, I had no other way of getting the treaty up. Had I not agreed to this, my colleagues could have filibustered or prevented it from coming out of committee. Even though I have the votes in the committee for the treaty I could have prevented it from coming to the floor. This must be confusing to people listening to this debate today, 
because why would we vote on this before the international treaty? The answer is that we have no choice. The answer is they've got me by the procedural ears here. If we don't get a chance to vote on the CWC by the 28th, we are not in the deal and we, as a nation, are very much out of sync. 
I will conclude by suggesting that Senator Kyl's bill calls for a couple of things that already are in the treaty. The bill does nothing to eliminate other nations' chemical weapons. It requires us to go back and renegotiate the Chemical Weapons Convention, which, as General Brent Scowcroft, not a man known for hyperbole, said the concept of starting over was pure fantasy. 
Next, this bill does nothing to strengthen trade controls internationally. It has language about the Australia Group--an organization that is already in place and will stay in place. There is nothing extraordinary about that. The Australia Group exists and will continue to enforce trade controls. 
Third, the Kyl bill provides sanctions against nations that use chemical weapons. That's already in law. The bill does strengthen this in minor respects, but it weakens it in others. It doesn't make it illegal to produce or stockpile these weapons. 
Fourth, the Kyl bill does nothing to address trade sanctions that will apply against U.S. companies if the Chemical Weapons Convention enters into force with us. 
In sum, the Kyl bill is not a substitute for the Chemical Weapons Treaty, although there are things in the Kyl bill that I would vote for. 
As I told my friend--and I really do think he is my friend, and we have been completely straight with one another--I am going to vote against this and urge my colleagues to do the same, because I don't know enough to know what is in here. I will never forget that when I first got here, Senator Pastore of Rhode Island, an old fellow, was a very powerful Senator; I asked him about something and he said, `Boy, let me tell you something. If you don't know what's in it, it's always safer to vote no.' So I am voting no. Although there might be some merit to this, I can't find it. It is clearly not a substitute for the CWC. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I wish we were not here debating this legislation today--not because I don't think it is right; I do, and I am a cosponsor of the bill; but because I wish there was no need to take up a bill like this in the first place. 
Unfortunately, our hands have been forced, largely by the courts. 
In March of last year, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a Washington State law prohibiting physician-assisted suicide was unconstitutional under the constitutional right of privacy. 
Then, a month later, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a similar New York State law, arguing that the equal protection clause of the Constitution gives the terminally ill the same rights to hasten their own death through drugs as other patients have to refuse artificial life support. 
Although implementation has been delayed by the courts, in 1994, Oregon voters approved a referendum making physician-assisted suicide legal in that State. 
The Supreme Court has heard oral arguments on the matter--and it is expected to rule before the end of this term. 
Now, if physician-assisted suicide does become legal--through the courts or through State referendums or by some other means--there will be no doubt an attempt made to have the Federal Government pay for this. 
I can hear the arguments already. People will demand that Medicare or Medicaid reimburse physicians who help people commit suicide. Mr. President, this is not such a farfetched notion. 
After the voters approved the Oregon referendum in 1994, Oregon officials actually admitted they would seek Medicaid reimbursement if the law were to go into effect. 
Now, truth in advertising here, Mr. President. I am opposed to physician-assisted suicide becoming legal in this country, period. So I don't want to hide under some false cloak here. I am one of those who does not support abortion, but I acknowledge that my personal religious view should not be imposed upon the rest of the world because, for me, it is hard to determine and insist that my view on when there is a human life in being is more accurate than someone who is equally as religious as me, but might have a different view. But a suicide is a different story. There is no question that there is a human life in being. Physician-assisted suicide is the most dangerous slippery slope, in my view, that a nation can embark upon. 
So I make it clear that this has nothing to do with whether physician-assisted suicide should be allowed. I don't think it should be. But that is beside the point today. What is at issue is--if it becomes legal in one State, several States, or all States--is the Federal Government going to have to pay for it? 
To that, I hope we will emphatically say `no,' regardless of what each of us thinks about the legality or constitutionality of physician-assisted suicide. 
No matter where you are on the issue, under no circumstances should the Federal Government be paying physicians to help people kill themselves. 
Let me say what else this debate today is not about. It is not about refusing to accept medical treatment. The Supreme Court has already ruled that individuals have a right to refuse unwanted medical treatment. I am not sure how a physician or a hospital would bill Medicare or Medicaid for not providing a treatment that the patient did not want. But, regardless of that, this bill explicitly states that the funding prohibition does not apply in such circumstances and does not apply to drugs given to alleviate pain. 
What we are talking about is when physicians specifically give a patient a drug to kill them--when there is a proactive attempt to kill a patient. That is what we are talking about--no Federal dollars allowed. 
I commend Senator Ashcroft and Senator Dorgan for their work on this bill. This has been a bipartisan effort from the start--going back to when this bill was first put together last summer. 
Mr. President, it is important that we swiftly and definitively resolve this issue. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of former Congressman Pete Peterson for the Post of Ambassador to Vietnam. At this critical juncture in our relations with Vietnam and Southeast Asia there are many important United States interests that can be advanced only with the presence of an able Ambassador in Hanoi. 
The most important of these interests is the continued accounting for our POW/MIA's. A Vietnam veteran and former prisoner of war, Pete Peterson has both a professional and profoundly personal stake in ensuring the fullest possible accounting of his comrades-in-arms. As ambassador, he has pledged to make achieving that goal his highest priority. 
In addition to enhancing cooperation on the POW/MIA issue, Peterson will be charged more broadly with encouraging and facilitating Hanoi's entry as a peaceful, cooperative member of the community of nations. Vietnam has begun working with us in the important area of counternarcotics, and this cooperation should be expanded to curtail the flow of heroin and other deadly drugs from Southeast Asia to our shores. We have also begun a dialogue on human rights which must be buttressed by expanded cultural ties and educational opportunities. 
The advocacy of a strong United States Ambassador coupled with the collective efforts of the American people and numerous nongovernmental organizations can do much to foster greater Vietnamese respect for international norms in the areas of human rights, democracy, and religious freedom. 
Finally, approving the nomination of Congressman Peterson as Ambassador to Hanoi will greatly assist efforts already underway to advance United States economic interests in Vietnam and throughout Southeast Asia. Vietnam has made significant progress toward transforming its inefficient centrally planned economy to a market-based economy, and it is actively seeking foreign participation in its economic development. Vietnam's efforts to rebuild its infrastructure and modernize its economy present great opportunities for United States businesses in the areas of energy, telecommunications, health, education, tourism, and environmental protection. But for United States firms to compete successfully with the numerous foreign companies already doing business in Vietnam, the administration must negotiate and Congress must approve a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement. As Ambassador, Peterson will play a central role in expediting negotiations on an agreement which will safeguard U.S. commercial interests in the fastest growing region of the world. 
There are some who have speculated about the administration's motives for normalizing relations with Vietnam at this time, questioning whether officials from the Lippo Group or other United States businesses with prospective commercial interests in east Asia sought to influence the decision in exchange for their campaign contributions to the Democratic National Committee. 
As our colleague, Senator McCain--like Congressman Peterson a former POW--noted at Congressman Peterson's confirmation hearing, `This rumor is entirely unsubstantiated by fact.' President Bush and Secretary Baker put the United States firmly on the path toward normalization in 1989 when they drafted a `road map' whose goal was the establishment of full diplomatic relations. 
The pace of normalization has actually slowed during the Clinton administration. As Senator McCain stated during the Foreign Relations Committee hearing, the Clinton administration was worried about the political ramifications for the President in making a decision to normalize--with the veterans organizations and others--and was not possessed with concern about helping business interests, whether domestic or foreign. 
In short, we have reached the point of preparing to exchange ambassadors because of the bipartisan conviction that normalizing relations is in our best interests. It had nothing to do with foreign lobbyists or contributions to any Presidential campaign. 
Peterson traveled first to Vietnam 30 years ago as an Air force fighter pilot. He served his country nobly, receiving two Silver Stars, several Bronze Stars, and two Purple Hearts. he flew 66 combat missions over Vietnam before his aircraft was downed near Hanoi on September 10, 1966. He then endured almost 7 years of unimaginable hardship as a prisoner of war, before finally returning home in March 1973. 
Now he seeks to return to Vietnam, not as a warrior, but as an ambassador of peace, helping to heal old wounds and bring Vietnam into the world community after 30 years of isolation. It is a testament to Congressman Peterson's commitment to public service that he is willing to take on this difficult mission. I wish him God's speed.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the forthcoming reversion of Hong Kong to Chinese control is, as a matter of diplomacy, the mere implementation of a diplomatic agreement between the United Kingdom and the government of the People's Republic of China. 
But it is, of course, far more complicated, and its implications far more profound. The challenges ahead are many. Will Beijing abide by the rule of law and uphold its commitment to the United Kingdom and the people of Hong Kong to `one country, two systems?' Will America and the major powers have the political will to challenge China should they renege on their commitments? 
Nowhere are the challenges of reversion greater than for United States law enforcement--for Hong Kong has long been a center of the international criminal organizations which control the trade in Asian heroin, money laundering is on the rise, and there are a host of other law enforcement problems. 
Here in the United States, we see the related problems of Asian organized crime, or Tongs, heroin trafficking from Asia through Hong Kong, alien smuggling, arms trafficking, and the use of Hong Kong as a money laundering center for criminals. Unfortunately, the capacity of U.S. law enforcement to respond to this threat is limited by the fact that we simply do not have enough agents with the language skills, intelligence background and contacts to infiltrate Asian organized crime. 
This is why I am introducing today the Royal Hong Kong Police Anticrime Strategy Act of 1997. I am pleased to be joined in doing so by Senator Grassley, my colleague on the Senate International Caucus on Narcotics Control. 
This legislation seeks to take advantage of a potential opportunity--even in the face of all the challenges which will come with the reversion of Hong Kong. To describe in simplest terms the opportunity--as officers of the Royal Hong Kong Police leave their force, U.S. law enforcement agencies may be able to bolster our anti-drug, money laundering, alien smuggling and Asian organized 
crime capabilities with the unique knowledge of the former officers of the Royal Hong Kong Police. 
For example, it could be of significant value to federal law enforcement to simply retain on a one-time or continuing basis former Royal Hong Kong Police personnel to use them to help build a major Asian-Crime investigative database. Such a database could form the backbone of U.S. investigations in the years to come. I offer this simply as a means to illustrate to my Senate colleagues the potential law enforcement benefits of this legislation. Of course, the best uses must be decided by the law enforcement professionals within the Justice and Treasury Departments. 
I also point out that I have long worked on this issue--beginning with a hearing with the FBI on the issue of Asian organized crime way back in August, 1990. My January 1992 drug strategy also called on the Bush Administration to determine if these police officers could be of assistance. In fact, a DEA operation began in 1992 which used some retired Royal Hong Kong Police in a very limited capacity to provide translation services to support investigations of Asian heroin trafficking. 
I was also pleased to include a provision offered by Senator Roth in the 1994 Biden Crime Bill to study this issue--unfortunately, this provision was dropped from the final agreement due to opposition in the House. 
But, today, with the continuing rise of the heroin trade, I am reiterating my call for us to address this issue. The legislation I offer today calls on the Attorney General and the Treasury Secretary to report to Congress on the need and potential benefits--as well as any potential security or administrative problems--of adding former officers of the Royal Hong Kong Police to our federal law enforcement agencies. 
And, if the benefits exist, this legislation authorizes the addition of up to 200 former officers to assist in the investigation of international drug trafficking, alien smuggling, money laundering and organized crime undertaken by the Justice and Treasury Departments. 
Mr. President, preparing for the reversion of Hong Kong primarily means preparing for the challenges ahead--but it also requires us to recognize the opportunities ahead. Taking advantage of this opportunity is what the `Royal Hong Kong Police Anticrime Act of 1997' is all about.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join in introducing today with Senator Grassley and others the Drug-Free Communities Act of 1997. This legislation will help take an important step forward toward a goal we all share--keeping kids away from drugs and drugs away from kids. 
This 5 year, $140 million authorization to fund local antidrug prevention efforts could be an important catalyst to getting local groups together to plan, coordinate, and carry out the wide variety of drug prevention treatment activities we all know are necessary to reverse the rise of drug abuse among our children. By unleashing the talents and energy of local coalitions of local businesses, schools, law enforcement, religious organizations, doctors, and others we can build community-wide and community-based drug prevention efforts. 
For all these reasons, I am pleased to offer my support for the concept embodied in this legislation. But, I must offer two important conditions to my support for this bill. First, as potentially valuable as antidrug coalitions can be, I do not believe it would be wise for us to `rob Peter to pay Paul' by trying to fund this drug prevention effort by cutting funding for other, worthy drug prevention efforts. It is my understanding that the other sponsors of this legislation in both the House and the Senate share this view, and I look forward to working with them to find the modest dollars necessary to fund this effort. 
Second, it is also my understanding that the sponsors of this legislation are continuing to work with the Drug Director to iron out the bureaucratic details of how this effort will be undertaken at the Federal level. I am confident that none of the sponsors of this bill have any desire to establish any new layers of wasteful bureaucracy, so I look forward to working with them to pass the most efficient, effective effort possible. 
This bill offers a key example of the bipartisan support for drug prevention and drug treatment efforts which exists at the grassroots level throughout our Nation. In the weeks and months ahead, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the same bipartisan fashion. 
As my colleagues have heard me note on numerous occasions--our Nation stands on the edge of the `baby boomerang'--with 39 million American children under the age of 10, the greatest number since the 1960's. We must prepare for these 39 million as they enter their teen years when they will be at their greatest likelihood of falling prey to drugs and crime. If we do not, we will pay for our lack of foresight with what could be the most severe epidemic of youth drug abuse, youth violence, and youth crime our Nation has ever suffered. 
Preparing each of these 39 million American children means giving them the techniques and the desire to stay away from drugs--in short, drug prevention. The Drug-Free Communities Act of 1997 is one of what must be many elements of a comprehensive, nationwide drug prevention effort. I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation and I look forward to passing it into law.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there is no doubt a lot of women in their forties who are awfully confused these days about whether they should receive a regular mammogram to test for breast cancer. Over the last several years--and especially over the last couple of months--the debate in the scientific community and the conflicting scientific studies have not painted a very clear picture for younger women. 
But, what is perfectly clear--what is not in dispute--is that older women should receive regular mammograms. Mammograms save lives. And, the scientific studies confirm it. If all women over 50 received regular mammograms, breast cancer mortality could be reduced by one-third. The recommended screening guidelines reflect this, no matter what group's guidelines you read. The American Cancer Society, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Physicians all recommend that women over 50 receive annual mammograms. 
Now, here's the problem. Women 65 and over have Medicare as their health insurance. The guidelines tell them--and their doctors are telling them--to get a mammogram once a year. But, Medicare pays for mammograms only once every 2 years. This means that an elderly woman must pay the cost of every other mammogram herself--or go without a mammogram every other year. And, even when Medicare pays for the mammogram, the woman is still responsible for at least 20 percent of the cost. 
The result, Mr. President, is that too many women are following Medicare's payment rules--and not getting tested--rather than following the scientific guidelines--and being tested. 
Two years ago, a study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It found that only 14.4 percent of women without Medicare supplemental insurance--that is, women who do not have, on top of Medicare, private insurance that may cover mammograms on an annual basis--only 14.4 percent of those women received even a mammogram once every 2 years, let alone annually. Even among those women with supplemental insurance, less than half had a mammogram over the course of 2 years. The study concluded that a woman's inability to pay a share of the costs for mammograms `is an obstacle to the effective mass screening of older women for breast cancer.' And, I would add, an obstacle to saving thousands of lives. 
So, Mr. President, today I am introducing the Medicare Mammography Screening Expansion Act. This bill does two things. First, it would cover mammograms under Medicare once every year, as recommended by the guidelines, instead of once every 2 years, which is now the law. Second, it would eliminate the 20-percent copayment that is currently charged to women when they receive a mammogram, so that women are not discouraged from obtaining this important preventive measure because of the cost. I should note that eliminating the copayment is not unprecedented. Medicare already does not charge copayments for flu shots and most clinical laboratory tests. 
Mr. President, we know that mammograms save lives. Yet, current Medicare policy creates barriers that are preventing women from seeking this simple, life-saving procedure. I urge my colleagues to join me in making mammography screenings more available and more affordable for American women.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee in bringing forward this compromise resolution with regard to Mexico and the narcotics issue. 
At the outset, I want to compliment the Senators who have been deeply involved in the negotiations on this matter--the chairman of the committee, the Senator from Georgia, the Senator from California, and the Senator from Texas. 
They and many other Senators have a deep and abiding concern about the serious threat that drug trafficking in Mexico posts to both that country and the United States. 
Indeed, we all agree, I suspect, on several issues. 
First, it is clear that we cannot overstate the role of Mexico as a source for narcotics. Mexico is the primary transit route for cocaine entering the United States, a major source country for heroin, methamphetamines, and marijuana, and a major money laundering center for illicit profits from the narcotics trade. 
Second, I believe we agree that the United States bears a significant responsibility for combating the narcotics trade. Undeniably, the demand for narcotics in this country spurs the narcotics trade. But we are not solely to blame for Mexico's ills. 
As the Mexican Government continually reminds us, Mexico is a sovereign nations, and it has the responsibility to do all that it can to confront the threat of the powerful drug cartels--cartels which now have considerable influence in Mexican society. 
Third, we agree that corruption in Mexican law enforcement is endemic. That corruption is deeply rooted, as even Mexican President Zedillo acknowledged in his State-of-the-Nation address last fall. 
Fourth, we all agree that Mexico must do much, much more in the war on drugs--as the White House acknowledged last month when the President made his certification. 
All this leads to the fundamental question now facing us: What can Congress do to help us achieve our objective of reducing the flow of narcotics from Mexico to the United States? 
I was disappointed that the President certified that Mexico had met the standard of fully cooperating, or taking adequate steps on its own. The systemic corruption in Mexico, combined with several failures to follow through on commitments made, argued against granting Mexico a full stamp of approval. Instead, I urged the President to invoke the national waiver, because I believed that our interests would be better served by not isolating ourselves from Mexico--which would surely occur were we to fully decertify Mexico. For my part, I believe it could have long-lasting, damaging repercussions that we cannot now predict. At a minimum, it would inhibit the political space that President Zedillo has to press forward with his agenda of reform. 
And if we destroy President Zedillo's political resolve to combat the drug traffickers, we will have achieved nothing--and we may well lose the gains we have recently made. In other words, decertification and exercising the full penalties possible under decertification offers a cure that appears to be worse than the disease. 
I am pleased that we have come to a bipartisan agreement--reached last night in negotiations with the administration--on the best way forward. The resolution recognizes the aspects of the issue that I have stated--specifically that both countries must take strong action to combat the scourge of narcotics. In addition, the resolution lays out several benchmarks--a set of policies that we expect both the Mexican Government and the United States Government to undertake in the coming months. 
For example, it makes clear that Mexico must implement its recently enacted anti-crime laws, including the new money laundering statute and the organized crime law. In addition, Mexico must investigate and prosecute official corruption at all levels of government--and we must do all we can to assist Mexico in that effort. And Mexico must deny safe haven to persons and organizations responsible for drug trafficking. 
These and many other measures--if vigorously implemented--will be critical to strengthening the effort against the drug trade. 
Mr. President, we have a major problem in Mexico. It is, in part, the result of our success in reducing the flow of narcotics through the Caribbean and Florida--and our success, in cooperation with the Government of Colombia, in dismantling the major cartels in that country. The emergence of powerful cartels in Mexico is a manifestation of the so-called balloon effect--if you pressure the drug traffickers in one area, they will move to another. Unfortunately, the traffickers are nothing if not resilient. 
The result, for both Mexico and the United States, is the expansion of organized crime syndicates that have considerable power and influence over not only the drug trade, but also Mexican society itself. Combating this development will require a major commitment--of resources and political will--by both our Government and the Mexican Government. 
The cooperation we have received from Mexico in the past year is far from perfect. We all acknowledge that. But we have made important progress in the past few years, and this measure will be an important contribution to spurring even greater cooperation between our two Governments.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to offer just few comments to indicate why I believe the course chosen by the majority today relating to the independent counsel is unwarranted. 
First, the official responsible for initiating the appointment of an independent counsel--Attorney General Janet Reno--has maintained the highest standards of integrity and professionalism. Second, the Attorney General has proven her willingness to request the appointment of independent counsels in the past when she believed the statutory standard was met. And, third, the Attorney General has already undertaken a serious inquiry into the campaign fundraising issues and continues to consider, as the facts develop, whether to seek an independent counsel. 
As we review the facts, we must remember that the independent counsel statute is triggered only upon receipt of specific, credible evidence that high-ranking Government officials listed in the statute may have violated our criminal laws. This is an appropriately high threshold that must be met before the process of appointing an independent counsel can go forward. This standard is not met by vague allegations. The law does not apply to unethical, improper, or unseemly conduct. Rather, the statute is triggered only after the Attorney General determines, after consulting with career Justice Department prosecutors and engaging in a serious, deliberative process, that the statutory test has been satisfied. 
The conduct of the 1996 elections are being carefully scrutinized by the Department of Justice. A task force comprised of career prosecutors from the 
Public Integrity Section of the Criminal Division, supported by over 30 FBI agents, has been assembled to explore fully the range of issues that have been raised. This task force will determine which, if any, of the allegations warrant criminal investigation. Of course, if the task force receives specific evidence from a credible source that a person covered by the Independent Counsel Act may have violated the law, a preliminary investigation under the act would be initiated. But, to date, the Attorney General has determined that the Department has not received such evidence. 
In short, we are at the early stages of the task force's operations where the job is best left to career investigators and prosecutors. 
What is more, under the independent counsel statute, it is the Judiciary Committee--not the full Senate--which has the most proper oversight role of the independent counsel process. I argued last week that was unnecessary for the Judiciary Committee to make any conclusions at this time as to the propriety of appointing an independent counsel. But, a majority of the committee did exactly that last week. Now, the full Senate has been called on to embark on an even more unnecessary and unwarranted course by asking all Senators to--in effect--substitute their judgement for that of the career investigators and prosecutors. I do not believe that the members of the Judiciary Committee who spend so much of their time overseeing Justice Department activities could make such a judgement now--so, I certainly do not think it possible that all the other Senators who do not sit on the Judiciary Committee can prudently or accurately make this judgement. 
Not only do we have a comprehensive task force already reviewing the 1996 campaign fundraising issues, but we also have an Attorney General who has repeatedly shown her independence, integrity, and willingness to call for an independent counsel. Since taking office, Attorney General Reno has requested the appointment of at least four independent counsels--Kenneth 
Starr, Donald C. Smaltz, David M. Barrett, and Daniel S. Pearson--to investigate wrongdoing of high executive branch officials and other individuals covered by the statute. 
In short, the most prudent course today is to wait for the Justice Department's investigation to be completed. Then, and only then, can the need for appointment of an independent counsel can be evaluated based on a complete and full record. 
I would also add that this is consistent with how I have proceeded in past cases. For example, in 1992, I, along with several other Democratic Senators on the Judiciary Committee sent a letter to then-Attorney General William Barr requesting that he call for an independent counsel to investigate the possibility that high-ranking officials engaged in obstruction of justice in the prosecution of a particular case. I did so only after Attorney General Barr had appointed a special counsel, indicating that the Attorney General had already concluded that criminal conduct may have taken place. I called for an independent counsel at that point to ensure that this investigation be carried out by someone whose independence was clear, rather than by a special counsel hired by the Attorney General. 
Finally, we also need to keep in mind that there are some costs to appointing an independent counsel at this time. An inquiry is already well under way--FBI agents have been assigned to the task force and, according to press reports, subpoenas have been issued and a grand jury has been convened. Once an independent counsel is appointed, that inquiry must be shut down and the independent counsel will have to start from scratch. And as we know from past experience, independent counsel investigations can linger for years. So if we are interested in resolving this matter, and getting answers as soon as possible, we ought to allow the Justice Department to go forward and put our trust in Attorney General Reno to trigger the independent counsel statute only if and when she deems it necessary.  
Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, 2 of the 12 seats on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals are currently vacant. Some have argued that the vacancy to which Merrick Garland has been nominated should not be filled because the D.C. circuit is overstaffed. But the reasons Congress gave for approving 12 seats for the D.C. circuit remain compelling today and justify filling this vacancy. 
Further, to propose eliminating a circuit court judgeship within the context of a particular nomination, rather than through the deliberative process we normally follow in addressing judgeship needs, jeopardizes the impartiality and independence of the judiciary. 
Merrick Garland's nomination was first delivered to the Senate on September 6, 1995--more than 18 months ago. The Judiciary Committee held a confirmation hearing on the nomination on November 30, 1995, and forwarded the nomination for consideration by the full Senate 2 weeks later. The full Senate failed to act on Garland's nomination for 9 1/2 more months, however, returning it to the President at the close of the 104th Congress. 
In fact, the Senate refused to confirm a single circuit court judge during the entire second session of the last Congress. This was the first time in more than 20 years that an entire session of Congress had passed without a single circuit court confirmation. Nonetheless, some argued that shutting down the confirmation process is par for the course in an election year. They are wrong. And let me set the record straight. 
George Bush made nearly one-third of his 253 judicial nominations in 1992, a Presidential election year. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I held 15 nomination hearings that year, including 3 in July, 2 in August, and 1 in September. In 1992--the last Presidential election year--the Senate continued to confirm judges through the waning days of the 102d Congress. We even confirmed 7 judges on October 8--the last day of the second session. As a result, the Senate confirmed all 66 nominees the Judiciary Committee reported out that year--55 for the district courts and 11 for the circuit courts. Let me repeat: last session, only 17 district judges were confirmed and no circuit judges were confirmed. 
Now that the election is over and Merrick Garland has been renominated, Republicans argue that we should not vote to confirm him because the District of Columbia circuit needs only 10 judges. They are wrong. And let me set the record straight. 
Congress has previously recognized the need for 12 judges. Twelve years ago, based on the recommendation of the Judicial Conference of the United States, Congress concluded that the D.C. circuit's caseload warranted 12 judgeships. The Senate report to the 1984 legislation creating an additional judgeship states: 
Located at the seat of the Federal government, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia inevitably receives a significant amount of its caseload from federal administrative agencies headquartered in that area. Administrative appeals filed in this court numbered 504 in 1982 and represented 34.8 percent of the incoming caseload. Due to the nature of the caseload which includes many unique cases involving complex legal, economic and social issues of national importance and a large backlog of pending appeals, this court requires one additional judgeship.

Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I have not spoken on judges this year, but having worked on it for so many years with my friend from Utah, having either been the ranking member or chairman of that committee. But let me make one point. 
It is one thing to say that we are going to disagree on judges. We did that when we were in control. We did that. And we said that all the judges that have been nominated here by two successive Republican Presidents--we picked seven out of a total of over 500--we said we disagree with these judges. The most celebrated case was Judge Bork, and less celebrated cases were people who have gone beyond being judges. Some are Senators. But the bottom line was that we understand that. 
But what I do not understand is this notion and all of the talk about activist judges without any identification of who the activist judges are. It is one thing for the Republicans to say that we are not going to vote for or allow activist judges. We understand that. We are big folks. We understand baseball, hardball. We got that part. No problem. 
But what I do not understand is saying we are not going to allow activist judges and then not identifying who those activist judges are. This is kind of what is going on here, and no one wants to say it. But since I have the reputation of saying what no one wants to say, I am going to say it. 
Part of what is going on here is, and in the Republican caucus there are some who say, No. We want to change the rules. We want to make sure, of all the people nominated for the Federal bench, that the Republican Senators should be able to nominate half of them, or 40 percent of them, or 30 percent of them. That is malarkey. That is flat-out malarkey. That is blackmail. That has nothing to do with activist judges. 
I do not doubt the sincerity of my friend from Utah. We have worked together for 22 years. But here is my challenge. Any judge nominated by the President of the United States, if you have a problem with his or her activism, name it. Tell us what it is. Define it like we did. You disagreed. You disagreed with the definition. But we said straight up, `Bang. I do not want Bork for the following reasons.' People understand that. But do not try to change 200 years of precedent and tell us that we are not letting judges up because we want the Republican Senator to be able to name the judge. Don't do that, or else do it and do it in the open. Let's have a little bit of legislating in the sunshine here. Do it flat in the open. 
I see my colleagues nodding and smiling. I am sort of breaching the unspoken rule here not to talk about what is really happening. But that is what is really happening. I will not name certain Senators. But I have had Senators come up to me and say, Joe, here is the deal. We will let the following judges through in my State if you agree to get the President to say that I get to name three of them. Now folks, that is a change of a deal. That is changing precedent. That isn't how it works. The President nominates. We dispose one way or another of that nomination. And the historical practice has been--and while I was chairman we never once did that--that never once that I am aware of did we ever say, `By the way, we are not letting Judge A through unless you give me Judges B and C.' 
Now, let me set the record totally straight here. There are States where precedents were set years ago. The Republican and Democratic Senator, when it was a split delegation, have made a deal up front in the open. In New York, Senator Javits and Senator Moynihan said: Look. In the State of New York, the way we are going to do this is that whomever is the Senator representing the party of the President--I believe they broke it down to 60--for every two people that Senator gets to name, the Senator in the party other than the President gets to name one. OK, fine. Jacob Javits did not go to Pat Moynihan and demand that he was going to do that. Moynihan made the offer, as I understand it, to Jacob Javits. That is not a bad way to proceed. 
But now to come along and say, `By the way, in the name of activist judges, we are not going to move judges' is not what this is about. 
I might point out that all the talk last election that started off--it all fizzled because it did not go anywhere--about how there is going to be an issue about activism on the courts, we pointed out that of all the judges that came up in Clinton's first term, almost all of them were voted unanimously out of this body by Democrats and Republicans, including the former majority leader. He only voted against three of all the nominees, then he argued, by the way, that Clinton nominated too many activist judges. And then it kind of fizzled when I held a little press conference, and said, `By the way. You voted for all of them.' It kind of made it hard to make this case that they were so activist. 
So look. Let me say that I will not take any more time, but I will come back to the floor with all of the numbers and the details. But here is the deal. 
If the Republican majority in the Senate says, `Look, the following 2, 5, 10, 12, 20 judges are activist for the following reasons, and we are against them,' we understand that. We will fight it. If we disagree, we will fight it. But if they come along and say, `We are just not letting these judges come up because really what is happening is they are coming to guys like me and saying, `Hey, I will make you a deal. You give me 50 percent of judges, and I will let these other judges go through.' Then that isn't part of the deal. 
Look, I have a message to the Court. I know the Court never reads the Congressional Record, and Justice Scalia said that we should not consider the Record for legislative history because everybody knows that all the Congressional Record is is what Senators' staff say and not what Senators know. He is wrong. But that is what he said. Maybe they don't read it. But I want to send a message. 
Madam President, when I was chairman of the committee and there was a Republican President named Reagan and a Republican President named Bush, the Judicial Conference on a monthly basis would write to me and say, `Why aren't you passing more judges?' They have been strangely silent about the vacancies that exist. Now, I agree that the administration has been slow in pulling the trigger here. They have not sent enough nominees up in a timely fashion. And I have been critical of them for the last 2 years, Madam President. But that is not the case now. All I am saying to you is, as they say in parts of my State, `I smell a rat here.' What I think is happening--and I hope I am wrong--is that this is not about activism. 
This is about trying to keep the President of the United States of America from being able to appoint judges, particularly as it relates to the courts of appeals. 
Now, what is happening is what happened today. Merrick Garland was around for years. Now, what is going to happen is they are going to say we reported out a circuit court of appeals judge. Aren't we doing something. The truth of the matter is the proof will be in the pudding several months from now when we find out whether or not we are really going to move on these judges. 
Let me point out one other thing. And I see my friend from Maryland in the Chamber, and I will yield particularly since I had not intended speaking at this moment.

Mr. BIDEN. The point I wish to make is this. When I was chairman of the committee and a Republican was President, we held, on average, a hearing for judges once every 2 weeks and had usually five judges, circuit court and district court, who we heard. 
Last year we essentially had one hearing every other month and we had to fight to get three to four on the agenda to be heard.

Mr. BIDEN. If I may respond to the Senator, obviously the facts are correct, but I think it worth elaborating a little bit more on the facts. I saw my very able colleague, the present chairman of the Judiciary Committee, on television the other day, and he was talking about the number of judges that were `left hanging,' who were not confirmed and sent back to the administration at the end of 1992, the Bush administration. And he cited an accurate number. But as my very distinguished friend, who is, as well, a scholar, knows, there is an old expression attributed to Benjamin Disraeli, who said there are three kinds of lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics. 
What my able friend from Utah did not mention is that just like President Carter--Carter's judges is a separate charge we can go back to, but just like President Clinton, President Bush did not get his nominees up here until the end of the process. 
In other words, they were late getting here. Notwithstanding the fact that he was late in getting his nominees up, the Senator may remember in the caucus over the objection of some Democrats who said the Republicans would never do this, I insisted we confirm judges up to the day we adjourned the Senate. During the last week the Senate was in that year, we confirmed seven judges. I could have easily just sneezed and they would not have been confirmed. And the fact is the reason why we did not confirm more is because we did not have time to hold the hearings and we were holding hearings on 20 or more a month.

Every single Federal judge in the last 24 years who has been appointed in the district of Delaware or the third circuit has been appointed by Senator Roth. I did not expect, did not ask, and not once was ever consulted about who he would appoint, and I supported every one that he sent up. Not one single time was I made aware of anything other than after the fact, which is OK. I am not complaining about that.

Mr. BIDEN. That was the system. Not one single time. And I was chairman of the committee. 
Now, I would point out one other thing to my friend. I want to have complete candor. If one considers taking judges based on their ideology and call that political, yes, we Democrats were political, as well. I am not complaining about that. I am not complaining about anybody who stands up and says I do not want Judge Smith, the President's nominee, because I think he will be bad on the court for the following reasons and comes to the floor and makes the case. I do not quarrel with that because I think that is the prerogative of the Senate and any Senator. What I am quarreling with is a different kind of politicizing, and that is drawing the conclusion that because I now control the Senate, I am not going to let the President of the United States have nominees whether or not I have an ideological problem with them.

Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, let me give an example of what you just said. I know you know, but it is important for the Record. 
I meet every year--I will not now because I am not the top Democrat on the committee. But every year for, I don't know, 14 or 15 years, I meet with what is called the Judicial Conference --a legislatively organized body where the Congress says the court can have such a function, where we look for recommendations. 
I might add, by the way, you may remember when there was a Republican President named Reagan, the Senator from Delaware introduced a bill to increase the number of Federal judgeships by 84. Why did I do that? I did that because the Federal court came to us, the Judicial Conference, and said, `Here is our problem. We don't have enough judges to administer justice in a timely fashion in this country. And there is a backlog on all these criminal cases.' 
I must admit to the Senator, when they came to me with that request, I knew the problem I was going to have. I was going to go into a Democratic caucus and say, by the way, a Republican President, who is a fine man but the most ideological guy we had in a long time, who announced he was going to appoint only very conservative judges, I was now going to give him 84 more than he had. 
I realized that was not a politically wise thing for me to do. But, listening to the court, I did just that. My recollection is the Senator from Maryland stood with me and said, `I don't like it. I admit, I am not crazy about 84 more judges being appointed by Ronald Reagan. But the court needs to be filled.' 
Now we have the strange happening, the courts come back to us and say--and they do this in a very scientific way--we not only need the vacancies filled, we need more judges than we have. They cite, as the Senator is very familiar with, they cite the backlog, they give the rationale that cases are being backed up. Guess what? The idea that we will even get a chance to discuss a judgeship bill, I predict to my friend from Maryland, on this floor is zero--zero. Not only that, to further make the point, this is the first time in the 24 years that I have been a Senator, in 24 years, the first time I have ever heard anybody come to the floor and say: You know, we should basically decommission judgeships. 
The ninth circuit is the busiest circuit in America, out in California. One of our colleagues, a very wonderful guy, a nice guy, says, `I am not going to let any other judge be in the ninth circuit'--notwithstanding they have five vacancies, if I am not mistaken, and they are up to their ears in work. This started last year when I was in charge of the Democratic side. He said, `I am not going to let anybody go through until the ninth circuit splits into two circuits.' 
I said, `Why do you want it to split?' 
He said, `The reason I want it to split is I don't like the fact that California judges are making decisions that affect my State.' 
The distinguished Senator from Idaho is shaking his head. He agrees. He is in that circuit. It is painful to point this out, but the reason why there is a Federal court is so there is not Illinois, Indiana, Idaho, California justice. There is one uniform interpretation of the Constitution. That is the reason we have a Federal circuit court of appeals. 
Now, this is quite unusual. We have--and I was not referring to the distinguished Senator from Idaho, who is on the floor, when I said, `there was a Senator.' That is not to whom I am referring. But another one of our colleagues said he is not going 
to let anybody go through until there is a split, because he does not like the idea that decisions relating to his State are being made by judges who are not from his State or are not from States of similar size. That is, interestingly, an effectively rewrite of the Constitution of the United States of America. I do not think the Senator thought it in those terms, but that is literally what it is. 
Now I am being told, OK, unless we, in fact, split the circuit--and by the way, I am not opposed to splitting the circuit. We split the fifth circuit because when we got to the point where Florida grew so big--Florida and Mississippi and Alabama and Louisiana, they are all in the same circuit--but they got so big, because of population growth, we said--the court recommended, we agreed--that it should be split into two circuits. We understand that. I am not opposed to that. I am not arguing about that. But the idea that someone says, `Until you do it my way, until you can assure me I am not going to be associated with that State of California, I am not going to let any vacancies be filled'----

Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield on that point, it is probably going to get him in trouble, but I want to compliment the chairman of the committee. The chairman of the committee did not buy into that argument. The chairman of the committee took the position on this that we should act, and he had been pushing this for some time. 
Again, I see my distinguished friend, who now I work with in another capacity, as the minority--the euphemism we use is ranking member--of the Foreign Relations Committee. We have much less disagreement than we have on some issues relating to judges. But, with him here, I can remember that during the last days when the Senator from Delaware was trying to push through judges--on 
October 8, 1992, the last day of the session, with President Bush as President of the United States, the Senator from Delaware pushed through seven Republican judges--the last day. 
I will bet you that has not happened very often in this place with Democrats or Republicans: The last day, seven. 
The reason I mention that is one of my distinguished colleagues--we have very different views, but I like him a lot--walked up to me and he was from a State where there were two Republican Senators, and two of those judges were his. He walked up and shook my hand. This will not go in the Record--it will go in the Record, but his name won't, but my colleagues will know who he is. He shook my hand and said, `Joe, you're a nice guy. I really appreciated it.' He says, `Of course, you know I would never do this for you.' 
I like him because he is straightforward and honest. He meant it, and that's why we get along so well. I am not referring to the Senator from North Carolina. He said, `I'd never do this for you.' The point being, not that Biden is a good guy or Biden is a stupid guy, the point being that the court is in desperate trouble in a number of jurisdictions. In southern California and south Florida, and in a number of places where there are drug cases that are backed up, a number of places where there are significant civil case backlogs, a number of places where population growth is straining the court, they need these vacancies filled. 
I respectfully suggest that it is a rare--it is a rare--district court nominee by a Republican President or a Democratic President who, if you first believe they are honest and have integrity, have any reason to vote against them. I voted for Judge Bork, for example, on the circuit court, because Judge Bork I believed to be an honest and decent man, a brilliant constitutional scholar with whom I disagreed, but who stood there and had to, as a circuit court judge, swear to uphold the law of the land, which also meant follow Supreme Court decisions. A circuit court cannot overrule the Supreme Court. 
So any member who is nominated for the district or circuit court who, in fact, any Senator believes will be a person of their word and follow stare decisis, it does not matter to me what their ideology is, as long as they are in a position where they are in the general mainstream of American political life and they have not committed crimes of moral turpitude, and have not, in fact, acted in a way that would shed a negative light on the court. 
So what I want to say, and I will yield because I see my friend from South Carolina--North Carolina, I beg your pardon. I am used to dealing with our close friend in the Judiciary Committee who is from South Carolina. I seem to have the luck of getting Carolinians to deal with, and I enjoy them. I will yield the floor by saying, I will come back to the floor at an appropriate time in the near term, immediately when we get back from the recess, and I will, as they say, Madam President, fill in the blanks in terms of what the absolute detail and each of the numbers are, because I have tried to recall some of them off the top of my head, not having intended to speak to this issue when I walked across the floor earlier. 
Let it suffice to say at the moment, at least for me, that it is totally appropriate for any U.S. Senator to voice his or her opposition to any nominee for the Court, and they have a full right to do that. In my study of and teaching of constitutional law and separation of powers issues, there is nothing in the Constitution that sets the standard any Senator has to apply, whether they vote for or against a judge. 
But I also respectfully suggest that everyone who is nominated is entitled to have a shot, to have a hearing and to have a shot to be heard on the floor and have a vote on the floor. 
We had a tie vote in the committee, Madam President, on one of the Supreme Court nominees. I was urged by those who opposed him--and I opposed this particular nominee--to not report it to the floor. My reading of the Constitution, though, is the Judiciary Committee is not mentioned in the Constitution. The Judiciary Committee is not mentioned. The Senate is. We only in the Judiciary Committee have the right to give advice to the Senate, but it is the Senate that gives its advice and consent on judicial nominations. 
I sincerely hope, and I have urged the administration to confer with Republican Senators before they nominate anyone from that Senator's State. I think that is totally appropriate. I think it is appropriate, as well, that Republican Senators, with a Democratic President, have some input, which Democrats never had with the last two Republican Presidents. I think that is appropriate. 
But I do not think it is appropriate, if this is the case--and I do not know for certain, it just appears to be--if the real hangup here is wanting to reach an informal agreement that for every one person the President of the United States gets to nominate, the Republican Party will get to nominate someone, the Republican Party in the Senate. Or for every two persons that the President nominates, the Republicans get to nominate one. 
It is totally appropriate for Republicans to reject every single nominee if they want to. That is within their right. But it is not, I will respectfully request, Madam President, appropriate not to have hearings on them, not to bring them to the 
floor and not to allow a vote, and it is not appropriate to insist that we, the Senators--we, the Senators--get to tell the President who he must nominate if it is not in line with the last 200 years of tradition. 
Again, I did not intend speaking at all on this, other than the fact I walked through and it was brought up, and since I was in that other capacity for so long, I felt obliged to speak up. 
I see my friend from North Carolina is here. I do not know if he wishes to speak on judges or foreign policy matters, but whichever he wishes to speak on, I am sure it will be informative. I yield the floor.  
Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, again, I did not anticipate that I would be speaking to this issue. Fortunately, or unfortunately, I am on the floor, and I understand why the Senator from North Carolina came over to speak in light of things that were said earlier today when he was not here and I was not here. I would like to respond, at least in part, to what my distinguished colleague has said. 
Let me begin by parcelling this out into three pieces. First, is the issue of whether or not the administration has acted in good faith; second, is not whether or not the substantive issues raised by the distinguished Senator from North Carolina are accurate, but whether or not there is a response to them; I think his concerns are not accurate; and third, whether or not the ultimate condition being laid down by the Senator from North Carolina, as I understand it--and I could be wrong--is appropriate. 
Let me begin, first, by talking about the administration. It is true that the distinguished Senator from North Carolina and I spent almost 4 1/2 hours last night addressing, in very specific detail--apparently without sufficient success--the concerns the Senator from North Carolina has about this treaty. I note--and I will come back to this--that the universe of concerns expressed by the Senator from North Carolina were submitted to me in writing some time ago. Although they have expanded slightly, they total 30, possibly 31, concerns. 
When I became the ranking member of this committee, I approached the distinguished chairman and said I would very much like to work with him, I would very much like to cooperate, and I would very much like to work out a forum in which we could settle our differences relating to what is sound foreign policy.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me move to the next point that relates to the merits of this treaty. That is a legitimate area of disagreement. I will be brief because I am keeping the staff and the pages, who have to go to school tomorrow morning, very late. 
UNIVERSALITY 
Critics charge that the CWC will be ineffective because rogue states such as Syria, Iraq, North Korea, and Libya--all of whom are suspected of or confirmed to have chemical weapons--have not joined the convention. 
Therefore, the argument goes, the United States should withhold its ratification until these states join. 
I could not disagree more. 
Just think of it. The logic of this argument would lead us to a world where rogue actors--not good international citizens--determine the rules of international conduct. 
Such a policy would amount, effectively, to a surrender of U.S. national sovereignty to the actions of a few. 
Instead of the United States actively leading international coalitions and setting tough standards on nonproliferation matters, the convention opponents would have us do nothing until every two-bit rogue regime would decide for us when we should act. 
This reasoning is contrary to the record of the past 40 years, during which the United States has led the way in nonproliferation initiatives. 
From the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, to the missile technology control regime, to the comprehensive test ban treaty, and to the chemical weapons convention itself, we have fought for establishing accepted norms of behavior. 
I happen to believe that international norms count. 
In a recent article that I coauthored with my distinguished colleague, Senator Richard Lugar, we noted that such norms provide standards of acceptable behavior against which the actions of states can be judged. They also provide a basis for action--harsh action--when rogue states violate the norm. 
Suggesting that we should now take a back seat to the likes of North Korea and Libya does a grave injustice to our record of international leadership and leaves such nations free to act as free operators without fear of penalty or retaliation by the nations whose armies and citizens they threaten. 
The fact that there is now no international legal prohibition against the development of chemical weapons should not be lost here. 
The suspected programs that treaty opponents are so concerned about are right now entirely legitimate according to international law, and we have already had a telling example of what can result from this perverse situation. 
The Japanese police were aware, before a cult attacked the Tokyo subway with sarin nerve gas in 1995, that the cult was manufacturing the gas--but they had no basis in Japanese law to do anything about it. 
That will change, both internationally and domestically, once the CWC enters into force. 
The convention will establish an international norm against the development of chemical weapons. It will provide the legal, political, and moral basis for firm action against those that choose to violate the rules. If the goal of treaty opponents truly is to target the chemical weapons programs of suspect states, then joining the convention is the best way to achieve this objective--and refusing to join is the surest way to protect the world's bad actions. 
VERIFIABILITY 
A great benefit of the chemical weapons convention is that it increases our ability to detect production of poison gas. 
Regardless of whether we ratify this convention, regardless of whether another country has ratified this convention, our intelligence agencies will be monitoring the capabilities of other countries to produce and deploy chemical weapons. The CWC will not change that responsibility. 
What this convention does, however, is give our intelligence agencies some additional tools to carry out this task. In short, it will make their job easier. 
In addition to onsite inspections, the CWC provides a mechanism to track the movement of sensitive chemicals around the world, increasing the likelihood of detection. This mechanism consists of data declarations that require chemical companies to report production of those precursor chemicals needed to produce chemical weapons. This information will make it easier for the intelligence community to monitor these chemicals and to learn when a country has chemical weapons capability. 
In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1994, R. James Woolsey, then Director of Central Intelligence, stated: `In sum, what the chemical weapons convention provides the intelligence community is a new tool to add to our collection tool kit.' 
Recently, Acting Director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, reemphasized this point before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Mr. Tenet stated: `There are tools in this treaty that as intelligence professionals we believe we need to monitor the proliferation of chemical weapons around the world. * * * I think as intelligence professionals we can only gain.' 
No one has ever asserted that this convention is 100 percent verifiable. It simply is not possible with this or any other treaty to detect every case of cheating. But I would respectfully submit that this is not the standard by which we should judge the convention. Instead, we should recognize that the CWC will enhance our ability to detect clandestine chemical weapons programs. The intelligence community has said that we are better off with the CWC than without it--that is the standard by which to judge the CWC.  
CONSTITUTIONALITY 
One of the issues that should not be contentious, and I hope will not continue to be a focus of attention, is whether the convention, and particularly its inspection regime, is constitutional. 
Every scholar that has published on the subject, and virtually every scholar that has considered the issue, has concluded that nothing in the convention conflicts in any way with the fourth amendment or any other provision of the U.S. Constitution. 
Indeed, to accommodate our special constitutional concerns, the United States insisted that when parties to the convention provide access to international inspection teams, the government may `[take] into account any constitutional obligations it may have with regard to proprietary rights or searches and seizures.' 
In plain English, this means that inspectors enforcing the Chemical Weapons Convention must comply with our constitution when conducting inspections on U.S. soil. 
It also means that the United States will not be in violation of its treaty obligations if it refuses to provide inspectors access to a particular site for legitimate constitutional reasons. 
In light of this specific text, inserted at the insistence of U.S. negotiators, I am hard pressed to understand how anyone can seriously contend that the convention conflicts with the Constitution. 
There is nothing in the convention that would require the United States to permit a warrantless search or to issue a warrant without probable cause. Nor does the convention give any international body the power to compel the United States to permit an inspection or issue a warrant.

Mr. BIDEN. So let me make this point absolutely clear, despite what opponents of the convention have said, there will be no involuntary warrantless searches of U.S. facilities by foreign inspectors under this convention. 
In light of this, I hope that the constitutionality of this convention will not become an issue in this debate.

Mr. BIDEN. Now let me move to the third issue. The notion of, as my friend from North Carolina stated, that there is an artificial date of April 29 made up by the administration to put undue pressure on the Senate to act. Let me point out for the Senate that there is nothing artificial about that date. It is real. 
What does that mean? It means that our failure to ratify before the 29th will have consequences. First, the chemical weapons treaty mandates trade restrictions that could have a deleterious impact upon the American chemical industry. If the United States has not ratified, as long as they have not ratified, American companies will have to supply end user certificates to purchase certain classes of chemicals from the CWC signatories. After 3 years, they will be subject to trade sanctions that will harm American exports and jobs. 
I know that my friend says a lot of chemical companies do not like this. I come from a State that has a little bit of an interest in chemicals, the single most significant State in America that deals with chemicals. A little company called Du Pont; a little company called Hercules; a little company called ICI Americas; a little company called Du Pont Merck--little pharmaceutical outfits who are among the giants in the world. They are not what you call liberal Democratic establishments. They are ardently--I can testify--they are ardently in favor of this treaty. They believe it is desperately in the interest of the United States of America and their interest. This is not a bunch of lib labs out there who are arms controllers running around saying, `Disarm, ban the bomb.' These are Fortune, not 500, not 100, 10, Fortune 10 companies that are saying, `We want this treaty.' And further, `We will be harmed if we do not enter this treaty.' 
This overall governing body, known as the Conference of State Partners, is going to meet soon after April 29 to draw up the rules governing the implementation of this treaty. If we, to use the vernacular, `ain't' in by the 29th, if we are not on by the 29th, we do not get to draw up those rules. 
There used to be a distinguished Senator from Louisiana I served with for a long time. My friend, the Presiding Officer, knew him from his days up here. His name was Russell Long. He used to say kiddingly, `I ain't for no deal I ain't in on.' But the chemical industry, which is our largest exporter--hear what I just said--the biggest fish in the pond are saying, `We want to be in on the deal.' 
That is why the 29th is important. If we are not a party to the CWC, we will not be a member of that conference. And this body, with no American input, could make rules that have a serious impact upon the United States. 
Third, there will be a body called the executive council with 41 members on which we are assured of a permanent seat from the start because of the size of our chemical industry, that is, if we have ratified by the 29th. If we ratify after the council is already constituted, then a decision on whether to order a required surprise inspection on an American facility may be taken without an American representative evaluating the validity of the request and looking out for a facility's interest because we will not be on the 
standing executive council that makes that decision. 
Fourth, there will be a technical secretariat with about 150 inspectors, many of whom would be Americans because of the size and sophistication of our chemical industry. If we fail to ratify the convention by the 29th, there will be no American inspectors. 
And finally, and most importantly, in the long term, by failing to ratify, we would align ourselves with those rogue actors, those rogue states who have chosen to defy the Chemical Weapons Convention. There would be irreparable harm to our global leadership on critical arms control and nonproliferation issues. 
I will not take the time now to address other concerns that have been raised, because I said I would limit myself to these three points. 
Concluding, Mr. President, first, there has been good-faith, long and serious negotiations resulting in significant movement by the administration on conditions to the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
Second, this treaty is in the overwhelming national interest of the United States of America, a topic I am ready, willing, and anxious to debate with my distinguished colleague from North Carolina and others who think it is not. 
But at a minimum, Mr. President, the Senate should get a chance to hear that debate and vote on whether or not the distinguished Senator from North Carolina is correct or the Senator from Delaware is correct. 
Third, Mr. President, April 29 is not an artificial date. Because the triggering mechanism was when we got to 65 signatories, and that 6 months after that date the treaty would enter into force. 
Well, 65 have signed on. And 6 months after they got to the No. 65, happens to be April 29. This is not artificial. We did not make up the date. That is what the treaty says. 
So, Mr. President, I sincerely hope that my friend from North Carolina, having reflected on the quandary the administration was placed in, which was to negotiate with the Lott group--they thought they were negotiating with Senator Helms; they thought they were negotiating with every Republican who had an objection, under the auspices of Senator Lott--if they had known that Senator Helms did not view that as the appropriate forum for this negotiation, they would have simultaneously met with him. 
But now at the end of the process, when we are about to go out on recess, to say that we are not ready to bring this treaty up when we get back unless there is a new negotiation, I find unusual, particularly since I have agreed with the Senator from North Carolina that I will sign on to additional conditions with him. 
Let us vote on the only nine outstanding issues that I am aware of that have been raised. None other has been raised that I am aware of, that the administration is aware of, anyone in the Lott group is aware of, to the best of my knowledge. 
So, Mr. President, let me conclude by saying, the Senator from North Carolina has dealt with me in good faith. We have negotiated in great detail. He has listed his 30 objections. We have agreed on 21 of the 30. We disagree on nine. We agree on a method to vote on those nine. 
I sincerely hope--I sincerely hope--for the interest of the United States of America, after having already decided in the Bush administration that we would do away with the use of chemical weapons regardless of what anybody else did, that we would not now lose our place of leadership in the world and our ability to engage in the moral suasion that relates to nonproliferation and the diminution of weapons of mass destruction, that we would not now forgo that position merely because 1, 2 or 5 or 10 Senators said we should not even bring it on the floor to debate. 
I do not believe that will happen. But then again, my wife thinks I am a cockeyed optimist. But I do not think I am being unduly optimistic or a cockeyed optimist. I think having been here this long, that the Senate will get a chance to work its will. That is all I am asking. All I am asking is the Senate get a chance between now and the 29th of April to decide whether it likes this treaty or not. I believe every Member of this Senate has the national interests of the United States of America in mind when they act and when they vote. 
Let each of them vote their conscience on this treaty. If it turns out that 66 do not agree with me, then we have spoken, as we did in the League of Nations. The consequences of that vote I think were disastrous. I think the consequence of failure to ratify this treaty would be disastrous. But I think the consequence of not even letting the Senate vote will be catastrophic. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to apologize to my friend from South Carolina because, as usual, he has been carrying the heavy load here. He has been carrying the water for all of us. I do apologize for not being here, to be more engaged in this debate. Frankly, I say to my friend from South Carolina, everything else we talk about--all the other talk about what we are going to do about campaign financing and campaign finance reform, and who has more money and who has less money, and how to avoid the stain and stink of money--ultimately, cannot make a difference until, we do what you have been telling us we need to do for the last decade or more. 
We have a Supreme Court that has interpreted the first amendment in a bizarre way. This is not only with regard to the Buckley case. Take, for example, all this talk about soft money. We would not be in the spot we are in with soft money in terms of both political parties had it not been for the Supreme Court decision last year. At least there used to be a couple of veils left in this dance of seven veils. Now, you have major, major contributors who can come in and just change the whole dynamic of Senate and House races. 
I just came from a meeting on chemical weapons. This is sort of the biological agent of politics that we are trying to eliminate here. Two years ago, in the last cycle, if somebody wanted to come in and put up $100,000, $500,000, $1 million, $5 million--if they did it all by themselves, did not coordinate it with a political party, put up billboards and advertisements and did not collude with the one or the other political parties against a specific candidate, then they could spend all the money they wanted. But there was this little veil that sat there. It did not allow the multimillionaire to pick up the phone and call the chairman of the Democratic Party or Republican Party in Delaware and say, look, I want to defeat Biden or I want to defeat the other guy and I have a million bucks; how do you want me to spend it? 
The Supreme Court came along--a fellow I voted for, a brilliant guy--and wrote an opinion and said in effect, `Oh, no, there's no distinction between you going out and spending it yourself, in first amendment terms, and giving it to and coordinating with a political party.' 
What happened? We have a thousand dollar limit on individual contributions. But what does that mean? In my campaign this last time out, all of a sudden I find--I assume in coordination with the political party; by the way, I am not saying Democrats would do the same thing if they had the money--all of a sudden, I am finding all these ads on the radio with our good friend Malcolm Wallop. He was a good friend; he is a good man. He was heading up Americans for Freedom or some organization with a name like that. 
He said, `This is Americans for Freedom. Do you realize Senator Joe Biden is taking away your freedom?' Another group came in and did specific radio ads against me, coordinated by the Republicans. 
All of a sudden, my opponent had money. When he had to go out and get little pieces at a time, he had a hard time convincing people to give him the money. But, you get a couple of those big guys, they come along, and here is 10, 20, 50, 70, 100,000 bucks. 
The point I am making is, all that is legal now. So what are we going to do? We can pass all the laws. I support McCain-Feingold. I am going to vote for it. But, I am reminded of that person who once said, `You know, moderate reform is like moderate chastity.' That is about what we are getting here with legislation. 
When I arrived here, one of the first things I did, to the best of my recollection--it was Dick Clark and Joe Biden--was propose Federal funding of elections, congressional elections, because I wanted to get the private money out of this deal. I wanted to challenge incumbents, to let challengers have the same money incumbents had. I did not want public officials to be beholden to anybody but the American taxpayer. 
I will never forget, some Democratic Senators, God bless their souls, like Warren Magnuson--`Maggie,' as we used to call him--from Washington State, and some very prominent Republicans, looked at me and said, `Kid, do you know what you're doing here? Do you understand this?' I am not joking about this. `Do you understand this?' 
One Senator I will not name but has long since passed, called me into the Cloakroom, pulled me aside and said, `Joe, come here.' I was 30 years old at the time. I walked in and said, `Yes, sir?' 
He said, `Enough of this stuff now, all right?' 
I said, `Enough of what?' 
He said, `This thing about giving the other guy the same amount of money we get.' He said, `I worked too'--I won't quote him precisely--`I worked too darn hard to get to the point where some little sniveling brat will get the same money I have to run against me.' 
Well, that is why nobody in here wants to have it that way. I am not crazy about the fact. I have been around longer now. I am a senior Senator, so I can raise more money than the other guy. But, the other guy should have as much money as me to run, and neither of us should have to go around with our hats in hand saying, `Will you help me?' because it is a corrosive process, especially for a new guy and a new woman. 
The reason I am saying that is this. I believe the vast majority of people who contribute to campaigns contribute to campaigns because they, in fact, find a Senator who already has a position they agree with. The problem I worry about is the young person who decides to run for the first time. 
I will repeat this story. I told it in a hearing once, and I paid for it. But I will repeat it again and probably will pay for it again. 
Toward the end of my first campaign, when I was 29 years old, I had no money, didn't have a thing--no television money--and all of a sudden, the guy that couldn't possibly be beaten, I am 
within a point of him, the polls said. 
About 10 days before the election, I get a phone call from a group of men I never heard from before in an area of my State, I say to the Presiding Officer, where we used to only ride through and say, `My God, look at the size of those houses.' I get a phone call. They were decent men, by the way, decent, honorable men. They called me, and we went out to this place they call `the hunt country' in my area. You know it. You know some of the people. I was just so flattered they invited me. 
I was thinking, 10 days. My brother, who is 6 years younger than me, was my campaign finance chairman. You can tell how effective we were. We had no money. He was 24 years old. The Senator from South Carolina knows my brother. Jimmy says, while driving me out there, `You know, Joe, we got a call from the radio stations. If tomorrow we don't have the check for next week, we're off the air.' Now, like anybody who is running for office, you pour your heart, your soul, everything into this.

Mr. BIDEN. Right, free speech. You pour everything into it. So I was sitting there, and I was within a point, according to the polls, of pulling off at that time, that year, what was viewed as the upset of the year. I wasn't even old enough, Mr. President, to be sworn in the day I got elected. 
So I was riding out there. I walked into this room with nice big leather couches. I get offered, like we do in the Foreign Relations Committee, a sherry. That is a kind of foreign relations thing, sherry. I get offered a sherry. I don't drink, so I politely said, `No thanks.' 
These guys are real nice guys, five or six of them, and most of them made a living, God bless them--I don't begrudge them this--by clipping coupons. They came from wealthy families with a lot of money, and they are decent guys. Two of them had already been helping me. They thought this was a nice little revolution, this kid coming up doing this. 
They sat there and looked at me. The one guy who was the older of this group--I say I was 29, so they were probably between the ages of 32 and 40. One guy looks at me and says, `Joe, can you tell us your position on capital gains?' Now, Mr. President, I knew the right answer for $30,000. I knew the right answer. Capital gains had not been an issue in the campaign. I had never spoken out on capital gains. No one had talked about it, but I am not stupid. 
I was sitting there--and this is the God's truth--I was sitting in that room seeing what I worked for for 2 years about to go down the drain because I don't have $20,000 to keep my radio ads on the air. $20,000 wouldn't get you anything these days, but it would have kept me on the air for 10 more days with my radio ads, which were very effective, as it turned out. 
I sat there, and I don't know why I did it--not because I am so honorable and brave or anything--I just blurted out, `I don't think we have to change the capital gains structure.' That was the end of the conversation. Everybody was very polite to me, said, `Great idea,' and talked about a few other things. They said, `Joe, lots of luck in your senior year.' I got up and left. I didn't raise any money from them. 
I could have said, `You know, gentlemen, I think the capital gains rate should be reduced.' I knew that is how they all made their living. By the way, there is a legitimate, serious argument that capital gains should be reduced. It is not like it is something that is immoral or bad. I just happen to disagree with it. The truth is, I had not even thought that much about it, so it would not have been like I was selling my soul had I changed a position. But, the contrariant instinct got the better of me. I heard the words come out of my mouth and I thought, `Oh, my God, what did I just say?' 
Maybe I should not be so honest, but I have been around here too long. I have been here 24 years. And, this story illustrates the corrupting nature of the process. I have never known anybody I have worked with where a contributor says, `Here, I got some money for you if you go ahead and take a certain position.' That is not how it works. That is not the corruption. The corruption is sort of an insidious thing. It is insidious. But, in the public's mind, it is all bad now, even when we get support from people for positions we die for politically--whether somebody contributed to us or not, we would hold them dear, we would go down. 
I always say to young people when they say they want to run for office, answer one question: Is there something you are willing to lose over? If you are not willing to lose over something, you should not get involved in politics; you should go do something else. 
And for all the women and men in the Senate, there are positions over which they are willing to give up their seats rather than yield on. Somebody who contributes to them, who happens to share their view on that issue--now it is tainted in the public's mind. When we get support from people who are supporting us because we are of like mind, not because we changed our mind to get their support, we are viewed in a way that we must have done it because of the contribution. That is how bad it has gotten. 
So what I do not understand, I say to my friend from South Carolina, is, you would think out of mere self-preservation and our own honor----

Mr. BIDEN. You would think we would want to change the system. I would say, to the best of my knowledge, all 100 Senators here are honest and decent people. But the perception out there is that there must be--must be--something wrong because all this money is in here. 
So, it seems to me, I say to my friend from South Carolina--and I am not being solicitous--as usual, you have cut to the quick of the matter. Nothing can fundamentally change--fundamentally change--with regard to the way in which the process works until we have the ability under the law to limit the amount of money we spend, to determine how we can raise it, and to limit certain outside excesses that presently exist. If we did the things that we all would agree privately we have to do, the Supreme Court, I believe, would rule under their recent case law that it was a violation of the first amendment. 
So what I am saying to my friend from South Carolina is, besides thank you, that you are dead, dead, dead right. I am going to vote for things in addition to this amendment, but not because I think without this amendment they are going to work, but because I think they are the only things we can do. And, I hope that I am wrong in terms of my reading of the Court's assessment of the first amendment. 
My colleagues sometimes kid me, Mr. President, because they know I teach constitutional law in law school now. I think it must send shutters through Justice Scalia and others that I have been teaching the last 5 years a course on constitutional law and separation of powers issues. But you know what they say, if you want to learn a subject, teach it. If you want to learn a subject, teach it. 
I am an adjunct professor at Widener University Law School, and I have taught a seminar on constitutional law for the past 5 years on Saturday mornings. I might add for the record, I do it without any conflicts to my job in the Senate. I do it Saturday mornings, on my time. Nobody helps me with it. 
I am telling you, Senator Hollings, you are right. Without changing the Constitution and giving us the power to determine what parameters we set or how we raise money for elections or how much we can spend, then anything we do here is subject to significant change by the Supreme Court. 
Twenty-one years ago the Supreme Court ruled that spending money was the same thing as speech. The Court said that writing a check for a candidate was speech, but writing a check to a candidate was not speech. 
The Supreme Court made a supremely bad and, I believe, supremely wrong decision. By saying that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom to write a check, the Court is saying that Congress cannot take the responsible step of limiting how much money politicians can spend in trying to get elected. And we have to start putting limits on this because money is just permeating the system. 
I am sure I am going to repeat a few things here that have 
been said by others, but I think they are worth being repeated. 
In just the last 4 years, the total amount of money given to the political parties has increased 73 percent--73 percent. The total amount of money spent on races for Congress has increased 600 percent in the last 20 years. These are in real dollars--600 percent. 
I ask you, how do these young pages, some of whom hopefully have dreams and aspirations of standing where I am right now--hopefully, a number of you have that aspiration--how do they get started. 
When I started to get involved in public office, I had to raise the awful sum of $150,000 to make the race credible, $250,000 to be in the game, and $350,000 to win in little old Delaware. 
Today, somebody who wants to beat an incumbent, me or Bill Roth, they better be able to raise a minimum of $2 million. But guess what? We only have 700,000 people in my whole State. But you know why they need so much money in Delaware? The reason is, we are in the fourth most expensive media market in the country. And as everybody knows, just to get to the point where 60 percent of the people in your State know enough about you to make a judgment whether they should vote for you or not, costs a lot of money. Just to get to know you--nothing else, not even to get to the point where they have any idea what your views are. Just to get to the point you are known. You know what it costs, I say to my friends who are from States much bigger than mine but in places where it is a lot cheaper to buy television? You know what it costs to air one 30-second ad at a good time on Philadelphia television on one of the network stations? It is $30,000 for 30 seconds.

Mr. BIDEN. I do not have a TV station. I believe we are the only State in the Nation that does not have its own commercial television station. That is not because we are good, bad, or indifferent. It is because it would make no economic sense. I live within 22 miles of the antennae of every one of the major stations--every one of the major networks in America. They are located in Philadelphia. I live in Delaware. 
And so what happens when I buy an ad or my opponent buys an ad on television? For every 100 people who see the ad, 96 of them live in New Jersey, Maryland, or Pennsylvania and are unable to vote for or against me. But I have to pay for them all. Now I am not complaining because I have an advantage. I am an incumbent. It is an advantage and a disadvantage. The disadvantage is that you are an incumbent. People do not like incumbents. The advantage is that people know your name. 
If you are an unknown person running, like I was the first time, how do you get to the point where even enough people know your name--unless you have a lot of money? And, my goodness, what it must be in the State of Michigan or Pennsylvania or South Carolina. Nevada is a little bigger now, but when I got here we were bigger than Nevada. Those States are bigger in population than Delaware. 
I can speak knowledgeably only about one of our colleagues who did not run the last time. I will not mention his name. I know why he did not run. He would have won, and most people say he would have won. The State he happened to represent required him to raise at least, he thought, $12 million. He did not want to do that anymore--did not want to do that. 
Look, the way we can raise the money is we can raise it at $1,000 a shot. That is the most we can raise from an individual. How many phone calls--from non-Federal property--do you make to be able to raise, in $1,000 increments, $12 million? That is a lot of money. 
But guess what that does now? It means that you have to go from a circle of people who you know--and you know you do not have to worry about their backgrounds, their circumstances, where they came from, what their objectives were--to the universe. 
And, I want to tell you there is not a single U.S. Senator, myself included, who, I believe, could vouch for the character or motive or motivation of all the people who contributed to them unless they have the FBI working for them. We would have to spend more money than we raise to do background checks. 
You know what I always think of, I say to my friend from South Carolina? I think of the guy who was probably more chaste than Caesar's wife, Jimmy Carter. I will never forget when he was running for President. He showed up at a fundraiser, and there was a guy named John Gacy--remember him, the mass murderer? Seriously, I am not joking. This literally happened. Gacy walks in and he contributes to Carter. And he is standing between Rosalynn Carter and Jimmy Carter. Then, later, we find out that the guy is a mass murderer. I say that not just because it is kind of humorous and we all laugh about it. But, I say that because there is no way, no matter how thorough you are as a candidate, that you can know about all your contributors. And I would have thought by now that we would all be worried about how it reflects on our reputation if a contributor turns out to be somebody that should not have contributed. 
For example, recently there was a name of somebody who was an unsavory contributor, as it turned out, in the newspaper. It was a Chinese man. One of my guys said, `My God, we have a man by that name that contributed to you,' and I said, Oh, my God, find out who this guy is. It is a name that is a relatively common Chinese name, I found out later, like Smith or Jones. Guess what? It turns out the guy with that name who contributed to me was a librarian with the Library of Congress. I will never forget sitting in my seat going, Oh, thank God, thank God. Because, really and truly, what would have happened if it turned out to be the guy everybody was writing about? If I were up for election I would have to spend $100,000 in television ads to prove I did not know the guy. 
Now, maybe we are counting on the people being so cynical that they will not hold anybody accountable for this. But I just think for pure self-preservation--not self-preservation of our jobs, self-preservation of our reputations and our integrity--that we would very much like the system to change. 
I might add, you know how they kid around here. We joke when we have colleagues who announce they are not running again and they have been here for some time. We always joke and say things like, Well, now you will be able to tell them what you think. There was a guy that my friend from South Carolina knows well, and I will never forget him. Remember Steve Young--Senator Young from Ohio? Senator Young had been out of office about 2 or 4 years, but he was a guy I think who was widowed at that time, a man in his eighties, if I am not mistaken. And, he hung around here. He did not lobby anybody but he hung around, in the gym, in the dining room. 
You may remember this story, Senator Hollings, and I apologize for being so personal. But, the reason I am telling these stories is I want to communicate to the American people who are listening in real personal terms how this system works. I will never forget the effort of the distinguished Senator from South Carolina who took me under his wing when my first wife was killed in an automobile accident. When I got remarried and wanted to introduce my new wife, Jill, to the people, he had a reception for me up in the famous caucus room and everyone from the Vice President, President, the Supreme Court, really laid it out to welcome my wife. And, I might add, as they say, a point of personal privilege, I still appreciate that. 
I will never forget there was a reception line and, Senator Hollings, you introduced me to people. Later in the night the reception line was still going on but you were having to entertain some of the people you brought along. Old Steve Young came in the line, Senator Young was being nice, welcoming people who were coming in. This is a true story. And, a guy walked up to Senator Young--he was to my left--put out his hand, and said, `Senator, I bet you don't know my name.' I can't quote what Senator Young said exactly because I am on the Senate floor and it would be inappropriate, but Senator Young turned to me and said, `Joe, will you tell this horse's tail his name? He has forgotten it.' 
All of us would like to say that once in a while. So we joke and we say when someone leaves this place, Well, guess you will be able to tell them what you think now. The implication in that comment is that how nice would it be if you were totally unfettered, even indirectly, totally unfettered? I envy, and I mean this sincerely, the women and men in here who have close to unlimited wealth, and I do not begrudge that. I mean that sincerely. I would love nothing better than to be able to run for office and say I do not want anybody's money. I do not want one single penny from anybody, thank you very much, because then I know people would look at me and no one would be able to even think or imply that anything I did was because of anything anybody contributed to me. 
I do not know why there is not a stronger instinct on this floor for that notion of not having to be beholden to any contributors--and more support for public funding. We may never get to the point where we even get television time made available 
to challengers. We may never get to the point, and I am a distinct minority, where we have public financing, so the taxpayers are deciding whether they in fact, support a candidate. But, at least we could get to the point, if we have the Senator's amendment, where we could limit the amount of money in the process for everybody across the board, for everybody. Boy oh boy, do you not think it would be nice not to have to go out and do all those fundraisers? 
Let me say what our friend from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, says. The danger in having this kind of discussion is that we imply that the 99 percent of the honorable people who contribute to us are somehow motivated by a bad reason. The vast majority of people who contribute to both political parties are people who contribute because it is their way of participating in the system and they want to promote the person whose ideas they agree with. That sounds naive to say after all these years, but it is true. I understand why the public does not believe any of it. I understand why the public does not believe any of that. 
I will conclude, Mr. President, because I see there are others here who wish to speak. I will never forget thinking as a young man when I arrived here that the best thing to do, and I still think it is, is to bring everything out in the cold light of day. That is why I have spent time explaining how the system works. I am often reminded of that phrase, that saying, that comment attributed to Bismarck in Germany. Bismarck allegedly said there are two things you should never watch being made. One is sausage and the other is legislation. I would amend that slightly. Once the American people got a chance to see exactly how this worked, with all the disclosures which I think are necessary and good in the long run, I think the thing that suffered was our collective integrity--our collective integrity. 
To the average person like my dad, anybody who was able to contribute $1,000 to a public official for a campaign must be doing it for a reason, and maybe is not so altruistic. 
So, what does it say now that they pick up the paper and realize that individuals and corporations and unions and anybody else can contribute $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $100,000, $1 million? Why do we expect them to say, `Well, it must be nobly motivated, it is not for selfish reasons.' In many cases it probably is totally nobly motivated. 
Mr. President, I think that the single most important thing that has to be done from a purely practical sense is to amend the Constitution and give us the right to limit the amount of money that candidates are able to spend. I lay you 8 to 5 that if you ask every Senator to stand up and say whether or not they thought too much money was being spent in public elections, 90 out of 100 would say yes. I bet that if you asked them, do you think we should limit the amount of money that is spent, at least 70 would say yes. 
But if you asked them, `Will you or your party lose political advantage if you do that?' they may change their views. The truth is that it is not just the Republicans who don't want this reform; it is some Democrats, too. And, the truth of the matter is, if we do what you and I, Senator Hollings, talked about a long time ago--essentially make it available for everybody to have the same amount of money, either by establishing a limit so that everybody would be able to be equal, or by providing public funding--every one of us would have a race every time. None of us like having those races.

Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator. I must tell you that there is a piece of me that says keep the system the way it is, because it is awful hard to beat me the way the system is. There is a Senator we used to know who was very powerful here. I would say, `Senator, how in the Lord's name did you get that person to contribute to me?' He said he told them, `It's not so much what Biden can do for you; it's what Biden can do to you.' 
The truth of the matter is, if you are here and you have gained seniority and you are in a good position--better in the majority than the minority--it is a lot easier for you to stay if you are challenged. So I have to admit to you that I know if I ever prevail in making sure everybody running has the same amount of money, or by practically making it low enough so everybody could raise the same amount of money--I might say, `Oh, my God, what have I done?' But it is the right thing to do. I don't have a lot of hope that we can do it. 
I thought when I got here in the midst of Watergate that maybe that episode would shock us into doing something serious--and we did it, until the Supreme Court overruled it. I hope we take advantage of the current situation and have the courage to act at a time when the spotlight is going to be on not only potentially illegal, but clearly unseemly, aspects of how these funds are raised. 
I want to make it clear that I am not suggesting that I am any better or worse than anybody else in this body. I am merely suggesting that we should change, for our own safety's sake and for our reputations, the way we do it now. I don't know how to really do it unless you first have the authority under the Constitution to be able to do it. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, each of us--not just those of us here in the Senate, but virtually every American--can remember someone; a teacher, a coach, a principal, who made a singular contribution to our lives during our school days. Someone who helped to show us the way as we passed through adolescence and into adulthood. Someone who was a role model, a mentor, a confidante, a friend. 
For more than forty years, Father Robert Kenney has been such an individual in the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, of young men who have attended Salesianum School in Wilmington, Delaware. As a teacher of mathematics, he prepared them for college and careers; as Athletic Director and baseball coach for 34 years, he molded the skills and the characters of young athletes, teaching lessons on the ball-field which would remain with his players throughout their adult lives. As Salesianum's principal, and later president, he maintained and broadened the school's fine reputation for building young men of character, young men whose sense of integrity, honor, compassion, and civic-mindedness were as great as their knowledge of mathematics, history, or literature. Today, Salesianum graduates can be found among the leaders in business and industry, education and the law, public service and community affairs can be found not only throughout Delaware, but across the Nation as well. A great many of them trace their leadership skills, in addition to their academic knowledge, to Father Kenney and the atmosphere he maintained at Salesianum School. 
Father Kenney has been more than teacher and coach, more than principal and president, even more than mentor to scores of young men. He is a major part of the beautiful and rich history of Salesianum and the contributions that the school has made to our city, our State, and the lives of so many of us. He is, quite simply, one of the heroes of our time in the State of Delaware. 
The high school I attended, Archmere Academy, is one of Salesianum's great rivals on the athletic field. There were a number of spring afternoons when I looked across the baseball diamond and hoped fervently that this would be the game when we would finally beat Father Kenney's well-coached and talented team. It never happened. Father Kenney would always figure out a way to squeeze out a win against the Archers. Often, it wasn't close. 
But as much of a rivalry as existed between the two schools, Father Kenney was someone I respected immensely, for his character as a man and as an educator was legendary. During my years in public service, as I have witnessed on an even greater scale Father Kenney's contribution to our community, my admiration has only deepened. 
This June, Father Kenney will be stepping down as Salesianum's president, though he will remain involved in the life of the school and the community. He calls Salesianum `my life's work,' and intends to continue to work with the school, its alumni association, and the people of our community. He probably knows this, but even if his ties to school and community weren't so strong, we wouldn't let him cease to be involved. 
As Salesianum's baseball coach, Father Kenney and his teams compiled a record of 411 wins against only 168 losses, for a winning percentage of .710. It is an impressive record, but I can tell you that his winning percentage in developing young men of great character is even more impressive. 
On behalf of our fellow Delawareans, I wish Father Kenney the best for his newest venture. Yet I promise you, Father Kenney, Delawareans are going to keep you busy.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I will deliver the first in a series of statements on the theme of NATO enlargement. In the next 4 months leading up to the Madrid Summit in July, I will examine the rationale for NATO's admitting new members, which countries appear to be leading candidates for admittance to the alliance, how NATO and Russia can define a new relationship, the responsibilities of our European allies in the process, and how to share the costs of enlargement fairly. 
Mr. President, as many of our colleagues are aware, the distinguished foreign Minister of the Republic of Hungary, Laszlo Kovacs is in Washington this week for a series of meetings. I would like to take the occasion of the foreign Minister's visit to note the progress that Hungary has made toward meeting the criteria for membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and to thank his government for the assistance it has provided to our forces involved in the Bosnia mission. 
Mr. President, the foreign Ministers from the 16 NATO members will meet in Madrid in early July to decide which Central European democracies should be invited to begin accession negotiations with the Alliance. 
In the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996, Congress named Hungary--along with Poland, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic--as a leading candidate for NATO membership and, therefore, eligible for transition assistance. I plan to travel to the region over the Easter recess to assess the progress that these countries have made toward meeting the criteria set out in the NATO enlargement study. Today, however, I can already point to several things that indicate to me that Hungary is well on its way toward assuming the responsibilities of NATO membership. 
The first is the successful effort by Hungary to conclude bilateral treaties with its neighbors, Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine. Students of Central European history know how truly important these treaties are for the security of the region. Many had predicted that the end of the cold war would bring with it a resurrection of Hungary's territorial claims against its neighbors, and they predicted an era of instability that would make us wish the cold war had never ended. 
Events, and the concerted effort of the Hungarian Government, have proven the pessimists wrong. First, Hungary has succeeded in establishing a stable, open democracy that has allowed the Hungarian people to enjoy the fruits of political and economic freedom. 
Equally important, Hungary has recognized that its security and prosperity are dependent upon a resolution of the territorial claims that poisoned relations with its neighbors in the decades after World War I. 
For those of my colleagues who have asked: `Why should NATO admit new members?' I ask you to look closely at the Hungarian example. One of the criteria for new members of NATO is that they must resolve all territorial disputes with their neighbors. 
Just as common membership in NATO has allowed France and Germany to overcome the enmity and territorial disputes that had resulted in three wars in 80 years, so too has the prospect of NATO membership led to reconciliation in Central Europe. The Hungarian Government is to be commended for its forward-thinking policies that recognize that cooperation is the key to stability in Europe in the 21st century. I particularly want to recognize the political courage of Hungarian Prime Minister Horn in disregarding the criticism of ultranationalists in his country and signing these treaties. 
In exchange for renouncing territorial claims, Hungary has secured pledges that its neighbors will respect the rights of the large ethnic Hungarian communities in those countries. As the European Union also begins to expand its membership eastward, I hope that national boundaries in Central and Eastern Europe will matter less and less, and the free exchange of people, products, and ideas will help ensure peace and prosperity for all. 
Romania and Slovakia are home to the largest Hungarian communities outside Hungary, and ideally we would like to see them join NATO as well. I am pleased by the recent progress made by Romania, which through free and fair elections has peacefully changed its government. The new ruling coalition, incidentally, includes a party representing the interests of the Hungarian minority. 
Slovakia, unfortunately, for the past several years has seemed to be heading in the wrong direction. I must question the commitment of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar to democracy, particularly to minority rights and a free press. 
The treaty with Hungary is a step forward, but if Slovakia is to join the community of Western democracies, it must show that it will not water down its commitments to respect the cultural and linguistic rights of its ethnic Hungarian citizens. 
The other theme I want to focus on today is the cooperation that Hungary has extended to us and our allies in connection with the ongoing peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. An essential part of that mission has been a staging base in Taszar, Hungary, which the Hungarian Government has leased to the U.S. military. It is from that base that we have deployed our forces to Bosnia to prevent a return to Europe's worst fighting since World War II. As former Secretary of Defense Perry has stated, without the cooperation of Hungary, the IFOR and SFOR missions would have been immeasurably more difficult. 
At Taszar 1,200 Hungarian troops are working with 3,200 Americans. This cooperation has allowed Hungarian officers and enlisted men to understand how a NATO military functions and what Hungary must do to allow its forces to operate jointly with those of the NATO countries. By all accounts, the work at Taszar has been a rousing success, both in supporting the IFOR and SFOR missions and in helping the Hungarian military. 
The threat to the security of Europe today no longer comes from an easily identifiable Soviet adversary; it comes from the prospect of instability. It comes from the prospect of future Bosnias. NATO must adapt to this new reality and prepare itself to undertake missions outside the territory of its member states. 
Our experience at Taszar shows that Hungarian membership in NATO will help us and our allies to carry out these new missions and will enable us together to help maintain the security and stability of the continent as a whole. 
Moreover, the Taszar experience shows how NATO enlargement can help reduce costs that we and our allies would face without enlargement. Enlargement will allow us and our allies access to bases like Taszar in times of crisis, and it will allow the central European democracies to rely on others for part of their security, thereby reducing the cost to them of restructuring their militaries. 
Let me reiterate that the prospective new members of NATO must agree to make the financial sacrifice necessary to modernize their militaries. We will, of course, do our fair share to help. In that regard, the 15 percent of the direct enlargement costs that last month's Pentagon cost study envisages the United States will assume seems an equitable proposal. But the prospective new members and the non-U.S. current NATO members must shoulder the largest share of the costs. 
My meeting with Mr. Kovacs today to discuss Hungary's progress toward NATO membership was extremely fruitful, and, as I mentioned earlier, I will visit Budapest later this month to help me ascertain for myself if Hungary is ready to join the Atlantic alliance. 
I commend the Hungarian people on the progress they have made in creating a successful democracy and free-market economy over the past 8 years and for their determination to ensure their security through cooperation with their neighbors and other democracies. 
I hope that Hungary will continue in this direction and will meet the criteria for membership in NATO so that in July it will be in the group of prospective members invited to begin accession negotiations with the alliance. 
I thank the chair and yield the floor. 
I thank my colleague from Alabama for giving me the opportunity to take the floor.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, while on a field trip to a Civil War site in the 1950's, a young African-American boy from Delaware asked his teacher why there was no mention of black soldiers. He learned a cold, hard lesson that day--that even though black soldiers fought and died for their country, they were not honored because of the color of their skin. 
That field trip ignited what would become a 40-year crusade by a Delawarean named Wilson K. Smith. Mr. Smith is a retired Army Sergeant, who was decorated with a Bronze Star and Silver Star during the Vietnam war as a member of the 101st Airborne Division, First Special Forces. In 1957, Sgt. Smith began collecting war stories from black veterans. By 1979, he had tracked down all the African-American Congressional Medal of Honor recipients. In 1989, he began seeking financial pledges and support to build an African-American Medal of Honor monument. 
I am proud to have worked closely with Mr. Smith over the last 5 years to see the realization of his dream. 
Last month, the names of the 85 African-American Medal of Honor recipients were officially recognized in a permanent exhibit at the Pentagon. This exhibit replicates a monument honoring black Medal of Honor recipients now on permanent display at Morgan State University in Baltimore, MD. Mr. Smith was the driving force behind the design and fundraising for this monument. 
This monument will help keep the legacy of the African-American Congressional Medal of Honor recipients alive for generations to come. Never again will young African-American school boys and girls have to wonder why black veterans are not honored for their service and sacrifice to the United States of America. 
The Medal of Honor is the highest award for bravery in military service to our country, but few are aware of the names, faces and stories of heroism of the Medal of Honor recipients. These are truly inspiring Americans, who continue to serve this country by their examples of courage, patriotism, and selfless dedication above and beyond the call of duty. From the Civil War to the World Wars to Vietnam to the Persian Gulf war, they have been the outstanding defenders of liberty, the highest hope of humanity in struggle, and the truest representatives of human strength. A memorial to bring that inspiration to African-Americans and to all of us, is a most worthy endeavor. 
It truly has been my honor and pleasure to have strongly supported Wilson Smith's crusade, along with many other national and State leaders, including former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Colin Powell. Wilson Smith is an outstanding man, Delawarean, U.S. veteran and historian. We all will forever owe him a double debt of gratitude for his service to our country.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, last fall, I had the opportunity to participate in a ribbon cutting ceremony commemorating renovations to the Queen Manor low-income senior citizen complex in Dover, DE. One of the highlights of the ceremony was a poem written and read by Mr. James B. Coker that reminds us that drug abuse is not the answer.

Mr. BIDEN. Last week, President Clinton announced a new addition to our strategy in the fight against drug abuse by young people in America. I applaud the President's effort to focus on teen drug abuse, and believe that it is a good response to a disturbing trend that we cannot ignore. We must harness a moral condemnation of drug use by all segments of our population. 
I commend Mr. Coker for making a difference, and am grateful for his contribution in the fight against drug abuse.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Republican leader as well as the Democratic leader for attempting to hold the vote long enough for me to get here. I voted before in the affirmative on the Graham amendment. We voted on it last year. 
I was one of the speakers at the International Chiefs of Police and Sheriffs Association discussing the juvenile justice bill. I thought I had left in plenty of time from a downtown hotel to get here. But, as Washingtonians will tell you, there is a good deal of road construction going on. I was caught behind the most polite cab driver in Washington. He stopped for everyone, which I was happy to see except for this day. Had I had the cab driver who runs over most people, I would have been up here. I should not say that. I will get letters about that. That was a joke, an attempted joke. 
But I want the Record to show that had I been here, I would have once again voted for the Graham amendment. 
I apologize if I inconvenienced the Senate in any way in attempting to hold it for me to get here. 
I thank my distinguished friend from Rhode Island for yielding.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator Leahy in introducing on behalf of the administration, President Clinton's Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Act, which the President announced last week in Boston. 
Three years ago Congress passed the Biden crime bill into law. Today, the verdict is in--the law is working to reduce adult crime. For example, the projected violent crime rate is the lowest since 1991 and the projected murder rate is the lowest since 1971. 
But we all know that, unlike adult crime, juvenile crime is on the rise. The statistics are all too familiar: Violent juvenile crime increased by 69 percent from 1987 to 1994; from 1983 to 1994 the juvenile homicide rate jumped 169 percent; and just recently, the Center for Disease Control has reported that the United States has the highest rate of childhood homicide, suicide, and firearm related deaths of 26 industrialized countries. We can and must do better than that. 
The President's program is based in large part, on success stories from cities like Boston, MA, which developed a comprehensive community-based strategy to both prevent at-risk youth from becoming criminals and deal harshly with those already in the criminal justice system. 
Boston's Operation Night Light sends probation officers on patrol with police to ensure that youth with criminal records stay out of trouble and to assist in the investigation of new crimes. And Boston's police force has joined with Federal law enforcement to target the illegal gun markets that supply most of the guns to gangs and violent youth. 
The results have been dramatic: Youth homicides have dropped 80 percent citywide; violent crime in public schools dropped 20 percent in just 1 school year; and most impressively--not a single youth died from a firearm homicide during 1996. Now that is a record we could be proud of. 
We are taking the same balanced approach to juvenile crime and drug abuse as we did in the 1994 Crime Act--tough sanctions, certain punishment and protection of vulnerable kids. 
Like the Democratic crime bill I, Along with Senators Daschle, Leahy, and many others introduced earlier this year--S. 15--the President's juvenile crime initiative cracks down on violent juvenile offenders and youth gangs, takes concrete steps toward preventing drug and gun violence, and invests in programs that will get kids off the streets and into supervised programs during the after-school hours when they are most likely to be the victims of gangs and criminals or the customers of drug pushers. 
The Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Act proposes to use Federal law enforcement where its expertise and resources can best contribute to fighting crime and the spread of gangs. The act also seeks assistance for local police and criminal justice systems to help them address matters that we all know are local law enforcement challenges that they handle the best. 
On the Federal level the President's bill: contains tough new Federal penalties applicable to gang activities such as racketeering, witness intimidation, car-jacking, and interstate firearms and drug trafficking; cracks down on juvenile gun use by extending the Brady bill to juveniles and requiring the sale of gun locks; makes juvenile records more accessible to police and educators; and targets abuse of drugs popular among youths by giving the Attorney General emergency rescheduling authority. 
But in recognition that the battle against youth crime and drug abuse is fought primarily in our communities and schools, the President's bill provides over $325 million annually to support State and local governments to: hire additional prosecutors to target gang and youth violence; create special drug and gun courts to handle violent juveniles more effectively; create safe-havens for at-risk youth; initiate systems of graduated sanctions so youth receive certain punishment for their first offense instead of a mere slap on the wrist; and promote use of curfews and put truants back in school where they belong. 
The President also proposes to recraft the Federal Juvenile Justice Office by eliminating bureaucracies, streamlining programs, providing additional flexibility to States and localities, and sharpening the Office's focus on research and development. These are reforms that I have long advocated. 
However, the President's reform proposal reaffirms our commitment to a few core principles that have worked well over the past 23 years--juveniles should not be housed in adult jails or lockups; juveniles in custody should be separated from adult criminals; status offenders should not be incarcerated; and where it exists, the disproportionate confinement of minorities must be addressed. 
With the introduction of this legislation the administration, Senate Republicans, and Senate Democrats have now all made it a priority to address the problem of youth violence. Of course, there are other proven, effective crime control programs that I would like to pursue--such as extending the 100,000 Cops Program to put another 25,000 cops on the beat. I am sure there are initiatives which others would want to push. 
But, instead of trying to pass an omnibus bill--which we all know will be difficult, if not impossible--I think that we should keep our focus on a targetted, specific bill which keeps our focus on the most immediate concern: youth violence and the criminal victimization of youth. 
I look forward to working with the administration and my Republican colleagues to craft responsible legislation that will address the pressing concerns of the American public and be signed into law during this session of Congress.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today, we renew our call for the congress to pass the `law enforcement officers' bill of rights act.' For 6 years, I have been working with Senator McConnell, other Senators, and the Nation's police officers to pass into law a bill protecting the rights of law enforcement officers on the front line of this Nation's fight against violent crime and drug trafficking. 
Before addressing the specifics of this legislation, I want to discuss the reality of law enforcement today. The simple fact is that as Federal, State, and local officials push to expand `community' or `problem-solving' policing we are necessarily requiring police officers to move away from standard procedures and towards more creative approaches. 
Of course, as we encourage creativity, there is always the need to guarantee the highest standards of police conduct. 
Unfortunately, because police department's internal disciplinary procedures vary so widely across the Nation, we are literally moving at cross-purposes. On the one hand, we are calling on police officers to take more creative approaches--which naturally raises the chances of technical violations of department procedures. 
While, on the other hand, we subject police officers to varying, often ad hoc, disciplinary procedures which do make clear what specific conduct is appropriate, nor what will happen should the conduct turn out to be a mistake. 
In fact, the practices that many departments use to guide internal investigations frequently allow police executives to take arbitrary and unfair actions against innocent police officers, while allowing culpable officers to avoid any punishment at all. 
The law enforcement officers' bill of rights is designed to replace the ad hoc nature of many internal police investigations by encouraging States to provide minimum procedural standards to guide such investigations. The standards and protections offered by this bill are modeled on the standards for law enforcement agencies developed by the National Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement. 
As the preface to the commission's standards on internal affairs notes:  
`The internal affairs function is important for the maintenance of professional conduct in a law enforcement agency. The integrity of the agency depends on the personal integrity and discipline of each employee. To a large degree, the pubic image of the agency is determined by the quality of the internal affairs function in responding to allegations of misconduct by the agency or its employees.' 
The specific standards and rights guaranteed by the law enforcement officers bill of rights are designed to improve and enhance the quality of the internal affairs function, including: The right to be informed by a written statement of the charges brought against an officer; The right to be free from undue coercion or harassment during an investigation; and The right to counsel during an investigation. 
The provisions of this bill will take effect at the end of the second full legislative term of each State. After such time, a law enforcement officer whose rights have been abridged may sue in state court for pecuniary and other damages, including full reinstatement. 
Although the bill provides certain procedural rights, it gives States considerable discretion in implementing these safeguards, including the flexibility to provide for summary punishment and emergency suspensions of law enforcement officers. 
It is also important to note what the bill does not do. The bill explicitly provides that the standards and protections governing internal investigations shall not apply to investigations of criminal misconduct by law enforcement officers. As a result, criminal investigations of law enforcement officers would not be affected by this bill. 
Moreover, the protections in this bill do not apply to minor violations of departmental rules or regulations, nor to actions taken on the basis of an officers' employment-related performance. 
I would also like to acknowledge the hard work of several of the Nation's leading law enforcement organizations on this important bill. The real leaders behind this effort--and they have been the leaders since the police officers' bill of rights won passage in the Senate in 1991--are the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, and the National Troopers Coalition. No one should be confused about where the force behind the law enforcement officers bill of rights lies--it lies with these organizations.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the bombings in Atlanta over the past 2 months--the second of which occurred last weekend--have marked the opening of yet another unfortunate new chapter in the escalation of domestic terrorism. 
While the magnitude of these attacks were far less than the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City bombings, they were noteworthy for the pernicious technique this criminal--or criminal organization--used: 
First, the terrorists attracted police, firefighters, and rescue workers to the scene by detonating one bomb, 
And then, with the unmistakable intent to injure the public safety officers responding to the first explosion, detonated a second explosive device in the parking lot outside the location of the first bombing. 
According to the experts, this tactic is one imported from the hotbed of terrorist activity--the Middle East. 
On two occasions last year, follow-on bombs were detonated in Southern Lebanon. One almost killed Israel's northern commander--Maj. Gen. Amiram Levine. 
Then this January, only 6 days before the Atlanta abortion clinic bombing, two bombs were detonated only 10 minutes apart near a bus station in Tel Aviv. Thirteen people were injured, including one police officer who came to the scene in response to the first bomb and was wounded by the second. 
Last month in Atlanta, the first bomb injured no one, but the `follow-on' bomb wounded seven people, including two FBI agents, one ATF agent, and two local firefighters. Experts have stated that many more rescue workers would have been injured had the force of the second blast not been deflected by a car, which just happened to be parked in the right spot. 
Five people were injured by the bomb that exploded in an Atlanta restaurant last Friday, but fortunately, the police found the second bomb and detonated it with a remote-controlled robot. 
Of course, all terrorist acts are horrific. 
But this follow-on bombing tactic is especially henious because the technique is designed to do one thing-- kill the police, firefighters, paramedics, and all the other professionals who unhesitatingly rush to the scene of a bombing to provide aid to the wounded. 
Mark my words: now that this tactic has been employed in Atlanta, covered by the national media, and probably communicated across the country through the Internet, some other devious, sick, individual, somewhere in the United States, will do it again. Mark my words. 
I believe that those who employ tactics aimed exclusively at injuring the police, firefighters, and other public safety officers should be punished above and beyond whatever punishment they would receive for destroying property or causing injury. 
That is why today I am introducing the Police and Rescue Squad Protection Act. 
The bill will increase the punishment for anyone who plants a follow-on bomb with the intent to injure public safety officers. And it clearly states that anyone who detonates, or attempts to detonate one bomb right after another bomb in the same location is acting with the criminal intent to injure law enforcement and emergency medical officials. 
In my view, this legislation will send a strong message that we will not tolerate the grotesque tactics that we've seen in the streets of Tel Aviv, and now, in Atlanta. 
More importantly, this legislation honors those who, without fear or hesitation, put themselves in jeopardy at a time of crisis. 
If this bill deters one terrorist from planting a follow-on bomb and saves the life of one police officer, firefighter, ambulance driver, or paramedic that rushes to the scene of a crime, then it will have been well worth the energy expended to enact it. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I intend to address one of the most important matters that should come before the Senate in the next several weeks: the Chemical Weapons Convention. This convention--negotiated under Presidents Reagan and Bush--would outlaw poison gas weapons. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention represents a significant step forward in our efforts to contend with the greatest immediate threat to our national security--the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention will make it illegal under international and domestic laws for a country to use, develop, produce, transfer, or stockpile chemical weapons. 
The CWC will help protect our citizens from the use of poison gas weapons by terrorist groups. It will benefit our military by requiring other nations to follow our lead and destroy their chemical weapons. It will improve the ability of our intelligence agencies to monitor chemical weapons threats to our Armed Forces and our Nation. The convention has the strong support of the American chemical industry, which was centrally involved in the negotiation of the CWC. It also takes into account all of the protections afforded Americans under our Constitution. 
This is a bipartisan treaty, initiated and negotiated under President Reagan, further negotiated, finalized, and signed under President Bush, and strongly endorsed and submitted for the Senate's advice and consent to ratification by President Clinton. 
The costs of the CWC are small, but its benefits are potentially enormous. 
At present, international law permits the Libyas and the North Koreas of the world to produce limitless quantities of chemical weapons. That will change when the CWC enters into force. 
The CWC will make pariahs out of states that refuse to abide by its provisions. Through the sanctions required by the convention, it will make it more difficult for those pariah states to obtain the precursor chemicals they need to manufacture poison gas. It will create international pressure on these states to sign and ratify the CWC and to abide by its provisions. The CWC will create a standard for good international citizens to meet. It will brand as outlaws those countries that choose to remain outside this regime. 
The entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention will mark a major milestone in our efforts to enlist greater international support for the important American objective of containing and penalizing rogue states that seek to acquire or transfer weapons of mass destruction. 
Ironically, should the Senate fail to give its advice and consent, this milestone will pass with the U.S. On the same side as the rogue states.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I wish to discuss an important decision facing the President this week in the fight against drug trafficking: Whether to certify that Mexico and Colombia have taken sufficient steps in the past year in combating the narcotics trade. The choice is important not merely because it affects our bilateral relations with these countries, but also because it will send a broader signal about our seriousness of purpose in the war on drugs. 
Of course, there will be other nations whose performance on counternarcotics will be assessed by the President this week. But when it comes to the narcotics trade, Mexico and Colombia are in a league by themselves--Colombia, as the leading source country for cocaine, and a major source of heroin, and Mexico, as the leading transit country for cocaine, and as a significant source for heroin, methamphetamines, and marijuana. And it is because of their predominance in the narcotics trade that the President's decision becomes a barometer of the U.S. commitment to this effort. 
Before discussing my specific views on the Colombian and Mexican cases, however, I want to briefly offer some general observations about the drug certification process. 
Just over 10 years ago, in the 1986 omnibus drug bill, the United States began a process of annually certifying the performance of countries which were either a major source of narcotics, or a major transit route for narcotics trafficking. Decertification does not merely carry a stamp of political disapproval. By law, nations decertified are ineligible for most U.S. foreign aid, and the United States is required to vote against loans for such nations in international financial institutions such as the World Bank. 
The President has three choices: First, he can certify that a country is fully cooperating with the United States, or is taking adequate steps on its own, to combat the narcotics trade. Second, he can decertify a country--a statement that it has not met that standard. Finally, he can provide a national interest waiver--a statement that the country has not met the standards of the law, but that the U.S. national interest lies in continuing the assistance programs. 
Not surprisingly, the nations subject to the scrutiny of the decertification process have not been thrilled with the honor. Indeed, many nations have protested that the United States has no right to challenge their performance on counternarcotics--given that the large demand in this country helps to generate the supply. Other nations perceive the certification process as an effort to shift the blame for our drug problem. 
I firmly reject such arguments. 
First, while I concede that the demand in the United States for narcotics has contributed to the explosive growth of the drug trade in Latin America in the last two decades, the dramatic increase in the power of the narcotics cartels--particularly in Colombia and Mexico--cannot be blamed upon the United States alone. The nations themselves must bear responsibility for their own neglect--for failing to take effective action against vast criminal enterprises which arose before their eyes. 
Of course, the United States must do its part to combat the drug problem. Over the past decade, we have. For example, we have steadily increased both our financial resources and our political commitment to combating the narcotics trade. We now spend $16 billion annually on our national drug program, as compared to $4.7 billion a decade ago. We have devised a national strategy, written by a drug czar who coordinates national policy from the White House. We have increased sentences at the Federal level for narcotics traffickers. We have strengthened controls on money laundering and the trade in precursor chemicals. There is more to be done. But by any objective measure, the United States continues to do its part. 
Second, I strongly disagree with the suggestion that the United States has no business assessing the performance of other nations in the drug war. The decision by the United States to maintain a partnership with another government--any government--must be based on an assessment of whether the cooperation between the two sides advances American interests. This is hardly a radical concept; rather, it is the daily practice of diplomacy. 
The people of the United States should expect nothing less. How else can we justify providing the full benefits of partnership--including foreign assistance and special trade preferences--unless we are satisfied that the other nation is doing its part on issues of great concern to us? 
After a decade of experience with the certification law, we can reach a conclusion about its utility--and whether it is worth preserving. I believe a strong case can be made that it should be. 
In the first few years after enactment of the law, the certification process, it is fair to say, was less than effective. It was the custom of the Reagan and Bush administrations to only decertify those nations with which our relations were already badly damaged. In other words, the primary focus was not on narcotics performance but on geopolitics. 
Thus, in the late 1980's, the nations regularly decertified were Syria and Iran--both on the list of state sponsors of terrorism; Afghanistan, then a satellite of the Soviet Union; and Panama, then under the control of General Noriega. In the Bush administration, after the U.S invasion ousted Noriega, Panama again was certified, and the nation of Burma--by then under the control of despotic generals--was added to this list of usual suspects. But not once did either President Reagan or Bush decertify a democratic ally. 
The message of this action was clear: Maintaining normal diplomatic relations took precedence over our anti-narcotics interests. As a result, most nations that were major drug trafficking centers came to expect that certification would be the norm--and that for all the talk and supposed pressure from Washington, they would not pay a price if they failed to meet our expectations. 
Under President Clinton, that approach has changed for the better--and for that change much credit must go not only to the President, but also to the previous Secretary of State, Warren Christopher. Most significantly, last year President Clinton decertified Colombia--a democratic nation which had, for much of the 1990's, been a close partner in the war on drugs. But when it became clear that the President of Colombia had taken campaign contributions from drug dealers--a matter that I will discuss shortly--and that his government lacked the political will to confront the drug trade, President Clinton stated plainly that Colombia had not met the standard of the law. 
That decision has profound implications elsewhere. Nations everywhere took notice--and are now on notice that the United States would make its decision on certification based on the standards of the law, not on the dictates of diplomacy. That, in turn, has greatly empowered the State Department and the law enforcement agencies--which now have greater leverage in holding our foreign partners to their counternarcotics commitments. 
In sum, because of the `truth-in-certification' which we now practice, I believe that the process has become a useful tool in our ongoing effort to procure the assistance of other nations in the war on drugs. Any effort to repeal the law or alter it significantly would be misguided. 
That is not to say the law is perfect--few laws are. During consideration of the foreign assistance legislation in the Foreign Relations Committee, I will be open to exploring ways of improving the certification process--to assure that the law advances 
our common objective: of ensuring that all nations join us in fighting the scourge of drugs. 
But that question is for another day. Today our primary attention must be devoted to the issue at hand: whether to certify that Colombia and Mexico have met the standard of the law. I renew my call--which I also made last year--to decertify Colombia and to not fully certify Mexico, but instead grant a national interest waiver. 
As has been widely reported, credible evidence suggests that Colombian President Ernesto Samper accepted millions of dollars in campaign contributions from the Cali cartel during the 1994 Presidential campaign. An investigation by the Colombian Congress--an investigation which our State Department has described as a `patently flawed process'--absolved Samper. But the conclusion of the Congress is not surprising, because many members of that body are also under investigation for accepting bribes from the cartel. 
President Samper might have overcome the stain of these allegations by taking concrete action to combat the drug trade. In fact, Samper had pledged such action in a letter to many members of this body in July 1994. But Samper's pledge proved to be, in large part, an empty gesture. 
For example, long-promised reform of the sentencing system--which provides inadequate penalties for drug trafficking--has not been enacted, although the Colombian Congress is just now taking up the issue. The inadequacy of the current system was amply demonstrated last month, when two noted leaders of the Cali cartel were sentenced to relatively light sentences--10 1/2 years in one case, 9 years in another. They were fined just $2 million. None of their assets were forfeited. Under the sentencing system in effect, the actual time served may be reduced by half. Worse still, the evidence is strong that they continue to operate their empires from prison--operations which the Colombian Government has done little to prevent. 
Other measures, such as reconsideration of extradition or strengthening the Colombian money laundering statute, might have permitted the certification of Colombia. But extradition is not on the table; and the money laundering statute is only now being considered in a special session--a transparent last-ditch effort to head off decertification. 
I say all this in full knowledge that there are thousands of dedicated officials in the Colombian National Police, and millions of ordinary Colombian citizens, who abhor the destructive nature of the drug trade on their own society, and are fully committed to combating it. I admire their courage and determination to fight on, despite the dangers of confronting the drug lords, who have no respect for human life. 
But how can we be assured of the Government's commitment against drug trafficking when the President of the country himself almost surely benefited from the drug trade? 
This must be an essential consideration in any certification decision: whether there exists corruption at high levels of government. We cannot demand perfection in implementation of policy. We cannot impose impossibly high burdens. But we can demand that the highest levels of government remain free from suspicion. 
Colombia has failed that test. Stated plainly, the corruption at the top in Bogota is the single most glaring failure in Colombia's performance--and the overriding reason that I recommend decertification. 
Mr. President, there is no joy in this conclusion. But we cannot overlook the corruption involving President Samper and the Congress, and we cannot avoid the conclusion that Colombia has not done enough to combat the drug trade. 
The story for Mexico is different than Colombia's. The key difference is the 
commitment of the President of Mexico, who I believe is steadfast in his determination to root out corruption in the Mexican police system. Unfortunately, his personal commitment has, thus far, been insufficient to cleanse a police system that is rotten to the core. 
The examples of police corruption in Mexico abound. The most troubling example was revealed just last week. A veteran general of the Mexican Army, a man hired just 3 months ago to head Mexico's antinarcotics agency--precisely because he was believed to be incorruptible--was fired after being accused of taking payments from one of Mexico's leading drug barons. 
The arrest of General Gutierrez raises several important questions about the United States-Mexican relationship in fighting the drug war. First, why did Mexico fail to alert us when it first suspected General Gutierrez some 2 weeks before his arrest? As a consequence, how much intelligence did the United States share in that 2-week period with Mexico that has now been compromised? Additionally, why did our intelligence assets fail to learn that the general had been placed under investigation? Finally, will we be able, in the short term, to continue cooperative law enforcement efforts--or will we have to step back and reassess the level and scope of our joint programs? 
Mr. President, we must have answers to these questions--both from our Government and from the Mexican Government. 
But until we get those answers, and until we see follow through by the Mexican Government on certain promises, I do not believe that we should certify that Mexico has provided full cooperation in the war on drugs. Instead, however, I do believe that the President would be justified in granting Mexico a vital national interest waiver. That decision--less than full certification--would send a strong political signal to the Mexican Government that its performance last year was inadequate, without causing a total disruption in our joint efforts. 
In making this recommendation, I should note that Mexico has made some progress in its effort to combat the narcotics trade. Last year, at our urging, it enacted several important anticrime laws--an organized crime law, a money laundering statute, and a chemical diversion statute. It has agreed to extradite, under exceptional circumstances, Mexican nationals. It has agreed to set up organized crime task forces in key locations in northern and western Mexico. 
All this is important. But, as the saying goes, the proof is in the pudding. We have seen only a handful of extraditions. We await implementation of the new anticrime laws. And we await full funding and adequate support for the task forces. 
Most important, we must see institutional changes to root out corruption--for that remains the largest obstacle to combating the drug cartels. All the laws, all the promises, all the task forces will be insufficient if Mexico cannot rectify the systemic corruption in its law enforcement agencies. Mexico's efforts to confront corruption, ultimately, will be the test of whether it is serious in combating the narcotics trade. 
Let me reiterate that I believe that, in contrast to the case of Colombia, Mexico has a President who is on our side. President Zedillo has demonstrated great courage in advancing an agenda of institutional reform and in trying to weed out corrupt actors in his government. We must stand with him in this effort. But we must also be honest about the situation as we now see it --and honesty compels the conclusion that Mexico should not be fully certified. 
But I do not believe that we should take the step of decertifying Mexico. President Zedillo's demonstrated leadership amid the growing drug threat is the fundamental reason I propose a national interest waiver for Mexico. A full decertification of Mexico could have long-lasting, damaging repercussions that we cannot now predict. At a minimum, it could inhibit the political space that President Zedillo 
has to press forward with his agenda of reform. And if we destroy the President's political ability resolve to combat the drug traffickers, we will have achieved nothing--and we may well lose the gains that we have recently achieved. 
Even as I recommend decertification for Colombia, and a national interest waiver for Mexico, I should emphasize that this issue can--under the law--be revisited during the coming year as to Colombia. The law permits the President to provide a national interest waiver during the course of the year provided there has been a fundamental change in government, or a fundamental change in the conditions that led to not providing a full certification in the first instance. 
In this regard, I encourage the Clinton Administration to spell out benchmarks for Colombia to achieve in the coming months --benchmarks that, if achieved, would permit the President to move forward with a national interest waiver. 
Mr. President, I do not underestimate the difficulties facing Colombia and Mexico in combating the power of the drug barons. But the difficulty of the challenge cannot be an excuse for insufficient action. Given the massive scourge of drugs confronting us, we must continue to raise the level of expectations and attention given to the drug trade by our southern neighbors. This is what the certification process calls for, and this is what our nation must do.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of our colleague, Congressman Richardson, to become our Ambassador to the United Nations. 
Mr. President, I will very shortly yield back the remainder of the time. I understand I have 15 minutes under my control. 
Mr. President, I take this opportunity to thank the chairman, Senator Helms, for his willingness to bring this important nomination to the floor so expeditiously. 
I join Chairman Helms in endorsing the nomination of Representative Bill Richardson to be the Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations, with rank of Ambassador. 
I commend President Clinton for having nominated him, and I strongly urge my colleagues here today to vote to confirm this distinguished Member of Congress who already has a long list of diplomatic accomplishments to his name. 
Congressman Richardson has ably represented the Third District of New Mexico for 14 years, but it is his experience in successfully negotiating the release of Americans and others in some of the world's least hospitable locales that has brought his formidable diplomatic skills to light. This diplomatic experience will serve him well at the United Nations as he seeks to advance American interests in contacts with 185 other nations. 
Likewise, Congressman Richardson's personal background and political experience have prepared him well to represent the United States in the world body. 
Bill Richardson was born in California and grew up in Mexico City. He attended high school in Boston and remained there to attend Tufts University, where he earned a bachelor's degree and a Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy. 
Bill Richardson then came to Washington, working in the Legislative Affairs Office at the State Department and as a staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where, like his predecessor, Secretary of State Albright, he gained an appreciation for the role of the Senate in helping craft American foreign policy. 
In 1978, Bill Richardson moved to Santa Fe, and in 1982 he won election to this first term as a Member of Congress. His vast district has been described by one writer as a `mini-U.N.,' with a diverse population that is 35 percent Hispanic and 25 percent Native American, including members of 28 different tribes. 
As a Congressman, he served on the Intelligence Committee and was a fervent advocate of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Bill Richardson has engaged in successful diplomacy with some of the world's most recalcitrant regimes and rebels. His humanitarian concern for individuals and his commitment to advance this country's interests have led him to countries like North Korea, Cuba, Iraq, Serbia, Nigeria, Burma, Haiti, and Sudan. My colleagues will recall that he negotiated the release of an American helicopter pilot in North Korea, three Red Cross workers in Sudan, and two Americans imprisoned in Iraq.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Congressman Richardson reminded us that while U.N. reform is important, we must never lose sight of the fundamental value of the United Nations for our national interests. We rely on the United Nations to provide humanitarian assistance to millions who otherwise would have no source of food or shelter. We rely on the United Nations to eradicate disease and improve health. We rely on the United Nations to prevent nuclear proliferation. We rely on the U.N. to facilitate and maintain peace. The United Nations allows us to combine our resources with those of others to bring about outcomes that are in our national interest. 
We must pursue reform, but we should not use reform as a stalking horse to undermine the United Nations' ability to carry out tasks that serve our fundamental interests. 
We must maintain our leadership in the United Nations. Doing so entails meeting our commitments to the United Nations; specifically, it means paying our back dues. We cannot expect others to fulfill their international obligations if we do not fulfill our own. 
The President's request for a $921 million supplemental appropriation. to be disbursed 2 years from now, is a good place to begin a bipartisan effort to pay off our debt and encourage meaningful U.N. reform. 
Mr. President, I look forward to working with Congressman Richardson over the next 4 years to ensure that the United States continues to play a leading role at the United Nations so that the United Nations continues to work in America's interests. 
Let me just suggest that I think since I have been here--and it has been 24 years--we have not had anyone who by temperament, experience, background, and education is any more qualified to be our Ambassador to the United Nations than Ambassador Richardson. We, all of us who have served here, at least for 2 years or more, have come to know him personally or have become acquainted with his incredible record of special missions, where he has not gone off on his own but gone off under the aegis and umbrella, at least, and being told by informing administrations what he has been doing, and the remarkable negotiations that he has undertaken with such remarkable results. 
The reason I mention that is not that that qualifies a man or woman to be the Ambassador to the United Nations in and of itself, but it indicates that this is a man who understands how to assess his opposition's interests and how to try to meet that interest without yielding on any principle that is important to this country. I think Madeleine Albright did that job well, as others have, and I think that Bill will do it equally as well. 
I also think that he goes there equipped with a firsthand knowledge of the concerns expressed by the chairman of the committee, the Senator from North Carolina, and our distinguished colleague from New Hampshire, who just spoke. This is not something he has to divine or guess about. This is not just in terms of our arrearages. Our involvement with the United Nations--and the future relationship the United States will have with the United Nations--is something that he is personally aware of, in terms of the intensity, the extent to which the concern exists, and the detail of the concern as emanated from the U.S. Congress, both in the House and the Senate. 
So, he is a man who will arrive on the scene fully aware of both sides of this equation. He is not just a very gifted academic or diplomat who will serve us there. He is not someone who has just learned academically of the concern of the Congress and the simple, basic, legitimate political concerns that we have. I don't mean partisan political, I mean political in the sense that we have to answer to our constituencies as to what we are going to do about paying arrearages, if we pay arrearages, and how we pay them. And I think that is a particularly useful background for a man to have at this moment, going to that job. 
He is, as I said, academically qualified. He is qualified by temperament. He is qualified by experience. And he is qualified, uniquely qualified in what is probably the single most significant issue that has faced our relations with the United Nations, probably since the United Nations has come into existence. That is: What is the relationship and role of the President's authority to make commitments relative to the use of American dollars and forces in other parts of the world, and how does that interrelate with the Congress and the Senate, in particular, and how and under what circumstances should we be making up our arrearages and looking out for our longer term interests at the United Nations? 
So for those reasons and many others which I have not mentioned here today, I think Bill Richardson is the right man for the job at this moment, although I suspect he would be qualified for the job at any moment. But I think he is particularly qualified to take over this job at this time.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I join with my longtime colleague in this endeavor, Senator Boxer, to restate our continuing opposition to legislation changing the current dolphin-safe standard. As usual, she has explained the issue much better than I could, so my remarks will be brief. 
Throughout the 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's, hundreds of thousands of dolphins were senselessly killed every year because of the use of gigantic purse seine fishing nets. Our efforts to require that each nation wishing to export tuna to the United States document that it possessed a dolphin protection program and a dolphin mortality rate comparable to ours largely failed, resulting in unilateral embargoes against noncomplying nations. 
The senseless slaughter of dolphin justifiably outraged many Americans. Literally tens of thousands of letters, telegrams, and phone calls poured into tuna companies' offices and Capitol Hill. The message heard was loud and clear: Don't allow this needless massacre to continue. 
Then, in 1990, something remarkable happened. American tuna companies, environmentalists, and consumers came together and revolutionized an entire industry. That April, Starkist, and shortly after that Chicken of the Sea, and Bumblebee--which combined sold more than 80 percent of the tuna in America--announced voluntary purchasing bans against all tuna caught in association with dolphins. 
On the heels of this campaign, then-Congresswoman Boxer and I wrote and shepherded into law the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act--a landmark statute that set one very simple, uniform standard: No tuna caught by purse seine net fishing, or by a boat capable of purse seine net fishing, can be labeled as dolphin-safe. 
Our labeling law immediately transformed the decades-long controversy. Dolphin mortalities caused by both American and foreign tuna boats plummeted from more than 52,000 in 1990, to just under 3,000 in 1995. A tremendous decrease. 
Millions of consumers now purchase tuna with a clear conscience, knowing that the deadly purse seine net method was not used. 
Simply put, the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act remains a remarkable success story. It does not mandate anything. It does not require thousands of bureaucrats. It merely requires accurate, truthful labeling. 
From the nutritional information printed on boxes of cereal, to salt content listings on low-sodium crackers, honesty in labeling is a well-established principle of law. 
This does not necessarily mean that all types of a given product must conform to the requirements of a particular labeling law. All milk is not required to contain 2 percent milkfat, for example. But, if a dairy company wishes to label its product as 2 percent milkfat, it must meet that standard. In essence that is the concept underlying the current dolphin safe standard. 
Unfortunately, legislation (S. 39) introduced recently by Senator Stevens and Senator Breaux changes the criteria for the current label, thereby eliminating the protection and honesty now provided. While the proposed no-mortalities requirement sounds good on its face, it is for all practical purposes unworkable and unenforceable. One observer, equipped with a pair of binoculars, can hardly keep accurate watch over the entire contents of a 1 to 2 mile long, half-mile wide net, submerged hundreds of feet below water. 
I recognize the potential significance and power of the October 1995 Panama Declaration, and I agree that our unilateral embargoes deserve a serious reexamination. In fact, legislation I and Senator Boxer introduced during the 104th Congress would have implemented key parts of the declaration by repealing the current comparability embargoes and opening our market--literally the most lucrative in the world--to all tuna caught in compliance with the current dolphin-safe standard. 
But market access issues, questions of whether to allow dolphin-safe and other tuna into our market, are separate from the reasoning behind the current label. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in the administration to lock-in the progress we have made. And I commend Senator Boxer for her diligent efforts to protect our environment while preserving our principles.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, for the third consecutive Congress, I am introducing legislation to expand the Federal Government's $150 payment to States when they bury veterans in State-owned veterans cemeteries. 
For those who are not familiar with my proposal, it is quite simple. My bill says that if a State buries a veteran free of charge in a State-owned cemetery--and that veteran is eligible for burial in a national veterans cemetery--the Federal Government will pay the State $150 for the cost of the plot. 
In other words, Mr. President, rather than the multiple and restricted criteria of plot allowance payments to States under current law, there would instead be only one standard in judging whether a State receives assistance from the Federal Government. And, that standard is: Is the veteran eligible for burial in a national cemetery? Period. 
Not only is it simple, it is the only thing that makes sense and the only thing that is fair. When the plot allowance for States was first established a decade ago, Congress did it in part to relieve the pressure on the national cemetery system. Our national cemeteries were filling up rapidly. That trend continues today. More than half of all national cemeteries are closed to additional burials, and there is no where near enough space for all of America's World War II veterans, let alone the veterans from later conflicts. So, rather than undertake the expensive process of building more national cemeteries, we entered into a partnership with the States for the creation of State-owned veterans cemeteries. 
That partnership has worked well, especially in States like Delaware that do not have a national cemetery to begin with. But, after entering into this partnership, the Federal Government then limited for whom it would reimburse States for the cost of the plot. We said that States would receive the $150 payment only if the veteran was receiving disability compensation or a pension; died in a veterans hospital; was indigent and the body was unclaimed; or was discharged from the military due to a disability. 
In other words, we ask States to bury all veterans eligible for burial in a national cemetery--but then we do not financially help them when they do. 
And, States are not even being reimbursed for all wartime veterans that they bury. Let me repeat that. States are not being reimbursed for all wartime veterans that are buried in State-owned veterans cemeteries. I mention that, Mr. President, because some people have characterized this bill as an attempt to provide the plot allowance to States for the burial of nonwartime veterans, and an attempt to give a benefit intended for those who fought in wartime to those who did not. That is simply not the case. 
There are thousands of wartime veterans who do not meet the current law's criteria. In fact, each year, about 5,000 veterans--many of them wartime veterans--are eligible for burial in a national cemetery and are buried without charge in State-owned veterans cemeteries, but do not meet the criteria set forth in current law for the States to receive the plot allowance. That is not fair to the States, and it is not right for America's veterans. 
Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this proposal would cost $1 million per year. While we all want to balance the budget--and this proposal will be paid for--$1 million per year is a relatively small sum in order to fulfill our commitment to America's veterans. 
In 1995, the Senate recognized this in unanimously approving this proposal as an amendment to the budget bill. Whether this bill is voted on separately or as part of another measure, it does not matter. What matters is that we work to ensure that America's veterans are guaranteed a decent and dignified burial. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort.

 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a comprehensive bill I first introduced last summer to make college more affordable for middle-class families. Formally titled the `Growing the Economy for Tomorrow: Assuring Higher Education is Affordable and Dependable' Act, it is known as the Get Ahead Act for short. 
This legislation contains numerous provisions--some of which have been or will be introduced by others as separate bills; other provisions are novel to this bill--but they all have one thing in common. They all are an attempt to renew our commitment to see that the American Dream of a college education remains within reach of all Americans. 
Because, the plain truth is, that dream is slipping out of reach for many middle-class families. When I was in college 30 some years ago, my parents could send me to a State university for less than 5 percent of their income. And, it stayed about that much--college costs went up each year by about the same amount that the average family's income went up--until 1980. And, then, college costs exploded. Since 1980, the cost of public college tuition and fees has increased nearly three times faster than the average family's income. 
We can debate endlessly the reasons why and who or what is to blame. But, all that middle-class families know is that the costs have skyrocketed, and they must constantly worry about how they will ever be able to afford to send their children to college. 
For a long time now, Members on both sides of the aisle have believed that the Federal Government has a role and responsibility in helping Americans get to college. Not to guarantee that everyone in America goes to college, but to guarantee that no one who qualifies for college is turned away just because they cannot afford it. It is important for individual Americans--and it is important for the future of America as a whole. 
But, I think it is legitimate to question that commitment today when costs are rising out of control; when we spend more on loans that have to be repaid and less on grants that do not; and when the tax law rewards investment in machines but not investment in people. 
It is time, Mr. President, to renew and reaffirm our commitment to higher education. And, so, I offer the Get Ahead Act, and I invite my colleagues to join me in this effort.

Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I will yield myself 15 minutes. 
Mr. President, let me begin, while both my senior colleagues are on the floor here, by complimenting Senator Byrd on his ringing endorsement of Madeleine Albright. Senator Helms and I have been around here a long while, 24 years. But that is a short time compared to the senior Senator from West Virginia. We all know that when he stands to take the floor and give his endorsement to a candidate who requires confirmation, probably more than any other Senator on this floor, the Chamber listens. 
Madeleine Albright is a fine candidate, but she is also a lucky candidate today to have such strong support from the Senator from West Virginia, and, as well, she is fortunate to have the Senator from North Carolina as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. I publicly thank him for how gracious he has been and for how he has expedited this nomination. We all know he is a man of very strong convictions, and we all know that when Senator Helms concludes that there is something moving in the Senate too swiftly, or it is something he does not support, he is, along with the Senator from West Virginia, maybe the most effective person on the Republican side of the aisle in slowing things down. 
There was a lot of discussion in the press and a lot of discussion in the Cloakrooms about whether or not Senator Helms was going to cooperate. I am here to tell you that he has not only cooperated, he has expedited it, and he has been, as always, the consummate gentleman in the way in which he has dealt with his colleagues, the new ranking member in particular, but the committee in general and the Senate as a whole. I personally thank him for doing what I never doubted he would do once he concluded he was going to get this on the floor early. I want the record to note that we are moving on one of the two most important Cabinet posts, and we are doing it before anything else has happened in this body. I thank the chairman. 
Mr. President, to state the obvious, I strongly support Madeleine Albright's nomination to become the 65th Secretary of State of the United States of America. Obviously, along with others who have spoken, I commend the President for nominating her. 
There was a friend of ours who doesn't always like having a quote attributed to him, but I must attribute every quote. I never want to make that mistake again. I will not use his name, but I will acknowledge that this is not emanating from me. We had a colleague who served with the Senator from North Carolina and me for some years--and I will tell him the name after I finish--who used to say, `It is great in politics when conscience and convenience cross paths.' 
I would suggest that Madeleine Albright's nomination to be Secretary of State meets that test like none other since I have been here. This is truly a historic occasion. I know we do not and should not think in terms of quotas and affirmative action. But the fact of the matter is this is one of two remaining bastions where the mindset, I think, of a foreign policy establishment, the mindset of the public, the mindset of everyone, is that it is sort of the province of men. And that stereotypical notion is, in large part because of the cooperation of the Senator from North Carolina, about to end today. That does not mean that makes anyone a good Secretary of State or makes her the most qualified person. But that is where the conscience part comes in. It just so happens that the woman we are about to confirm--God willing and the creeks not rising--is also eminently qualified to be Secretary of State. 
I have been here too long to use phrases like `this is the most qualified person.' There are 50 people maybe in America who are qualified to do this job, and there are probably 10 as qualified, but none more qualified than Madeleine Albright. 
One of the things I think that has endeared her and recommended her to Senator Helms and to me, both of us having served on the Foreign Relations Committee for so long, is that we have encountered Madeleine Albright in our official capacities and our personal political lives on a number of other occasions, and we have found her, as professor, as foreign policy adviser, and as a politically active academic, to be extremely incisive, blunt, to the point, and honest with us in her assessments. You have no idea--maybe you do, Mr. President, but the longer you are here it will become even more apparent. I find that the hardest speak to understand is foreign policy speak. And I sometimes used to kid, after years of being the chairman or the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I would say to the witness, `You sound like you are from the State Department.' That means that you get a nonanswer; never a wrong answer, but a nonanswer. Madeleine Albright is very straightforward. And it is a welcome thing. We had that in other Secretaries of State, Democrat and Republican. But it is always nice to know. 
In her 4 years as our Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Albright has ably demonstrated her qualifications to carry American foreign policy into the 21st century. Her personal history, her academic research and writing, her diplomatic experience, and her political acumen make her uniquely qualified to lead this country in working with our friends and allies--and our adversaries, and there are some--to further our national interests and the ideals of freedom and democracy that we espouse as a nation. 
As we all know by now, Ambassador Albright was not born an American. She and her family chose to come to these shores out of a deep appreciation of what America stands for. She was born in Czechoslovakia, which between the two world wars was the only country in Central Europe to share our commitment to freedom and democracy. 
She was twice forced to flee her native land, first in the wake of the Nazi occupation, then 10 years later after a Communist coup. She has seen first-hand the two worst forms of tyranny of this century, and she vividly understands the importance of standing firm against aggressors who seek to subvert freedom. 
The young Madeleine Korbel earned a bachelor's degree from Wellesley College in political science in 1959, worked briefly as a journalist, then married and raised three 
bright, accomplished, and lovely daughters, two of whom I have had the occasion to get to speak with and get to know a little bit better. 
At the same time she was raising her family, she attended graduate school at Columbia University. In 1968, she earned her master's degree and the certificate of the Russian Institute at Columbia. She went on to receive her Ph.D. from Columbia in 1976. 
With her doctorate in hand, she came to Washington to work for one of the finest men ever to serve in this Senate--the late Senator from Maine, Edmund Muskie, who himself went on to become Secretary of State. As his chief legislative assistant, she gained an appreciation for the role of the Senate in helping the President and the Secretary of State craft American foreign policy, experience on which she will draw as we work with her in the years ahead. 
Ambassador Albright left Senator Muskie's staff in 1978 to work for her former professor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, on the staff of President Carter's National Security Council. She then worked at two of the most prestigious think-tanks in Washington--the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars--before becoming a professor at Georgetown University in 1982.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in the 1980's as the Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe were casting off the Soviet yoke, then-Professor Albright conducted research into the attitudes of the people of these countries, and she wrote about the need to assist them in their transition from communism to freedom. 
That is where Senator Helms and I and others on the Foreign Relations Committee got to see her again because she came and testified about that research and the polling data that she conducted. 
Her academic and personal understanding of these issues will allow her to formulate policies to encourage the continued spread of political and economic freedom throughout the world as she attempts to implement this administration's foreign policy. 
At the United Nations, Ambassador Albright successfully advanced and defended American interests and enlisted the support of others for our policies. Her straight talk and tireless commitment won her the admiration of Democrats and Republicans alike. She recognizes that while it is sometimes in America's interest to act alone, always acting alone is ineffective and an unnecessary use of our resources. 
Two weeks ago, Ambassador Albright came before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and outlined a comprehensive framework for American foreign policy into the next century, one in which none of us, I think, is likely to accept wholesale. But that is the way the process is supposed to work.

Mr. BIDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, Ambassador Albright possesses a rare talent for articulating the reasons why events in seemingly far away places matter a great deal to ordinary Americans. 
I was with another member of this administration, Sandy Berger, today and we were talking about it. I said that I had to leave to go and deal with Madeleine Albright's nomination on the floor. And I said, `They seem to like her.' I don't think this is inappropriate to suggest. There is no State secret. He said, `We were at a meeting, and she used the line that I think is great, and it captures what is going on. She said, `It is amazing that the 1 percent of the resources of this Government may very well'--that is approximately what we spend on the whole foreign policy establishment of this Government--` 1 percent of the resources of this Government will probably determine 50 percent of the future of this Nation over the next 6 to 8 years.' 
The reason I bother to mention that as an aside is that one of the things she grasped very well, as all great Secretaries of State have, is in the context in which she is operating, and the context in which the foreign policy it will be her responsibility to promote will be hers. 
Ambassador Albright has made a convincing argument for the United States to remain engaged throughout the world and for this Congress to give the State Department the resources it needs to, as she said, `promote and protect the interests of the American people.' 
I look forward to working with Ambassador Albright to secure an adequate level of funding for her to direct American diplomacy, in order that our Foreign Service officers, our U.S. Information Service officers, and our Agency for International Development workers can be active throughout the world. We need a diplomatic corps that can react quickly and decisively to crises before they escalate and then threaten peace and stability. We cannot afford to keep the State Department so underfunded that diplomats are reduced to making calls from pay phones because our missions are so poorly equipped that even the telephones don't work. 
Mr. President, there is much more to say and much that has been said. I do not want to be the one to slow up the process. Let me conclude by suggesting that I particularly look forward to working with Ambassador Albright in a number of specific areas--the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention before it enters into force April 29, and to negotiate further arms control treaties, including a Start III accord. 
I also look forward to developing a policy in Bosnia that allows us to withdraw our forces by mid-1998 without allowing a relapse into renewed fighting among the various parties there. 
I also am looking forward to encouraging democracy throughout the world in places like Serbia, Belarus, Iraq, China, Burma, and Cuba, all of which are going to be daunting tasks we face. And to be sure, before NATO decides to admit new members--I hope that we will--that the enlargement will increase the security of all the countries in Europe, and, second, that the costs of enlargement are fairly allocated in a manner not unduly burdensome on the American taxpayer. And third, that a NATO charter with Russia can be concluded that allows the alliance the opportunity to consult with Moscow before making final decisions, in order to accommodate enhanced security in Europe. And also to increase our efforts at combating the scourge of international drug trafficking, which threatens so many of our neighborhoods and families. 
The one thing that every Secretary of State has given lip service to is dealing with that issue. The one thing that every Secretary of State, Democrat or Republican, has promptly forgotten is a commitment I have gotten before from every Secretary that they will not forget. But I want the Record to note, if Madeleine Albright is listening, that I remind her I will not forget her commitment that the State Department should be involved in that testy, little, difficult item of dealing with the international drug problem. The truth of the matter is most folks at the State Department and foreign policy types think it is kind of beneath them to deal with drug policy, and I am here to tell them, now that I rank on the Democratic side, I will be a thorn in their side about increasing their attention to that issue. 
Mr. President, I am enthusiastic about the prospect of working with Ambassador Albright over the next 4 years. I am confident that she will cooperate closely with the Senate to ensure that our foreign policy continues to embody American ideals and to serve the interests of the United States around the globe. 
I strongly urge my fellow Senators to vote to confirm Madeleine Albright as our next Secretary of State. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce--along with Senator Daschle, Senator Leahy, and many other Senators--legislation which will be a key cornerstone of the Senate Democrats anti-crime, anti-drug focus for the new Congress. 
Our thrust is clear and straight-forward: 
We must continue the successes of the 1994 Biden crime law. 
And, at the same time, we must take up the new challenge of confronting crime and drug abuse among our youth with a commonsense strategy balancing tough sanctions, certain punishment and protecting literally millions of kids from the criminals and drug pushers who can target any kid from any family whose parents are at work when the school day ends. 
We must continue the success of the 1994 crime law. 
While I give the credit first and foremost to the police officers on our Nation's streets, the verdict from the FBI's national crime statistics is that since the 1994 crime law, violent crime is down and down significantly: 
1996 is projected to have the lowest murder toll since 1988--and a murder rate that is lowest since 1971; 
1996 is projected to have the lowest violent crime total since 1990; and 
the murder rate for wives, ex-wives and girlfriends at the hands of their `intimates' fell to an 18-year low in 1994--and is lower still in 1995. 
This is a record of success which should convince the Senate to extend the 1994 crime law. 
Adding 25,000 more police by extending the 100,000 cops program for two more years. 
Extending the Violence Against Women Act funding to shelter 400,000 more battered women and their children and continuing to help States arrest and prosecute batterers. Providing an additional $5 billion to build up to 80,000 more prison cells for violent criminals--we also propose to give States greater flexibility with these dollars to speed the prosecution of violent criminals and increase the use of drug testing. Provide $1 billion to extend such proven law enforcement programs as the Byrne anti-drug grants to State and local law enforcement. And, extend the crime law trust fund to fund all these initiatives from the cost-savings from downsizing the Federal Government--without increasing the Federal budget deficit. 
The bottom line--this bill calls on the full Senate to continue the successes of the 1994 Biden crime law. 
But, this legislation does not stop there. In the face of rising teen drug abuse and rising youth violence--despite some recent hopeful news--we must undertake a comprehensive effort to target these problems. This legislation offers just such a comprehensive effort: 
First, we propose to reform the juvenile justice system to crack down on violent youth by: 
Making some key changes to Federal law that respond to legitimate concerns which create the pressure to take the unwise step of prosecuting kids in our overburdened adult courts. Specifically, providing greater access to juveniles records and raising the mandatory release age for juveniles from 21 to 26--so juveniles will face up to 11 years in prison even if they are prosecuted as juveniles. 
Providing $1 billion to help States build prisons for violent juveniles as well as additional prosecutors and other improvements to State juvenile justice systems (including certain, graduated punishment for first-time and minor juvenile offenders). 
Creating special juvenile `gun' courts where juvenile gun offenders are tried and sentenced on an expedited basis. 
These are essential to controlling juvenile crime because, as every mother knows, immediate and certain punishment is the key to disciplining kids. 
Second, we must target one of the primary sources of youth violence--street gangs. 
We propose aggressive steps to: 
Target gang paraphernalia by boosting the penalties for criminals who arm themselves with bullet-proof body armor and deadly accurate laser-sighting devices. And, as Senator Leahy has identified, we must make some commonsense reforms to speed law enforcement access to the numeric pagers so often used by youth gang criminals. 
Create a new crime of interstate franchise spread of street gangs--a step which better targets Federal law enforcement resources than simply federalizing ever more State crimes and encroaching upon the State's traditional handling of juvenile crime. 
Cracking down on street gangs also means that we should increase the penalties for witness intimidation, a favored tactic of criminal street gangs. This is a proposal outlined by the President just this weekend. 
Third, we must redouble our efforts to treat and prevent youth drug abuse. 
For the past several months, you have heard me modify one of the key arguments of the President's 1992 campaign by stating--`it's drugs, stupid, it's drugs.' 
This statement is--unfortunately--necessary in the face of rising drug abuse among our children. While drug abuse among adults is holding steady, all the surveys tell us that more and more children are falling prey to drugs. 
We propose a multi-prong response, because drugs need to be fought not only in our communities, but also in our scientific laboratories where important breakthroughs are being made into medicines to treat drug addiction--we propose additional funding for the Federal Medications Development Program and to provide incentives to the private sector to develop new medicines to treat heroin and cocaine addiction. 
We must also expand drug courts to cover 50,000 children--a vast improvement on the no drug testing, no treatment, and no threat of punishment system which typifies too many juvenile courts today. 
As I proposed last year, we must tighten controls on the club drug--ketamine--that is popular with too many children today. 
Funding drug treatment for 600,000 drug-addicted children is also key--particularly as our Nation stands on the edge of a baby-boomerang wave that will mean more teenagers--and more teen addicts. 
Reauthorizing the drug director's office as well as the Safe & Drug-Free Schools Program which is the core of Federal drug prevention efforts are two other necessary steps. 
In addition, and in response to the recent passage of so-called medical marijuana initiatives, we seek a measure which should be supported even by their proponents--a simple study to determine if drug abuse among children rises in these two States. 
Fourth, we call for a renewed effort to prevent youth violence. 
No where has the crime policy debate been subject to more distortions and misunderstandings than on a goal all of us should share--let's prevent kids from getting involved in crime, violence and drugs in the first place. 
To get past all the misunderstanding, we propose to call upon the prestigious, non-partisan National Academy of Sciences to answer the questions--can we prevent youth crime? And, if so, how do we do so in the most efficient way possible? 
Let me repeat a challenge I offered last week--I will live by the results of this study, if those who oppose prevention efforts will as well. If the national academy says we can't figure out this task, so be it, I will not seek appropriations for any funds we authorize through this legislation. But, if the national academy of sciences says that we can, I challenge all to support full funding for these crime prevention efforts. 
But, in the meantime, it seems to me that we do know at least one thing about preventing youth crime and drug abuse--my mom summarized what we know in the simple phrase used by mothers everywhere: `Idle hands are the devil's workshop.' 
This refers to the commonsense notion that if we can just get kids off the streets and into supervised programs during the after school hours when kids are likely to be the victims of gangs and criminals or the customers of drug pushers--if we can just do that simply thing, with boys and girls clubs or many other proven efforts, we can make important in-roads against drug abuse and crime among children.
