Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, for the information of the Senate, this resolution on behalf of Senator Lautenberg and myself is the so-called deeming budget resolution. We have cleared this with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. 
Last year this Congress reached an historic agreement with the President. We enacted the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I think those pundits who like to suggest that this Congress has not done anything seem to conveniently forget that the balanced budget agreement was done in this Congress. 
Nevertheless, that agreement and the implementing legislation--the Budget Enforcement Act of 1997--put in place for 5 years spending limits on appropriated accounts and extended various other fiscal enforcement tools. I have often thought of this legislation as a first step in creating a biennial budgeting and appropriations process. We have operated in the second session of this Congress under those spending caps and applied the discipline of that act to help us secure the first balanced budget in decades. 
The levels set forth in this Senate resolution reflect the bipartisan balanced budget agreement--updated for the most recent fiscal and economic information provided to us by the Congressional Budget Office and for legislation enacted since the last budget resolution was agreed to. 
This is similar to the action which the Senate took on April 2 of this year when we passed S. Res. 209 which provided a section 302 allocation to the Committee on Appropriations in advance of completing action on a budget resolution. 
What we have done today is simply provide committee spending allocations and establish overall aggregate levels of spending and revenues so that we can continue the fiscal discipline inherent in our budget rules--this means we will be able to enforce our section 302 and 311 points of order and our pay-as-you-go rule. 
I feel this discipline has been critical to our ability to uphold the bipartisan balanced budget agreement and led us to a period of budget surpluses. Thus we should not let the fact that we were unable to complete conference prevent us from going forward with the budget rules which have served us so well in the past. 
I am hopeful that early in the next Congress we might consummate the 2 year budgeting and appropriations process in statute along with other changes to the Budget Act necessitated by the changed environment of projected budget surpluses.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am very pleased at the Senate's passage of S. 2117, as amended, which includes a number of legislative items of great interest to my home state of New Mexico. This legislation allows for transfer by the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior real property and improvements at the old Jicarilla Ranger District Station, near the village of Gobernador, New Mexico to San Juan College. It also allows for transfer by the Secretary of the Interior real property and improvements at the old Coyote Ranger District Station, near the small town of Coyote, New Mexico, to Rio Arriba County. An additional provision will amend the National Trails System Act to designate El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro as a National Historic Trail, and finally, this bill will convey tracts of land--paid for by Carlsbad Irrigation District and referred to as `acquired lands'--back to the district, which I have been working to accomplish for several congresses. 
All of these provisions have bipartisan and administrative support, and all will improve the lives of New Mexicans around the state. Regarding the Jicarilla Ranger District transfer, the Forest Service determined that the ten acres in question are of no further use to them and recently endorsed passage of this bill to provide long-term benefits for the people of San Juan County and the students and faculty of San Juan College in northwest New Mexico. The Coyote Ranger Station in northern New Mexico will also continue to be used for public purposes, including a community center, and a fire substation. Some of the buildings will also be available for Rio Arriba County to use for storage and repair of road maintenance equipment, and other County vehicles. 
Over one third of the land in New Mexico is owned by the federal government, and therefore finding appropriate sites for community and educational purposes can be difficult. These transfers are logical since they provide facilities and lands for community use while removing unwanted and unused land and facilities from federal ownership. 
Amending the National Trails System Act to designate El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro as a National Historic Trail, commemorating the Spanish settlement of the southwest United States is particularly appropriate in this year of the Cuartocentenario. 1998 is the 400th anniversary of the establishment of the first Spanish capital at San Juan Pueblo, the first terminus of the El Camino Real by Don Juan de Onate. We in New Mexico are most proud of this chapter in our Nation's history. This trail represents the migration route into the interior of the continent by Spanish settlers, and I am pleased that our nation will honor this part of its history. 
Finally, the transfer included which is specific to the Carlsbad project in New Mexico, directs the Carlsbad Irrigation District to continue to manage lands as they have been in the past, for the purposes for which the project was constructed. I believe this is a fair and equitable bill that has been developed over years of negotiations. The Carlsbad Irrigation District has had operations and maintenance responsibilities for the past 66 years. It met all the repayment obligations to the government in 1991, and it's about time we let CID have what is rightfully theirs. 
This legislation accomplishes three things: conveys title of acquired lands and facilities to Carlsbad Irrigation District; allows the District to assume management of leases and the benefits of the receipts from these acquired lands; and sets a 180 day deadline for the transfer, establishing a 50-50 cost-sharing standard for carrying out the transfer. 
This legislation is long overdue, is not contentious, and has in fact passed out of the Senate before. I urge prompt passage in the House of Representatives. 
I want to thank Senator Daschle for his help.

Mr. DOMENICI. Yes it certainly is. I would note that Secretary of Energy Pena noted and has appreciated the cooperation that has occurred in this area under the current partnership program. In a joint statement signed on March 11 of this year, Secretary Pena and Deputy Minister of Minatom Mr. Ryabev specified those areas in which further scientific research will be necessary; plutonium fuel, neutron physics, and materials. That joint statement was an important indicator of the success and purpose of the gas reactor partnership and future efforts should be consistent with that statement.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in honor of the distinguished military career of Colonel William L. Berland. Colonel Berland is retiring on November 13, 1998, after completing 27 years of faithful service to his country. He is currently stationed at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico and plans to make New Mexico his new home. We thank the great State of Montana for sending Colonel Berland to the service of this country, and we welcome him as a new New Mexico resident. Most importantly, we thank Colonel Berland for the unselfish service he gave to America and wish him and his wife Debbie the best in their retirement.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am proud to pay tribute to one of the most resilient cities in America--Roswell, New Mexico. One-hundred and twenty-five years ago, the Roswell Post Office opened its doors and a town's identity was established. Since that time, the residents of Roswell have displayed a hearty `can-do' attitude as they adapted to the constantly evolving economic climate of the region. 
Roswell has served as an economic and educational hub for southeastern New Mexico. It has been a center for sheep ranching, cattle driving, space exploration, and military aviation. Today, Roswell supports a thriving dairy industry and, because of its warm winters and relaxed pace, it has become a popular retirement destination for senior citizens across the country. Roswell is the site of the New Mexico Military Institute, one of the finest military preparatory academies in the country, and many noteworthy figures such as Pat Garrett, Roy Rogers, Roger Stauback, and Nancy Lopez have called it their home.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the conference report to S.1260, the `Securities Litigation Reform Uniform Standards Act of 1998' and I want to commend the Majority Leader for bringing this conference report to the floor for a vote prior to the Senate's adjournment. Few issues are more important to the high-tech community and the efficient operation of our capital markets than securities fraud lawsuit reform. 
So today, I want to congratulate Senators D'Amato, Dodd, and Gramm for all of their hard work on this legislation to provide one set of rules to govern securities fraud class actions. 
This conference report completes the work I began more than six years ago with Senator Sanford of North Carolina. Back in the early 1990's, Senator Sanford and I noticed that a small group of entrepreneurial plaintiffs' lawyers were abusing our securities laws and the federal rules related to class action lawsuits to file frivolous claims against high-technology companies in federal courts. 
Often these lawsuits were based simply on the fact that a company's stock price had fallen, without any real evidence of wrongdoing by the company. Senator Sanford and I realized a long time ago that stock price volatility- common in high tech stocks- simply is not stock fraud. 
But, because it was so expensive and time consuming to fight these lawsuits, many companies settled even when they knew they were innocent of the charges leveled against them. The money used to pay for these frivolous lawsuits could have been used for research and development or to create new, high-paying jobs. 
So, we introduced a bill to make some changes to the securities fraud class action system. Of course, the powerful plaintiffs' bar opposed our efforts, and the bill did not move very far along in the legislative process. 
After Senator Sanford left the Senate, I found a new partner--the senior Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd. Senator Dodd and I continued to work hard on this issue and in 1995, with tremendous help from Chairman D'Amato and Senator Gramm, we succeeded in passing a law. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 passed Congress in an overwhelmingly bi-partisan way--over President Clinton's initial veto of the bill. 
And since enactment of the 1995 law, we have seen great changes in the conduct of plaintiffs' class action lawyers in federal court. Because of more stringent pleading requirements, plaintiffs' lawyers no longer `race to the courthouse' to be the first to file securities class actions. Because of the new rules, we no longer have `professional plaintiffs'--investors who buy a few shares of stock and then serve as sham named plaintiffs in multiple securities class actions. Other rules make it difficult for plaintiffs' lawyers to file lawsuits to force companies into settlement rather than face the expensive and time consuming `fishing expedition' discovery process. 
From my perspective, it has begun to look like our new law has worked too well. Entrepreneurial trial lawyers have begun filing similar claims in state court to avoid the new law's safeguards against frivolous and abusive lawsuits. Instead of one set of rules, we now have 51--one for the federal system and 50 different ones in the states. 
According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, this migration of claims from federal court to state court `may be the most significant development in securities litigation' since the passage of the new law in 1995. 
In fact, prior to passage of the new law in 1995, state courts rarely served as the forum for securities fraud lawsuits. Now, more than 25 percent of all securities class actions are brought in state court. A recent Price Waterhouse study found that the average number of state court class actions filed in 1996 (the first year after the new law) grew 335 percent over the 1991-1995 average. In 1997, state court filings were 150 percent greater than the 1991-1995 average. 
So, there has been a tremendous increase in state securities fraud class actions. In fact, trial lawyers have testified to Congress that they have an obligation to file securities fraud lawsuits in state court if it provides a more attractive forum for their clients. Believe it or not, plaintiffs' lawyers actually admit that they are attempting to avoid federal law. 
The increase in state court lawsuits also has prevented high-tech companies from taking advantage of one of the most significant reforms in the 1995 law--the safe harbor for forward-looking statements. Under the 1995 law, companies which make predictive statements are exempt from lawsuits based on those statements if they meet certain requirements. Companies are reluctant to use the safe harbor and make predictive statements because they fear that such statements could be used against them in state court. This fear stifles the free flow of important information to investors--certainly not a result we intended when we passed the new law. 
So today, the Senate will vote to send to the President one set of rules for securities fraud cases. One uniform set of rules is critical for our high-technology community and our capital markets. 
Without this legislation, the productivity of the high-tech industry--the fastest growing segment of our economy--will continue to be hamstrung by abusive, lawyer-driven lawsuits. Rather than spend their resources on R&D or creating new jobs, high-tech companies will continue to be forced to spend massive sums fending off frivolous lawsuits. That is unacceptable to this Senator. 
When I first worked on this issue, executives at Intel Corporation told me that if they had been hit with a frivolous securities lawsuit early in the company's history, they likely never would have invented the microchip. We should not let that happen to the next generation of Intels. 
This new law also will be important to our markets. Our capital markets are the envy of the world, and by definition are national in scope. Information provided by companies to the markets is directed to investors across the United States and throughout the world. 
Under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Congress has the authority to regulate in areas affecting `interstate commerce.' I cannot imagine a more classic example of what constitutes `interstate commerce' than the purchase and sale of securities over a national exchange. 
Not only does Congress have the authority to regulate in this area, it clearly is necessary and appropriate. Right now, in an environment where there are 50 different sets of rules, companies must take into account the most onerous state liability rules and tailor their conduct to those rules. If the liability rules in one state make it easier for entrepreneurial lawyers to bring frivolous lawsuits, that affects companies and the information available to investors in all other states. One uniform set of rules will eliminate that problem. 
Mr. President, I again want to commend my colleagues for their work on this important bill. I understand that this is a bi-partisan effort, which has the support of the SEC and the Clinton Administration. I also want to thank my colleagues over in the House--Chairman Bliley, Representative Cox, and others who have worked so hard on this issue. This is the culmination of a tremendous amount of work, and I think that our capital markets, high-tech companies and our litigation system will be better served because of it.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with great pride and honor that I rise today to pay tribute to my retiring colleague from Idaho, Senator Dirk Kempthorne. In his six years of service to the United States Senate, he has proven himself to be a very thoughtful and determined leader and I am honored to have the opportunity to rise and speak on his accomplishments. 
It was a pleasure to work with Senator Kempthorne as he crafted one of the most important bills we have passed in the United States Senate, the Unfunded Mandates bill. I was particularly pleased that the private sector was included in the assessment of Unfunded mandates and Dirk was generous and extraordinarily helpful to me and my staff throughout the legislative process as we developed and negotiated this legislation. Not only did the junior Senator from Idaho manage two weeks of debate on the Senate floor which sometimes lasted 12 hours a day, but his skillful leadership and influence brought affected parties to the table to negotiate and produce legislation which passed both the House and Senate by overwhelming margins. Clearly, without his strong commitment to American small businesses, this objective would not have been achieved. 
In addition to his service on the Small Business Committee and Armed Forces Committee, Senator Kempthorne was given the responsibility of chairing the Drinking Water, Fisheries, and Wildlife subcommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee. He wrote an update of the Safe Drinking Water Act which won bipartisan praise. He worked many long and arduous hours crafting legislation to reauthorize and reform the Endangered Species Act, an issue extremely important New Mexico and other WesternStates. Dirk's perseverance and hard work was instrumental in laying the groundwork for long overdue reform of this law and I am hopeful that we can be as diligent and compromising as he has been in crafting and passing ESA reform legislation in the future. 
The state of Idaho is fortunate to have a statesman of his caliber. During his tenure, he has earned the respect and admiration of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle because of his unique ability to negotiate, compromise, and foster positive working relationships not only with his colleagues, but between federal, state, and local governments. These skills will serve him well as he faces new challenges in the future. Although we will miss his presence in this body, I know that he will continue to be a valuable asset not only to the state of Idaho but to this Nation. 
Finally, I understand the challenges and difficulties associated with raising a family while serving in Congress and I respect and admire his decision to do what is right for his family and their future. Nancy and I wish Dirk, Patricia, and their children all the best.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute on my behalf, and on behalf of the people of New Mexico, to a true American patriot, Senator John Glenn. It has indeed been a privilege to serve in this Chamber for 24 years with a man of such honor and distinction. 
Although I only served with Senator Glenn on the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee for a brief time, I have been able to witness firsthand John Glenn's legendary fairness and leadership. I doubt there has ever been a Senator who could match his dogged determination. He worked tirelessly for many years to cut government waste and improve the efficiency of government, and I applaud his efforts. 
Since his arrival in 1974, John Glenn has championed the cause of space exploration and research, an area of particular interest and importance to my home state of New Mexico. He has long understood, and I strongly concur with him, that the United States has a unique opportunity and obligation to the pursuit of knowledge and exploration of the heavens. Thanks to Senator Glenn's continuing sense of duty and service to his country, we will expand our understanding of space and its effects on the human body. 
The success of our space program has enabled our children to dream of different worlds, our scientists to explore the nature of matter and the origins of time, and us to be able to look up into the night sky and to understand what we see. John Glenn played a crucial role in achieving this success. His flight on Friendship 7 was one of the first indications of the greatness of America's space program. His flight on Discovery will be a continuation of the greatness John Glenn helped established--and a confirmation of the contributions senior Americans can, and do, make in our society. 
John Glenn's life as a military hero, space pioneer, and statesman is the stuff of legends. Although his time here in the Senate draws to a close, he assures us that the legend will grow when he takes off on the shuttle Discovery later this month. It truly has been a pleasure to work with the distinguished Senator from Ohio. Good luck, John Glenn, and God Bless.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with great respect that I rise today to express my gratitude to the distinguished Minority Whip, Senator Wendell Ford, for his 22 years of service to the United States Senate. I have been here since the beginning of his Senate career and have witnessed his many accomplishments over the years. His tenure has represented a shining example of hard work, honesty, and integrity. 
Senator Ford and I served on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee for many years together and shared a mutual interest in energy policy. He has been a strong advocate of the disposal of chemical weapons at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky and has stood firm in his commitment to exploring safe, affordable, and environmentally sound alternatives to chemical weapons incineration. He understands the threats of nuclear proliferation and we have shared a common desire to ensure proper stewardship of nuclear stockpiles across the globe. I have appreciated his valuable contribution to this mission and will miss his presence on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
An accomplished public servant, Senator Ford served his country in World War II, was elected Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and as a Senator, established himself as a national leader in energy, aviation, and federal-election reform policy. However, he may be best known for his steadfast commitment to serving the people of his beloved home state, Kentucky. He has diligently sought to create opportunities for the people of America and I am confident that upon his return to Kentucky, he will continue to give as generously of himself as he did during his 22 years of service in Congress. 
I believe that I speak on behalf of all members of the Senate when I say that Wendell's leadership, talent, and friendship will be sorely missed. I am grateful that I had the opportunity to work with him and hope that when the time comes for me to leave office, I will be as well respected as Senator Wendell Ford by my constituency and colleagues on both sides of the aisle. 
Wendell, on behalf of myself and the State of New Mexico, I commend you on job very well done and wish you and Jean continued health and happiness in your retirement.

Mr. DOMENICI. First let me talk for a moment, since he is present on the floor, of Senator Bumpers, the senior Senator from Arkansas. Let me use a couple of minutes of my time to say a few words about him before I proceed to talk about the budget and a few other matters. 
First, I want to say to Senator Bumpers, I don't think he needs me to repeat again what I have said in committee. He is going to be missed. He has been a real credit to this place called the U.S. Senate. I have never known him to behave, act, or in any way conduct himself as to demean this place. He has held it in respect, and that makes it a better place when we do that. 
But I also want to remind the Senate, since it has not been stated here on the floor as I know of, that in the energy and water appropriations bill it was my privilege, at the behest of some of Dale Bumpers' good friends here in the Senate, with the help of his staff and others, to include a resolution honoring him for his diligent and hard work on behalf of the public domain in the United States--the forest lands, the wilderness, the parks. In that bill, the resolution says we want him to be known for as long as there is an Arkansas. Thus, we took eight wilderness areas that are in his State that he had a lot to do with, and for name purposes we made all of them part of one wilderness called the Dale Bumpers Wilderness Area. 
That is now 91,000 acres in total that will bear your name. I know many other things could be done to indicate our esteem for you, but many of us thought that this might just be one that would strike you as quite appropriate. And we hope so. It is now the law of the land. The President signed it about 22 hours ago. Thus, I am here saying it in your presence. 
I thank you personally on behalf of our side of the aisle for everything you have done.

I only say that by way of the great respect we have for the way you talk to us, and talk to the American people. I am very pleased that you used that little 30 feet of carpet and hall as your place to talk.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to talk about three or four things. I am going to try my very, very best to be factual. I am concerned that here, in these waning days, considering the situation that exists on Pennsylvania Avenue, that the President finds himself in a very supercharged political environment. I don't think I had to say that. I think everybody knows that. But I want to suggest that yesterday afternoon, or whatever time of day it was that the President had a quickly called press conference to talk about the Congress of the United States and what we have and haven't done, and particularly to say that we aren't taking care of his education programs, and unless we do, he is going to keep us here. 
Normally, when I say `Mr. President,' I am addressing the Chair, because that is what we are supposed to do. If we care to address anyone here, we do it through `Mr. President.' 
Permit me to address the Mr. President on Pennsylvania Avenue, President Bill Clinton. 
President Clinton, you have been known to have a fantastic memory. As a matter of fact, I think you acknowledged that at one point recently, although, as with many of us who grow older, you did indicate that with the passage of time and the pressure of many things to do, that that great memory fails every now and then. 
Now, Mr. President--Bill Clinton--I am suggesting that maybe your memory failed you when you gave that speech yesterday. So let me tell you what I remember about your education programs that you claim we have not funded. 
I want everybody to know that on many things regarding budgets and programs, you can look to the budget that the President sends up here to see what it asks for and what we are giving him. This is the budget for the year we are now appropriating, which started technically on October 1. Here it is. 
I had occasion, shortly after it was issued, to have the education parts of this reviewed. I remember coming to the floor of the U.S. Senate to say to the President, which OMB agreed to, `Mr. President, the official scorekeeper and official evaluator of budgets for the U.S. Congress says that your request for money for two education programs--interest reduction so that schools can afford buildings they need and so-called 100,000 teachers so we can lower the classroom ratio--those two programs were found by the official budget analysts to not properly have been placed in this budget. What they said is, they break the budget that you just signed, Mr. President.' Point No. 1. 
Point No. 2: If they are so important--and I am not denying that the President feels they are, and maybe many Senators feel they are--do you know what the President did in asking us to pay for them? He didn't provide the money to pay for them. He did not. It is not in this budget. He said, `When you pass the cigarette tax, I would like you to use some of it for education.' 
Let me just say, that sort of says to me, `I couldn't find room in the budget for these things that I am telling you are very important. So if we get a cigarette tax, we'll pay for them.' 
Do you know what happened? After weeks of debate, we didn't get a cigarette tax. 
Mr. President, what I know is that the appropriators in the U.S. Senate, in the bill that takes care of education--so there will be no misunderstanding, in this regular budget you asked for $31.4 billion for education. Look at the appropriations bill, Mr. President. Ask OMB, your official people who look at it. See how much the Senate gave you for education funding for the year you are complaining about. Interesting, $31.4 billion--exactly what you asked for. Now, Mr. President, you tell the American people you are going to keep us here until we do this, as if we are the ones to blame for it not being done--that is, those two programs. 
I am living in a different world, or the President's memory has failed him, because do you understand, I say to my fellow Senators, that the President is asking for that money now for these two programs--and for many Senators it is doubtful whether that is the way to help education, but, nonetheless, let's just follow it. He is now saying he is going to keep us here until we do it. But guess what. He knows, his helpers know, that he has to find programs within the Government to cut, which are called offsets, in order to pay for those two programs. He knows that, because this budget says he didn't have room for it in here. He was making room through a cigarette tax that never happened. 
As of right now, 2:25 p.m., I am not aware that the President has submitted a means to pay for those programs. I am not aware that the President has told us how to pay for them if we wanted to adopt them. All I am asking is that we depoliticize a few of these issues, or at least state the facts correctly. We do not deserve blame for not including two programs, which, I repeat, are not paid for in this budget, when as of today, 11 days into the fiscal year, we don't know how the President intends to pay for them. All right? That is the first point I would like to make today. 
Second point: There has been a lot of discussion this morning on the floor of the Senate by some Senators about this issue of a Patients' Bill of Rights. I think the country understands, but just so it won't be left unaddressed here this morning, let me again refresh our collective memories. With everything that we have to do, we took 3 1/2 weeks to debate the Patients' Bill of Rights on the floor of the Senate. 
The minority can say we didn't let it pass, but, Mr. President, the majority can say, they didn't let it pass. They had a bill; we had a bill. We had more than 50 votes; they did not. They kept our bill from passing which had more than sufficient votes. So I ask, who is to blame for a bill not passing? Again, I want to be practical, I can't say it is all their fault, the minority's fault, but clearly it is certainly not all the Republicans' fault. 
What was the really big issue between the two parties? And I leave this one to the American people. The principal issue that divided us was the lawyers of the United States. They support the minority heavily--not all of them, not all of them, but those who litigate. What did they want in the bill that we didn't want in the bill? We didn't want a new right to go to court to sue managed care entities, HMOs. We left the right to sue the doctors and the professionals, but we didn't want to create a new right to sue the HMOs in courts of law for damages. 
We, on this side, for the most part--not unanimously, but for the most part--have adopted a sense about health care, and it says lawyers and lawsuits don't deliver health care; lawyers and lawsuits make health care cost more. We could not see why, if the minority and the President think it is such an enormous new status and set of rights that we should adopt--and we tend to agree--why would the minority that didn't have the votes to pass here but we had the votes to pass ours--why would they deny a bill's passage based upon, they want lawyers back in the loop and we don't want lawyers back in the loop? I leave it to those listening and those who will look at the Record. See if I am correct that that was the biggest stumbling block, and see whether the President and the minority caused the Patients' Bill of Rights bill to fail or not. 
Those are two points, and I want to make a third. 
Mr. President, in the election past, two things worked for the President. He is probably the best public relations President we have ever had. 
Two things worked for him as certain--as certain--as when you write a name in ink on a piece of paper with indelible ink; it will be there. And those two things that he has used over and over--you need not think; they will pop into your mind--Social Security and education. Right? 
What we have seen, I say to my friend from Alabama, we have seen the Social Security card played. How? `No tax cuts out of the surplus because it jeopardizes Social Security.' That is the typical every 2-year issue. It is raised again. 
Let me suggest to Mr. President, Bill Clinton, you know, Mr. President, that we are about, in the next 72 hours, to pass a very big appropriations bill. Maybe Pennsylvania Avenue does not know this, but here is the best estimate I have. We are about to spend--spend; not tax, spend--$18 billion of the surplus that was supposed to be saved for Social Security. Got it? The same pot that the President says, `Don't touch it. It's for Social Security,' we are about to spend $18 billion of it for so-called `emergencies.' And I will get to that in a moment. 
Friends here in the Senate and those listening, you cannot have it both ways. You cannot say to Republicans, `You can't use the surplus to give back to the American people in taxes, even if it's a tiny amount, but you can spend the surplus for bigger Government.' You know, it just does not wash. Both are diminishing, to some extent, the surplus of $1.6 trillion that we expect in the next decade. 
I do not think it will be that much. In fact, the year we are in right now is supposed to have an $80 billion surplus. I think it will be $20 billion off because of economics. And then we will spend $18-, $20 billion of it that we did not plan to spend. Then we will have something for defense next year that we need, and there will probably be none left for tax cuts. That is what it looks like. 
So I want to just talk about one of the emergencies. 
I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.

Mr. DOMENICI. One of the `emergencies' is a real emergency. That is to help agriculture in the United States. But let me suggest, to help agriculture in the United States, we sent the President a bill. We had $4 billion in the emergency funding for the farmers of the United States. 
When the President of the United States asked us for emergency money--which he knew people like Senator Domenici would start adding up to see how much more you are spending of the surplus than the Republicans planned to use in tax cuts--the President asked for $2.3 billion for agriculture. We gave him $4 billion. 
But in the meantime, a distinguished Senator on the minority side, whom I have great respect for, the minority leader, Senator Daschle, introduced a bill saying, `We want $7.2 billion as an emergency for agriculture. And we want to wipe out the new law which is only 18 months old called Freedom to Farm because we currently have an emergency'--$7.2 billion. The President asked for $2.3 billion. Now we get a communication from the President that says, `I asked you for $2.3 billion, but essentially I want Daschle's bill, too.' Now, believe it or not, we sent him a bill with $4 billion. He vetoed it and said, `Now you've got to give me what Senator Daschle's bill has.' 
Mr. President, we have had the best people in this body working on agriculture who put this emergency package together. And believe me, the $4 billion package would make the American agriculture whole. There would be no net loss of income to the agriculture community. They know it. The experts know it. But because it is an election year, and because of the turmoil that exists that I have alluded to earlier in my conversation with the Senate here, the President now holds agriculture programs hostage. If we do not do it his way, we will close down the Department of Agriculture. Frankly, if we did, it would be the President's--it would be on his shoulders, not ours. But you know, it will get worked out. I just thought everybody ought to know how these things work. 
Now, should it matter? We have worked for 20 years to get a balanced budget and a balanced budget agreement. The result has been nothing but good news for America. Almost everybody that even touched the issue lays claim to having done it all, including the President who claims the entire economic well-being of the country is because he is President. He can do that. That is fine. 
The truth of the matter is, there are plenty--plenty--who deserve credit, including the Federal Reserve, including Republicans in the Senate, Democrats in the Senate, the same in the House. But it really started happening, in terms of restraining the budget, when both bodies became Republican. And we can go back and trace that. That is when we fixed welfare to save money, that is when we changed Medicaid to save big dollars, and on and on. 
Let's go home, let's wrap this up in the next few days, but let's remember the facts. And let's not let this superheavy, politically charged environment color things such that we are going to take that surplus we take so much pride in, and find out in 3 or 4 months that there is only 25, 30, 40 percent of it left, even though we were told, `You're going to really use it up if you cut taxes.' What happened? We did not cut taxes, and it got used up. Interesting. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Valles Caldera in Northern New Mexico is a place you visit for a day, and long to return to for a life time. It is nature at its most extraordinary--an almost perfectly round bowl formed by a collapsed volcano. It is a place with rolling meadows, crystal-clear streams, roaming elk, Ponderosa pines and quaking Aspen trees, and Golden eagles. This legislation guarantees that this very special place will be there for future generations to visit and remember. 
I am very proud to be introducing legislation that will authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire a truly unique 95,000 acre `working ranch' in New Mexico, known alternatively as the Baca Ranch, the Valle Grande, and the Valles Caldera. Independently, but as importantly, this legislation also addresses longstanding problems encountered by Federal land managers in disposing of surplus federal property and the acquisition of private inholdings within federal management areas. 
The former provides a unique solution to the management of a unique property, while the latter builds on existing laws and provides resources dedicated to the consolidation of federal agency land holdings. 
In north-central New Mexico there is a truly unique working ranch on an historic Mexican land grant known as Baca Location No. 1. The Ranch is currently owned and managed by the Baca Land and Cattle Company, and it comprises most of a collapsed, extinct volcano known as the Valles Caldera. This ranch also contains innumerable significant cultural, historic, recreational, ecological, and productive resources. 
The bill I introduce today is the result of months of negotiation with the Administration, Senator Bingaman, and Congressman Redmond. We have incorporated ideas from groups interested in the acquisition of the truly unique Baca Ranch. Many Americans, especially New Mexicans have expressed a desire for the federal government to purchase the Ranch. After months of research and consideration, I met with President Clinton on Air Force One while we were both returning to Washington from New Mexico to discuss the possibility of this land acquisition. Because the nature of the property requires a unique operational program for appropriate development and preservation, I approached him with an innovative trust structure for the management of the Baca Ranch. This trust would manage the ranch with appropriate public input and governmental oversight. I indicated that I was not interested in having the ranch managed under current federal agency practices. The President expressed enthusiasm for making this concept a reality, and we agreed on a Statement of Principles to govern the acquisition of the Baca Ranch at the end of July. 
This unique working ranch has been well maintained and preserved by the current owners. In fact, if ever there was an example of sterling stewardship of a piece of property, this is it. 
The legislation introduced today certainly cannot pass this year: unfortunately, time has run out for the 105th Congress, but many concerns and ideas about federal purchase of the property will be discussed at hearings upon reintroduction in the 106th Congress. While there is consenus that this property should be acquired, we do not yet know the cost of the property. The Baca Ranch is estimated to be worth approximately $100 to $125 million, but the appraisal has not yet been given to the Forest Service or made public. Therefore, the exact cost of acquisition has yet to be determined. 
This is the largest purchase of public land by the Forest Service in at least 25 years, therefore, it is imperative that careful consideration is given to not only the purchase, but to the management of the property as well. 
In past years, federal land management agencies have been criticized for their stewardship of public lands. I find it ironic that many of the groups who wish to bring this ranch into government ownership are the same groups who, in recent years, have initiated relentless litigation against the Forest Service and BLM alleging poor management of federal lands. However, diverse interests have come together to reach agreement on the trust management of the Ranch, and Congressman Redmond and I have worked hard in both Houses of Congress to obtain funding for purchase. Any funding at this point should be viewed as earnest money, and will be subject to this authorization and agreement on the fair market value for the property. 
The parties have really worked hard in framing this legislation, and there are still a few issues we would like to work out. Not the least of which includes the interest expressed by the Santa Clara Pueblo in purchasing land outside the Caldera, but contains the headwaters of the Santa Clara Creek. Negotiations between the Pueblo, the Administration, the current owners of the property, and the congressional delegation on how to resolve this issue was not completed prior to today's introduction. However, all parties are interested in continuing discussion regarding a potential Santa Clara purchase of property adjacent to their pueblo. I also note that Congressman Redmond has expressed specific interest in addressing other Native American issues regarding the Ranch acquisition. 
I have visited the Baca Ranch, and I can tell you that it is one beautiful piece of property. The Valles Caldera is one of the world's largest resurgent lava domes with potential geothermal activity. The depression from a hugh volcanic eruption over a million years ago is more than a half-mile deep and fifteen miles across at its widest point. The land was originally granted to the heirs of Don Luis Maria Cabeza de Vaca under a settlement enacted by Congress in 1860. Since that time, the property has remained virtually intact as a single, large, tract of land. 
Historical evidence in the form of old logging camps and other artifacts, and a review of the history of territorial New Mexico clearly show the importance of this land over many generations for the rearing of domesticated livestock, and as a timber supply for local inhabitants. Several film sets have been left standing on the property, representing a significant part of the history of the American film industry and its depiction of the American West. 
The careful husbandry of the Ranch by the Dunigan family, the current owners, including selective harvesting of timber, limited grazing and hunting, and the use of proscribed fire, have preserved a mix of healthy range and timber land with significant species diversity providing a model for sustainable land development and use. The Ranch's natural beauty and abundant resources, and its proximity to large municipal populations could provide numerous recreational opportunities for hiking, fishing, camping, cross-country skiing, and hunting. 
Mr. President, the Baca Location is a unique working ranch. It is not a wilderness area, as in the words of the Wilderness Act, `untrammeled by man, where man is a visitor who does not remain.' Man has been there for many generations, and will remain for many to come. Similarly, it is not a resource that could be run well as a national park. This ranch can best be protected for future generations by continuing its operation as a working asset through a unique management structure. This legislation provides unique management under a trust that may allow for its eventual operation to become financially self-sustaining. 
Mr. President, recent indication by the current owners of the Baca Location that they wish to sell the ranch has created an opportunity for us to acquire it into public ownership and allow for appropriate public access and enjoyment of these lands for the first time since 1860. Because of the ranch's unique character, however, I am not interested in having it managed under the usual federal authorities, as is typical of the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, or the National Park Service. Under the current state of affairs on our public lands, Forest Service and BLM management is constantly hounded by litigation initiated by some of the same groups that wish to bring this ranch into government ownership. I do not want to take this property, put it in that situation, and then claim we have done a great thing. 
This legislation represents an opportunity to experiment with a different kind of public land management scheme. Burdensome regulations, and litigation resulting therefrom, have brought federal land management practices rapidly towards gridlock. The Valles Caldera National Preserve will serve as a model to explore alternative means of federal management and will provide the American people with opportunities to enjoy the Valles Caldera and its many resources for generations to come. 
This trust idea, based on similar legislation for federal management of the Presidio in San Francisco, sets in motion a truly unique management scheme befitting this truly unique place. I am willing to take a chance on an innovative approach because I believe that the current quagmire of federal land management simply does not do justice to this very special place. The unique nature of the Valles Caldera, and its resources, requires a unique management program, dedicated to appropriate development and preservation under the principle of the highest and best use of the ranch in the interest of the public. 
Mr. President, title I of this legislation provides the framework necessary to fulfil that objective. It authorizes the acquisition of the Baca ranch by the appropriate Federal agency. At the same time, it establishes a government-owned corporation, called the Valles Caldera Trust, whose sole responsibility is to ensure that the ranch is managed in a manner that will preserve its current unique character, and provide enumerable opportunities for the American people to enjoy its splendor. Most importantly to me, however, the legislation will allow for the ranch's continued operation as a working asset for the people of north-central New Mexico, without further drawing on the thinly-stretched resources of the Federal land management agencies. 
I am looking forward to hearings on this legislation next year, and know that the legislative process shall enlighten us further as to the complex nature of the Ranch. I, personally, am greatly looking forward to seeing an value estimate of the land prior to authorization. While valued between $37 and $55 million in 1980, I have heard that the Baca ranch is currently estimated to be worth approximately $100 to $125 million. I do not know how such inflation will affect the likelihood of the location's federal acquisition. I do know that we have waited patiently for many months for a promised appraisal from the current owners, but an appraisal has not yet been complete nor have any other offers to purchase the land been made. Therefore, the exact cost of acquisition has yet to be determined. Before we commit large sums of federal taxpayer dollars to purchase new property, it seems prudent to provide a solution for the orderly disposal of surplus federal property and to meet our current obligations to those who hold lands within federal properties. 
I would like to emphasize that while both portions of this bill are important to federal land management, both in New Mexico and nationwide, my intention is not to tie federal acquisition of the Baca upon disposition of surplus federal land. Instead, I feel this legislation independently addresses the acquisition of this unique property for public use and enjoyment, while solving current land management problems. 
Currently, New Mexico has approximately one-third of its land in public ownership or management. I agree that these public lands are an important natural resource that require our most thoughtful management. 
In order to conserve our existing National treasures for future use and enjoyment, we must devise, with the concurrence of other members of Congress and the President, a definite plan and timetable to dispose of surplus land through sale or exchange into private ownership. 
Title II of this legislation addresses the orderly disposition of surplus federal property on a state by state basis. It also addresses the problem of what is known as `inholdings' within federally managed areas. There are currently more than 45 million acres of privately owned lands trapped within the boundaries of Federal land management units, including national parks, national forests, national monuments, national wildlife refuges, and wilderness areas. The location of these tracts, referred to as inholdings, makes the exercise of private property rights difficult for the land owner. In addition, management of the public lands is made more cumbersome for the federal land managers. 
In many cases, inholders have been waiting generations for the federal government to set aside funding and prioritize the acquisition of their property. With rapidly growing public demand for the use of public lands, it is increasingly difficult for federal managers to address problems created by the existence of inholdings in many areas. 
This legislation directs the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture to survey inholdings existing within Federal land management units, and to establish a priority for their acquisition, on a willing seller basis, in the order of those which have existed as inholdings for the longest time to those most recently being incorporated into the Federal unit. 
Closely related to the problem created by inholdings within Federal land management units, is the abundance of public domain land which the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has determined it no longer needs to fulfil its mission. Under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), the BLM has identified an estimated four to six million acres of public domain lands for disposal, and the agency anticipates that additional public land will be similarly identified, with public input and consultation with State and local governments as required by law. 
Mr. President, let me simply clarify that point--the BLM already has authority under an existing law, FLPMA, to exchange or sell lands out of Federal ownership. Through its public process for land use planning, when the agency has determined that certain lands would be more useful to the public under private or local governmental control, it is already authorized to dispose of these lands, either by sale or exchange. 
The sale or exchange of this land which I have often referred to as `surplus,' would be beneficial to local communities, adjoining land owners, and BLM land mangers, alike. First, it would allow for the reconfiguration of land ownership patterns to better facilitate resource management. Second, it would contribute to administrative efficiency within federal land management units, by allowing for better allocation of fiscal and human resources within the agency. Finally, in certain locations, the sale of public land which has been identified for disposal is the best way for the public to realize a fair value for this land. 
The problem, Mr. President, is that an orderly process for the efficient disposition of lands identified for disposal does not currently exist. This legislation addresses that problem by directing the BLM to fulfil all legal requirements for the transfer of these lands out of Federal ownership, and providing a dedicated source of funding generated from the sale of these lands to continue this process. 
Additionally, this legislation authorizes the use of the proceeds generated from these lands to purchase inholdings from willing sellers. This will enhance the ability of the Federal land management agencies to work cooperatively with private land owners, and with State and local governments, to consolidate the ownership of public and private land in a manner that would allow for better overall resource management. 
Mr. President, I want to make it clear that this program will in no way detract from other programs with similar purposes. The bill clearly states that proceeds generated from the disposal of public land, and dedicated to the acquisition of inholdings, will supplement, and not replace, funds appropriated for that purpose through the Land and Water Conservation Fund. In addition, the bill states that the Bureau of Land Management should rely on non-Federal entities to conduct appraisals and other research required for the sale or exchange of these lands, allowing for the least disruption of existing land and resource management programs. 
Mr. President, this bill has been a long time in the making. For over a year, now, I have been working with and talking to knowledgeable people, both inside and outside of the current administration, to develop many of the ideas embodied in this bill. In recent weeks, my staff and I have worked closely with the administration on this legislation. I feel comfortable in stating that by working together, we have reached agreement in principle on the best way to proceed with these very important issues involving the management of public land resources, namely; the acquisition and unique management plan for the Baca ranch in New Mexico, and just as importantly, the disposition of surplus public lands in combination with a program to address problems associated with inholdings within our Federal land management units. 
Mr. President, I have committed to the administration to continue to work with them on three or four areas of this bill, where concerns remain. I have full confidence, however, that we can address these issues through the legislative process in the next Congress. For example, the need for additional roads, parking, visitor facilities, and water and mineral rights are also important issues that must be resolved. However, we are very luck to have the pleasure of a bipartisan, administration approved, legislative concept from which to work. 
The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will schedule hearings to address the many issues regarding Federal purchase of the Baca Ranch early in the 106th Congress. Hopefully, by that time, an appraisal will be available for review. Congress has tried to resolve the difficult challenges in acquiring this property before, and failed; cooperation among the parties may bring success this time around. I believe that in the end, we will be able to stand together and tell the American people that we truly have accomplished two great and innovative things with this legislation.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today, with great pleasure, I introduce `The Rural Employment in Telecommunications Industry Act of 1998.' 
The introduction of this Bill marks a historic opportunity for rural communities to create jobs within the telecommunications industry. The Bill establishes a program to train residents of low income rural areas for employment in telecommunications industry jobs located in those same rural areas. 
As many of my colleagues know, I have an initiative called `rural payday' and I believe this Bill is yet another step in creating jobs for our rural areas. All too often a rural area is characterized by a high number of low income residents and a high unemployment rate. 
Moreover, our rural areas are often dependent upon a small number of employers or a single industry for employment opportunities. Consequently, when there is a plant closing or a downturn in the economy or a slowdown in the area's industry the already present problems are only compounded. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment and talk about New Mexico. 
While New Mexico may be the 5th largest state by size with its beautiful mountains, desert, and Great Plains and vibrant cities such as Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and Las Cruces it is also a very rural state. The Northwest and Southeast portions of the state are currently experiencing difficulties as a result of the downturn in the oil and gas industry. Additionally, the community of Roswell has been dealt a blow with the closing of the Levi Straus manufacturing plant. 
As I stated before, rural areas that simply do not have the resources of more metropolitan areas can be simply devastated by a single event or downturn in the economy. And that Mr. President is why I am introducing `The Rural Employment in Telecommunications Industry Act of 1998.' 
The Bill will allow the Secretary of Labor to establish a program to promote rural employment in the telecommunications industry by providing grants to states with low income rural areas. The program will be a win win proposition for all involved because employers choosing to participate in the project by bringing jobs to the rural area will be assured of a highly skilled workforce. 
The program will provide residents with intensive services to train them for the new jobs in the telecommunications industry. The intensive services will include customized training and appropriate remedial training, support services and placement of the individual in one the new jobs created by the program. 
And that is what this bill is about, providing people with the tools needed to succeed. With these steps we are embarking on the road of providing our rural areas throughout our nation with a vehicle to create jobs. We are creating opportunities and an environment where our citizens can succeed and our communities can be vibrant.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today the United States Senate has taken a historic step in preserving one of America's treasures--Route 66. S. 2133, the Route 66 Corridor Preservation Act of 1998, will preserve the unique cultural resources along the famous Route 66 corridor and authorize the Interior Secretary to provide assistance through the Park Service. Congresswoman Heather Wilson of Albuquerque, New Mexico, introduced a companion bill (HR. 4513) in the House of Representatives. I am hoping that body will promptly act on this bill with the changes proposed by the distinguished Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Chafee. 
I introduced the `Route 66 Study Act of 1990,' which directed the National Park Service to determine the best ways to preserve, commemorate and interpret Route 66. As a result of that study, I introduced S. 2133 this June authorizing the National Park Service to join with federal, state and private efforts to preserve aspects of the historic Route 66 corridor, the nation's most important thoroughfare for east-west migration in the 20th century. 
The Administration testified in favor of this legislation, with some modifications. We've made some good changes to the bill, and Senator Chafee's amendment furthers progress for success of this Park Service program. This legislation authorizes a funding level over 10 years and stresses that we want the federal government to support grassroots efforts to preserve aspects of this historic highway. 
New Mexico added to the aura of Route 66, giving new generations of Americans their first experience of our colorful culture and heritage. Designated in 1926, the 2,200-mile Route 66 stretched from Chicago to Santa Monica, California. It rolled through eight American states, and in New Mexico, it went through the communities of Tucumcari, Santa Rosa, Albuquerque, Grants, and Gallup. Route 66 allowed generations of vacationers to travel to previously remote areas and experience the natural beauty and cultures of the Southwest and Far West. S. 2133 will facilitate greater coordination in federal, state and private efforts to preserve structures and other cultural resources of the historic Route 66 corridor, the 20th century route equivalent to the Santa Fe Trail. 
This bill authorizes the National Park Service to support state, local and private efforts to preserve the Route 66 corridor by providing technical assistance, participating in cost-sharing programs, and make grants. The Park Service will also act as a clearing house for communication among federal, state, local, private and American Indian entities interested in the preservation of the Route 66 corridor. 
As we draw to the close of this century, there is more interest in trying to save Route 66. I sincerely hope that this legislation is quickly passed on the House floor. The time is now to provide tangible means of assistance to preserve this special highway. 
The amendment (No. 3800) was agreed to. 
The committee amendment, as amended, was agreed to.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 4104, the Conference Agreement on the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Bill for FY 1999. 
This bill provides new budget authority of $26.9 billion and new outlays of $23.2 billion to finance the operations of the Department of the Treasury, including the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Customs Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and the Financial Management Service. The bill also finances the Executive Office of the President, the Office of Personnel Management, the General Services Administration, and other agencies that perform central government functions. 
I congratulate the Chairman and Ranking Member for producing a bill that is within the Subcommittee's revised 302(b) allocation. I also commend the Chairman's strong commitment to law enforcement throughout this bill, including support for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. 
When outlays from prior-year BA and other adjustments are taken into account, the bill totals $26.9 billion in BA and $26.0 billion in outlays. The total bill is at the Senate subcommittee's revised 302(b) allocation for nondefense discretionary budget authority and outlays. The subcommittee is also at its Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund allocation for BA and outlays.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am very pleased at the Senate's passage of S. 2402, the Old Jicarilla Administrative Site Conveyance Act of 1998. This legislation allows for transfer by the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior real property and improvements at an abandoned and surplus administrative site of the Carson National Forest to San Juan College. The site is known as the old Jicarilla Ranger District Station, near the village of Gobernador, New Mexico. The Jicarilla Station will continue to be used for public purposes, including educational and recreational purposes of the college. 
The Forest Service determined that these ten acres are of no further use to them, since the Jicarilla District Ranger moved into a new administrative facility in the town of Bloomfield, New Mexico. The facility has had no occupants for several years, and the Forest Service recently testified that the improvements on the site are surplus, and endorsed passage of this bill to provide long-term benefits for the people of San Juan County and the students and faculty of San Juan College. 
Clearly, this legislation deserves prompt approval in the House and signature by the President because it is noncontroversial and the land can readily be put to good use for San Juan College and the area residents. We also need to put this property in the hands of the college so it can protect the area from further deterioration and fire. 
Over one third of the land in New Mexico is owned by the federal government, and therefore finding appropriate sites for community and educational purposes can be difficult. S. 2402 is a win-win bill in providing facilities and lands to San Juan College and removing unwanted and unused land and facilities from federal ownership. I urge prompt passage in the House of Representatives. 
The committee amendment was agreed to. 
The bill (S. 2402), as amended, was considered read the third time and passed. 
The title was amended so as to read: `A bill to direct the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to convey certain lands in San Juan County, New Mexico, to San Juan College.'.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I'm pleased to see the Federal Research Investment Act presented for approval to the Senate. This bill, S. 2217, is one that I've supported through-out its history, because it addresses the health of our nation's science and technology base. 
Our science and technology base is vital to the nation's future. Any number of studies have confirmed its importance. As one excellent example, the National Innovation Summit, organized by MIT with the Council on Competitiveness, confirmed that the integrity of that base is one of the cornerstones to our future economic prosperity. At that Summit, many of the nation's top CEOs emphasized that the nation's climate for innovation is a major determinant of our ability to maintain and advance our high standard of living and strong economy. 
Advanced technologies are responsible for driving half of our economic growth since World War II, and that growth has developed our economy into the envy of the world. We need to continually refresh our stock of new products and processes that enable good jobs for our citizens in the face of increasing global challenges to all our principal industries. 
The Federal Research Investment Act continues the goal first expressed in S. 1305, that I co-sponsored with Senators Gramm, Lieberman, and Bingaman, to double the nation's investment in science and technology. Among other improvements, S. 2217 proposes a more realistic time scale for achieving this expanded support. 
This doubling must be accomplished within a balanced budget that avoids deficits, thus a longer period is a better choice. That balanced budget is essential, it enables the economic health that is fundamental to our ability to really use advanced technologies. 
The new bill continues to emphasizes a broad range of research targets, from fundamental and frontier exploration, through pre-competitive engineering research. This emphasis on a spectrum of research maturity is absolutely critical. The nation is not well served by a focus on so-called `basic' research that can open new fields, but then leave those fields wanting for resources to develop these new ideas to a pre-competitive stage applicable to future commercial products and processes. 
The new bill addresses a spectrum of research fields with its emphasis on expanding S&T funding in many agencies. We need technical advances in many fields simultaneously. In more and more cases, the best new ideas are not flowing from explorations in a single narrow field, but instead are coming from inter-disciplinary studies that bring experts from diverse fields together for fruitful collaboration. This is especially evident in medical and health fields, where combinations of medical science with many other specialities are critical to the latest health care advances. 
This new bill has additional features that weren't part of the earlier one. It proposes to utilize the National Academy of Science in developing approaches to evaluation of program and project performance. This should lead to better understanding of how GPRA goals and scientific programs can be best coordinated. The new role for the National Academy can help define criteria to guide decisions on continued and future funding. The bill also sets up procedures to use these evaluations to terminate federal programs that are not performing at acceptable levels. 
The new bill incorporates a set of well-developed principles for federal funding of science and technology. These principles were developed by the Senate Science and Technology Caucus. Those principles, when carefully applied, can lead to better choices among the many opportunities for federal S&T funding. The new bill also incorporates recommendations for independent merit-based review of federal S&T programs, which should further strengthen them. 
Many aspects of the Federal Research Investment Act support and compliment key points in the new study released by Representative Vern Ehlers just recently. His study, `Unlocking our Future,' will serve as an important focal point for continuing discussions on the critical goal of strengthening our nation's science and technology base. I've certainly appreciated interactions with Representative Ehlers as he developed his study and as S. 2217 was developed. 
The new Federal Research Investment Act builds and improves on the goals of the previous bill. With S. 2217, we will build stronger federal Science and Technology programs that will underpin our nation's ability to compete effectively in the global marketplace of the 21st century.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has passed S. 736--the Carlsbad Irrigation Project Acquired Land Transfer Act. I, along with Congressman Skeen, have been working to convey tracts of land--paid for by Carlsbad Irrigation District and referred to as `acquired lands'--back to the district, during the past several congresses. 
I introduced this bill in May of 1997 in order to transfer lands back to the rightful owners. This legislation will not affect operations at the New Mexico State park at Brantley Dam, or the operations and ownership of the dam itself. Furthermore, the bill will not affect recreation activities in the area. 
This legislation is specific to the Carlsbad project in New Mexico, and directs the Carlsbad Irrigation District to continue to manage the lands as they have been in the past, for the purposes for which the project was constructed. I believe this is a fair and equitable bill that has been developed over years of negotiations. The Carlsbad Irrigation District has had operations and maintenance responsibilities for the past 66 years. It met all the repayment obligations to the Government in 1991, and it's about time we let CID have what is rightfully theirs. 
This legislation accomplishes three things: Conveys title of acquired lands and facilities to Carlsbad Irrigation District; allows the District to assume management of leases and the benefits of the receipts from these acquired lands; and sets a 180-day deadline for the transfer, establishing a 50-50 cost-sharing standard for carrying out the transfer. 
The Carlsbad Irrigation Project is a single-purpose project created in 1905 by the Bureau of Reclamation, acquiring all facilities, lands and water rights of the privately-owned Pecos Irrigation Company. The CID has had operations and 
maintenance responsibilities for the irrigation and drainage system since 1932. 
During the 104th Congress, the Carlsbad Irrigation District presented testimony before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on one occasion, and before the House Committee on Resources on two occasions. Additionally, the administration expressed on several occasions before these two committees that they want to move forward with acquired land transfers where they make sense. The Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, Eluid Martinez, has informed the district and me that he believes that the Carlsbad project is one of several projects where the Bureau would like to pursue transfer opportunities. It is about time that we pass this legislation to provide the Bureau with the ability to accomplish their stated goal in a fair and equitable manner. 
This transfer shifts responsibility from the Federal Government back to a local entity, and creates opportunity for the district to improve and enhance the management of these lands. After a long wait, we have gotten administration support for this transfer in language substituted by the Senate Energy Committee, and have gained support from the Democratic side of the aisle. I hope that the House of Representatives will act quickly on this legislation so that the Carlsbad Irrigation District will promptly begin getting the benefits for that which they have paid.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have asked for this time today to address two serious and interrelated concerns: One, the President's plans to intervene in Kosovo; and, two, the already evident crisis in readiness of the U.S. military. 
There are some who believe that these two concerns should be dealt with separately. Some may argue that linking the two is merely an excuse for U.S. inaction. I wish to be very clear. Developments in Kosovo may compel the United States and our allies to intervene. However, this intervention should not be paid for by further hollowing out of the Armed Forces. 
I and many of my colleagues, will not support airstrikes in Kosovo, and especially a ground force presence, unless the President agrees to submit a budget that addresses the related readiness and operational tempo requirements of the U.S. military. 
Also, we must be careful not to believe that there is an easy or inexpensive long-term solution to the problems in Kosovo. The administration would have us believe that NATO airstrikes will somehow solve the problem. I, and many colleagues, disagree. 
The recent massacre of ethnic Albanians in two small villages in Kosovo has heightened awareness and condemnation of Serbian aggression. Powerful airstrikes and military action could send a strong and unambiguous message to the Serbian leader. As in Bosnia, empty threats of NATO action never does anything to get the job done. 
There is good reason to be concerned about 400,000 Albanians forced from their homes as winter approaches. I am concerned. I am deeply concerned about that. But I am more concerned about involving U.S. lives in ill-conceived military campaigns. I am deeply concerned that we will be sending an already weary and overextended military into a situation for which there is no quick and easy solution. 
Mr. President, as you know, the U.S. defense budget has declined for the past several years. At the same time, nontraditional deployments have stretched an already extended military force to its limits. This is largely the result of downsizing of our force structure while increasing the number and the frequency of deployments overseas for purposes other than a war. 
We have been asking our Armed Forces to do more with less for several years. They are finally admitting that they cannot do more with what the President has given them. Yet, the administration is asking them to still do more. 
Now I and many of my colleagues wish to ask the administration one question: Will you do more? Will you ensure that readiness does not suffer further? Will you stop the hollowing out of our military forces? 
Some may think that this readiness issue isn't real. I am sure there are those who think that there is no crisis in readiness. Well, I believe that a few examples of the crisis in readiness are absolutely persuasive. 
Here are just a few of the symptoms of this crisis: 
One, Navy pilot retention has sunk to an all-time low of 10 percent. This is the lowest in recorded history of pilot retention programs. 
Air Force pilot retention is at 30 percent, and it is projected to decline further. The Air Force is now 700 pilots short. 
The aircraft deployed on primary, peacekeeping deployments--such as Bosnia--are being `cannibalized,' meaning, they are being stripped for spare parts to keep at least a few flying. It is not uncommon for this to happen at a low-priority unit in the United States; however, allowing this to happen in the front-line deployments like Bosnia where we might soon go into combat is inexcusable. 
Aircraft carriers are being deployed with personnel slots empty. A recent report has one carrier on a peacekeeping mission with a crew that is lacking 1,000 persons to perform the essential tasks. In other words, the United States has aircraft carriers on missions that are lacking about 20 percent of what is considered a full crew. How ready are these carriers to perform their missions? 
We have Army units arriving for critical combat training at the Army's national training center in California with mechanics and `mounted' infantry simply missing. These units have junior noncommissioned officers filling roles traditionally filled by senior experienced noncommissioned officers. 
This is a problem that permeates every branch of the Armed Forces. We simply are not retaining the seasoned, well-trained military personnel and professionals. I and Senator Stevens are commissioning an important study by GAO to find out exactly why our military persons are leaving the service in unprecedented numbers. 
The troops that I personally visited in the Persian Gulf made it clear that morale is low there. They are tired of constantly being separated from their families. I believe this separation would be tolerable if the operational tempo required of them were humane. 
I believe the separation would also be eased, if they were assured that their families had adequate housing and food on the table. 
I believe the separation would be tolerable and their loyalty to the military secure, if it weren't for the fact that they also question the purpose of the missions. 
Mr. President, I believe we are failing own soldiers on all counts. 
That brings us to the question of money. There is simply not enough money in the defense budget as it is currently projected to do everything that needs to be done. There is an effort underway to provide emergency supplemental funding for military readiness. I support that effort. However, this will not solve the bigger problems.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report accompanying the Department of Agriculture and related agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999. 
The final bill provides $59.6 billion in new budget authority (BA) and $44.8 billion in new outlays to fund most of the programs of the Department of Agriculture and other related agencies. All of the funding in this bill is nondefense spending. The conference report now includes `emergency' funding totaling $4.3 billion in budget authority and $4.1 billion in outlays to provide relief to the nation's farmers. 
When outlays for prior-year appropriations and other adjustments are taken into account, the conference agreement totals $59.4 billion in BA and $51.6 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1999. Including mandatory savings, the subcommittee is $1 million in budget authority below its 302(b) allocation, and at its 302(b) allocation for outlays. 
The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee revised 302(b) allocation totals $59.4 billion in budget authority (BA) and $51.6 billion in outlays. Within this amount, $17.9 billion in BA and $18.1 billion in outlays is for nondefense discretionary spending, including agricultural emergency spending. 
For discretionary spending in the bill, and counting (scoring) all the mandatory savings in the bill, the final bill is $4.0 billion in BA and $3.9 billion in outlays above the President's budget request for these programs. The bill is at least $4 billion in both BA and outlays above the Senate- and House-passed bills, all due to the addition of the emergency disaster assistance for farmers. 
The disaster aid package includes $2.2 billion in direct payments to farmers experiencing crop losses due to natural and other disasters. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act as amended prohibits `emergency' spending for purposes of crop disaster assistance. The conference agreement includes directed scorekeeping language allowing the emergency designation to be used in this case. This conference report therefore violates Section 306(a) of the Congressional Budget Act by including legislative language under the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee that was not reported by the Senate Budget Committee. 
I recognize the difficulty of bringing this bill to the floor at its 302(b) allocation and in addressing the need for disaster assistance by farmers in many parts of the nation, including New Mexico and parts of the Southwest.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as United States Senators, we are often fortunate to have people of exceptional ability work for us. It is, however, unusual to have someone of unlimited compassion helping the people in the State we represent. Darlene Garcia is a person of unlimited compassion and I have been very lucky to have her on my staff for the last 20 years. 
Darline is the Director of my Las Cruces office. This is one of the fastest growing areas in New Mexico, and Darlene has her finger on the pulse on it all. She has helped hundreds of New Mexicans with their veterans benefits, social security, food stamps, and immigration problems. Darlene knows how to make the Federal Government do what it is supposed to do for its citizens. In fact, Darlene knows how to make U.S. Senators do what is right by their constituents. 
I sometimes say, there isn't any kind of care that Darlene hasn't championed be it health care, child care, or elder care. She has always worked for more and better care for the people of Southern New Mexico because it is Darlene who rally cares. Darlene is the doer of good deeds. If good deed were dollars, she would have surpassed Bill Gates years ago. 
Darlene always has a smile for everyone who walks into my office. She always knows who to call to solve a problem. She has been a mother figure and an inspiration to all of the young people who have interned in my Las Cruces office. 
Darlene has been my representative to the business community, worked extensively with county and municipal government officials and of course, the Hispanic community. She has worked on border issues and has helped keep the Texans under control The latter is no small feat. 
I want to thank Darlene for all of her hard work, and wish her the best in retirement. God bless you, Darlene, for all that you have done for me and for the people of New Mexico.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will take just a couple of minutes. I want to comment on the administration's discussions with us regarding Kosovo and just make one statement that I feel compelled to make on the Senate floor, which I have made to the administration and to a number of Senators. 
First of all, from this Senator's standpoint, it will be extremely difficult to support any kind of military action in Kosovo unless the President of the United States requests of us significant increases to the defense budget to address the shortfalls in military readiness, personnel, and modernization recently acknowledged by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
From my standpoint, we ought not be supporting additional military action and putting our men and our equipment in harm's way unless and until we have a game plan to put adequate resources into our Defense Department for the readiness shortfalls that already exist. 
The crisis in military preparedness that has only belatedly been acknowledged by the President and his administration is very grave. 
To support ongoing operations around the world, our men and women in uniform are deployed far away from their homes and their families for unprecedented lengths of time. Morale among many of our troops is suffering, and recruiting and retention statistics are dangerously low. Modernization of our force is seriously underfunded across the services. Training in many of the combatant commands must halt well before the end of the fiscal year due to funding and supply shortfalls. Nearly 12,000 military families are once again on food stamps. And failing to provide additional funding for potential costly military operations in Kosovo while United States forces are about to complete 3 years in Bosnia at a cost of nearly $10 billion will, in my opinion, severely and perhaps irreparably exacerbate the critical readiness crisis that exists. 
In summary, if the President expects this Senator to support Kosovo action--and I am not sure the administration seeks a resolution--I have just stated succinctly what I believe is an absolute necessity on the part of the President and his administration; that is, tell us how you are going to make our military ready again before you send them into harm's way again, when we already know that we are short of much of the equipment and parts and our military is in many respects lacking and deficient in readiness. 
I think it is a simple proposition. I think they have time to do it. I think it is serious. I think when many Senators find out about the readiness issues, they are going to be saying the same thing: Let's see how we are going to fix that before we engage in another battle. 
I yield the floor. I thank the Senator.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer strong support for the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999. As several of my colleagues in the Senate have also recognized, we owe a great deal of gratitude to Senator Thurmond. As a soldier and as a Senator, he has fought to defend our country and safeguard our national interest. 
I thank Senator Thurmond his unceasing commitment and untiring service to this country and its institutions. 
Mr. President, this legislation contains many positive things for the state of New Mexico--both in the programs funded and the changes made to enhance research and development efforts. 
The most significant contribution made by this legislation to R&D efforts in our state will be realized by eliminating several barriers to cooperation between national laboratories and the private sector. The partnerships among our federal laboratories, universities, and industry provide important benefits to our nation. 
A substantial amount of benefits are attainable in New Mexico, given the unique assets in this state. These partnerships help to create innovative new products and services that drive our economy and improve our quality of life. 
I am pleased that this year's conference ruled favorably on so many of the requests for increases that I put forward. Many of these increases will leverage unique assets and capabilities in New Mexico to ensure that our national interests are protected. 
The bill authorizes $4.5 billion for Department of Energy defense activities, much of which is done at Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), in addition to DOE's Lawrence Livermore facility in California. Approximately $2.5 billion of this authorization will be spent in New Mexico. 
In addition, the Defense Environmental Restoration and Waste Management programs are authorized at $5.44 billion. Of that, approximately $415 million will be spent in New Mexico for waste management functions, environmental restoration activities, technology development efforts, nuclear materials and facilities stabilization functions, and a variety of cost-cutting and program support initiatives. 
Several other important items for defense efforts in New Mexico that are authorized in the bill. 
For example, this year's authorization for the High Energy Laser System Test Facility (HELSTF) at White Sands Missile Range is $23 million, including $8 million for solid state laser research. An additional $10 million is authorized for further research in the Theater High Energy Laser (THEL), an effort jointly funded and supported by Israel. 
The Exploratory Development of Advanced Weapons technology at Kirtland's Air Force Research Laboratory is authorized at $129 million for the coming year. 
A total of $40.2 million is also authorized to support the Advanced Radiation Technology Program at Kirtland's Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). The lab is using its expertise in laser technologies to develop a new deep space imaging system, in addition to a special interactions development program. 
$24 million is authorized for Space and Missile Rocket Propulsion Program. The Air Force Laboratory at Kirkland is involved in this program. 
The Ballistic Missile Technology Program is authorized at $16. This funding was not included in the President's request. Kirkland AFRL and White Sands Missile Range are involved in this program. 
$75 million is authorized for the Advanced Spacecraft Technology Program, $32 million more than the budget request. These funds will advance space plane development, the Clementine microsatellite program at Kirkland AFRL, and the Satellite Orbital Transfer Vehicle which is worked on at the New Mexico Engineering and Research Institute. 
In a related endeavor, a total of $10 million is authorized for the Scorpius Low-Cost Launch program. This program utilizes assets at New Mexico Tech in Socorro and will be tested at White Sands in the coming months. 
The Airborne Laser Program is authorized at $235 million. The Special Programs Office for this critical Air Force effort in theater missile defense is located at Kirkland, and this program relies heavily on basic research in directed energy and adaptive optics at the AFRL there. 
The Air Force Operational Test & Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) at Kirkland is authorized at $29.5 million. This is $5 million more than the President's budget request and will support the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation Center's independent operational tests to evaluate weapon systems operational effectiveness and suitability. 
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Flat Panel Display Program is authorized at $41. This includes an earmark of $7 million for High Definitions Systems in integrated command and control technology. 
The Warfighter Information Network is authorized at $132.1 million for procurement of weapons communications equipment, including the Echelon Above Corps (EAC) communications program. This authorization level includes a $35 million increase to continue modernization of the Army's tactical voice and data communication system. Laguna Industries at the Pueblo of Laguna is involved in producing these shelters. 
$21.9 million is authorized for Ground Penetrating Radar Program & Landmine Warfare & Barrier Technology, including a $2 million increase for a ground radar and vehicle mounted mine detector. 
Also, this legislation authorizes military construction for several projects critical to the viability of New Mexico's military installations. 
This bill authorizes $6.8 million for the Nuclear Weapons Integration Facility and $1.8 million for the Fire Training Facility, as well as $6.4 million to improve family housing at Kirkland. 
Holloman is authorized $1.3 million for improvements to its War Readiness Materials Warehouse and $11.1 million to construct a state-of-the-art physical fitness center. 
$3.6 million is authorized for improvements to family housing at White Sands Missile Range, and a $3.3 million authorization is included to allow New Mexico's National Guard to build the Taos Armory. 
An additional $8 million is authorized to support the Big Crow Program Office--DoD's only asset for testing high power stand-off jamming capability in electronic warfare scenarios. 
These are some of the major programs related to U.S. military capabilities and research and development efforts that reside in the state of New Mexico. I thank Chairman Thurmond and the Senate Armed Services Committee for recognizing and supporting the many contributions to our national security needs that are based in New Mexico. 
Unfortunately, however, I cannot pretend that the measures contained in the legislation will ensure U.S. security. I cannot in good conscience purport that this legislation--or any legislation--can solve the current crisis faced by the armed forces. 
The strength of the U.S. military cannot simply be measured in numbers of soldiers or the state-of-the-art weapons they possess. The fortitude of this country's military is not only based on advanced weaponry, but rather is also a reflection of the strength of its morale. 
Mr. President, the morale of our military is under siege. When retired colonels are heard commenting that in their half a century of hanging around soldiers they have seldom seen the cutting edge of our fighting forces so dull, nor morale lower, there is good reason for concern. 
 Rather than focusing on the hardware issues encapsulated in the term `modernization,' I would like today to emphasize the problems with readiness, morale and quality of life. Equipment is secondary to the well-being of the men and women in uniform. The best weapons cannot bring about victory without adequate training in their use and the firm loyalty of the soldier to buttress the military objectives fought for. 
We are now in our fourteenth year of decline in defense spending. What can no longer be ignored is that the increase in non-traditional deployments coupled with down-sizing is steadily eroding readiness and morale. 
Our reduced force structure is overextended. Overextension is eroding retention rates, quality of life, operational readiness, and, most importantly, morale. Whereas the U.S. military had 22 foreign missions during the 1980s, they have already been involved in 36 foreign missions since 1990. 
At the same time, our forces have been down-sized by 35 to 40%. In addition, forward basing has decreased by two-thirds--from 39 major installations to 13. This translates into more forces based in the U.S. while deployments are overseas. 
The result? More frequent and longer deployments, due to down-sized forces and up-sized involvement in foreign missions. The OPS TEMPO required under these constraints lead to grueling days even after returning home from prolonged overseas missions. 
Some soldiers are currently required to spend up to 150 days away from their families annually. Then, upon returning home, they still have too many additional duties to really spend quality time at home. 
Retention rates continue to plummet, especially in the Air Force. This is not happening because we are not offering generous pay bonuses to re-enlist. Last year, 800 pilots refused re-enlistment bonuses of $60,000. The Air Force is planning to increase these bonuses to $110,000, but the Air Force is also planning for this problem to get worse. 
Why? Although military planners contend that competition with a booming U.S. economy and the private sector is the cause for defection, the reality is more complex and points to the same problems already discussed. Heavy deployment schedules and no down-time between deployments cause stresses on service personnel, especially those with families. 
A related issue is that the men and women in our armed forces increasingly believe that their loyalty is a one-way street. In addition to demanding more for less from our soldiers, their quality of life is also eroding. 
The United States, the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world, currently has military men and women who require food stamps to provide for their families. The Defense Department says it would be `too expensive' to solve this problem. 
Housing for our military families is also inadequate. According to a study from the Defense Science Board, 62 percent of our barracks and 64 percent of our family housing are unsuitable. In the face of this, the President's request for military construction and family housing for 1999 was $1.1 billion less than Congress provided in 1998. 
Some in Washington are saying this is a money problem. It is a money problem, but it is also more than that. It is also a leadership problem, and it is a question of how competently our defenses are being managed. 
Our pilots and other specialists are leaving the services in droves not just to get better paying jobs; they are also leaving because they are being worn out; and they are not getting the support they need from their own leadership. They are being worn out by repeated deployments. And they are not always convinced that what they are being asked to do makes sense. 
Back home their spouses resent the military for turning their families into single-parent households. And the quality of life offered to these military families can't begin to compensate. 
Is it any wonder that with a booming economy and plenty of good jobs available in the private sector that our soldiers are voting with their feet? Is it any surprise that given inadequate housing for the families back home that they rarely see due to deployments abroad for missions they don't understand that our soldiers are frustrated, ill-prepared and low on morale? 
Perhaps most disturbing, I am beginning to see too many reports that the leadership is not addressing the real problems. There seems to be an emerging question of the confidence in our military's senior leadership. There is a growing concern that the top leadership is not willing to make the hard decisions to restrain our military missions to the available human and material resources or to expand those resources to meet the increasing demand. 
That brings us back to the question of money. There is simply not enough money in the defense budget as it is currently projected to do everything that needs to be done. There is an effort underway to provide emergency supplemental funding for military readiness. I support that effort. However, this will not solve the bigger problems. 
Our military leaders are beginning to agree. In a recent Armed Services Committee Hearing with the Joint Chiefs, U.S. military leaders finally conceded that they do, indeed, have a severe problem. The $1 billion in supplemental funding will help, but according to the most recent Joint Chiefs' testimony, between $10 to $13.5 billion would be necessary in the coming year to meet U.S. defense needs. 
One thing is blatantly clear. We must strive to adequately feed, house, and train our most precious military resource--the men and women in our armed forces. To do this will mean more resources for our defense budget and it will mean better management of the resources--human and material--that we already have. 
For next year, for the fiscal year 2000 budget, I believe, we need to start the new millennium by at least stopping the ebbing tide and end the 15 year decline. 
Each year the Armed Services Committee is given the difficult task of balancing between current and long-term readiness under current budget constraints. In recent years, they have had the impossible task of ensuring that personnel, quality of life, readiness, and modernization programs are adequately supported, while funding levels remain insufficient to achieve that objective. 
The Committee recognizes, as do most of us concerned about our national defense, that combat readiness of our armed forces is at risk. The risk is a function of older equipment resulting from inadequate modernization and a force structure too small to meet ongoing demands. Aging equipment and weary soldiers cannot possibly defend this country adequately. Nor can dominance result from this equation. 
I am gravely concerned about preparedness, modernization and procurement. However, I am most concerned about the human element of our armed forces. The best equipment and the most rigorous training cannot compensate for too lengthy, too frequent deployments and time away from loved ones. 
Mr. President, the solution is clear. We must stop the ebbing tide in our national defense budget. If we don't the hollowing out of our military forces will continue. Our national security will be at risk during a time of international uncertainty and growing threats. Our soldiers deserve better and U.S. citizens are counting on us.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998. By reauthorizing the Higher Education Act (HEA) the Senate is making a down-payment on our nation's future. 
I would begin by saying: it is a simple fact that the future is prejudicial in favor of those who can read, write, and do math. A good education is a ticket to the secure economic future of the middle class. As the earning gap between brains and brawn grows ever larger almost no one doubts the link between education and an individual's prospects. 
And that is what the Senate is doing today, improving the post-secondary educational system of our country. 
What does the bill do in a nutshell? It improves financial aid opportunities for students, creates a unified program to promote excellence in the teachers our schools produce, and streamlines HEA by consolidating overlapping programs and eliminating unnecessary regulatory requirements. 
Mr. President, before I make some specific comments about provisions in the bill, I would like to first talk about how important the bill is for New Mexico. 
Approximately 100,000 students are enrolled in New Mexico's public colleges and universities, with about 53,000 students enrolled in community colleges and about 47,000 enrolled in universities. However, the number of high school graduates is expected to increase during the next decade and members of the current workforce are also expected to seek additional education during that period. 
Consequently, the state must have a high-quality, low-cost college education available to a growing number of students, regardless of income level, ethnic background or place of residence. 
Students attending New Mexico institutions received more than $200 million in financial aid, counting grants and loans from all sources, during the 1995-96 academic year. About 78 percent of that assistance came from federal sources, and during 1995-96, New Mexico students contracted for about $110 million in federal loans. 
Thus, I believe that educational performance is a crucial element in New Mexico's capacity to prosper in the extremely competitive national and international economy. 
New Mexico's colleges and universities directly and indirectly contribute to the economic vitality of the state, as they produce graduates with considerable intellectual depth and breadth, workers whose skills allow them to meet the demands of their employers, and first-rate research that helps to expand the boundaries of human knowledge. 
Mr. President, I would now like to turn and make a few comments about several of the provisions in the bill and especially one that will benefit New Mexico. 
Title V establishes a new part dedicated solely to supporting the needs of Hispanic Serving Institutions that is authorized at $62.5 million for fiscal year 1999. The funds may be used for construction or maintenance of instructional facilities, support of faculty exchanges and faculty development initiatives, the purchase of books and periodicals, technological and management improvements, and improving and expanding graduate and professional opportunities for Hispanic students. 
New Mexico has 17 designated Hispanic Serving Institutions that serve more than 23,500 Hispanic students. These school include Albuquerque Technical Vocational Institute, College of Santa Fe, College of the 
Southwest, Eastern New Mexico University-Roswell, Luna Vocational Technical Institute, New Mexico Highlands University (NMHU), New Mexico Junior College, New Mexico State University (NMSU) Las Cruces, NMSU-Carlsbad, NMSU-DonAE6a Ana, NMSU-Grants, Northern New Mexico Community College (NNMCC), Santa Fee Community College, University of New Mexico (UNM)-Los Alamos, UNM-Taos Education Center, UNM-Valencia County Branch, and Western New Mexico University. 
Title II, entitled Teacher Quality, focuses on improving teacher quality and the recruitment of highly qualified. First, the bill seeks to improve student achievement, through quality improvement of the current and future teaching force by improving the preparation of prospective teachers and enhancing professional development activities. Second, the bill seeks to increase the number of students who complete high-quality teacher preparation programs. 
Title III or the Institutional Aid Title creates a new grant program for Tribal Colleges and Universities to strengthen services to Native American students. I am especially pleased with this new program because of my longstanding involvement with the issues affecting Native Americans. Tribally-controlled colleges in New Mexico like the Crownpoint Institute of Technology, the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, the new Navajo Community College in Shiprock, and the Southwest Indian Polytechnic Institute (SIPI) in Albuquerque could potentially benefit. 
Student financial aid is given a huge boost through several changes. First, the bill increases the maximum Pell Grant levels to the following amounts: $4,500 for academic year 1999-2000; $4,800 for academic year 2000-2001; $5,100 for academic year 2001-2002; $5,400 for academic year 2002-2003 and $5,800 for academic year 2003-2004. 
The Federal TRIO Programs are given a boost through changes to the Student Assistance section in Title IV. I have always been a strong supporter of TRIO and most pleasing is how much the students, schools, and communities of New Mexico will benefit. 
The 1,900 current TRIO programs provide benefits to 700,000 students nationwide. Two-thirds of participating students come from families where neither parent attended college and whose incomes are below $24,000. 
The Dissemination/Partnership provision would encourage partnerships between TRIO programs and other community based organizations offering programs or activities serving at-risk students. 
The Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL) is stabilized in the following way. Student loan rates will be equal to the 91-day-T-bill-plus-1.7-percent while students are in school, and plus-2.3-percent during repayment after graduation. The interest amount is capped at 8.25 percent and for PLUS loans, rates will be the 91-day-T-bill-plus-3.1 percent, capped at 9 percent for borrowers and lenders. 
An innovative loan forgiveness program is also included for teachers. Up to $5,000 of a teacher's loans will be forgiven after five years of teaching for those choosing to teach in urban or rural school districts that serve large populations of low-income children. 
Mr. President, in closing I believe we are taking an important step forward today by making an investment in our Nation's future with the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.

Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to call attention to a study of market mechanisms in federal student loan programs, Section 801 of the conference report. I was pleased to see this issue addressed in the context of the Higher Education Act. As you know, Chairman Jeffords, our fiscal year 1999 Senate budget resolution raised concerns about the federal government setting interest rates for student loans and encouraged your Committee to look for a long term solution to the difficult problem of Congress setting these rates. I believe this study is a good first step and hopefully will give a good data on which to access where we go after the newly adopted student and lender rates sunset in 2003. 
One matter I wish to clarify with the Chairman is the participation of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in this study. CBO is a critical non-partisan analytical body on which we in Congress rely. By law they can not recommend specific policies or endorse the policy recommendations of others. I would assume then that the purpose for which you seek CBO's participation in the study for their expertise on student loans, and in general, study design and analysis.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in a moment I am going to ask consent on something, but I thank Senator Bond and congratulate him for what he did today. I don't know if we can do anything that is enough in response to the marvelous baseball year that Mark McGwire and others have given to the American people. 
I suggest that in an America that has grown so cynical about anything, wasn't it a marvelous thing to see how the people responded to the genuineness, the frankness, the decency of both Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa? Just remember, on a number of those very important home runs, those people who caught that ball, without one moment's hesitation--until right at the end, of course--they said the ball belongs to him; they weren't trying to get rich. It was just absolutely marvelous for the United States to see that kind of thing happen. 
Then to see the friendship between two people who are really at war in a very civil and different kind of way to break this title, which both of them did, which has been there for 37 years, and see how they related to each other. I think they have become genuine friends while they have proceeded, each in their individual way, to try to break one of the most important and difficult athletic standards in all of organized athletics worldwide. 
I believe if the Senate understands what has happened, they are going to approve that very soon. I commend the Senator for it, and I hope Mark McGwire and his family understand the reason for you doing this and why we are probably going to unanimously accept it. I thank the Senator. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business and then proceed to a unanimous consent request.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Federal Reserve today decided to cut interest rates, and this is a very important step toward restoring confidence and stability in the world's financial markets. It shows that the world's policymakers are taking an active role in ensuring that financial contagion does not spread further. It is also an insurance policy against further damage to the U.S. economy from international events which currently are out of our control. 
However, the U.S. Federal Reserve cannot resolve the current financial crisis alone. Investors are shunning the emerging markets because of a heightened sense of the risk that is there. In order to get money flowing to these regions again, nations must improve their banking regulations and must make information about their financial systems more available. This will assure investors and will help resolve much of the current crisis. 
As policymakers, we should aid the Fed's effort to restore international confidence by approving the International Monetary Fund's request with appropriate amendments. We should also remain confident that the Fed will continue to act in a way that ensures maximum U.S. long-term growth, as they have done in the past and, as I gather, they decided to do today.

Mr. DOMENICI. Distinguished Senator Harkin is the Senator who told me he is going to object. He is not here, so the Senator from Montana is objecting. 
I say to the Senate--in a way to the absent Senator Harkin--frankly, this is a completed conference report on one of the required annual appropriations bills. From what I understand, there is no objection to this bill. From what I understand, it passed the House 389 to 25. 
We are all engaged in trying to get the appropriations bills passed because that is our duty. We are supposed to have them finished before the fiscal year ends, and there are constant complaints that we don't get it done. 
Essentially, tomorrow is the end of the year. We worked very hard, Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate, to get this bill done, to meet it, have it within our allocation so it does not break the budget, to do it in the way that most probably will get a Presidential signature. 
The Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the entire Department of Energy, both defense and nondefense, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission--they cannot help Senator Harkin. They are all in this bill. They should get their funding. They can't help Senator Harkin solve the problem of the labor, health, and human services bill, which the Senator from Iowa thinks needs a further allocation of resources in order to accomplish what he, as ranking member, thinks should be done. 
In addition, I suggest, at the request of the President, this bill includes a provision to resolve a dispute between the District of Columbia courts and the Public Defenders Office. We included that provision in the bill because this has to be enacted before the end of the current year. If that does not happen, then the public defenders--the entire office, which defends those in the District who cannot afford their own lawyers, will not be able to meet its payroll. 
The leadership of the House and Senate Appropriations Committee wanted Senator Reid and me to address that problem, and we were able to do that with the help of Chairman McDade and his ranking member, Representative Fazio from the State of California. 
I hope Senator Harkin will reconsider this objection and will let us adopt this conference report. All I can say is, in all honesty, Senator Harkin and those who feel like he does, holding this bill up is not going to help one bit resolve the problem that centers around how much money should Labor, Health, and Human Services have to spend this year on its annual appropriations. It is just not going to help. 
There is nobody suggesting the money ought to come out of this bill. There is nobody suggesting that the solution to the problem, which is raised by the Senator from Iowa, can be solved by this bill or by this Senator. 
It has to be resolved, if a problem exists, through the leadership here and the chairmen of both of the Appropriations Committees, and I assume maybe even the White House. Since all of that would be required to resolve the problem, I once again ask, What good does it do to hold this bill up? And I hope that will not be a long-lasting event. 
I thank the Senate for considering this. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.

Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Harkin, let me thank you very, very much for the consideration you are giving us today in letting this very important bill pass. 
I think the Senator knows that while a lot of what I do as chairman of the Budget Committee is fun work, a lot of it isn't very much fun. That part that isn't very much fun is the issue of who is right on the scoring--OMB or CBO. I am charged with the responsibility, if there is a difference between them, of going through it, line by line, program by program, with my staff, and if there are, indeed, errors that run in favor of OMB, which means you would have more money to spend, if they are based on policy differences that were not taken into consideration when CBO did theirs, we make the adjustment. 
I can report, as staff on your committee knows, we have found $215 million in outlays where we found policy errors, and they came mostly from the IDEA program where they made changes and they were taken into consideration regarding the new policy costs, so we are at $215 now. 
I assure the Senator that I am totally aware of the difficulties in the bill. I will continue to review the scorekeeping baseline assumptions made for your bill by both OMB and CBO and see if there are any other adjustments that need to be done to accommodate the concerns the Senator has expressed on the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will try to stay within 5 minutes. I thank the Senate which will be adopting the conference report. It is a good report. 
We will put a statement in that identifies some of the very new approaches to better governance. We do not have that completely in the Department yet, but we have some new ideas that we are imposing on the Department that will permit it to be run a little better than in the past. 
I want to change to another subject, and that is the Tennessee Valley Authority and the $75 million that was, this year, put in the President's budget for the nonpower aspects of the Tennessee Valley Authority. 
Mr. President, I hope that nobody is trying to make political hay out of the fact that the U.S. House of Representatives would not fund the $75 million for the TVA in this year's appropriations bill, and as a consequence we did not fund it. Let me tell you why the House would not fund it, and make sure that the Record is replete with the background information that the U.S. House had last year and this year regarding the $75 million. 
First of all, there is a gentleman, who I do not know, named Craven Crowell--Chairman Craven Crowell. I think he was appointed to the board by the Clinton-Gore administration in 1993. 
In 1997, meeting with Members of Congress and the administration, the Chairman argued that TVA's so-called `nonpower programs,' which include flood control and navigation on the Tennessee River, as well as management of some unique resources on the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area, indicated that these nonpower programs should be transferred to other Federal agencies, leaving the Tennessee Valley Authority to focus solely on the production of electrical power. 
Less than 1 month later, this very proposal to no longer fund that kind of activity because it should be transferred to other Federal agencies found its way into the 1998 budget request. The TVA Chairman had made an interesting proposal just a couple of weeks prior, and already it had been incorporated into the administration's budget. There is no way that that would have happened if people in the administration had not been aware of what Chairman Crowell was planning to propose, and if they had not given him the green light to do that.

Mr. DOMENICI. This is a TVA release that suggests that Chairman Crowell and others have decided that they do not need the $75 million and that other Federal agencies are going to take over. And the U.S. House had this release, had the proposal to eliminate Federal funding of TVA's appropriated programs in January of 1997. 
Mr. President, what has happened is that after doing this, and leaving the distinct impression with the U.S. House Subcommittee on Appropriations that they were not going to need the money anymore, and surely were not going to need it for the 1999 appropriations bill, they have changed their mind. That is, both the Chairman down there in the Tennessee Valley Authority area and the White House. They now want the money, after going through all of this that I have just discussed with the Senate. 
Let me tell you, what they did by proposing this was to get all of those in the surrounding areas who do not necessarily agree with the TVA to join in saying they do not need the money. And there are private power companies who clearly do not think TVA needs this nonpower money. But both the administration and the Chairman, Chairman Crowell, had indicated they do not need the money. 
Mr. President, in spite of that, because the administration changed its mind, and the Senators from Tennessee and from Kentucky and others came to me and said, `Well, we know we said we don't need the funding anymore, but will you fund it another time for us?' I did. The Senate approved. 
Mr. President, what has happened is the U.S. House said no, 
and, frankly, there is no way to change their mind because what they throw back at us is, we were just told in 1997 that that was the last year we needed that subsidy, that $75 million. 
Frankly, if there is any blame to go around, it does not lie with the Senators, who did everything humanly possible. They got the Senate to fund it, they encouraged me to hold it, they even met with Members of the House to tell them to put it back in, but what they got was what we might have expected. 
You just told us last year you don't need it anymore. The chairman down there issued this plan saying we don't need it. The President's budget said we don't need it. 
Now, if there is any reason that we didn't get it, it is because of that, not because of partisan politics. There are no Democrats on the committee who went to conference with me who are in favor of that. No one in the House is in favor of it, because you tell the House, and apparently this is how it works over there; it is not too bad. It sounds like the way you would behave. Tell the House this is the last year we are funding TVA $75 million, and they aren't too sure you want to fund it anyway. You do it and then you come around and change your mind after you have had this exhaustive plan and this commission appointed so that you won't have to have this money. You come along and say, as I said, we need it in another year, and they are saying the House will not vote for it another year, we can stay here until Hades gets a little cool, but we will not approve it because you told us you don't need it, and now we have too much support against it and it will not be funded. 
I am very hopeful for those who wanted to point fingers either at this Senator because he is Republican or some of the other Senators from the Tennessee Valley area. It is not their fault. Frankly, I don't think it is the committee's fault. It is just one of those things where, the way the House argued the case, you can't make them change their mind. And what they said was pretty logical. They had some good points. I know the occupant of the Chair served in the House. When you tell the House committee you are not going to fund it one single year beyond this one and come back and say, after all those plans and us getting money out of you, we need another year, it is not easy. 
Nonetheless, I want to say I am trying, because the Tennessee Valley Authority has some very expensive interests on some outstanding long-term obligations, bonds and indebtedness, that they know they have to refinance, and in the process of refinancing, there would be a change in the interest rates. Obviously, it would be better and they would save money. We are trying to put together an amendment that would be taken care of as part of overall appropriations which would give them some interest rebate. So to the extent that this would help offset what they now think will be a big void because of the $75 million, we will try that. 
It actually has strong support from a number of Senators, including the Tennessee Senators, that we try to do this. I say to the people there, I am going to try to do this with their help and with the help of Chairman Stevens and others here in the U.S. Senate who I think will understand this issue and have understood it and will try to help us.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, H.R. 5060, the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1999, complies with the Budget Act's section 302(b) allocation of budget authority and outlays. 
The conference report provides $20.9 billion in budget authority and $13.0 billion in new outlays to fund the civil programs of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, certain independent agencies, and most of the activities of the Department of Energy. When outlays from prior year budget authority and other actions are taken into account, this bill provides a total of $20.7 billion in outlays. 
For defense discretionary programs, the conference report is below its allocation by $11 million in budget authority and $1 million in outlays. The conference report also is below its nondefense discretionary allocation by $20 million in budget authority and $46 million in outlays.

In addition, I hope the agency will examine further management initiatives, such as those currently under review, that might be necessary in the short term to address existing budget constraints and to ensure that the resources that are available are being utilized to maximize the likelihood of succession review of application for new technologies. 
I agree with the Senator from Georgia that the Commission should continue to monitor the workload of the SFPO to ensure that adequate resources are available to meet demand for application reviews.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I strongly support H.R. 4103, the Defense appropriations conference report for fiscal year 1999. The pending provides $250.5 billion in total budget authority and $168.1 billion in new outlays for the Department of Defense and related activities. When outlays from prior years and other adjustments are taken into account, outlays total $245.1 billion. 
There are some major elements to this bill that are important for the Senate to review. 
The bill is consistent with the bipartisan balanced budget agreement. 
It funds a 3.6 percent pay raise for military personnel, rather than the 3.1 percent requested by the administration. 
It contains quality-of-life enhancements for our Armed Forces, which total $455 million more than was requested. 
I strongly support this bill, and I urge its adoption. I want to complement the chairman of the Appropriations Committee on his very skillful handling of this important legislation and for his statesmanlike approach to some serious and troubling issues in this year's defense budget.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note the presence of the minority leader in the Chamber. I wish to state for the Senate that I understand the Energy and Water appropriations bill has a hold on the minority side, and I wanted to say if it has to do with the Tennessee Valley Authority, I would like very much to discuss that with the Senator because there is nothing we can do about it in this bill. But there is another thing we are going to do in another bill, and we would like to share that with you, whoever has the hold. I would very much like to do that. If that is the only hold, we can't fix the bill as far as TVA, but we can take some action to try to alleviate the problem in another way before we leave. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, on September 26, people all across America joined in the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation's `Walk to Cure Diabetes.' 
Today, approximately 16 million Americans suffer from diabetes. Heart and kidney disease, strokes, blindness, loss of limbs, and nerve damage are just some of the complications associated with this dread disease. An estimated 179,000 people die from this deadly disease and its complications every year. Unfortunately, diabetes rates are growing worldwide. 
I rise today to commend the `Walk to Cure Diabetes,' which is an effort to increase public awareness about this disease and to raise private sector funding for the search for a cure. 
In Albuquerque, my hometown, hundreds of New Mexicans participated in the `Walk to Cure Diabetes.' They joined thousands of Americans who walked and ran to raise more than $40 million to support research for better diagnosis, treatment and, ultimately, a cure to diabetes. 
I am heartened by the fact that participation in this grassroots effort is growing in New Mexico, where diabetes hits especially hard among our American Indian and Hispanic people. Among these populations, this disease is exacting a devastating toll. 
I would like to thank the `Team Domenici' runners, most of whom are associated with Albuquerque's Mountainside YMCA, who will represent my support for this endeavor. These `Walk to Cure Diabetes' team members included: Mary Howell, Chris Howell, Loretta Koski, Rosanna Thomas, Kim Babb, Loren Schneider, Mike Green, Chrissy Dukeminier, Becky Voccio, Stephanie Browne, Carole Smith, Jim Hughes, Debby Baness, and Lisa Breeden. 
Where the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and other organizations work to shore up private sector support, I am pleased that Congress and the administration have strengthened the federal government's investment in diabetes treatments and the search for a cure. 
When we negotiated the five-year Balanced Budget Agreement in 1997, I was pleased to have initiated $30 million annually for a five-year Indian Health Service (IHS) diabetes treatment effort aimed at American Indian populations where diabetes rates are almost three times the rate in the general population. We also provided another $150 million over five years for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for a similar effort aimed specifically at juvenile diabetes. 
As part of these national efforts, new resources will be put toward understanding Type 1 diabetes, which adversely afflicts thousands of young Americans. This form of diabetes occurs when the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas are inexplicably destroyed. 
This infusion of federal resources will also allow the IHS and CDC to establish a Diabetes Prevention Research Center in Gallup, N.M., to develop coordinated preventative efforts to help control the growing number of diabetes cases among American Indians. 
Dr. Gerald Bernstein of the American Diabetes Association has reported that the gene that predisposes a person to diabetes is five times more prevalent in American Indians than in whites, and twice as prevalent in blacks, Hispanics and Asians than in non-Hispanic whites. In the 1950's, the IHS officially reported negligible rates of diabetes among Navajo Indians. In less than 50 years, diabetes has gone from negligible to rampant and epidemic. 
In part, the diabetes problem in the United States can be helped by lifestyle changes among those people predisposed to the disease. A concerted effort is needed to teach people how proper nutrition, early detection and treatment can help save lives. This will not be easy. In the case of Navajo and Zuni Indians, for example, prevention can be difficult to incorporate into daily reservation life. Exercise programs may not be readily available, dietary changes may be contrary to local custom for preparing foods, or soft drinks may be routinely substituted for drinking water that is not plentiful or potable. 
These kinds of factors in Indian life will be studied carefully at the Gallup Diabetes Prevention Research Center. Recommendations and CDC assistance will be provided to IHS service providers throughout the Navajo Nation, the Zuni Pueblo, and other Apache and Pueblo Indians in New Mexico and Arizona. The improved diagnostic and prevention programs will flow from this Gallup center to all IHS facilities around the country. 
Through these efforts we hope diabetes rates will drop, and not continually increase as they have for the past four decades. The number of U.S. diabetes cases reported annually between 1980 and 1994 has risen steadily, from 5.5 million cases to 7.7 million cases. The number of diagnosed cases is up from 1.6 million Americans in 1958. 
The human toll is devastating and the medical costs of treating diabetes will continue to escalate unless our medical and prevention research efforts are more successful. While we still have not found a cure for diabetes, enough is known today to significantly control the negative end results of diabetes like blindness, amputation, and kidney failure. 
The `Walk to Cure Diabetes' has been helpful in raising public awareness of the growing diabetes problem. I am pleased that we in the Senate join this effort through federal funding, policy initiatives and moral support. 
Madam President, I would encourage my colleagues to note the 1998 `Walk to Cure Diabetes.' It is one step in the American quest to attack this awful disease and improve the situation for all the people who are susceptible to the ravages of diabetes.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I come to the floor not to discuss the pros and cons of an urgent supplemental, or any of the ingredients contemplated to be within it, but to render an accounting to the Senate, as best I can, of the request that the President has made for urgent supplemental funding that would come as an emergency funding, which means we would be spending the surplus that we have worked so hard to protect to pay for these items. 
The calculations that the Budget Committee staff has worked up for me would indicate that, as of now, the President's requests amount to $14.148 billion. That means that the President asks us to spend $14.148 billion for such things as agriculture emergencies, Y2K emergencies--the computer situation that may result in a disaster if we don't try to use some new system and the purchase of new computers to alleviate the problem that may occur in the year 2000--there is some Bosnia money; embassy security money; interior security, or terrorism money; state embassies money; treasury security; and an economic support fund. They are listed in detail in this statement.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I do not pass judgment on whether each and every one of these is something we should fund, nor whether each and every one of them is something we should not fund. I merely want to state to the Senate, and to those who are interested, that there seems to be a big argument going on now as to what is happening to the surplus and whether or not the Republicans in the U.S. House who want a tax bill are spending the surplus. 
Actually, I will tell everybody that in the first year, the 1999 year, that bill spends $7 billion of the surplus--if anybody is interested. The President's request for supplemental funding, emergency funding, not included in the budget--therefore, using the same fund--in the first year already amounts to $14.148 billion, and I believe I can say it is growing, because there is nothing in this number for special moneys that the Defense Department might need. There is some indication of a billion dollars for readiness. But the President's people are quick to say that won't be new money, it will be offset. Well, we will see what they are offsetting it with. 
The chiefs of staff are meeting here in the Congress to tell us what they think they need for readiness, and I understand their message is not a good one. It is one that says we are really getting behind with reference to the kinds of things needed to keep a strong military which is totally built around voluntarism--such things as getting behind in the amount of pay we are giving them, the kind of pensions we are giving them, and the readiness equipment. So we don't have anything in this accumulation that equals $14.148 billion. There is nothing for that part of anything that would be an emergency.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under Section 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for 1986. 
This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget through September 21, 1998. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of the 1998 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. Res. 84), show that current level spending is below the budget resolution by $17.1 billion in budget authority and above the budget resolution by $1.9 billion in outlays. Current level is $1.0 billion below the revenue floor in 1998 and $2.9 billion above the revenue floor over the five years 1998-2002. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $176.4 billion, $2.9 billion above the maximum deficit amount for 1998 of $173.5 billion. 
Since my last report, dated September 8, 1998, there has been no action that has changed the current level of budget authority, outlays, and revenues.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the question before the U.S. Senate is not whether the Federal Reserve Board should reduce interest rates; it is whether or not the U.S. Senate should say that the Federal Open Market Committee should promptly reduce the Federal funds rate. 
Any Senators who have traveled the world, including Europe, and are asked what institution that the United States has in place that is the best thing going for global success, American capitalism and prosperity, guess what they will say? 
They won't say the Senate, they won't say the House, they won't say the President; they will say the Federal Reserve Board and its Chairman, who have been permitted, by act of Congress, to act independently of political pressures. 
Now, frankly, there is a very serious problem with global economic faltering. Nobody has an answer to it. There are many suggestions as to what we didn't do that we should do. But I submit, for the world to find out, after Alan Greenspan and this Federal Reserve Board have done a most marvelous job in controlling interest rates and monetary policy that the whole world is looking at and saying they did it perfect, absolutely right--for us to come along now and say, `Well, look, that is really so, but we would like to tell them right now'--in a way taking away some of their independence because we want to put political pressure on them--`that they should promptly reduce interest rates,' frankly, I believe we will send the wrong signal, because I think the signal we need is the stability of the Federal Reserve Board making decisions on behalf of America, and America in a global market. That is the kind of stability that the world is looking for. 
You know, I don't think anybody believes--and I am not saying Senator Harkin does--that we should regularly on the floor of the Senate be critiquing the Federal Reserve Board and then telling them what they ought to do. I don't think anybody thinks that. But I think we are falling right into that trap here. 
I have suggested--and I give it again to the sponsor--why don't we do what we ought to do and say the Federal Open Market Committee should seriously consider reducing the Federal funds rate? That way, we would be chiming in by whatever vote occurs with many people who think that, but we would not take this time in economic history to say that we are opting to say that the U.S. Senate says you should do it promptly. That is my argument. The Senate can do what it would like. I believe we ought not adopt it. If we want to state our case in this regard, we ought to state it another way, so that we are just joining in with comments and observations, but not drawing a conclusion that says if we were doing it, we would change it right now and we urge that you do that and do it promptly. 
That is essentially the issue. 
Mr. President, we are in the most complicated quasi-world recession that we have been in perhaps in modern times because capitalism is faltering around the world--not because capitalism and entrepreneurship doesn't work, but there are institutions that have fallen apart in other countries that are affecting us. I have no doubt that the Federal Reserve Board is going to do the right thing. There is no doubt in my mind that they are. I also suggest that if they reduce interest rates, everybody should not expect that the world economy is going to get fixed. There are many serious problems that it won't fix. 
I reserve the remainder of my time. 
Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have been here a long time and I voted on that resolution that the Senator is talking about. I didn't think I ever voted on a resolution that told the Federal Reserve Board what to do in precise terms like, `Lower the interest rates.' The resolution that we adopted overwhelmingly was much more in the tone and tenor and words of what I recommended. It says: `They should continue to take such actions as are necessary to achieve and maintain interest rates low enough to generate significant economic growth.' 
Frankly, that is precisely what we ought to be doing. We ought to be saying take whatever action is necessary; we should not say to them that we are saying, as a matter of policy, you should lower the interest rates. We ought not do that to the Federal Reserve. It will not do anything but discredit them over the long run and add instability where stability is needed.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, the bill I am introducing today is the first step in addressing a longstanding unfairness that has blemished the conscience of New Mexico's history. It is an injustice that dates back to the time when Jefferson Davis, Daniel Webster, and Sam Houston walked the Halls of the Capitol as Senators. 
In 1848, the United States signed the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo with Mexico. Under this treaty, the United States acquired the territory that is now California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. The Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo solved some problems but created others. It failed to adequately protect the civil and property rights of the people living in the newly annexed territory. 
This bill is a very important piece of legislation. It is the opportunity to reverse the heritage of ill-will between the Hispanic people and the Federal Government. Hispanic descendants have been waiting for 150 years to get the Federal Government to fairly look into the land grant situation. 
We ratified a treaty with property rights guarantees provisions which, in retrospect, have turned out to be inadequate. John R. Van Ness, described the treaty as an enormous real estate deal, but the land grant claimants were led to believe that their property rights would be honored and protected. Some officials with the Federal Government, on the other hand, expected to get clear title to most of the land it was paying for regardless of the existing property rights of the Mexicans. 
The land grant applicants have endured hostile government officials. At one point, President Cleveland appointed William Andrew Sparks, as surveyor general for New Mexico. Sparks has been described by historians as `steeped in prejudice against New Mexico, its people and their property rights.' We had corrupt lawyers, and a confederation of opportunists who used long legal battles to acquire empires that extended over millions of acres--all at the expense of Hispanics. 
In 1891, the Surveyor General was replaced by the Court of Private Land Claims. The situation went from bad to worse because the court's procedures heavily favored the Government and the result was injustice. 
The New Mexico Court of Claims required that claimants prove that the Spanish or Mexican granting official had the legal authority to issue the land grant. Consequently, many New Mexico land grants were held to be not legitimate. As a result, the New Mexico court rejected two-thirds of the claims presented before it. Ultimately, by one account written by Richard Griswold del Castillo, only 82 grants received congressional confirmation. This represented only 6 percent of the total area sought by land claimants. The Court of Private Land Claims enlarged the national domain of the Federal Government at the expense of hundreds of Hispanic villages, leaving a bitter legacy. 
This bill is based on legislation recently passed by Congressman Bill Redmond. This is a major piece of legislation, and I commend Congressman Redmond. He came to Washington, and he quickly identified one of the most important and longstanding disputes that his constituents have had with the Federal Government and he took decisive action. He passed a major bill to begin the process of seeing what these claims were all about and adjudicating them, if possible. 
Members retire from 20- and 30-year careers and never achieve the passage of an important piece of legislation, and yet, Congressman Redmond got this bill passed in the House in his first term. 
Congressman Redmond's bill creates a Presidential commission to adjudicate the community land grants located in New Mexico. It is designed to benefit descendants of Mexican citizens who settled in Mew Mexico before the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. The purpose of the legislation is to determine which community land grants could be reconstituted from land currently held by the Federal Government--and I repeat, from land currently held by the Federal Government. The legislation finally implements the spirit of Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. 
I told Congressman Redmond that I would sponsor his bill in the Senate, and today I am introducing the companion bill. I am proud to do so. 
I have made some changes and only a couple of additions in the version of this bill that I am introducing today. 
The changes are based on the lessons I have learned from talking to the heirs of some of the land grants; and from reviewing the history; and from talking to scholars, historians, and land grant lawyers. 
I want to thank Roberto Mondragon, Max Cordova, Estevan Arellano, Joyce Guerin, Georgia Roybal, Juan Sanchez, Pedro Gutierrez, Jr., and Roberto Torrez for their invaluable help. 
I have also asked the Indian leaders to review the legislation in draft form. While I have not yet received their comments, I want them to know that I view their issues to be important, and I look forward to working with them and for them. 
First, it seems to me that the Federal Government needs to take an affirmative role in obtaining the necessary documentation needed to prove the validity of the community land grant claims. Unfortunately, many of the New Mexico documents were destroyed during the Pueblo revolt. But scholars have told me that the Mexican and Spanish governments have ever-improving archives that may indeed contain what these New Mexicans need. This bill requires the Secretary of State to negotiate an agreement with Mexico and Spain for access to the documents. It seems especially appropriate that in 1998, as New Mexico celebrates its 400th anniversary of the first Hispanic settlement, that our Government would begin negotiating the necessary agreements for access to these critical and historically significant documents. 
In reading the histories it seemed to me that there was a lot of ambiguity in the treaty and even more ambiguity and discretion in the statutes establishing the Surveyor General and the Court of Private Land Claims. 
I believe history supports my view that ambiguity works to the detriment of the land grant claimants. Therefore, I propose that before the commission begin its work on adjudicating specific claims it first develop clear and concise rules so that everyone will be treated fairly. This legislation requires the Presidential commission to be formed and then to develop a Code of Land Claims Procedure that would be reviewed by the Energy Committee to insure that it is fair in the Senate and its counterpart in the House. 
Once the documents are available and the rules have been spelled out, the commission would be ready to adjudicate the land claims. 
Trying to do justice 150 years after the fact is complicated. This legislation holds harmless private land owners and the Indians of New Mexico with reference to their claims, their lands, and with reference to access to their sacred sites. It makes sure that title companies and lenders will be satisfied that this legislation and any petitions for reconstituting the land grants will not adversely affect private property. It makes sure that our State Engineer is satisfied with the criteria used to deal with land claims without upsetting our system of water rights. I believe we can all agree that we do not want to have the Federal Government interfering in these various areas. 
The legislation calls upon the commission in its Code of Land Claims Procedure to have a clear set of rules for what can and cannot be done for our Indian people. 
I am hopeful that this bill can address what has for too long been a tale of land loss and denial without creating new problems or injustices.

[El Tratado de Guadalupe-Hidalgo soluciono algunos problemas pero creo otros. No protegio adecuadamente los derechos civiles y de propiedad de la gente que vive en el territorio nuevamente anexado.] 
Este proyecto de ley es un pedazo de legislacion muy importante. Es la oportunidad de invertir la herencia de la mala voluntad entre la gente hispanica y el gobierno federal. Los descendientes hispanicos han estado esperando 150 anAE6os para inducir al gobierno federal para mirar con justticia las concesiones de la tierra. 
Ratificamos un tratado con las provisiones de las garantias de los derechos de propiedad que, en retrospeccion, han resultado ser inadecuadas. John R. Van Ness describio el tratado como reparto enorme de las propiedades inmobiliarias, pero condujeron a los demandantes de la concesion de la tierra a creer que los derechos de propiedad serian honrados y protegidos. Algunos funcionarios con el gobierno federal, por otra parte, esperaban para obtener titulo claro a la mayoria de la pista que lo pagaba, sin importar el derecho de propiedad existente de los mejicanos. 
Los demandantes de la concesion de la tierra han aguantado a oficiales hostiles del gobierno. En una punta, el Presidente Cleveland designo Guillermo Andrew Sparks como el agrimensor general para Nuevo Mejico. Sparks han sido descrito por los historiadores segun lo `empapado en prejudicar contra Nuevo Mejico, su gente, y los derechos de propiedad.' Teniamos abogados corruptos y una confederacion de los oportunistas que utilizaron batallas legales largas para adquirir los imperios de tierra que extendieron muchos millones acres--todos a expensas de los hispanos. 
En 1891, el Agrimensor General fue substituido de la Corte de las Reclamaciones Privadas. La situacion fue de malo a peor porque los procedimientos de la corte favorecieron fuertemente el gobierno. El resultado fue injusticia. 
La Corte de Reclamaciones de Nuevo Mejico requirio que los demandantes prueben que el funcionario espanAE6ol o mejicano que concedio tenia la autoridad legal para publicar la concesion de la tierra. Por lo tanto, muchas concesiones de la tierra de Nuevo Mejico fueron llevadas a cabo sin ser legitimas. Consecuentemente, la Corte de Nuevo Mejico rechazo dos tercios de las reclamaciones presentadas. En ultima instancia, por una cuenta escrita por Richard Griswold del Castillo, solamente las concesiones del ochenta-y-dos recibieron la confirmacion del Congreso. Esto represento solamente seis por ciento del area total buscados de los demandantes. La Corte de las Reclamaciones Privadas de la Tierra agrando el dominio nacional del gobierno federal a expensas de los centenares de aldeas hispanicas, dejando una herencia amarga. 
Esta proyecto de ley se basa en la legislacion aprobada recientemente por Congressman Bill Redmond. Este es un pedazo de legislacion importante, y aplaudo Congressman Redmond. El vino a Washington, identifico rapidamente uno de los conflictos mas importantes y de muchos anAE6os que sus componentes han tenido con el gobierno federal, y el tomo una accion decisiva--el aprobo una cuenta importante para comenzar el proceso de juzgar estas reclamaciones. 
Algunos miembros se jubilaron de 20- y 30 anAE6os y nunca alcanzan el paso de legislacion importante, pero, Congressman Redmond consiguio la aprobacion de esta cuenta en la Casa de Representantes en su primer termino. 
La cuenta de Congressman Redmond crea a una Comision Presidencial para juzgar las concesiones de la tierra de la comunidad situadas en Nuevo Mejico. Se disenAE6a para beneficiar a descendientes de los ciudadanos mejicanos que colocaron en Nuevo Mejico antes del Tratado de Gudelupe-Hidalgo. El proposito de la legislacion es para determinarse que concesiones de la tierra de la comunidad se podrian reconstituir de la tierra tenida actualmente por el gobierno federal. La legislacion finalmente pone el espiritu del Tratado de Guadalupe-Hidalgo. 
Dije a Congressman Redmond que patrocinaria su proyecto en el Senado, y estoy introduciendo hoy el proyecto del companAE6ero. Estoy orgulloso hacer tan. 
He hecho muy pocos cambios y solamente un par de adiciones en la version de este proyecto que estoy introduciendo hoy. 
Los cambios se basan en las lecciones que he aprendido de hablar con los herederos de algunas de las concesiones de la tierra; de repasar la historia; y de hablar con los eruditos, historiadores, y los abogados de la concesion de la tierra. 
Deseo agradecer a Roberto Mondragon, Max Cordova, Estevan Arellano, Joyce Guerin, Georgia Roybal, Juan Sanchez, Pedro Gutierrez Jr., y Roberto Torrez por su ayuda inestimable. 
Tambien he pedido los caudillos de los Indios para repasar el bosquejo, y mientras que yo todavia no he recibido sus comentarios, quisiera que supieran que creo que sus asuntos son muy importantes, y miro adelante a trabajar con ellos. 
Primero, me parecia que el gobierno federal necesita tomar un papel afirmativo en la obtencion de la documentacion necesaria para probar la validez de las concesiones de la tierra de la comunidad. Desafortunadamente, muchos de los documentos de Nuevo Mejico fueron destruidos. Pero los eruditos me han dicho que los gobiernos mejicanos y espanAE6oles tienen archivos siempre mejorando. Esta proyecto requiere a la secretaria del estado negociar un acuerdo con Mejico y EspanAE6a para el acceso a los documentos. Se parece especialmente apropiado que en 1998, cuando Nuevo Mejico celebra su 400o aniversario del primer establecimiento hispanico que nuestro gobierno comenzaria a negociar los acuerdos necesarios para estos documentos criticos e historicamente significativos. 
En la leyenda de las historias, me parecia que habia mucha ambiguAE4edad en el tratado, y aun mas ambiguAE4edad y discrecion en los estatutos que establecian el agrimensor general y la corte de las reclamaciones privadas de la tierra. 
Creo que la historia sostiene mi opinion que la ambiguAE4edad trabaje al detrimento de los demandantes. Por lo tanto, propongo que antes de que la Comision comience su trabajo sobre el juicio de reclamaciones especificas, primero se convierte reglas claras y sucintas por lo tanto cada uno sea tratado con justicia. Esta legislacion requiere a la Comision presidencial ser formada y despues desarrollar un Codigo del Procedimiento de las Reclamaciones de la Tierra que seria repasado del Comite de la Energia para asegurarse de que todo es justicia. 
Cuando los documentos sean disponibles y se han explicado las reglas, la Comision serian listas para juzgar las reclamaciones de la tierra. 
Tratar de hacer la justicia 150 anAE6os despues del hecho es complicado. Esta legislacion sostiene inofensivos a propietarios privados de tierra. Se cerciora de que las companAE6ias de titulo y los prestamistas sean satisfechos que esta legislacion no afectara al contrario la caracteristica privada. Se cerciora de que nuestro Ingeniero del Estado este satisfecho con los criterios usados a encargar de las demandas de la tierra sin trastornar nuestro sistema de los derechos del agua. Creo que podemos todos convenir que no deseamos que el gobierno federal interfiera con nuestro sistema de los derechos del agua! 
La legislacion requere a la Comision en su Codigo del Procedimiento de las Reclamaciones de la Tierra para tener una coleccion clara de reglas para lo que se pude hacer o no se puede hacer para los indios. 
Estoy confiado que este proyecto que tiene demasiado tiempo sin dar cuenta de la perdida de la tierra y de la negacion se resolvera sin crear nuevos problemas o injusticias. 
Gracias, Sr. presidente.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I traveled to the recent Summit meeting in Moscow. At that Summit, a protocol was signed that will, if successfully implemented, safeguard 50 tons of Russian weapons-grade plutonium and transform it into new forms that should ensure that it is never again used in nuclear weapons. 
I've placed special emphasis on this agreement for many months, and I invested a great deal of personal effort to achieve success. I welcome these recent steps. At the same time, I recognize that this protocol only creates an opportunity for real progress, we have to go far beyond just signing the protocol to secure the benefits that it can provide. 
I've spoken out in the past on the need to ensure that Russian stocks of weapons-grade materials do not find their way to terrorists or rogue states. The current financial crisis in Russia only adds further emphasis to these concerns. The former Soviet Union relied on guards and guns to safeguard their fissile materials. Now those guards may not have been paid for months--that has to increase our concerns. At the Summit we certainly heard about the tremendous burdens being borne by the Russian people from the current economic uncertainties and rampant inflation. 
Some programs already exist to improve the protection of nuclear materials. The Materials Protection Control and Accounting program is demonstrating some real successes in improving this situation. But the current opportunity to remove 50 tons of weapons-grade material from potential weapons use is most unique. I've worked to be sure that we quickly seize it. In fact, my visit to Russia in July with Senators Thompson and Grams was motivated largely by my interest in finding ways to progress more rapidly with this 50 tons. 
After that visit in July, I spoke with you about my misgivings with the Administration's plan to couple the rate of weapons dismantlement to the rate at which the weapons-grade plutonium could be used in reactors, as mixed-oxide or MOX fuel. At that time, the Administration was planning for Russia to use about 1.3 tons of this material per year in a set of Russian reactors. I argued that this was far too slow a rate. It would take 35 years to dispose of the 50 tons at that rate--none of us can be the least bit sure that the current window of opportunity for progress with Russia will stay open anywhere near that long. 
In July, I proposed that we structure an agreement that decouples the initial steps in dismantlement from the final step of reactor use. Specifically, I believed that the Russians would accept a program that targets a goal for moving 10 tons per year of weapons-grade plutonium through the weapons dismantlement step, through conversion of classified shapes into unclassified ones, and into safeguarded storage. These steps have the effect of significantly reducing the risk that this material will be re-used in weapons. 
We still need to proceed with the final disposition of the Russian plutonium in reactors, and I want to accomplish that step as rapidly as possible as part of our overall integrated program on plutonium disposition. But construction of MOX fuel fabrication facilities, plus limitations on the number of reactors in Russia that can accept MOX fuel, will lead to slower progress for this final step. 
I discussed this approach with President Clinton in late July and encouraged that plutonium disposition be a focus of his next Summit. I appreciate his willingness to include this subject at the Moscow meetings. 
I've just recently corresponded again with the President to outline my suggestions on key principles that should guide our negotiations of the detailed agreements required to implement the new plutonium disposition protocol. In that letter, I repeated my strong advice that he appoint a special envoy charged with the entire plutonium disposition effort. This program requires coordination across multiple federal agencies, as well as negotiations with Russia and the G-7 countries. In my view, an envoy who commands domestic and international respect, and who clearly has Presidential authority, is essential to expedite success. 
I listed six key negotiating points in my letter to the President. First, I emphasized that agreements must focus on rapid progress for the initial steps of the process, the dismantlement, conversion of classified shapes, and the safeguarded storage. These steps can and should be targeted at a rate of 10 tons per year. 
Second, all milestones that we establish to gauge progress must include sufficient transparency that we can be positive that agreed-upon steps are accomplished. 
Third, Russian plutonium must eventually be used in MOX fuel, but the rate for this step will be much slower than 10 tons per year. Nevertheless, we need to make progress toward this ultimate goal and this step must be part of the overall integrated program. I also noted that in my conversations with Russian leadership, they are very sensitive to achieving the best utilization of their plutonium. They believe that new generations of reactors can best utilize some of their plutonium. I believe that we should respect their interests, as long as the weapons material is always stored under effective safeguards while awaiting eventual use. 
Fourth, we should minimize the construction of new Russian facilities. We should seek and perhaps help to convert some existing Russian facilities. For example, some of their weapon production facilities should be converted to weapon dismantlement. 
Fifth, it is important to involve the other G-7 countries. Plutonium represents a global risk prior to disposition and careful disposition of plutonium is a global benefit. For that reason, we should encourage meaningful participation from our G-7 friends as we work together on these goals. 
And finally, we should assure that any U.S. resources that subsidize the Russian Federation's program are provided only upon assurance that tasks and milestones were satisfactorily completed. 
It will be a challenge to negotiate agreements that follow these six points, but it is essential that we promptly start serious negotiations. I'm pleased to be informed by the Administration that the first discussions with the Russians on this subject will occur very soon. 
In closing, I want to note that this current emphasis on disposition of excess weapons materials is only one action in what I hope will be a long series of important steps toward dramatic reductions in global risks and tensions. This agreement is important, but it has to be followed by more agreements. Each of these subsequent agreements must be carefully and fully implemented, and should target further reductions in the large world-wide stocks of weapons materials. 
In order to achieve these reductions, new agreements have to be in place to inventory global sources of fissile materials; and obviously all nations will eventually have to participate to achieve real success. Other future agreements need to provide reliable counts of actual warheads, and eventually to dramatic reductions in the numbers of such warheads. 
Our long term goal should be a world without nuclear weapons, but that goal will only be achieved by many many years of patient progress toward intermediate goals. Each step along this journey must be focused on further reductions in global tensions and in risks of international conflicts. 
In the near term, I am committed to the importance of the disposition of the current 50 tons of Russian excess weapons-grade plutonium. We have a golden window of opportunity to rid the world of materials for thousands of nuclear weapons, we must not squander the chance. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, let me say that it is most appropriate that we take this action tonight during the second week of Hispanic Heritage Month in the United States. It is quite appropriate, while we are honoring the contribution which Hispanic culture has made to our country, that we are now saying to one group of Hispanics who live on the island of Puerto Rico that we are willing to see you take a vote regarding whether or not you would choose to become the next State. 
Mr. President, this resolution affirms that the first step in any change of political status for the community of Puerto Rico rests with the people of that island. When they express that opinion in December--December of this very year--then it will be up to Congress to take whatever steps are necessary to consider that decision. 
Let me say that there are a number of Senate heroes with reference to this Puerto Rico resolution. First, I must say that the individuals most likely to recall the difficulties of taking a vote and deciding whether to become a State are the citizens represented by those Senators whose States were last admitted, or close to being last admitted. So the hero tonight is Frank Murkowski of the great state of Alaska. For anybody wondering, that is not a Hispanic name--Murkowski--but it is a name of European descent, perhaps Polish. He understands what it is for a State to go through this process of deciding whether you are going to become a part of the Union, the United States of America. 
I remind the Puerto Ricans--who are Americans in their own right--that Americans think that the United States is so important that we had a Civil War over whether you could unilaterally drop out of the Union once you joined it. So I want you to take it seriously, Puerto Rico, because it is serious. We had the biggest battle within the borders of our own Nation about the issue of keeping this great country together, and you should know that and you should be concerned about that. 
Secondly, let me suggest that in the State of New York there is a Senator named Senator D'Amato, and the Puerto Ricans know that is not a Spanish name either; it is Italian like mine, Domenici. But this Senator from New York understands what the Puerto Ricans in his State and the Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico mean to our Nation. He has always been willing to give the people in Puerto Rico an opportunity to determine their destiny. And I believe second to Senator Murkowski on our side of the aisle, behind the scenes, Senator D'Amato has made it very clear that this night should occur--not next year or the year after, but now. So I compliment my good friend and a friend of the Puerto Rican people in New York and across the country. I compliment the Senator for his tremendous, tremendous regard for what Puerto Rico believes is right and fair. 
I must say, from the other side of the aisle, it is most interesting that tonight we have a series of Senators with these strange names--Murkowski on our side, D'Amato on our side, Domenici speaking, and Torricelli from New Jersey. I compliment Senator Torricelli for his vigilant and absolute persistence that something should be done on this issue before we leave here. 
So tonight, without any question, the Puerto Rican people can already say across the island and throughout the rest of America, because it is a foregone conclusion, that the Senate will vote on this resolution propounded by the Senator from Alaska, Senator Murkowski. Frankly, it will pass overwhelmingly. There will be no dissenting votes tonight, because for those who would like to dissent, they have already decided that they are not going to make a point of it. 
As a consequence, we are going to approve this in just as formidable a way as if we had voted, when the U.S. Senate says without a dissenting vote tonight, that we agree with this resolution. 
Mr. President, once again, many of us came here from around the world, or our parents or grandparents did. And we know the validity and the great value of America. We hope the people in Puerto Rico understand that and act accordingly. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the overriding of the President's veto on partial-birth abortion. Before I give my comments and observations, I want to look across the Senate to the freshman Senator from Pennsylvania, Rick Santorum. I want to say to him that when he spoke on this issue today, and when he spoke on this issue the last time we debated it here, I was never more proud of a Senator than I was to observe him and watch him. I can assure him that even though he may not have won the last time in terms of what we are doing in a veto override, and he may not win this time, there are millions of Americans who have watched him. Whether they were concerned about this issue or not, if they watched for a while, they are concerned right now. You can't ask for anything more. 
I read the Senator's wife's book with reference to the problems they had with reference to an abortion they had no control over, an early delivery of a child that died. I am so proud, I can hardly express it tonight. 
I want to once more congratulate him for what he has done here on the floor of the Senate. It is not easy, but he did it with great, great style. 
Mr. President, this debate is about infanticide. Frankly, I didn't dream that concept up. There is a very distinguished Senator from the State of New York--I know Senator D'Amato from New York is here and I think he would concur when I say a distinguished Senator named Senator Moynihan--who looked at this problem and it didn't take him very long. We talk all around it. He talked right to it when he said this is infanticide. 
So this debate is about humanity and necessity. The procedure of partial-birth abortion, to put it bluntly, is inhumane. 
By now, many Americans are uncomfortably aware of the details of partial-birth abortion. They have heard the testimony of doctors who performed this procedure, nurses who witnessed this procedure, and they have most likely seen informational ads or read descriptions of this procedure. Maybe they have even watched us debate this issue on prior occasions. So I am not going to go through the details of the procedure. I will only say that, at a minimum, it is cruel and inhumane. I find it ironic that our Constitution, via the eighth amendment, protects criminals from cruel and unusual punishment; however, that same amendment does not protect innocent babies when it comes to cruel and inhumane procedures that are known as partial-birth abortions. 
Proponents of partial-birth abortion claim that the procedure is rare, occurring only about 500 times a year. However, that is simply not true. The number of partial-birth abortions is closer to between 3,000 and 5,000 a year. In New Jersey alone, at least 1,500 procedures are done each year. Besides being inhumane and quite prevalent, partial-birth abortion is also unnecessary. 
Opponents of this legislation argue that partial-birth abortion is necessary to protect the health of the mother. However, most experts say this is also simply not true. According to more than 500 doctors nationwide, who make up what is called the Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, it is never--I repeat never--medically necessary to perform a partial-birth abortion to protect the health or fertility of the mother. A former Surgeon General, who we admire and respect when he sort of agrees with our views but we ignore him when he disagrees, Surgeon General Everett Koop, has also stated that partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to protect the mother's health or fertility. So amidst all this evidence, how can the opponents of this bill tell the American people that partial-birth abortion is sometimes medically necessary? 
If this procedure is not medically necessary, why do we allow it? As I told you, Mr. President, this debate is not about Roe v. Wade or the choice of life. It is not about any of those things. But it is about a baby, a life that is destroyed in a cruel and inhumane way. It is about a life that is unnecessarily destroyed and need not happen. It is for these reasons that I will gladly vote to override the President's veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997. 
I suggest tonight to my good friend, the leader of this cause, that if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. If indeed that means that you have already tried three times, then try and try again. What is so patently right will soon prevail. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself just 5 minutes for some opening remarks. 
From our standpoint, I would like very much the distinguished Senator from Louisiana to take a few minutes of my time because the Senator from California spoke longer than 5 minutes. I will yield time to the Senator from Louisiana for his comments. 
First of all, Mr. President, it is too bad that the MMS, the Federal agency that is establishing these rules, doesn't have better credibility with those that they are proposing rulemaking against. You need not have the industry that you regulate think that you are totally against them--arbitrary, or somewhat capricious--in order to get your job done. 
As Senator Boxer has indicated on at least three occasions, this only affects 5 percent of the oil companies. That is MMS's view. That is the agency of the Federal Government that thinks these rules are wonderful. 
From my standpoint, I would like to tell you what the independent producers say. Frankly, I believe this is as valid as an MMS evaluation. The IPAA--that is the independents across America--say that the percentage of oil producers impacted by the oil royalty rule is 100 percent. In fact, this is their principal concern this year, that these proposed regulations, if adopted, will have a serious impact on many, many independent producers. Frankly, I believe that is the case. 
First all, MMS, the regulating agency, has permitted so broad a latitude under the rubric of unreasonable that I believe they can do almost anything. It is not certain what the rules will be when they are completed. They will be very uncertain. Litigation will not disappear. It will become more rampant.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are here on the floor of the Senate, it seems to me, proposing a set of rules that would like to gouge for oil bucks, gouge for oil royalties. 
Let me state for the Senate a couple of facts about oil production in the United States and about the cost of oil that I believe are startling. 
First of all, about 3 weeks ago--I don't know what the exact measurement is today--one of my staff members drew some comparisons in terms of what oil is worth today, what gasoline is worth today for our automobiles and for our Nation. If you go to a supermarket, I say to my friend from Illinois, or if your wife does, and she buys bottled water, she will pay more for a gallon of bottled water than Americans are paying for gasoline for their cars. That is good economics for America, but it is bad economics for America's oil independents, for America's independent producers. Because, just as that truism indicates that gasoline and oil producers have been at an all-time low for the last 5, 6 or 7 years, oil production is going down in the United States. Many independents who have been stalwarts are literally saying they do not know if they can make their bank payments for 1 additional month. 
Here we come to the floor with an amendment that is saying, let the regulators impose new regulations, and we sing the praises--at least the Senator from California does--that it is going to get more money out of the oil companies. That sounds wonderful. In fact, it is kind of alleged here this morning that, you know, they--these oil companies--are just taking money out of somebody's purse so we ought to go after them like we would go after somebody who took a purse away from somebody. 
Mr. President, if you are going to take more money from the oil producers of this country--and we are already becoming more and more dependent on foreign oil, and the price of oil is going down and down--I ask you, won't you in about 3 or 4 or 5 years get less by way of oil royalties than you are getting today by shutting off American production and causing some more of them to get closed? Where will the royalty come from as we produce less oil, rather than more? 
So whether it is $60 million, $70 million, $80 million or $100 million that allegedly will come in, that is not the test of whether the rules are fair. If we imposed those kinds of regulations on any industry we regulated, could we stand up and say we just got $50 million from the patent applicants of the United States because we just increased the fee? But you have to ask, what is fair, what is right, what is just, not just are the regulators right because they picked up more money. 
Before we are finished, we will go through a litany of arbitrary, confusing regulations that they intend to pursue. They are just looking for a little window--I can tell you these regulators are--because there is a moratorium right now. They are hoping against hope that they will get an 8- or 10-day window when there is no moratorium so they can slap on these. 
I want to tell them here and now that they are going to have a hard time doing that, because I believe we will prevail today, and I believe we will make sure that any bill that goes to the President for signature is going to have this on it. 
Having said that, I reserve the remainder of my time, excepting I would yield whatever amount of time that Senator Breaux from Louisiana desires.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Breaux from Louisiana as much time as he desires. 
Before I do that, I just want to make an observation. I just read a most authentic history of Theodore Roosevelt, and my observation to the Senator from Illinois is he wouldn't take this case so he wouldn't be down here arguing on anything because he would look at the facts, and he would say I don't want to be on the wrong side of the facts. He wouldn't be down here anti-anything. He would leave the argument to somebody else. 
I yield to the Senator.

Mr. President, let me just say, immediately after Senator Landrieu spoke, I wanted to get up, but I did not timely, so Senator Boxer spoke. But I commend her. I think she made a very brief statement today, but I think it was right on point. For those who are looking for a succinct wrap-up of what this issue is about, that 5 minutes is a very good summary. 
The issue is whether the new set of rules is going to solve the problem of litigation and of making things clear and reasonable and easy to understand, or is it going to invite more litigation? And I think the industry, small and large, come down on the side that it is too complex, leaves too much to the subjectivity of the Mineral Management Service, and has a number of rules that are so arbitrary and onerous that this is not going to help us out of the mess we are in. I am saying it my way; I think Senator Landrieu said it her way. But before we are finished, we will talk about that some more. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, since I have considerably more time than the distinguished Senator from California, I would like to make a few remarks and then save a few minutes for Senator Gorton, the manager of the bill. 
Mr. President, fellow Senators, first of all, there has been a lot of talk about lawsuits that are out there that have been going on for years on end. Essentially, fellow Senators, the reason that a new set of regulations and rules were supposed to be adopted was so we wouldn't have all of that litigation; so that we have a more clear-cut definition of what is market value for oil and gas, rather than leave so much to subjectivity, to arguments and disputes. 
Let me suggest, if that is the case, that I can almost promise the U.S. Senate that if the rules that the Minerals Management Service is proposing to adopt are adopted that they will all be back in court over and over again, because they are unintelligible. They leave many opportunities for the Minerals Management Service to second-guess. They leave at times many opportunities to go back in an audit and even undo the market value as determined by a company upon the advice of people from the MMS. 
Mr. President, when I was a Senator in the middle of the Iranian-prompted crisis where we had lines--Senator Hutchison's statement was that they even shot at each other in New York in one of those lines early in the morning because somebody thought one car was moving ahead of them. You might have been Governor, I say to the occupant of the Chair, when that happened. You may remember that. 
During that period of time, a gentleman in my State, who is currently one of the most successful and marvelous businessmen in the retail marketing of oil and gas products in my State, was down in a little office where his business was beginning. He begged me to come and see him. I went to see him. And a grown man was on the brink of falling apart. Whenever he would talk, he would cry, because the then-U.S. Government Energy Department had been told by Congress to enforce some very vague rules about gouging. 
Here comes auditors to that man's office. He can't give them enough. They come back month after month, and his business is floundering. And they want more information. They want to go back further in time. They want him to bring in his customers and let them talk to the enforcing agency about the various arrangements. 
I pledged to him right then that, not knowing the facts, I would see that he was treated fairly. He was. He succeeded in getting around that, and is surviving, as I have just indicated, bountifully. 
Mr. President, what we don't want to let happen is we don't want a new set of regulations that permit a bureaucracy, however much we must rely on them--the MMS--to go into American energy producers in the manner that I have just described for my good friend down in Artesia, NM. 
I contend that is what is going to happen, because, pursuant to congressional requests, some of us, Democrats and Republicans, sat down at the table with the MMS and the industry. And it is absolutely a cinch based upon the disagreements that occurred around that table and the failure on the part of the MMS to consider what many of us thought to be a very reasonable request; that if we let these get adopted, we haven't seen anything yet with reference to tying up this money in litigation and arguments. As a matter of fact, there is even a position in these new rules where the MMS can actually contend that a company would sell below market value to avoid the 12.5-percent royalty. Does that make sense to anyone? When you sell below market and give something away, you are giving away 12.5 percent to the Government, but you are keeping 87.5 percent of your own money. Right? But there is something in here to make sure they don't sell below market. There are so many nuances. I am not sufficiently expert. Again, I think I know when I see something that isn't going to work. 
Let me conclude. Industry is not to blame for the current rule. The MMS wrote it. All producers are affected by it--not 5 percent. Under current law, MMS can collect the royalties that are fair market value. Nothing is stopping them. Anybody thinking we are going to stop collecting royalties is mistaken. We are going to keep on collecting them under a set of rules that are very unreasonable and complicated. But why substitute another set that we think is going to do equally as bad and maybe move even more arbitrarily against the producers of energy in this country? There is a concept within it that you are guilty until proven innocent. There is, as I said before, a notion that producers will sell cheaply to avoid a royalty. Why would anybody do that? I just explained that to the Senate. 
There is extensive opportunity for second-guessing. The scourge of the regulated is to have regulators second-guess. That is the scourge. You have one answer and you thought you were abiding by it. But they second-guess it and you get audited. And there is another set of rules. These rules are unworkable. One well, 10 different valuation calculations for on-shore oil; one well, 8 different valuation calculations for off-shore. 
For whatever has been said here today about who we are working for in opposing the Boxer amendment, actually what I believe is happening is we are saying to a bureaucracy of the U.S. Government that we have had a good view of how you make rules, we think you are doing it in an unreasonable manner, and we would like you to do it better, so we are not going to give you any money to enforce what you have proposed to do. 
Essentially, all the arguments have been made about how important gas and oil production is for our Nation. We understand that. But this is not an issue about anybody cheating. It is an issue about whether a new set of rules is better than the old ones when we firmly believe they are not. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the junior Senator from Wyoming. I have heretofore on other occasions accepted and supported his various concerns in this area, but I want to share with him and the Senate a situation that perhaps deserves some special consideration for New Mexico, even if it is for a time certain. Let me, as best I can, explain this. 
First of all, there is a case called the Seminole case, very much understood in Indian country. It pertains to gaming in this manner. The Federal courts have ruled under the Seminole case that the States are immune from suit and that means they can't be sued by an Indian tribe. So we start with that premise. 
In the State of New Mexico, we have 14 Pueblos and two Apache tribes that have gaming houses and have compacts. But the compacts are very different than anyone else's in the country, for a couple of reasons. 
First of all, in order to make the compacts valid, the Supreme Court of the State of New Mexico ruled that the legislature had to be involved in getting this done, not just the Governor. The State of New Mexico, through its legislature, I say to my friend Senator Enzi, came along and imposed, not by way of compact agreement, but just imposed as part of the authority for the Governor to enter into a compact, that each casino owned by the various Indian groups be charged 16 percent on gross slot machine revenues. 
Obviously, that has not been negotiated, and my friend from Nevada is talking about compacts that are negotiated and that he doesn't know of any situation where they were not negotiated. I am suggesting one where they were not negotiated, but pursuant to a mandate from the legislature that charged them 16 percent gross tax on slot machines. They either took it or left it. The Secretary, I say to the Senator from Wyoming, said, `I'm not going to sign the pacts, because if I sign them, I am at least implicitly agreeing that the legislature can tax Indian casinos.' 
He let the pacts go in under a provision that says if he doesn't sign it within a certain amount of time, it goes into effect anyway. 
We have compacts with our Indian tribes being assessed 16 percent, and I am not here to ask the U.S. Senate for relief from that, for I don't even know if 16 percent is right or not. All I know is it is a very big piece of money for very small casinos, but we have nothing yet in New Mexico that rivals the smallest, most minute casino in the State of the distinguished Senator from Nevada who just argued in favor of the Enzi amendment. They are very small casinos, with one exception, and even that is not a rival to anything the Senator has in a State that has legalized gaming. 
Our Indian people would like to contest the 16 percent. Isn't it interesting, the Seminole case, which I just recited, prevents them from going to court, so they can get no relief from what they want to argue is an illegal imposition of this license fee, or at least arbitrary and unreasonable based upon what they are making. There they sit. 
The point of it is there is at least a hope and an avenue for potentially getting this issue into the courts if you leave the section in the law that Senator Enzi chooses to remove from the law, because it provides for a remediation section and a Secretarial procedure which is being removed, so we will leave them in the status quo with no way to challenge. 
Frankly, I repeat, I don't know whether their challenge is going to be valid or not, but it seems a little bit unfair that there is no way to challenge it even when a Secretary of the Interior is suggesting that the States didn't have the authority to impose that tax or that much. The Secretary can't do anything about it either, because all he does is sign the pacts or let them go into effect based on the expiration of time. In either case, you will have left the 16 percent license fee, gross fee, in place with no way to challenge it in any court because of the Seminole case. 
I say to the Senator from Wyoming, he is probably going to win today. I haven't had a chance to explore how we might effect some justice and fairness here, but I do suggest that it is at least right for me to come down here and object, and I believe there might be a way that you can ameliorate New Mexico's problem by exempting them, by leaving the statute that we are concerned with in place for the New Mexico licensed casinos. 
If you say you don't want it anywhere else, you want to wipe it out because it may have an opportunity to get around the need for compacts, you could at least leave it in effect somehow or another for those in New Mexico who are suffering under the situation which I have just described. 
Having said that, because of this, obviously I can't vote aye on the amendment. You don't need to worry because I haven't been out lobbying Senators because this is a particular problem, very peculiar and particular to New Mexico. The Indian people think they have a case for just fairness, that they ought to be able to challenge this, and they will never have a chance to challenge it if your amendment wipes out the statute which gives the Secretary some additional power.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering S. 2237, the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999. 
The Senate bill provides $13.5 billion in budget authority and $8.7 billion in new outlays to operate the programs of the Department of the Interior and related agencies for fiscal year 1999. 
When outlays from prior year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the bill totals $13.5 billion in budget authority and $14.0 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1999. 
The subcommittee is below its section 303(b) allocation for budget authority and outlays.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I commend the full committee and our Interior Appropriations Subcommittee for the hard work on this bill. As a member of the subcommittee, I am especially grateful to our chairman, the distinguished Senator from Washington (Mr. Gorton) for his sensitivity to the special needs and concerns of New Mexicans. We live in a State with vast Federal land ownership. Programs within the Interior Department and the Forest Service, especially, which are funded by this bill, have a major impact on the lives of my constituents. As in previous years, it has been a pleasure working with Senator Gorton to craft a bill that is good for both New Mexico and the Nation. 
I am especially pleased that this bill accommodates additional funding for the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center in Albuquerque and the El Camino Real International Heritage Center, as well as for Bandelier, Aztec ruins and Petroglyph national monuments, the Rio Puerco watershed rehabilitation, and the Middle Rio Grande Bosque Research proposal. This bill also provides increased funding for the vanishing treasures initiative and continues support for my Indian diabetes initiative. 
At a time when we are asking every committee of the Senate to work with tight spending caps to preserve and extend the progress we have made in balancing the budget, the committee has reported to the floor a bill that still provides for an increase in spending for our national parks. Hard choices were made to achieve this increase and I applaud the committee's work in providing this increase. 
Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the bill.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, 1998 is a very special year for celebrating Hispanic roots in New Mexico. This year we are commemorating the 400th anniversary of the first permanent Settlement in the Southwest, which took place in the EspanAE6ola Valley near San Juan Pueblo of New Mexico in 1598. 
Dozens of meaningful and beautiful events have already been held in honor of this anniversary. I participated in a particularly stirring event at the San Gabriel Chapel in EspanAE6ola last spring. The Spanish Mayor of EspanAE6ola, Richard Lucero, organized a very special event with Governor Earl Salazar of San Juan Pueblo and Governor Walter Dasheno of Santa Clara Pueblo to unveil the design for a commemorative stamp featuring the San Gabriel Chapel and the `Spanish Settlement of the Southwest--1598.' This is 22 years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock. 
The Governors and the Mayor exchanged stories about the importance of their respective cultures to each other. All those present were moved by the stories of lasting friendships formed on baseball fields, and marriages between Indians and Hispanics. There were also strong expressions of Hispanic and Indian intent to keep forging their futures together, along with the Anglo culture. I wish those meaningful stories and moments could have been enjoyed first hand by more New Mexicans. 
In July, I was back in EspanAE6ola for annual fiesta and the official first sale of the United States commemorative stamp. This starkly beautiful stamp has done more than I first imagined to bring a new unity to the historic EspanAE6ola Valley. Both the Spanish and Indian cultures in this valley have openly expressed and celebrated the positive aspects of bringing two distinct cultures together. 
The Quarto Centenario, or 400th Anniversary, is a most vital and memorable commemorative year for New Mexicans and for our nation. New Mexico's newspapers are reporting many of the historical details of the early Spanish colonization of the Southwest. Educators and museums are providing many opportunities to revisit our state history through music, dance, and lectures. 
The Archdiocese of Santa Fe has recently published `Four Hundred Years of Faith.' This fascinating review of the critical role of the Catholic Church in shaping the culture of New Mexico is well told and beautifully illustrated, including photographs of all the Catholic Churches in New Mexico. 
Don Juan de OnAE6ate, the original Spanish colonizer, was accompanied by the Sons of St. Francis who walked into northern New Mexico with OnAE6ate in 1598. As described in the book from the Archdiocese, `What resulted from the first struggles was nothing less than the birth of New Mexico culture and Catholicism that can truly be called indigenous to this land. The reconciliation between the Spanish and Indian people produced a faith capable of adapting to different circumstances, as well as being inclusive of the many different peoples already present and those that would follow.' 
`The eminent Pueblo scholar Professor Joe Sando has written of these positive accomplishments. He notes that the Pueblo Indians have fared much better under the Spanish than the Indians on the East Coast of the United States. There are no Indian markets in Boston or New York. Their Indian culture was pretty well destroyed. In New Mexico, Indian culture still flourishes.' 
Spain has also been an active participant in the Quarto Centenario. The Vice President of Spain, Francisco Alvarez-Cascos, and the Spanish Ambassador to the United States, Antonio de Oyarzabal, and their delegation visited key Spanish historic sites in New Mexico last spring. 
This Spanish delegation traveled to EspanAE6ola and San Juan Pueblo, where OnAE6ate's original expedition established the first Spanish settlement in the Southwest. A powerful reconciliation meeting was held with New Mexico Pueblo Indian leaders at San Juan Pueblo. 
At this historic meeting, Indian leaders stressed the beneficial aspects of Spanish settlement, like art, agriculture, trading, government, and the introduction of Catholicism. The Indian proclamation, however, also stated that the period of settlement `brought great suffering and pain' for both the Pueblo people and the colonizers. 
This day of reconciliation in late April focused on forging stronger ties between Spain and the Indian pueblos, with the promise of educational, economic development and cultural opportunities. 
As a follow-up to the promises of this historic reconciliation, hundreds of New Mexicans, are planning to go to Spain in November on a trade and cultural exchange mission. 
The Spanish Vice President Alvarez-Cascos summarized the day in his remark that, `We are the sons of our past history, but we are also the fathers of our future.' He said the two peoples `want to know each other better to build a new friendship.' 
A sacred buffalo dance was performed by Pueblo dancers with men wearing authentic buffalo headdresses. Hundreds of New Mexicans attended this outdoor event on the San Juan Pueblo Plaza in spite of the blustery weather. The spirit of unity and harmony was apparent to all who attended. 
Thus the original site where OnAE6ate met the Ohkay Owingeh Indians, Place of the Strong People, and renamed their home San Juan de los Caballeros (hence, the San Juan Indians), was also the sight of a powerful reconciliation meeting 400 years after OnAE6ate proclaimed it the capitol of the Kingdom of New Mexico. 
The Spanish delegation also visited the site of the future Hispanic Cultural Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico. As planned, this will be our nation's largest Hispanic cultural center. 
To build this national and international cultural center, local public and private contributions have been raised, exceeding $20 million. These funds will build an art gallery, museum, restaurant, ballroom, ampitheater, and literary arts center. 
Federal money of about $18 million will be used to match these local contributions and to build the planned Hispanic Performing Arts Center. Altogether, approximately $40 million will be invested in this new cultural and educational attraction featuring the many aspects of Hispanic culture, history, and arts. 
We New Mexicans are looking forward to this new showcase for Hispanic art, dance, music, food, and history. I feel a new pride among Hispanics of New Mexico as they prepare to offer this new treasure for the enjoyment of visitors from all over America and the world. 
In master calendars of New Mexico events for the Cuarto Centenario, over 180 events are listed. These range in purpose from lectures and reenactments to cultural performances, and parades. Prominent New Mexico women in the arts, politics, and education will be featured in `Nuestra Mujeras' (Our Women). The `Dia de La Raza' (Day of Hispanics) will be a major event in October with events at the University of New Mexico, the new Albuquerque Civic Plaza, and the Albuquerque Museum. When moving events like these are attended and remembered, New Mexico and America will have a better sense of pride in its Spanish roots. 
As our nation celebrates and acknowledges Hispanic Heritage Month in 1998, I wish to commend the thousands of New Mexicans who have worked so hard to bring their Spanish heritage to the forefront during the Cuarto Centenario--the 400th anniversary of the first permanent Spanish settlement in the Southwest. Americans can be grateful for these fine moments of remembrance, reconciliation, and cultural gems for creating a stronger future.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the First Amendment to the Constitution mandates that Congress shall make no laws which abridge the freedom of speech. The freedom to engage in political speech is the bedrock of our democracy. We may not like what people say when they exercise their First Amendment rights, but this Senator acknowledges that everyone has the right to engage in political speech. 
This bill places unconstitutional limits on the First Amendment rights of individuals, groups and even unions. The bill creates a rule which virtually prohibits any political ads by individuals, groups and unions which mention specific candidates within 60 days of an election. 
That would serve to muzzle political speech at the most critical time during a campaign. Not only is this unconstitutional, it is bad policy, because it will only serve to make the media more powerful. 
I have examined the provisions in this bill very carefully, and even on the slightest chance the Supreme Court would find these provisions constitutional, I ask my fellow Senators: is this good policy? 
The reason I ask this question is that, in my view, when you muzzle the political speech of individuals and groups, whose voice will then carry the day? 
In our zeal on both sides of the aisle to address the role of certain entities in our elections, we need to ask ourselves: what will be the consequence of restricting the free speech rights of unions, corporations and wealthy individuals to engage in campaign-related speech? In my mind, by restricting freedom of speech for these groups, we will make the media an even more powerful player in the political process. 
During the 60 days prior to the election when the so called bright line rule is in effect, the only one who will be able to speak directly about the candidates will be the news media. 
We all know the saying around Washington: `you shouldn't pick a fight with someone who buys paper by the ton and ink by the barrel.' Because it enjoys the full protection of the First Amendment, we call the media the Fourth Estate, or the Unofficial Fourth Branch of government. The media are the `Big Opinion Makers'--they write the editorials, present the news and decide which issues deserve the attention of the American people on a daily basis. 
We also know that members of the media are only human--and by that I mean that they are opinionated. Their opinion tends to lean in favor of a liberal, Democrat agenda. Recent surveys have shown that close to 90 percent of the media votes for liberal Democrat candidates. What of their independence? What about their role in the election of federal officials? 
Thomas Jefferson once wrote: There are rights which it is useless to surrender to the government, but which rights governments always have sought to invade. Among these are the rights of speaking and publishing our thoughts. 
This bill is a giant step toward Congress invading the rights of many to engage in political discourse and surrendering those rights to the media. In my view, you can choose McCain/Feingold or you can choose the First Amendment. I choose the First Amendment. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the legislation before the Senate, I rise in strong support of the objectives set forth in this bill. As we all know, this legislation would establish a policy for the U.S. to develop and deploy a national missile defense as soon as technologically possible. This system will defend all 50 states against any limited ballistic missile threats. 
Mr. President, allow me to offer a couple of observations about the changed international and national security environment which directly impact U.S. defense needs. The original impetus for a national missile defense system was the perceived threat from the Soviet Union during the cold war. 
Although some assume that the collapse of the Soviet Union and the continued thaw in previously frosty relations with Russia have rendered such defensive capabilities unnecessary, this view is naive. I believe that in many respects the threat has actually increased. 
The increased threat results from several interrelated factors. The collapse of the bipolar geopolitical order defined by U.S.-Soviet confrontation has ushered in multipolar instability. The threats we confront today as a nation are diffuse. Moreover, our potential enemies are abundant in a world where interstate relations are no longer delineated according to membership in one of two ideological camps. 
I would like to emphasize a further change brought about by changes in the international environment. An additional aspect of the post-cold-war world is the rapid and, in some cases, uncontrollable diffusion of advanced technologies. While earlier non-proliferation efforts relied heavily on stringent export control regimes, heavy reliance on multilateral controls is insufficient to protect U.S. interests.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under Section 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for 1986. 
This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget through August 31, 1998. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of the 1998 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. Res. 84), show that current level spending is below the budget resolution by $17.1 billion in budget authority and above the budget resolution by $1.9 billion in outlays. Current level is $1.0 billion below the revenue floor in 1998 and $2.9 billion above the revenue floor over the five years 1998-2002. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $176.4 billion, $2.9 billion above the maximum deficit amount for 1998 of $173.5 billion. 
Since my last report, dated July 30, 1998, CBO has completed its estimate of the budget authority for the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (P.L. 105-178). As a result, the current level of budget authority has been reduced by $923 million. This report also incorporates the budget authority, outlay, and revenue impacts of the Homeowners' Protection Act (P.L. 105-216), the Credit Union Membership Access Act (P.L. 105-219), and an Act to establish the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund (P.L. 105-223).

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have just adopted a resolution paying our respects, without any doubt in my mind, to one of the most wonderful women who has worked in the Senate, Angela Raish. She has worked in my office for 21 years. Many hundreds of people in the Senate and many thousands out in my State and around the Nation know her as one of the best women who has ever served in this institution. She served this Senator well, but in doing that, she also has helped literally hundreds of people who none of us are even aware of. We are going to pay tribute to her later in the week with an event here in the Senate, and there will be a lot of people who will come to say thank you to Angela. 
I wanted to take with us to that event this resolution where the Senate recognized her 21-year effort. The resolution accurately depicts much about her life and what she has accomplished, the many outstanding jobs she has held, and obviously the longest tenure in my office working for the Senate. I thank the Senate for passing this resolution.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering S. 2334, the Foreign Operations and Export Financing Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999. 
The Senate bill provides $12.6 billion in budget authority and $4.9 billion in new outlays to operate the programs of the Department of State, export and military assistance, bilateral and multilateral economic assistance, and related agencies for fiscal year 1999. 
When outlays from prior year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the bill totals $12.6 billion in budget authority and $12.6 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1999. 
The subcommittee is below its section 302(B) allocation for budget authority and outlays.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending military construction appropriations conference report provides $8.5 billion in new budget authority and $2.6 billion in new outlays for military construction and family housing programs for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1999. 
When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other actions are considered, the outlays for the 1999 program total $9.2 billion. 
Compared to 1998 appropriations, this bill is $446 million lower in budget authority, and it is $412 million lower in outlays. 
This legislation provides for construction by the Department of Defense for U.S. military facilities throughout the world, and it provides for family housing for the active forces of each of the U.S. military services. Accordingly, it provides for important readiness and quality of life programs for our service men and women. 
The bill is within the revised section 302(b) allocation for the Military Construction Subcommittee. I commend the distinguished subcommittee chairman, the Senator from Montana, for bringing this bill to the floor within the subcommittee's allocation. 
Earlier, because CBO had not adjusted its baseline, prior year military construction outlays had not been revised to reflect Congress' override of President Clinton's line-item veto of 37 fiscal year 1998 projects. This adjustment would have revised prior year outlays upward by $112 million. This $112 million has now been added back to the CBO baseline and CBO's scoring of this legislation. Accordingly, this conference report contains no scorekeeping adjustments. 
I urge the adoption of the conference report.

This report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for 1986. 
This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget through July 28, 1998. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of the 1998 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. Res. 84), show that current level spending is below the budget resolution by $16.2 billion in budget authority and above the budget resolution by $1.9 billion in outlays. Current level is $1.0 billion below the revenue floor in 1998 and $3.0 billion above the revenue floor over the five years 1998-2002. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $176.4 billion, $2.9 billion above the maximum deficit amount for 1998 of $173.5 billion. 
Since my last report, dated October 29, 1997, the Congress has cleared, and the President has signed the following authorization acts: National Defense (P.L. 105-85), Adoption and Safe Families (P.L. 105-89), Savings Are Vital to Everyone's Retirement (P.L. 105-92), Veterans' Benefits (P.L. 105-114), Food and Drug Modernization (P.L. 105-115), 50 States Commemorative Coin Program (P.L. 105-124), Hispanic Cultural Center (P.L. 105-127), Surface Transportation Extension (P.L. 105-130), Small Business Reauthorization (P.L. 105-135), Acquisition of Real Property for Library of Congress (P.L. 105-144), an act amending Sec. 13031 of COBRA of 1985 (P.L. 105-150), Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (P.L. 105-178), Care for Police Survivors Act of 1998, (P.L. 105-180), Agriculture Export Relief Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-194), and Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform (P.L. 105-206). The President also signed the following 1998 appropriation bills: Agriculture (P.L. 105-86), Commerce, Justice, State (P.L. 105-119), District of Columbia (P.L. 105-100), Foreign Operations (P.L. 105-118), Interior (P.L. 105-83), Labor, HHS, and Education (P.L. 105-78), and 1998 Emergency Supplementals and Rescissions (P.L. 105-174). In addition, Congress has cleared for the President's signature the Homeowners Protection Act (S. 318). These actions changed the current level of budget authority, outlays and revenues. 
In addition, the budget authority and outlay totals established in H. Con. Res. 84 have been revised to reflect adjustments made by the Budget Committee for continuing disability reviews, arrearages for international organizations, Federal land acquisitions, the International Monetary Fund (new arrangements to borrow), and the renewal of expiring contracts under section 8 housing assistance. Since my last letter, these changes have increased budget authority and outlays $12,489 million and $50 million, respectively. U.S. CONGRESS,

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, last night the Senate passed H. Res. 3731. This legislation designates a special auditorium at Sandia National Laboratories as the Steve Schiff Auditorium. Steve spoke in that auditorium on several occasions as part of his long service to the people of the State of New Mexico. I believe we all know, now that we have had a chance to look at Steve Schiff's life and his time in the House, before his unfortunate death from cancer, that he was in all respects a good public servant--he demonstrated integrity of the highest order, deep and fundamental decency, and an acute and open mind. He went about his business quietly but with efficiency. He was great at telling stories, usually about himself. He was a model for all politicians to admire. 
Mr. President, I wish that we could do something more significant than naming this very, very fine auditorium at Sandia National Laboratories after him. We will have a ceremony when that takes place officially, and the people of his district and our State will join us in a celebration that I hope is a fitting tribute to our deceased colleague.

Mr. DOMENICI. Now, Mr. President, Senator Rod Grams and I traveled to France to develop a better understanding of policies underpinning the utilization of nuclear energy for about 80 percent of their electricity. We visited several key French facilities, and Senator Fred Thompson joined us after the site visit and participated in several of the high-level meetings with elected and appointed Government officials. 
Observations from our trip provide some important perspectives for consideration in the United States: 
Nuclear energy has been implemented in France with strict attention to minimizing environmental consequences. Waste products are reduced at each step in their process. 
The French nuclear energy system enables them to achieve world-class standards for minimal environmental impact from power generation. They are justifiably proud of their record. Their carbon dioxide emissions per capita are about one-third those in the United States. 
French reliance on a `closed fuel cycle' has enabled recycle and recovery of the energy content of spent fuel while also dramatically reducing the volume and toxicity of waste products below those in the United States with our `open fuel cycle.' 
Transportation and interim storage of spent fuel are done carefully in France, with virtually no negative impacts. Interim storage is essential in implementing their fuel cycle. 
At each site in France, attention to protection of the environment is outstanding. For example, while the United States left corrosive waste from uranium enrichment in tens of thousands of steel casks at places like Paducah, Kentucky and Portsmouth, Ohio, the French have routinely extracted commercial products from the same waste and stored only inert products. 
The nuclear industry in France is structured around a closed fuel cycle, which recycles much of their spent fuel. This requires reprocessing of the fuel, a step that the U.S. banned in 1977. That decision by President Carter sought to avoid availability of separated plutonium with its proliferation concerns. The French, along with other countries, were equally concerned about proliferation; but they simply ensured careful safeguards on the plutonium and today are seeking to increase their reuse of plutonium to minimize plutonium reserves. Excellent security and international safeguards were obvious in their facilities. 
When the French reprocess spent fuel, they reuse plutonium in mixed oxide or MOX fuel, consisting of a mixture of plutonium and uranium oxides. Their reprocessing allows the plutonium and uranium to be reused and dramatically reduces the toxicity and volume of their waste below the U.S. open cycle. In contrast, we just plan to bury our spent fuel with no attempt to recycle the valuable energy content of the spent fuel or reduce its volume or toxicity. The resulting waste volume from 20 years of a family of four in France is about 2.5 cubic inches, about that of a pack of cards. And after 200 years, the radiotoxicity of their waste is only about 10% of the value of our spent fuel. 
The French have gone to great lengths to educate their public about nuclear issues, and extensive environmental monitoring information is routinely shared with the citizens from all the activities we saw. 
Transportation of spent fuel is required in the French system. But the French have never experienced a radioactive spill in any traffic accident. Simple interim storage is routinely used in France, without the political debates we face in the United States over this necessary step towards a credible fuel cycle. 
A 1991 French law prescribed a 15 year period to assess options for disposition of their final waste products, whereas we precluded our options and focused on a permanent repository with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. Under this program, they are actively studying further reductions in the toxicity of their waste. We learned that they would welcome strong collaboration in this field with the U.S. The Accelerator Transmutation of Waste program, funded for the first time in the current Energy and Water Appropriations Bill, is one program they singled our for enhanced cooperation. 
The French do not justify their closed cycle with economic arguments, instead they point to its sensitivity to environmental issues and the minimal legacy left for future generations. In fact, with uranium prices currently extremely low, the closed cycle may be slightly more expensive than our open cycle, at least in the near term. Partly for that reason, partly because of the large investment required if the U.S. tried to now duplicate the French system, and partly because there are now alternative options to achieve a closed cycle, we do not recommend that the U.S. simply adopt the French closed cycle. 
New closed cycle options should be considered driven by technological advances in the decades since the French initiated their system. We believe that these new options deserve evaluation here to enable the U.S. to consider the benefits of a closed fuel cycle. Some of these newer options would provide benefits similar to the French system, plus some would avoid proliferation concerns by never separating plutonium. Some of the new nuclear initiatives funded for next year should explore these attractive options. Almost any of these options, however, require interim storage of spent fuel--our trip only adds to the strength of current arguments for prompt implementation of this simple and important step. 
In summary, there are important lessons from the French system for our use of nuclear energy. In the next session of Congress, we look forward to working with you to improve our system, drawing upon these lessons where appropriate.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is an article that follows on the tragedy that happened here in Washington when a man, 41 years of age, obviously suffering from a very serious disease called schizophrenia, was off his medication and, because of his disease, did the kind of things that have shocked our country and shocked our Capitol. The story is about four or five people in the United States who have family members with the same disease, schizophrenia, and have suffered the consequences of their relative, son or daughter, being off the medication--because there is a propensity on the part of those with this ailment to not want to be on medication. Sometimes it offends them a bit. Sometimes it causes extreme obesity. Sometimes it causes some muscular jittering. But whatever the case, it is hard to keep them on their medication. 
I believe we might turn this terrible incident into a constructive response to a very destructive event because, as this article points out, there is little that the parents and relatives can do in their communities to help when they begin to feel the desolation and absolute loneliness when a member of their family, a daughter or son who has this dread disease, decides not to stay on the medication or the medication needs to be changed to be effective. The loneliness is absolutely incredible. As a matter of fact, in this marvelous land of ours, it is fair to say that only in a few places is there any help at all for these people. I don't know how many Americans saw Russell Weston, Sr. and his wife when they met with the press and talked about their son, their son, the 41-year-old who burst through a door here in our Capitol. We all know about the events, and feel great, great sympathy and empathy for the family of the two fallen officers. We have almost been, as a nation, in mourning since that event occurred. And that is as it should be. 
Mr. President, I am not going to say much more about this, other than to say that I have worked with the mentally ill in this Nation. I have worked hard to get more and more people to recognize that this is a disease and that we ought to cover this disease with insurance just as we cover heart failure. That causes some difficulty. Nonetheless, today I don't rise on that score. I merely rise to say: Maybe, maybe this great land of ours, and maybe this institution called the U.S. Senate, and maybe groups across America that are worried about this, might just see if there is a way we can prevent this from happening, if we could prevent it from happening even a couple of hundred times. We frequently see schizophrenics committing acts of murder and degradation, and we all know why it is happening. As a matter of fact, we can almost say with certainty, I say to my friend, Senator Byrd, that if most of those people were on the right medicine they would not be perpetrating these kinds of acts. I hope we would use this to stimulate our collective thinking on what we might do about it. 
I don't have the answers. But I have talked to a few Senators. I have talked, in particular, to Dr. Frist, Senator Frist from Tennessee, who concurs with me that there is little help available. For, you see, in the case of Mr. Weston, if they wanted him to be taken care of, they had very few options. They could call the police. I think across America it is pretty obvious, police will come by and they will say, `This is a medical problem. We can't help you.' They could take him to a hospital. A normal hospital would say, `We can't help you.' They could put him in an institution for a few weeks to try to get him back on board and on the medication, but they had already done that. 
So this Washington Post article called `Tears of Blood; For Families of Schizophrenics, a Gunman's Shots Strike at Their Hearts' is something we should all take cognizance of. 
I hope by these remarks--and some others in this community, I understand, are interested in this--that we will find a way to start meeting together in groups, trying to figure out what should an American response be? Maybe it is a State response. Maybe it is not a Federal response. But we might be the ones to stimulate some real thinking about a responsibility. In this case, we could really be preventers, we could be preventers of serious, serious acts of violence because that can be prevented. It is just we do not help at the time they need help. And we don't have a system set up to provide such help. 
I thank the Senator for listening, and, in particular, for giving me a few extra moments this morning. I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, with the passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, Congress recognized domestic violence as a serious threat to the health safety of women in this country. We successfully created vital programs to train the law enforcement and judicial communities to respond to domestic violence, and further supported important intervention programs. In some respects, however, we left the job only partially addressed. We failed to train and support the professionals that face victims of domestic violence on a daily basis: health care professionals and staff. 
Today, I am pleased that Senator Stevens is joining me in introducing a bill to fill that gap: `The Prescription for Abuse Act--(Rx for Abuse Act).' 
Health care professionals and staff are truly on the front lines of domestic violence work. Nearly four million American women are physically abused each year. While our shelters are always overwhelmed, not all women seek shelter. Not all victims call the police. But eventually, almost all victims seek medical care. Last year, the Department of Justice reported that more than one in three women who sought care in emergency rooms for violence-related injuries were injured by a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend. And, while the impact on the health care system is immense, few health care settings have intervened in a comprehensive way to identify, treat, and prevent the violence that they see on a daily basis. Of particular interest reported to me by a New Mexico doctor, a significant number of office or emergency room visits are not detected as domestic violence-related because physicians and staff are not trained to properly identify the signs of a battered victim. 
Domestic violence is repetitive in nature. According to 1993 data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, one in five women victimized by their spouse or ex-spouse reported that they had been a victim of a series of at least three assaults in the prior six months. Unfortunately, the way the system currently works, the bones are set and the cuts stitched, but the patients are seldom asked about their injuries or referred to services that can help them stop the violence. 
Health care providers, professionals, hospitals, emergency health care staff, physical therapists, and domestic violence organizations need to join forces to find ways to identify, address and document abuse. They need to work together to ensure the confidentiality and safety of victims, and to connect victims to available services. 
Violence against women takes a tremendous toll on our health care system. Battering is a leading cause of injury to women and each year more than a million women seek medical attention because of it. Women who have been battered or sexually assaulted utilize the health care system at much higher rates than non-abused women, for a variety of health problems, including repeated injuries, stress-related disorders, depression, and other physical and mental illnesses. And battering during pregnancy increases the risk of premature, low birth weight, or stillborn babies. Health care providers and staff are often the first, and only, professionals to see a battered woman's injuries. They are in a unique position to identify abuse before it is reported and to intervene in a way that will result in a reduction in the morbidity and mortality caused by violence in the home. In far too many ways to enumerate, domestic violence is a health care issue. Training health care professionals and staff to recognize, intervene, and refer victims to additional assistance is the purpose of this bill. 
As we are all aware, domestic violence knows no age, educational, economic, or socio-cultural barriers. It is evident in our smallest communities and our largest cities. In the sparsely-populated State of New Mexico, there are 26 domestic violence shelters that served more than 16,000 unduplicated clients last year. There were 11,400 non-resident shelter clients and 5,000 shelter residents, with 77,000 nights of shelter provided in one year alone. This represents a thirty-eight percent increase over a four-year period. The New Mexico Coalition Against Domestic Violence and the countless professionals who staff the shelters and clinics across the State know the extent and consequences of the horrific problem of domestic violence on children, women, and families. 
I am proud to say that New Mexico is on the cutting edge of a strategy to begin the process of training health care professionals and staff to become more involved in this critical issue. Last month, a collaborative effort of the New Mexico Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the New Mexico Medical Society, and the New Mexico Department of Health, in partnership with the Family Violence Prevention Fund Health Initiative, pulled together teams from 15 hospitals across the State to train health care providers to identify and respond to the needs of domestic violence victims that they treat. Based on the ongoing work in my State, and similar work in Alaska, Senator Stevens and I am introducing a bill to replicate such efforts around the country. 
The bill establishes three and four-year demonstration grants to strengthen state and local health care systems' responses to domestic violence by building the capacity of health care professionals and staff to identify, address, and prevent domestic violence among their patients. It will give these health care professionals the training, tools, and support they need to confidently address the violence that affects their patients' health. The bill authorizes ten grants up to two million dollars each for statewide teams to develop four-year demonstration programs and ten grants up to $450,000 each for local teams to direct three-year local level demonstrations. Eligible state applicants are state health departments, domestic violence coalitions, or the state medical or health professionals' associations or societies, or other nonprofit or governmental entities that have a history of work on domestic violence.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to convey a ten acre parcel of land, known as the old Jicarilla administrative site, to San Juan College. This legislation will provide long-term benefits for the people of San Juan County, New Mexico, and especially the students and faculty of San Juan College. 
This legislation allows for transfer by the Secretary of Agriculture real property and improvements at an abandoned and surplus administrative site of the Carson National Forest to San Juan College. The site is known as the old Jicarilla Ranger District Station, near the village of Gobanador, New Mexico. The Jicarilla Station will continue to be used for public purposes, including educational and recreational purposes of the college. 
Mr. President, the Forest Service has determined that this site is of no further use to them, since the Jicarilla District Ranger moved into a new administrative facility in the town of Bloomfield, New Mexico. The facility has had no occupants for several years, and it is my understanding that the Forest Service reported to the General Services Administration that the improvements on the site were considered surplus, and would be available for disposal under their administrative procedures. 
This legislation is patterned after S. 1510, approved by the Senate earlier this month, by which the property and improvements of a similarly abandoned Forest Service facility in New Mexico will be transferred to Rio Arriba County. The administration has indicated its support for the passage of that bill, and I hope that this bill will gain their support, as well. 
Mr. President, since the Forest Service has no interest in maintaining Federal ownership of this land and the surplus facilities, and San Juan College could put this small tract to good use, this legislation is a win-win situation for the federal government and northwestern New Mexico. I look the Senate's rapid consideration of this legislation, and urge my colleagues to support its passage.

Mr. DOMENICI. I am pleased to have Senator Harkin as a cosponsor of this amendment. 
There are two parts to my amendment; both parts have no cost. 
The first part addresses the 12,000 military families on Food Stamps. 
For 3 years the Defense Department has refused to take this problem seriously. 
I first wrote to DoD in 1996; then I was told that this was a problem only because military personnel have decided, and I quote, `to have a larger family than he/she can afford.' In other words, it is Defense Department policy to discourage military families and to engineer the size of those families. 
In 1997, I wrote again to Secretary Cohen because he publicly stated that it was `not acceptable' for military personnel to be on Food Stamps. I regret to say that he wrote back saying only that he would `monitor' the issue. 
Last year in the fiscal year 1998 Defense Authorization bill, Congress mandated a DoD report on potential solutions. The report is now several months late and will not be submitted in the foreseeable future. 
Congress is getting the bureaucratic stiff-arm from DoD on this issue. It's time to bring that to an end. 
My amendment will require DoD to propose low cost solutions to this problem, and it requires these proposals as a part of DoD's FY 2000 budget request. 
Next year. If DoD still refuses to take this problem seriously, I will propose my own solution. If the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Defense Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee see fit to support me, I'm sure we can be successful. 
The second part of the amendment will permit us to better understand our growing problems in military family life, morale, and retention. 
This year, I collected information from each of the services on these issues. Unfortunately, the information I collected confirms my suspicions that the Defense Department has failed to collect data properly. For example: 
Each service collects data on these issues differently--or not at all--which prevents comparing among the services. This also means that successes and failures to address these problems cannot be identified. 
Now that everyone agrees that readiness is a serious problem, everyone wants to do something about it. But, because the issues are not fully understood, some of the proposed `'solutions' may be off the mark. For example, Congress is increasing re-enlistment bonuses for pilots to compete with airline salaries, but there are indications that high airline salaries are not the real problem. We won't really understand the problem until we have better data; only then can we apply effective solutions. 
The nature of military life has gone through profound change in the last 20 years, but those changes are not fully understood or taken into account in DoD national security decision making. It is not clear how the new prominence of families in military life should--or should not--be taken into account in making national security decisions. 
Because of these problems, my amendment requires a special unit in the General Accounting Office to collect and study the data. They will use an Advisory Panel of experts to assist the study and will report back to the Appropriations Committees next year. With these issues better understood, we will be able to apply more effective solutions, and we should be able to make some real improvements in how Congress and DoD address quality of life and family issues.

Mr. DOMENICI. When you hear my remarks, you will be pleased that you did. 
Mr. President, let me suggest the Appropriations Committee has come in right on the number, in terms of the budget. They have no directed spending or anything else that would seek to gimmick this budget. Some were asking, `Will you turn the other way and let us have some directed spending that breaks the caps?' I haven't been able to do that for anyone, and I am very grateful we do not have to do it on this bill. The chairman of this committee came in, and everywhere he moved, he said, `Let's meet the budget right on the money.' And he did. I commend him for that. 
Mr. President, I strongly support S. 2132, the Defense Appropriations bill for FY 1999. The pending bill provides $250.5 billion in total budget authority and $168.2 billion in new outlays for the Department of Defense and related activities. When outlays from prior years and other adjustments are taken into account, outlays total $245.2 billion. 
There are some major elements to this bill that are important for the Senate to review. 
The bill is consistent with the Bipartisan Balanced Budget Agreement. 
This year the defense budget is once again confronted with a serious mismatch between the DoD/OMB and the CBO estimates of the outlays needed to execute the programs in the budget request. CBO's estimate was $3.7 billion higher than OMB and DoD's estimate. 
Because the President's proposed defense spending was right up to the discretionary spending caps adopted in the Bipartisan Budget Agreement, compensating for CBO scoring would require large reductions in manpower, procurement, or readiness, or all three. Cuts like that are simply not acceptable. 
During the Senate's consideration of the congressional budget resolution in March, the Senate received an excellent suggestion from the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee. We adopted a Stevens Amendment that called on CBO and OMB to resolve their differences. Several meetings occurred as a result, and under the auspices of the Budget Committee, we devised a solution. The solution has three parts: 
First, Congress would legislate policies recommended by the Administration to better manage cash in DoD's Working Capital Funds. This would lower fiscal year 1999 outlays by $1.3 billion. 
Second, Congress would agree to changes proposed by the Administration in two classified accounts in the Air Force budget that would lower 1999 outlays by $700 million. 
Third, Congress would enact asset sales amounting to $730 million. 
The Chairman of the Appropriations Committee has assured me that taken together these actions help reduce the 1999 outlay shortage to manageable dimensions and help avoid the negative effect on readiness or modernization that was feared. 
I strongly support this bill, and I urge its adoption. I want to compliment the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee on his very skillful handling of this important legislation and for his statesmanlike approach to some serious and troubling issues in this year's defense budget.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe one of the most difficult bills to appropriate and stay within the caps and the allocations under the Balanced Budget Act is the bill that the distinguished Senator, Senator Harkin, is referring to. It is difficult every single year. It will be difficult this year; he knows it and I know it. 
I want to make sure that everybody understands that the Senator from New Mexico did not adopt OMB numbers in arriving at the corrections that were made in the amounts of money available for the Defense appropriations bill. We will be very glad to show Senators precisely what we did. In fact, I am going to insert a statement into the Record--I won't give it--showing that we actually made policy adjustments that permitted the changes in the expectation of expenditures, and then on top of that we allowed for the sale of assets that were a certainty, and we counted those sales in terms of receipts that could be spent in this bill. 
What I am going to say to Senator Specter, chairman of the committee--and I told him this already--is that the staff and I are going to work with them, and we intend to do everything in our power to adjust the numbers so that they get the benefit of any policy changes that are justifiably on the side of OMB's different numbers. If that yields more money to spend, we are going to do that, and we are going to try our best. Let me repeat that we did not use OMB's numbers; we used OMB policy adjustments in a very confused procurement account, and they convinced us that in the policy that they were going to adopt, there would be more expenditures than we had expected--or less, whichever the case may be that yields more money to spend. 
I also want to say to the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education that they chose last year to forward-fund a lot of their accounts. I am not critical. What they did is, they said, on a number of big accounts, we will not fund them for the whole year. We will fund them at the end of the year, thus, getting charged for only a small amount of money. Now, I can't help it that the chickens have come home to roost. The money is now being spent in this year, and we don't even have to appropriate; we already spent it. I can't fix that on every bill. 
So, Mr. President, let me just say to the Senate, the bill, which Senator Specter will chair and Senator Harkin is ranking member on, is the most difficult bill we have. And this Senator, in my responsibility to the Senate, will do everything I can to see that the numbers are accurate and that we maximize the amount of outlays. It is outlays they need; they don't need any budget authority. I will do that as soon as practicable, and our staff and theirs will start working as soon as they want us to. 
The amendment and its author do not accurately characterize what has been done respecting outlays for the National Defense budget function. 
There has been no arbitrary adjustment of CBO's scoring of defense outlays as some characterize. 
Instead, the following actions have been taken: 
The DoD Authorization bill contains legislation to reduce outlays in DoD's Working Capital funds by $1.3 billion. 
The DoD Authorization bill also implements policies that would reduce outlays in two Air Force accounts in classified programs by $700 million. 
The DoD Appropriations bill we are debating today contains a new Pentagon Renovation Fund; there has been a scoring adjustment for this new fund to bring its outlays in line with typical military construction outlay rates, rather than the higher overall rates that CBO would otherwise attribute to this spending. This adjustment amounts to about $190 million. 
That's the totality of any outlay scoring adjustments in this appropriations bill. There are no other adjustments to CBO scoring. I believe it is important to realize that for the adjustments that have been made, in each case there is a specific legislative and/or policy provision that is key to the adjustment, and each legislative provision should have a material impact on outlays.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is a real honor today to support legislation, H.R. 3731, honoring Representative Steve Schiff. This legislation designates a special auditorium at the Sandia National Laboratories as the `Steve Schiff Auditorium.' Steve spoke in this Auditorium on several occasions, as part of his long service to the people of New Mexico. 
Steve Schiff exemplified all that was good about public service: integrity of the highest order, deep and fundamental decency, and an acute and open mind. He went about his business quietly, but with wonderful efficiency. He was great at telling stories, usually about himself. He was a model for all politicians to admire. 
Steve came to New Mexico from Chicago, where he was born and raised. He served the people of New Mexico in different capacities since 1972, when he graduated from the Law School at the University of New Mexico. Before election to Congress in 1988, he served as District Attorney for eight years. 
One of Steve's favorite local programs was his Tree Give-Away Program. For eight years, Steve held a Saturday tree give-away day at the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center. He gave away more than 115,000 trees. Through those trees, he shared his own hope, faith, and love. Those trees now flourish throughout the Albuquerque area in New Mexico as lasting symbols of this man. In a similar way, his legislative achievements continue to serve the American people as another reminder of this great American. 
Along with those trees and his legislation, the Steve Schiff Auditorium will serve as a lasting memorial. I'm happy and honored to have been a part of his life.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it probably will come as a big surprise that, for example, the current price for a gallon of crude oil is cheaper than the price for a gallon of bottled water. Many people will say, `That is great.' Those who look at the American economy and forget about our oil production and our oilfield workers, they would say, `Great.' But if you are looking at how far we have gone in our oil dependence, you will see the small producers of oil in the United States are in the most serious problem they have been in in modern times. The prices are so low that I had two of them come to see me the other day. One last year had $15 million invested in new wells; this year, zero. One drilled 31 new wells last year; this year, 1. We have hundreds of thousands of small wells, called stripper wells, producing 15 barrels a day or less. Many of those, if they shut them in, the oil is gone. The entire reserve is lost. 
We are not sure how to fix that. It is a very complicated problem. But the amendment that is being offered, which I join in, is saying, with prices this low and the fact that we used a lot of our expensive oil during the Iraqi war, we ought to replenish with $420 million worth of purchases. At least it will stabilize somewhat the faltering prices here and may stabilize the stripper wells that are going down the tube and will not be available to America for the production of oil. The way it is paid for is to say: If the President of the United States deems it to be an emergency, then it will be an emergency under the budget. That is not exceptional. We do that for emergencies all the time. We think the oil patch is in a state of emergency. 
Mr. President, the head of the National Stripper Well Association, estimated that small producers already have closed 100,000 wells this year, and cut production by 300,000 barrels a day and has been forced to eliminate 10,000 jobs because of falling prices. 
Small oil companies are sinking with crude oil prices. 
Behind the price drop is the reduced demand in Asia because of its financial crisis, the prospect of Iraq selling more oil and the inability of the OPEC to agree on production cuts. 
The state, receives about 30 percent of its funds from oil and gas. Each dollar drop in the price of a barrel of oil translates roughly into a drop of $20 million in state revenues. 
In Oklahoma, the continuation of low oil prices could lead to the permanent abandonment of about three-fourths of Oklahoma's almost 90,000 oil wells. 
This amendment will direct the Secretary of Energy to purchase and transport and additional $420,000,000 of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve upon a determination by the President that the current market conditions are imperiling domestic oil productions from marginal and small producers. 
This is a small step to show support for our domestic oil industry.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I offer this amendment today with my distinguished colleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, and my colleague from, New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, to address funding for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, referred to as FLETC. 
This is a consolidated law enforcement training center for the Federal Government that is operated by the Department of the Treasury. 
The committee bill reduces the funding for FLETC by $18.7 million below the President's budget request of $100.3 million. 
The bill reduces funding for both the operating and the construction and maintenance accounts, which will have serious effects on our law enforcement training program. 
Mr. President, some years ago, because law enforcement training became a necessity for a number of departments of the Federal Government, every major department which wanted to train their own law enforcement people, and the U.S. Government made a very good decision. They said the Department of Treasury will establish the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, and it will take care of most of law enforcement training that is required for institutions and entities like the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Immigration, and just an untold number of agencies that need to have their law enforcement people trained. 
Through good fortune, an earlier abandoned naval base in the State of Georgia, called Glynco, was the site that was determined for this Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. 
As a matter of fact, I am sure some wonder why I remain so interested in this. A little part of it is in the State of New Mexico. But, believe it or not, when I was a second-year Senator on the Public Works Committee, we were about to spend $600 million on a new center for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. I suggested, almost in a very mild voice, wondering whether then committee chairman of the Public Works Committee would even consider this new center, and said, `Would you adopt a resolution saying that before we agree to build a new one that we will take a year and look around and see if we might not already own a facility such as an abandoned military base?' I think, to get rid of me, they all said, `Let's adopt the resolution.' And sure enough, 9 months later, before we ever spent any money, the chairman called me to his office and said, `Look. They found a naval base in the State of Georgia which has just recently been closed, and it will be perfect. We will not have to build a new one.' 
Although many, many claimed they were the people that got Glynco, I was very pleased to be invited as a brand new Senator in the back row and know that because I had asked that we not spend money until we look around, that we found it. 
It has been doing a marvelous job. The only major competitor is the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
Some time ago, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, when Jim Baker was Secretary of Treasury, decided to expand and create a new one. They picked a former college in the city of Artesia, NM, which offered them the entire campus at a bargain rate, and it has since grown along with the Glynco establishment in Georgia. 
I came to the floor tonight to urge the committee to restore the FLETC salary and expenses and construction to the President's level. 
I know the committee had difficulty because they had to do a lot of things the House didn't do in their bill with the same amount of allocation, overall. But this amendment will actually allow $20 million for new construction of critical dormitory and classroom facilities at both Artesia in New Mexico and Glynco: $6.4 million for new dormitories in Artesia; $7.5 million for new dormitories at headquarters in Glynco; and, $6.4 million dollars for new classrooms at Glynco, which will be augmented by the amounts in the bill, restoring the budget request, and a proposed reprogramming of funds. 
Mr. President, the Congress has put a significant emphasis on law enforcement over the past decade. I have been concerned for quite some time that the law enforcement agencies of the Treasury Department--that is FLETC, the Customs Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms--are overlooked when Congress talks about violent and youth crimes, drugs, gangs, and illegal immigration. 
The Department of the Treasury plays a very important role in this regard. While Congress has more than tripled the budget of the Department of Justice law enforcement agencies over the last decade, Treasury agencies--and this is no aspersions on the current leadership of the subcommittee--have often struggled to keep up with workloads that are increasing all the time. FLETC is a case in point. Since Congress began serious anticrime efforts, thousands of law enforcement agents have been recruited. Many of these agents receive their basic as well as advanced training at these Federal law enforcement facilities. While the administration and Congress added these agents, sufficient resources were not devoted to keep up with the training requirements. The President requested $71.9 million for the Federal law enforcement training salaries and expenses, and the committee provided $66.25. 
There are 70 Federal agencies that depend solely upon the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center to provide all direct costs for entry level training. Without these additional funds, the number of students trained in 1999 will fall below the actual number of agents trained in 1997 while the demand is greater. That will be 3,900 less. Should the administration decide to keep training levels stable, as much as 10 percent would have to be cut from other sources or some programs would have to be reduced or eliminated such as the Office for State, Local and International Training within FLETC. 
Rather than go on with all of the details that I have regarding this, I just want to conclude that this is not good policy. If Congress is going to commit to strong law enforcement, it needs not only the personnel but the high-quality training needed to prepare and protect our law enforcement agents. FLETC, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, must be in position to meet those demands. 
Mr. President, this amendment provides important resources to support the training of our Federal law enforcement personnel. I believe the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center should be a priority in this bill, and I urge adoption of the amendment.

This one is in behalf of myself, Senator Coverdell, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Cleland from the respective States, the largest center in Georgia by far, and we have kind of a small adjunct to it in the State of New Mexico. So all four Senators are on the amendment. 
First, we are relying upon the distinguished chairman, who will see to it in conference that the President's request for operations and the like will be met, and that probably is already in the House bill. 
This amendment says that within the amounts appropriated in the act, up to $20.3 million may be transferred to the acquisition, construction, improvements and related expenses account of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center for new construction. I send that amendment to the desk. It is the one with the four Senators who I have mentioned.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to address one of the international organizations funded in the Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations bill that is currently pending. I speak of the Organization for International Economic and Cooperation, or OECD, as it is known. 
Mr. President, we live in an era where the pubic rightly demands both less government and higher quality services. This is an era where government downsizing and reform are expected of not just federal, state, and local governments, but also to international organizations. 
One organization that has understood that less is better when it comes to government is OECD. The OECD was founded in 1961 as a successor to the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, which was formed to administer the Marshall Plan. As the situation in Europe has changed, so has the work of the OECD evolved. Its purpose today is to contribute to the world economy through economic cooperation among its member nations and beyond. 
The OECD works on issues such as regulatory reform, electronic commerce and tax reform. With its first-rate studies and current information, OECD helps the United States and its other member nations to stay ahead of the curve in the fast-changing global economy. Its work offers policy makers important insight on what the United States can do to benefit from globalization and general economic liberalization. 
At the same time, the OECD has understood that it, too, has to change. On its own initiative, the OECD has undertaken a significant process of reform, committing to cut its overall spending by ten percent. It is well on its way toward achieving this goal. 
The distinguished Chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations Subcommittee has put an emphasis on getting all international organizations to cut administrative costs. The pending bill reflects reductions in funding to those organizations that are above 15 percent in total administrative costs. Based on the State Department data available to the Subcommittee--a 1997 report which includes data only through 1995--the Subcommittee has reduced funding for the OECD. The OECD has indicated to me that its administrative costs are now only about 12.4 percent of its budget. 
I urge the Department of State to provide the Subcommittee with more recent data so that those international organizations that have reduced their overall administrative costs can be appropriately reviewed for FY 1999 funding. For organizations that have pursued reform, such as the OECD, I hope the Subcommittee will reconsider the Administration's budget request for inclusion in the final bill.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to discuss a very important issue today that often does not get the attention that it deserves--the need for accurate economic statistics. 
Policymakers rely on statistics to guide them in their decision-making process. For instance, the Federal Reserve sets interest rates based on the reported level of economic activity and inflation; Congress and the Administration craft multi-year budget proposals using an economic baseline that is built upon current data; we examine the effectiveness of different tax and fiscal reforms by their effect on measured savings rates. 
In all cases, we take for granted that these building block statistics give us a reliable portrayal of current economic conditions. We seldom consider just how difficult it is to construct them nor realize that it is getting harder to do so as our economy continues to evolve. 
We can no longer hope to measure overall economic activity by counting how many widgets roll off an assembly line. We have to put a value on financial and high-tech services. Increasingly, we will also need to be tracking internet commerce. It is imperative that our data collection methods keep pace with our rapidly changing economy. Our statistical agencies employ exceptionally talented people who are working hard to ensure that this happens. 
In the last several years, one can point to many notable data enhancements from our statistical agencies. For instance, BLS has worked hard to improve the accuracy of the Consumer Price Index; BEA has implemented `chain-type' measures for GDP which provide a more up to date reading of the economy. 
Despite such progress, more needs to be done. Growth is booming in the service sector, where we have the least amount of source data. We need to increase our coverage of this important part of our economy. It is imperative that we do so immediately, because there are already signs that our statistics are lagging behind the economy's advances. There has been a growing discrepancy between economic activity measured on a product basis and an income basis. In recent years, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been growing 0.5 percentage points slower than Gross Domestic Income on an annual basis. In theory, these two items should grow at the same rate since they are technically measuring the same thing. 
Economists speculate that GDP growth is being understated because much of our recent economic growth has been concentrated in the hard to measure service sector. While a 0.5 percentage point difference in GDP growth might not seem like a lot, it has an enormous effect on our budget projections. Over a five year period, this difference could yield up to a cumulative $140 billion swing in our surplus estimates. Indeed, many believe that an understatement of GDP is a major reason why CBO, OMB and major private economic forecasters have been underestimating revenues as of late. 
Thus, if we want to ensure that we have more accurate budget forecasts going forward, we should be directing our energies at improving the accuracy of the data used to build these forecasts. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) which compiles the GDP series has laid out an ambitious agenda to make just such improvements to its data collection procedures. Amongst other things, they are seeking to step up their coverage of the information sector in order to ensure that comprehensive data is available for the computer industry. 
This is just part of their initiative to improve the GDP accounts. In order to do so, they have requested an additional $4.5 million. While this money is hard to come by given our tight budget caps, I think it is fair to say that this investment might have one of the highest rates of return within this bill. Indeed, in recent testimony to the JEC, Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan said that statistics are `one of the areas where I believe the payoff is of sufficiently large magnitude where very small amounts of money can have very large potential rewards.' 
I hope that we take heed of Chairman Greenspan's words and that we will be able to find the funds to allow our statistical agencies to improve their data collection processes. I believe that this is the most effective way to improve the accuracy of our budget forecasts and enhance the countless other policy decisions yet to be made.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this year's Captive Nations celebration is dedicated to the `Memory of the Over 100 Million Victims of Communism.' 
Behind the Iron Curtain millions were killed and millions more were victimized by the societal and political structures that coerced conformity and attempted to dictate thought in these authoritarian states. 
The term victim in this context conjures up SS troops and gas chambers, the purges under Stalin, Hungary in 1956, and the Prague Spring. Countless tragedies are recounted in the stories of those who fought for freedom and died at the hands of a racist regime bent on genocide or in confrontation with a relentless and overpowering Red Army. 
Fascism lasted for 12 years in Germany. 
Stalinism lasted twice as long in the Soviet Union. 
An estimated 6 million perished in Nazi concentration and work camps during World War II. 
Between 30 and 60 million perished through the work of Stalin's secret police from torture and execution. 
There were, however, many more who persisted and became victims for their beliefs but remained clear in their conscience. The yoke of oppression could not smote their passion. That is the essence of the `Power of the Powerless,' according to Vaclav Havel, dissident, writer, and political prisoner who is now President of the Czech Republic. 
The ideas contained in the `Power of the Powerless' is what I would like to convey to you on this occasion, because of its lesson in today's world where Captive Nations are few and the powerless seized the power, because it belonged to them all along. 
In 1978, Havel wrote:  
A specter is haunting Eastern Europe: the specter of what in the West is called `dissent.' This specter has not appeared out of thin air. It is the natural and inevitable consequence of the present historical phase of the system it is haunting. It was born at a time when the system, for a thousand reasons, can no longer base itself on the unadulterated, brutal, and arbitrary application of power, eliminating all expressions of nonconformity. What is more, the system has become so ossified politically that there is practically no way for such nonconformity to be implemented within its official structures. 
The system was exemplified by the greengrocer whose store displays the slogan: `Workers of the world, unite!' 
Due to semantics, the greengrocer is indifferent to the slogan. 
His obedience is verbalized in a manner that does not degrade his humanity so much as the truth. `I am afraid and therefore unquestioningly obedient.' 
Ten years later, the system collapsed in the wake of dissent. The Berlin Wall fell in response to the pressure of East Germans voting with their feet, and within a year a microcosm of the former World Order vanished. Glasnost and Perestroika shook the ossified foundation of the Party and its dogma to its core, and the Soviet Union collapsed, allowing for self-determination and the birth of democracy in many formerly Captive Nations. 
It was the Power of the Powerless, the greengrocer's humanity, that eventually brought the system to its knees. Any political system is comprised of the individuals within it, and these individuals, victims or conformists, possess the power of conferring legitimacy to the system. 
In the former Captive Nations legitimacy waned when the victims refused to perpetuate the lie. 
When the gap between ideology and daily reality could no longer be bridged by pat slogans and prescribed ritual, the system's foundation crumbled. 
By accepting the rules of the game, individuals became players. But their refusal to abide by the rules frayed the tightly woven fabric of falsity upon which the system was based. 
Rejection of the system is encapsulated in the following description: 
One day something in the greengrocer snaps and he stops putting up the slogans merely to ingratiate himself. He stops voting in elections he knows are a farce. He begins to say what he really thinks at political meetings. And he even finds the strength in himself to express solidarity with those whom his conscience commands him to support. In this revolt the greengrocer steps out of living within the lie. He rejects the ritual and breaks the rules of the game. He discovers once more his suppressed identity and dignity. He gives his freedom a concrete significance. His revolt is an attempt to live within the truth. 
In his expression of his identity and human dignity, the greengrocer becomes the victim. 
He is purged from the system and punished. His actions are a reminder that an alternate truth exists, thus, he is a threat. 
He has done more than express his dissent, he has illuminated the lie that comprise his surroundings. 
His power is augmented in its juxtaposition to the facade. 
It was the many who expressed their identity in those Captive Nations who tarnished the ideological veneer that was to bridge the gap between truth and falsity. They were victimized, often murdered, for their unwillingness or incapacity to abide by the rules and forfeit their dignity. 
Legitimacy is the glue that holds the system together. Legitimacy must be conferred by the individuals in the system. Without the power of individuals the system must utilize force, coercion and fear to maintain control. The days of an authoritarian state are always numbered, and democracy is the only legitimate social order. It is for this reason, I believe, that in time the remaining Captive Nations--Cuba, China, North Korea--also will join the community of democratic states. The ideological battle is over, and the system with the only solid basis for its legitimacy--its citizens--won. 
In memory of the millions who perished under authoritarian regimes, it is only right for us to recognize their sacrifice. They rejected the facade and refused to perpetuate or propagate the lie. Their sacrifice is also a sobering reminder of our privilege. 
It is also appropriate and important to recognize the victims who survived and are witness to the crimes of history. In commemoration of those who perished, it is all the more potent to recognize those who were victims and survived. Today we can applaud those who would not be victimized, the individuals who refused to be swayed by untruths and promises of power. They are the ones that I would like to remember today. The ones who fought tyranny and prevailed have offered the greatest gift to those who tried and failed. They serve as a reminder to those around them that living a lie is worse than living in fear. And in the Captive Nations they were many in 1989 and thereafter.

Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much, Madam President. And I thank Senator Gregg. 
First, I am pleased to be on the floor to hear the discussions that have taken place and pleased to hear Senator Lautenberg comment about our taxpayers and the need to return to the taxpayers--he described it his own way--but to return to them some of their hard-earned money. 
Actually, the difference between the two resolutions is very clear now. First of all, on Social Security it could not be more clear. The Republicans do not talk about 1999 and Social Security; they say: `Save Social Security first'-- unqualified. 
The difference between the two resolutions is very, very simple, but I think rather profound. First of all, both resolutions purport to say, and try to say, that we want to save Social Security first. We just say that, and we do not qualify it with reference to years or which budgets. We just say, `save Social Security first.' That is No. (3) in our conclusionary resolves. 
And then we add a fourth one. And I will just read it, because you cannot do any better than just reading the language. `Return all remaining surpluses to American taxpayers.' 
Now, that is very simple. That establishes that this resolution, which is sponsored by the chairman of the committee, Senator Gregg, Senator Lott, and myself, with some additional cosponsors--what we are saying is, take care of Social Security, no ifs, no ands, no buts. Any additional surpluses should be given back to the American taxpayers. 
Frankly, there is a great debate occurring now on what we should do with the surpluses because, believe it or not, I recall that many Senators said, `We will never see the day that we have real surpluses.' What was being said was, `Social Security moneys are being used to pay for our bills. We will never reach the day when we have surpluses without using Social Security at all that are real.' And for this discussion, I will call them `operating surpluses.' `Never will we see the day.' 
Well, if CBO is right, Madam President, we have seen the day, as a matter of fact, in the sixth year of this 10-year projection. And it is not a terribly optimistic set of economics; it does not take into account a real big recession, but actually in its overall calculations it assumes a rather moderate and then even a slight downturn in this economy, and it still has, in the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth years, a $40-billion-a-year operating surplus, not using a penny of Social Security during those years. 
I can recall my good friend, Senator Hollings, who is the chief sponsor of the resolution, which I commend him for, saying 
we would never get to that day. And I did not think we would either, I say to Senator Hollings. I never thought we would. But we are there. Frankly, we may be--we may be--in a position, believe it or not, when those surpluses occur much sooner than that. And it may be that we can fix Social Security permanently into the next century and have some very big surpluses left over, for we might not need all of the Social Security money that is in this budget to fix Social Security. We may fix it differently and make it very solvent and truly credible for the next 100 years. 
What we are saying--and we want this loud and clear to the American people--the American fiscal policy is such that you are paying more taxes than we need to run our Government. And we are saying, when that day arrives that we have fixed Social Security and we still have more of your taxes than we need to run this Government, we are saying we will give it back to you. I repeat--return all remaining surpluses to the American taxpayer. 
I would hope that rather than the two sides have an argument over that, I would hope the Democrats would support ours. 
Let me tell you, the only thing I can see that would not have them joining us is if they perceive that Government isn't big enough now and that what we must do in the future, Madam President, if we have the surpluses that we have both been talking about, is we have to save some of that to add more expenditures to Government. 
Maybe it is wishing too much that both sides of the aisle would agree on that, but I submit that we on this side of the aisle would have been badly mistaken had we voted for a resolution that did not say to the American people we have a big enough Government--we have a big enough Government. The question now is, take care of Social Security, and then do not use the excess revenues which we took from the public for more Government; give it back to the people by way of tax relief. 
That is a simple, as I indicated, but profound difference between the two resolutions. And I hope--I hope--that we leave here at 4:15 having turned a rather inconsequential vote into a very significant vote, because on the one hand it could be a vote that said we are going to save Social Security. But we have already agreed to that. The President has agreed to that. We put it in our budget resolution. 
The difference now is that in addition to that, which we are reiterating, we added a second part that says: If we get there, and we have these surpluses that it looks like we are going to have, then we do not want to have any ifs, ands, or buts about that, we want to give it back to the taxpayer in tax relief. 
I hope that the second-degree amendment sponsored by Senator Gregg, the chairman of this subcommittee, Senator Lott, and myself, will be adopted. 
If I have any time remaining, I yield it back and yield the floor. 
Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the last couple of weeks we have all been on the floor trying to get appropriations bills completed. I would just like to submit to the U.S. Senate that we ought not be doing this every year. 
Don't we have enough knowledge and wisdom and information to appropriate every 2 years instead of every year? Don't we have enough information about budgets and estimating that we could do a budget that lasted for 2 years and make automatic economic adjustments? Of course we do. 
Mr. President, if the authorizing committees are wondering why they do not have a chance to do things around here, this is one reason. Because we hardly have enough time to do the appropriations bills. Because they are up every year as if we were in constant motion. In fact, I defy even Senators with the best recollection to recall one appropriations bill from another year by year. They are so often that they are all one big glob of votes. 
Frankly, the Senator from New Mexico had made a mistake this year, because there is a bill at the desk saying we ought to do this every 2 years. We would get our job done better and we would have oversight time and the Senate would be a better place to work in and could do its business better. I should have started 4 months ago insisting that that bill for 2-year budgets and 2-year appropriations be voted on by the U.S. Senate. 
But I can tell the Senate, it will be voted on the next opportunity when our leader has some time, and it may be early next year. We are going to get that bill out of committee, and we are going to vote on this issue of whether we have to do this every single year. 
Frankly, we now have evidence that these bills are 90 to 95 percent similar one year over another. I know chairmen feel they have made dramatic changes year over year; and, yes, they may have. They also passed the appropriated money for bills that have not been authorized, and they know that. And their response is, `Nobody's doing it, so we have to do it.' Well, nobody is doing it because there is no time for anybody to do it. 
Mr. President, I believe many Senators agree with this. I have talked to them at length on it. Frankly, we are going to decide in the Senate pretty soon whether we are going to keep on doing this. I am not sure we will win, but surely we are going to present this issue. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate-reported Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations bill, S. 2260, represents the excellent work of my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire, Subcommittee Chairman Gregg. It is a difficult task to balance the competing program requirements funded in this bill, and he and his staff are to be commended for their efforts to present a sound and equitable measure for the Senate's consideration. 
When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the bill totals $33.2 billion in budget authority and $31.8 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1999. 
The bill is within the revised Senate Subcommittee's Section 302(b) allocation for both budget authority and outlays. It is $10 million in budget authority and $6 million in outlays below the 302(b) allocation. It is $1.4 billion in budget authority and $2.6 billion in outlays above the 1998 level. 
I today submit a table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of this bill. 
It is a pleasure serving on the Appropriations Subcommittee with Chairman Gregg. I appreciate the consideration he gave to issues I brought before the Subcommittee, as well as his attention to the many important programs contained in this bill.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2138, the legislative branch appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999. 
The bill, as reported provides $1.6 billion in new budget authority and $1.3 billion in outlays for the Senate and other legislative branch agencies, including the Library of Congress, the General Accounting Office, and the Government Printing Office, among others. As a matter of comity, the bill does not include funding for operations of the House of Representatives. 
When outlays from prior year appropriations and other adjustments are taken into account, the bill totals $2.4 billion in budget authority and outlays. The bill is under the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation $38 million in budget authority and at its allocation for outlays. 
I want to commend the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee for producing a bill that is substainially within their 302(b) allocation. I am pleased that this bill continues to hold the lien on congressional spending.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has today passed S. 1510, the Rio Arriba, New Mexico Land Conveyance Act of 1998. This legislation will provide long-term benefits for the people of Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. 
Seventy percent of Rio Arriba County is in federal ownership. Communities find themselves unable to grow or find available property necessary to provide local services. This legislation allows for transfer by the Secretary of the Interior real property and improvements at an abandoned and surplus administrative site for the Carson National Forest to Rio Arriba County. The site is known as the old Coyote Ranger District Station, near the small town of Coyote, New Mexico. 
The Coyote Station will continue to be used for public purposes, including a community center, and a fire substation. Some of the buildings will also be available for the County to use for storage and repair of road maintenance equipment, and other County vehicles. 
Mr. President, the Forest Service has determined that this site is of no further use to them, since they have recently completed construction of a new administrative facility for the Coyote Ranger District. The Forest Service reported to the General Services Administration that the improvements on the site were considered surplus, and would be available for disposal under their administrative procedures. At this particular site, however, the land on which the facilities have been built is withdrawn public domain land, under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management. 
I have worked closely with the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management since introducing this bill in November. The Administration is supportive of the legislation and the changes made to the bill. 
Mr. President, since neither the Bureau of Land Management nor the Forest Service have any interest in maintaining Federal ownership of this land and the surplus facilities, and Rio Arriba County desperately needs them, passage of S. 1510 is a win-win situation for the federal government and New Mexico. I look forward to the House's agreement and Presidential signature soon.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to make a point of order that the pending amendment by Senator Wellstone that would repeal the provisions of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, T21, that pay for the additional highway and transit spending in that bill violates section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act. 
Everybody should understand that we have already passed and the President has signed an ISTEA bill. The moneys that are encapsulated in the amendment by Senator Wellstone would now have to come out of that bill, and as a matter of fact this particular VA-HUD bill before us would get charged with $500 million and thus make it break its cap because we would be spending $500 million in directed spending in this bill that does not come within the caps. 
So here is the practical effect of this amendment. Should this $500 million in spending come out of the programs in this bill or any other bill that has yet to be considered by the Senate--Interior, Transportation, Commerce, Justice, Labor-HHS, Foreign Operations--if this additional spending is not ultimately offset in some fashion, the overall spending caps would be violated by $500 million and a sequester would be the end result with all nondefense programs being cut $500 million. 
Finally, I must alert my colleagues that if this provision stands in the final bill, not only the fiscal year 1999 appropriations bill will be charged the cost but the nondefense discretionary spending caps will be reduced by $15 billion for the years 2000-2002. That is the amount of the mandatory spending that would occur under T21 and not be paid for by this repeal. 
The issue has been fully debated. We debated it in the Chamber when we were taking up ISTEA. It has been up in its totality one additional time and partially one other time. I believe we have spoken. We have voted. I particularly urge that the Senate not open this matter at this late date. This is not a technical point of order. This is a serious point of order. If this amendment passes, essentially we will add $15 billion to the expenditures under the caps, meaning that all other programs will bear cuts related to that. And in this particular year, $500 million will have to be cut from all of the domestic programs that we have unless we raise the caps by $500 million--break the budget and raise the caps by $500 million. 
Mr. President, I do not choose to debate the substance of this issue. I assume it was discussed yesterday by the distinguished prime sponsor of this amendment. 
But I submit that in this bill, veteran spending is going up, not down. In this bill before us, and in the ISTEA bill, the veterans of America have received substantially more money than they got last year. In addition, a $1.5 billion new add-on for the education programs for veterans occurred in the ISTEA bill. 
So we are doing our job in behalf of veterans and we need not visit this once again and cut all the programs of Government by the amounts I have discussed here today. 
So I raise a point of order, subject to the provisions that I have heretofore enumerated. 
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, Senator Rod Grams and Senator Fred Thompson and I traveled to Russia, preceded by 3 days in France. Senator Grams accompanied me to France; Senator Thompson, on the Russian part of the trip. We went to France and Russia to do very distinct things. In France, we wanted to talk about nuclear power and the nuclear fuel cycle, and if I have time this afternoon I will address that. If not, I will do that on another day. I would like to proceed with what we went to Russia for and what we determined and what recommendations and thoughts I have that come from that trip. 
Our primary goal when we went to Russia was to explore and develop options for the rapid disposition of Russian weapons-surplus plutonium. These materials represent a potential clear and present danger to the security of the United States and the world. The 50 tons that Russia has declared as surplus to their weapons program represents enough nuclear material for well over 5,000 nuclear weapons. Diversion of even small quantities of this material could fuel the nuclear weapons ambitions of many rogue nations and many nations in general. 
During our visit, we discovered that there was a very critical window of opportunity during which the United States can address the proliferation risks of this stock of weapons-surplus plutonium. We have urged that the administration, our President and our Vice President, seize on this opportunity. No one can reliably predict how long this window will stay open. We must act while it is open. 
Unclassified sources estimate that the United States and Russia currently have about 260 tons of plutonium--100 tons here and 160 tons in Russia. Much of this material is in classified weapons components which could be readily built into weapons. 
While we saw significant ongoing progress on control of nuclear weapons in Russia, much of which was with the assistance of the United States of America through our national laboratories, our visit confirmed the dire economic conditions in their closed cities, the cities that they used to provide ample resources on a high priority because they were the source of their nuclear strength. These conditions fuel concerns of serious magnitude. 
The United States has an immediate interest in ensuring that all Russian weapons-grade plutonium, as well as ours, as well as highly enriched uranium that is theirs and that is ours, is secure. Furthermore, Mr. President, as soon as possible, that material must be converted into unclassified forms that cannot be quickly reassembled into nuclear weapons. Then the materials must be placed in safeguarded storage. 
These actions, plus a reduction in Russia's large nuclear weapons remanufacturing capability, are necessary precursors to future arms control limits on nuclear warhead numbers. 
The United States and Russia have declared 50 tons of weapons-grade plutonium as surplus. Current administration plans have asked in the budget for Congress to proceed with a program to use 3 tons per year of our surplus as mixed oxide, generally referred to as MOX fuel, for commercial nuclear reactors, while the Russians are focused on a program that would not use much of their plutonium as MOX. The process that is going on of negotiating between America and Russia is that Russia would have only 1.3 tons converted. 
So to summarize the concerns with the efforts thus far, I state the following with very grave concerns. No bilateral agreement is in place to control each country's rate of weapons dismantlement, conversion into unclassified shapes, and storage under international safeguards. We were told by the Russians that they were moving faster than the United States in this regard. But we need adequate transparency to assure our citizens on this count. 
The rates of MOX--mixed oxide--use that we propose and they propose are not equal and would in the long run exaggerate the larger Russian quantities. The planned mixed oxide use rate of Russian plutonium is so slow that it requires more than 30 years to dispose of the 50 tons that we have each declared to be surplus. The potential proliferation risk from this material exists as long as it is neither under international safeguards nor used in a reactor as MOX fuel. 
Thirty years is too long to wait for verifiable action on this material. 
On our trip, we explored whether other European entities would help with MOX fabrication and use in order to assist in increasing the plutonium disposition rate: We did not find a receptive audience that would consider introduction of this weapons plutonium into the European nuclear economy, where it would upset their goal of balance within their civilian nuclear cycle between plutonium recovered from spent fuel and plutonium expended as MOX fuel. 
We also discussed the French-German-Russian plan for relocation of a German MOX plant to Russia to provide their 1.3 ton capability. While the equipment and expertise are available, funding for this move has not been identified within the G-7 to date. 
As additional information, we learned from the Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Adamov that he would prefer not to use their surplus weapons plutonium as MOX. Instead, he favors saving it for use in future generations of advanced reactors. We learned that MOX fabrication and use in Russia will occur only with Western funding of their MOX plant and compensation to encourage their use of MOX in present reactors. 
The combination of Minister Adamov's vision combined with the economic situation in Russia provides an important opportunity to address mutual interests. I believe that he would support bilateral dismantlement of weapons, conversion from classified shapes to unclassified forms, and internationally verified storage. These steps must be accompanied by appropriate levels of transparency. 
These initial steps could and should occur rapidly, with a target goal of 10 tons per year. I also believe that Russia would accept MOX disposition of their plutonium at the slow rate that is currently planned, leaving most of their plutonium in storage for their subsequent generations of reactors. The United States, as well as other G-7 countries, may have to help Russia with resources. 
The program I've outlined would rapidly reduce potential threats from Russian surplus plutonium in a transparent and verifiable way. It could move far faster than our current program that focuses on immediate use of converted material in MOX fuel. 
This new program would shift focus onto the rates of material involved in the steps preceding MOX fabrication and use. It would still continue with MOX use, at a slower pace than dismantlement, conversion, and safeguarded storage. The final move to MOX would remain part of an integrated disposition program. Minister Adamov strongly noted his views that use of the plutonium as MOX in reactors is the only credible final disposition route. 
The United States has failed to fully appreciate the opportunity that exists to permanently reduce the threat posed by inventories of weapons-grade plutonium in Russia. Furthermore, the United States should not proceed with any unilateral program for disposition of our own weapons-surplus plutonium. 
Leadership from the White House will be essential to ensure success. These issues should be prominently featured at the July Gore/Kiriyenko meeting and the September Clinton/Yeltsin summit. Mr. President, I intend to work with you and our Senate colleagues to pursue actions towards these initiatives. 
One of our primary recommendations to President Clinton is that he designate a special envoy solely for the vital task of plutonium disposition in order to provide the full-time focused oversight and interagency coordination that is vital to achieving success. This envoy should also coordinate actions among the G-7 countries to ensure their participation in this challenge. 
It is evident that efforts in this Administration towards plutonium disposition have not been marked by a suitable level of urgency, commitment and attention. Designation of this special envoy is essential to address this serious issue. 
Finally, Mr. President, in our discussions within Russia, each Senator emphasized that many Russian actions are viewed in Congress as adding fuel to the fires of global weapons proliferation. We explained to our Russian hosts that Congressional concerns over their activities jeopardize the entire range of U.S.-Russia cooperative programs. 
These strong expressions of interest and concerns, directly from U.S. Senators to Russian leaders, should provide a framework within which the Administration can negotiate bilateral agreements that address these proliferation risks and truly enhance global security. 
I would just like to discuss with the Senate what went on in Russia, and further elaborate on the suggestions that I have. We were privileged to meet with the highest Russian officials who work in the area of atomic or nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. In these meetings, I believe it was mutually understood that there is a reason to take 50 tons of plutonium that they have from weapons, and 50 tons that we have, and if we cannot agree, and if the world will not accommodate efficiently more tons being converted to MOX fuel for reuse in nuclear powerplants, that we should establish in each country a storage facility that is internationally monitored, subject to international controls in both countries, where we will place this plutonium in changed forms so that in this new form it will be, as far as possible from being usable for military purposes and bomb production. 
What a gift we could make to the world if America and Russia could agree that, because of dismantlement--which is occurring, we have 50 tons of plutonium, and I have just told you the number of weapons it could produce if it was used again for nuclear weapons--that we could both say dismantling the weapons system is working. We agree with each other; we are going to have some abiding principles of transparency and control, and we are going to start to take this out of circulation. 
There is one other item that came to our attention as we discussed this proposal. Some of us were familiar with the now-heralded Nunn-Lugar proposal, whereby the United States helped Russia with some of the problems that it had with nuclear proliferation commodities and storage of fissionable materials in their country. The history of Nunn-Lugar, although it recently is very successful, was that for a number of years it could not get off of center. It stayed kind of stuck because of the myriad of agency involvements and rules and regulations. Knowing of that, we recommend that a special envoy be appointed by the President to be in charge of this program of attempting to reach a bilateral agreement on getting rid of 50 tons of plutonium that could be reused for bombmaking. 
So, in summary, the recommendations we make to our President and to our Vice President as they begin to work anew with Russia are as I have described them. Frankly, we believe, the three of us--and one of the three is the occupant of the Chair who attended the entire visit to France and Russia with reference to nuclear energy and nuclear weapons--we recommend that the President engage with and quickly reach agreement with the Russians on the disposition of 50 tons of plutonium; and that we commit, likewise, from our side, that this ultimately be done in a fashion whereby what cannot be turned, through MOX fuel, to a substance that cannot be used for bombs, that the remainder be changed in shapes and forms, but that the storage be monitored by international controls and international bodies so as to account for its safekeeping, and getting it out of circulation as potential use for nuclear weapons.

Mr. DOMENICI. Then, Mr. President, Senator Grams of Minnesota, Senator Thompson of Tennessee, and myself have written a letter to all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, whereby we have once again summarized this situation that we find, this hope that we have that our President will pursue negotiations and quickly arrive at a bilateral agreement to give the world a gift, a present that says: We are now going to get rid of a huge portion of the dismantlement surpluses that can still be used in the future for nuclear bombs, ridding our world of that potential. 
We ask that our colleagues read our suggestions, and that they, too, become interested in this proposal.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will follow this up next week, and perhaps my friend who occupies the Chair could join me that day, because the first part of our visit was a visit to France, ultimately to Germany, to talk about the nuclear power fuel cycle. I want, next week, to go into some detail as to how well the French people and the French Government are handling nuclear power, and how poorly we have handled that issue in America. Just to whet one's appetite about what we visited and what we will be talking about, let me just say the country of France gets 80 percent of its power from nuclear powerplants--80 percent. It is the cleanest country, in terms of emissions. It is the least contributor to atmospheric pollution, which many in our country and around the world are concerned is causing global warming, because they don't burn any coal, they don't burn any oil. They produce most of their electricity from nuclear power. 
Isn't it interesting that they do not seem to be afraid? They have had no accidents of any consequence whatsoever. And we in America, who started this great technology, invented it, had the companies that were best at it--we sit idly by and claim we want to rid the atmosphere of the pollutants that might cause global warming and we essentially, through regulation and otherwise, have eliminated the prospect of nuclear power for some time in the United States. We will speak about that in more detail later. 
Mr. President, with reference to completing the Senate's business and then letting my good friend Senator Jeffords proceed with his speech as in morning business, I am going to proceed with the wrapup, which will include a privilege to the Senator to continue even after we have finished.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in behalf of the majority leader, I have the following statement. 
This morning the Senate will immediately proceed to a stacked series of rollcall votes with respect to the VA-HUD appropriations bill. The first vote in the series will be a 15-minute vote with all succeeding votes in the series being limited to 10 minutes each. Up to six rollcall votes can be expected. Hopefully, that series of votes will include passage of the VA-HUD appropriations bill. 
Following disposition of that bill, the Senate is also expected to consider the legislative appropriations bill. However, any votes ordered with respect to the legislative branch appropriations bill will be postponed, to occur on Tuesday, July 21, the time to be determined by the two leaders.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am for the kids, but I am also for passing an appropriations bill that helps all the farmers in the United States and puts into play the entire agricultural program of this country. 
Frankly, Mr. President, the other day I came to the floor and talked about, how much longer are we going to spend debating the cigarette tax and various expenditures under that program? I made a mistake, I told the listeners that we had 2 weeks. We had 4 weeks to debate these issues. Now we are scheduled to pass appropriations bills that will keep our Government running and more and more, for some reason, we leave it to everybody here to speculate--the other side continues to offer amendments, be it on the tobacco issue or some other program that has nothing to do with the appropriations process, that delays it and then puts in motion things that actually put the bill in jeopardy. 
The Senator just spoke and said this was not a budget issue. Let me tell you, it is a budget issue. It is a budget issue to the tune of $100 million being added to the expenditure side of a balanced budget 5-year plan, because under the Budget Act you cannot count taxes against expenditures like this. So we are breaking the budget to the tune of $100 million--$100 million. 
It seems to this Senator we ought not to be doing that when we just got a 5-year agreement in place. And so it is subject to a point of order. The Senator can say it is technical. I say it is real. 
In addition, I say this approach of imposing taxes--and this is a tax according to the Congressional Budget Office--should not be taking place on appropriations bills that are already late. Mark my word, the President of the United States will be giving the Republican leadership--he will be saying to them, `You can't get your work done. You didn't get the appropriations done.' 
Let me tell you, this violates the spending caps that we agreed to--plain and simple. I do not believe we ought to do that on this bill when that chairman spent weeks and weeks in his committee trying to not break the caps. We come along with an amendment, and it sounds nice, sounds kind of sexy politically, but essentially it is reopening the debate that we had for 4 solid weeks here on the Senate floor. 
Now, for all the reasons I stated, but more important, because the Budget Act so provides, I make a point of order against the pending amendment under section 302(f) of the Budget Act of 1974. 
Mr. President, let me say, I believe the Senate ought to stand up and say we are not going to break the budget here. We are going to stand on this point of order of substance and deny the efficacy of this amendment because it can't sustain the 60 votes required. 
I make the point of order and I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Department of Agriculture and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999. 
The Senate-reported bill provides $56.7 billion in new budget authority (BA) and $40.8 billion in new outlays to fund most of the programs of the Department of Agriculture and other related agencies. All of the funding in this bill is nondefense spending. This Subcommittee received no allocation under the Crime Reduction Trust Fund. 
When outlays for prior-year appropriations and other adjustments are taken into account, the Senate-reported bill totals $55.2 billion in BA and $47.5 billion in outlays for FY 1998. Including mandatory savings, the Subcommittee is at its 302(b) allocation in BA and outlays. 
The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee 302(b) allocation totals $55.2 billion in budget authority (BA) and $47.5 billion in outlays. Within this amount, $13.7 billion in BA and $14.1 billion in outlays is for nondefense discretionary spending. 
For discretionary spending in the bill, and counting (scoring) all the mandatory savings in the bill, the Senate-reported bill at the Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation in BA and outlays. It is $43 million in BA and $24 million in outlays above the President's budget request for these programs. 
I recognize the difficulty of bringing this bill to the floor at its 302(b) allocation. I appreciate the Committee's support for a number of ongoing projects and programs important to my home state of New Mexico as it has worked to keep this bill within its budget allocation.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, yesterday the Congressional Budget Office released its annual midyear review. I believe every Senator should acquaint himself with it. This CBO analysis speaks volumes about the success that the Republican-led Congress has had in putting the Federal Government's fiscal house in order--because policies aimed at reducing Federal spending, stimulating economic growth, coupled with the passage of the Balanced Budget Act last year have produced remarkable results. 
The Congressional Budget Office, which is our official scorekeeper and economic analysis group, now projects that there will be a Federal budget surplus of $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years. Let me repeat, the Congressional Budget Office now projects a Federal budget surplus of $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years. This is up significantly from the $650 billion, 10-year number they gave us in January. 
The Budget Office forecasts surpluses of $63 billion for this year; but they tell us that surplus will grow, rising to $80 billion in 1999; $251 billion in 2008. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the total accumulated surplus--I repeat --during the next 10 years will be a whopping $1.6 trillion. 
More importantly, the Budget Office projects that in the second 5 years, from 2003 to 2008, we will produce a $168 billion operating budget surplus. That means a surplus, excluding the money borrowed from Social Security. 
For those who said they wonder when the day will ever come when we will have a balanced budget, having returned to the Social Security trust fund whatever was used in the general funding of this Nation, the Congressional Budget Office says that day will arrive in the year 2003. And it will produce a very genuine and solid $40 billion a year, more or less, in a genuine surplus on budget, taking into consideration the Social Security trust fund 
in its entirety. 
In other words, under the leadership of this Congress, we have moved from Federal budgets that produced deficits for as far as the eye can see to budgets that project surpluses for as far as the eye can see. I believe we must now move to protect this surplus from those who would use it to expand Government. Rather, our first priority must be to protect and preserve the fiscal integrity of Social Security for the future. 
We are committed to that goal. But we are also committed to providing needed tax relief to our hard-working families. We now know that we will have an operating surplus, roughly $40 billion a year, beginning in the year 2005. Therefore, I believe we must see to it that this surplus is available for tax cuts for the American people and that we not spend this money to grow Government. Let us spend this money to grow the paychecks of Americans. 
Mr. President, there will be a lot of talk about this Congressional Budget Office's re-estimating of our national fiscal policy. I commend it to those who are concerned, legitimately concerned, about where we ought to go in the future based upon our successes. 
I also would like Senators to know that the Congressional Budget Office did not assume a robust, strong, growing economy for the entire next 10 years. They have taken into consideration the potential, although we hope it will not occur, of a downturn in the economy, and we still have these kinds of surpluses--indicating that the economy is vibrant, productive, that the increases in productivity are far greater than we have estimated in the past, tax revenues are growing faster than we estimated in the past. 
Clearly, an opportunity now is before us to make sure Social Security is taken care of and also to look carefully and surely right in the eye of, Should we give tax cuts to the American people? I think the answer is going to be a resounding yes. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2168, the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill for 1999. 
This bill provides new budget authority of $93.9 billion and new outlays of $54.5 billion to finance the programs of the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, and other independent agencies. 
I congratulate the Chairman and Ranking Member for producing a bill that complies with the Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. This is a one of the most difficult bills to manage with its varied programs and challenging allocation, but I think the bill meets most of the demands made of it while not exceeding its budget and is a strong candidate for enactment. So I commend my friend the chairman for his efforts and leadership. 
When outlays from prior-year BA and other adjustments are taken into account, the bill totals $91.9 billion in BA and $102.4 billion in outlays. The total bill is at the Senate subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for budget authority and outlays, for both defense and nondefense. 
I ask members of the Senate to refrain from offering amendments which would cause the subcommittee to exceed its budget allocation and urge the speedy adoption of this bill.

Mr. DOMENICI. I do not intend to delay matters at all. Whenever the chairman is ready to go, I certainly won't be on my feet. I want to rise and congratulate Senator Lugar and those who helped put his amendment together. I am a cosponsor, but I don't take credit for any of the innovation and thoroughness of this work. 
I just want to say on a very personal note that every now and then when you see things out in our country or in the world sort of mixed up, and you see mixed signals, you wonder just what is our country doing, and somebody like Dick Lugar comes along and makes sense out of something that appears to be just a mess. 
There can be no question, whatever support there is in this body for sanctions--and clearly they must be an instrument, a tool--whatever support there is for that concept does not mean our country ought to be living under a `quilt' of sanctions, many of which are just bilateral between us and some country, when we already know that many of them don't work or they work to our detriment. 
Here we sit today with an emerging crisis in agriculture, probably mostly from the Asian flu; that is, from the failure in the Asian markets because of their banking systems falling apart, and those people can't buy the products they were buying. Nonetheless, when we added Pakistan for something they did, which we were all worried about, and they depended upon our grain and that kind of product to feed their people, obviously American agriculture is hurting. 
Now, there are some who would like to make it that the new legislation creating an open market at some time in the future, a totally free and open market, is the cause of the problem. That is not the cause. The cause is that America's trading in 
foodstuffs and products from our farms is not working as well as it should because we have done something that is harming it, or failed to do some things that would cause it to work better. 
Let me repeat one more time, why in the world are we still holding up IMF? If we want to reform it, why don't we reform it and pass it? There is hardly anybody in agriculture or American industry that hires our people that doesn't think we ought to do that. 
Now, Senator Lugar would like to do that. That isn't what he is doing here today. He is doing the next best thing. If that isn't a prescriptive manner, postmanner, trying to get rid of some of the nonsense of the unilateral, bilateral and multilateral situations that we have where we say we can't sell countries our product. Why don't we get on with fast track? If you want to talk about what would help our farmers, that is what would help. Get America's trade markets open so they can sell their products. 
Obviously, what we are doing here today is a very rational, sensible approach to a very, very, confused set of policies which are not working to America's benefits, which we can pass and then sit back and say we did something. Isn't that great; we did something. We never measured it. I gather the new guidelines will ask us to at least measure before we do it; is that correct, Senator Lugar?

I do compliment you because every now and then when things are confused, you make up for that and come up with something like this.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say to anyone listening to this debate, you would think that those who want the big spending bill that is in the guise of helping children stop smoking--you would think they have not had an opportunity on the floor of the Senate to present their case. If one would take this discussion and say that is the only discussion we have had on the so-called cigarette tax bill, that would be one thing. But my recollection, without checking the record, is that we have debated this issue for 4 weeks. Is that not correct, I ask the chairman of the subcommittee? Four weeks of floor time, with scores of amendments and so many hours of debate that I am assuming even the American people who watch C-SPAN wondered, `How much longer are you going to discuss this?' Now we come to the floor on an appropriations bill that everybody knows has to be passed and signed by October 1 or we close down all of agriculture in America, and up comes the cigarette bill and a debate starts: `The Republicans don't want to let us vote.' 
I don't know anything about the lack of ability to amend the amendment, but I do know this. This amendment is for real in terms of its budgetary impacts. As a matter of fact, if this were on the bill when it came out of committee, it would be subject to a point of order and the whole bill would fall. That is how important it is, because it overspends what is allocated to the Subcommittee on Agriculture by $8 billion. I wonder how many eight billions of dollars over the allocation which keeps this new balance we can have around here? Can we have eight or nine of them this year and say, `It is such wonderful legislation that we just ought to break the rules of the budget?' 
I will acknowledge the Budget Act says you can waive the Budget Act, so I am not critical of those who try to waive it. But I am wondering whether or not, when we wrote that Budget Act and said you can waive it, whether we had in mind breaking a 5-year balanced budget that was in place for the first time in 40 years because along came some legislation that people thought was very, very interesting and important? 
Let me repeat. There are some who are going to say this is just a procedural vote, it isn't meaningful, and Republicans have pulled this out of the bag like a rabbit pulled out by some kind of a person that pulls tricks. There is nothing to that. Mr. President, $8 billion is a lot of money. I think the American people understand $8 billion. And this is $8 billion in new direct spending that will be charged to this subcommittee on its agricultural bill for all of agricultural programs, including research, in the United States. It could cause the bill to fail so that those on the other side of the aisle can have yet another chance to debate an issue which has been debated for 4 weeks. 
Mr. President, I am glad the majority leader raised the point of order under the Budget Act. It is absolutely right. It is correct. It is substantive. As a matter of fact, had he not raised it, there would have been a chorus of Senators here to raise it because it is so patently in violation of the 5-year budget agreement that we just entered into last year wherein we told the American people it is a first in 38 years and how proud we are that we are in balance. Then along comes the President who says don't spend a nickel of the surplus on anything but Social Security. Then we come with bills like this, and there goes $8 billion of the surplus here. I don't know what is going to happen on the next bill when they have more of this. So, frankly, I believe we ought to sustain the point of order. 
I repeat, it is real, it is fair, and it is timely. They have had, those who want this gigantic $875 billion new expenditure plan over the next 25 years--that is what the bill before us, the big bill, was--anyone who wants that, they had their debates for 4 weeks and lost. Do we want to start over again on an appropriations bill? And then who is going to be claiming we didn't get our business done, we couldn't get the appropriations finished by October 1? Who is going to be doing that? The President and the minority party. And this is just one more instance where it is their fault we don't get it done, not our fault. 
We ought to pass this appropriations bill and do this in due course if there is another opportunity presented by the Senate. If not, they have had their day in court, it seems to me. I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there are more than 168 ways that this bill makes the IRS more service oriented, and taxpayer friendly. It cracks down on abuses highlighted in the hearings. It corrects some problems called to my attention by constituents. Chairman Roth and the Finance Committee should be commended for the fine job they did on this bill. 
Often when we pass legislation, I ask the question: Who cares? 
I can assure you that this is one piece of legislation that everyone cares about. No agency touches more Americans than the IRS. As I said before one out of two Americans said they would rather be mugged than be audited by the IRS. This bill should reverse that prevailing view. Among the key provisions the bill strives for better management; better use of technology; reinstatement of a checks and balances system so that the IRS will no longer be the judge, jury and executioner; discipline for rogue IRS agents; taxpayer protections including the right to a speedier resolution of a dispute with the IRS; fundamental due process and a long overdue reorganization. Hopefully, these reforms will change the environment and change the culture at the IRS. 
The bill prohibits the IRS from contacting taxpayers directly if they are represented by a lawyer or an accountant. The IRS called this practice by bypassing the tax professional and visiting the taxpayer at work or at dinner `aggressive collection' techniques, my constituents called it harassment. 
The bill attempts to make the IRS employees more accountable for their actions by putting their jobs on the line when they deal abusively with taxpayers. 
The bill requires the IRS to terminate an employee if any of the following conduct relating to the employees official duties is proven in a final administrative or judicial determination: 
Failure to obtain the required approval signatures on documents authorizing the seizure of a taxpayer's home, personal belongings, or business assets. 
Falsifying or destroying documents to conceal mistakes made by the employee with respect to a matter involving a taxpayer. 
Assault or battery on a taxpayer or other IRS employee. 
Under the bill, the IRS will no longer be allowed to send out tax bills with huge penalties compounded with interest and cascading penalties just because the IRS was years behind in its work. 
If the IRS does not provide a notice of additional taxes due, a deficiency, within 18 months after a return is timely filed, then interest and penalties will not start to be assessed and compounded until 21 days after demand for payment is made by the IRS. This excludes penalties for failure to file, failure to pay, and fraud. It is not fair for the IRS to wait years before contacting a taxpayer who honestly believes he has paid the correct amount, only to deliver to him years later a tax bill with interest and penalties that dwarfs the original underpayment. I had a constituent who was told he owed an additional dollar--one dollar--in taxes but owed more than $2,500 in penalties and interest! The IRS agent's response when asked about it was, `Well, I guess we gotch ya good.' 
Small businesses have been the target of some of the worst abusers. I will always remember the day a good friend, a restaurant owner in New Mexico called my office, justifiably hysterical. The IRS had just padlocked her restaurant. What was she to do? What could I do? 
This bill codifies the proposition that all men and women, even if they work for the IRS, shall follow fundamental due process requirements. Padlocks and raids should be a last resort under this bill. 
The bill requires the IRS to provide notice to taxpayers 30 days before the IRS files a notice of Federal tax lien, levies, or seizes a taxpayer's property. 
The bill gives taxpayers 30 days to request a hearing. No collection activity would be allowed until after the hearing. 
The bill requires IRS to notify taxpayers before the IRS contacts or summons customers, vendors, and neighbors and other third parties. 
The bill requires the IRS to implement a review process under which liens, levies, and seizures would be approved by a supervisor. 
The bill legislates common sense. It prohibits the IRS from seizing a personal residence to satisfy unpaid liabilities less than $5,000, and provides that a principal residence or business property should be seized as a last resort. 
In addition, the bill expands the attorney client privilege to accountants and other tax practitioners. 
Under this bill, the IRS could no longer insist that a taxpayer waive his rights. In particular, the IRS could no longer insist that a taxpayer waive the statute of limitations before the IRS would settle a case. The bill requires the IRS to provide taxpayers with a notice of their rights regarding the waiver of the statute of limitations on assessment. 
If the IRS cannot locate the taxpayer's file, the bill prohibits the IRS from rejecting the taxpayer's offer-in-compromise based upon doubt as to the taxpayer's liability. I have known constituents who are left in an IRS twilight zone because the IRS lost their file. I know of one constituent who had his file lost five times. Fortunately, he kept a copy of the file himself, and worked next door to a Kinko's copying center. 
This bill allows for a prevailing taxpayer to be reimbursed for his or her costs and attorney's fees if the IRS is found not to be substantially justified. The substantially justified standard is consistent with the little-guy-can-fight-the-federal-government-and-win philosophy. I am glad this standard is being expanded, and incorporated into this bill. Originally, the notion that a citizen should be able to recoup attorney's fees and costs when the Federal Government was not substantially justified was a concept in the Equal Access to Justice Act which I authored in the early 1980's. It is historically interesting to note, and perhaps prophetic, that the IRS lobbied very hard to be exempt from that law. In fact, the IRS was exempt when the bill was first enacted. When the Equal Access to Justice was reauthorized 5 years later, Senator Grassley and I worked to include the IRS. It was a big fight but Congress prevailed and got the IRS under the Equal Access to Justice Act's umbrella. The Federal Government with its deep pockets shouldn't be allowed to simply `outlast' the average American taxpayer. That isn't what our justice system is about. 
The bill also clarifies that attorney fees may be recovered in a civil action in which the United States is a party for unauthorized browsing or disclosure of taxpayer information. I have heard a lot about this abuse both from constituents and from the witnesses in the campaign finance investigation. 
If a taxpayer makes an offer to settle his or her tax bill and the IRS rejects it and the IRS ultimately obtains a judgment against the taxpayer in the amount equal to, or less than the amount of the taxpayer's statutory offer, the IRS must pay the taxpayer's fees and costs incurred from the date of the statutory offer. I am pleased this provision is included in this bill. The offer and settlement provisions are patterned after the securities litigation reform bill which Senator Dodd and I authored last Congress. 
I can't believe we have to pass a Federal statute to accomplish this next task but apparently we do. 
The bill requires all IRS notices and correspondence to include the name, phone number, and address of an IRS employee the taxpayer should contact regarding the notice. To the extent practicable and if advantageous to the taxpayer, one IRS employee should be assigned to handle a matter until resolved. 
In New Mexico, a notice can come from the Albuquerque, Dallas, Phoenix, or Ogden IRS center. Taxpayers are often left with no option but to contact my office asking for help in simply identifying who they should talk to at the IRS to settle their tax matter. The caseworkers are experts, but it would take them 2 days to track down the right IRS office so that the constituent could try and solve their problem. It was so commonly befuddling to constituents that my caseworkers asked that this identification provision be included in this bill. 
Movie stars, rock singers, and hermits like, and need unlisted phone numbers. The same is not true for Federal agencies. The bill also requires the IRS to publish their phone number in the phone book along with the address. We have a beautiful new IRS building in Albuquerque, but the only phone number for the IRS is the toll free number that is too frequently busy. If you did not know the IRS building in Albuquerque existed, you would not find a clue of its location in the telephone book. 
I am pleased that the Senate was willing to accept a Domenici amendment, cosponsored by Senators D'Amato, and McCain that requires IRS helpslines to include the capability for taxpayers to have their questions answered in Spanish. 
In addition, the bill establishes a toll free number for taxpayers to register complaints of misconduct by IRS employees and publish the number. 
The bill requires the IRS to place a priority on employee training and adequately fund employee training programs. The IRS is making progress. The accuracy of the advice that taxpayers received when they called the IRS was very bad. For example, in 1989, the advice was correct only 67 percent of the time. The accuracy has fortunately improved. Training is the key. 
The bill requires the Treasury to make matching grants for the development expansion or continuation of certain low-income taxpayer clinics. 
The bill requires at least one local taxpayer advocate in each state who has the authority to issue a `Taxpayer Assistance Order' when the taxpayer advocate believes it is appropriate. 
Mr. President, many, in fact most, IRS employees work very hard and do a good job. Perhaps the best way to reform the IRS is to reform the code to make it simpler. The doubling from $100 billion to $195 billion of the tax gap--the difference between the amount of taxes owed and the amount actually paid--is evidence that the system is breaking down. 
I am also pleased that the bill simplifies the capital gains holding period and makes it easier for taxpayers to calculate their capital gains.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the legislation before us today. This bill touches on matters of great importance to the future of American farmers as well as the direction of foreign policy for the United States. 
I agree with many of my colleagues who contend here today that this legislation signals an important first step in reevaluating our sanctions policy. Many of us would agree that we have overused and thereby deadened the sting of sanctions. In addition, unilateral sanctions only hurt U.S. producers, regardless of the sector, and essentially amount to a gift to our foreign competitors. 
I would also like to express my agreement with those who have suggested that agricultural sanctions in particular are an ineffective stick and cause substantial damage to already depressed agricultural markets. In a world market where the prices for agricultural commodities continue to decline and almost every major player heavily subsidizes its agricultural sector, curtailing U.S. farmers' access to significant portions of the global market through sanctions only serves to make a difficult situation worse. 
I would also like to emphasize the importance of allowing the free market to dictate agricultural production and sales. The wealth of nations--and this is a conscious choice of wording--is not attained by erecting barriers--either through tariffs or embargoes--to the export of our agricultural commodities. Our agricultural surplus must be allowed into markets where there is a demand. Pakistan is only one of those markets. 
If left in place, these sanctions will have a devastating immediate impact on American farmers. The pending sale of 15 million tons of wheat to Pakistan hangs in the balance. Our wheat farmers will shoulder the most immediate burden of misguided foreign policy unless we are willing today to take a small, but crucial step, in changing that policy. American farmers desperately need the remaining 10% of global markets that our current sanctions deny them. We already witnessed the impotence of embargoes in 1980. How often do we have to repeat our mistakes to learn? 
Between 1993 and 1996, the United States unilaterally imposed sanctions 61 times against 35 countries. The effectiveness of these sanctions in attaining specific foreign policy objectives would have to be evaluated on a case by case basis. However, what requires no detailed examination at all is that we have created a web of walls to U.S. exports that previously did not exist. We have erected, in essence, extensive non-tariff barriers to myriad U.S. exports. We have systematically carved out large pieces of the global market and made them inaccessible to U.S. producers. The competition should be overwhelmed with gratitude. We are doing more to bolster foreign producers of agricultural goods than their own governments could hope to achieve through subsidies. 
The focus of this legislation are the sanctions invoked in reaction to the nuclear tests carried out in India and Pakistan earlier this Spring. The 1994 Glenn amendment not only included agricultural commodities, it also shut off agricultural credit programs that enabled countries like Pakistan to import U.S. wheat and feed its citizens. In sanctioning Pakistan in this manner, we run the risk of further destabilizing the existing regime. I have already voiced my concern about the danger inherent in this approach. Hungry citizens and desperate regimes with nuclear weapons capability could be a formula for disaster. 
A further disaster must, however, be noted and has not been adequately emphasized in the discussion of this bill. Allowing international markets to be regulated by supply and demand for agricultural products--as well as other goods, services and capital--is an idea that dates back to the founding of this nation. The wealth of this nation can only be derived from a free market economy and unimpeded international trade. These artificial barriers will spell disaster for U.S. farmers in the immediate term, and they will eventually have negative ramifications for every sector in the U.S. economy. 
Mr. President, I am hopeful that this legislation will initiate further changes. It is essential to American farmers that we change the current policy. This is an important first step to removing the barriers we have created to allowing U.S. producers to compete and profit in global markets. The economic lessons published by Adam Smith in 1776 are as pertinent today as they were at this country's birth. U.S. sanctions will serve to crush the invisible hand and hinder our competitiveness. I believe we should keep this foremost in our mind as we evaluate our sanctions policies, MFN and fast track in the coming months.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to raise the issue of Section 632 of Title VI of the Higher Education Act, the so called `hold harmless' provision as the Senate discusses this very important reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. 
It is my understanding that Section 632 was first enacted in the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 in order to prevent the Department of Education from funding new or expanding existing Title VI, International Education Programs unless existing Title VI programs were funded at their FY 1992 level. However, the bill before us removes the provision, so as to give the Secretary of Education greater flexability. 
The University of New Mexico's Latin American Institute has contacted me to raise its concerns about the removal of Section 632 from the Higher Education Act. I also understand the international programs at Ohio State and the U. of Michigan have contacted their respective Senators with similar concerns. 
However, I also understand the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act does not create any new programs within Title VI, so is it your understanding that since no new programs are created within Title VI that Section 632 is unnecessary?

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am the other Senator from New Mexico, so whatever has been said about the amendment, and who is for and who is against it, was not talking about my amendment. 
First, I don't have any amendments. I rise to congratulate the committee on an excellent bill. By authorizing this Higher Education Act, the Senate is making a downpayment on our Nation's future. Benjamin Franklin, in the very early days of our country, put it best when he said, `An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.' Sometimes around here we are talking about interest rates as if they apply only to the economy and the like. So Benjamin Franklin, even many years ago, was talking about interest. He said, `An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.' I believe that is right. 
Building upon his statement and others, I say it is a simple fact that the future is prejudiced in favor of those who can read, write, and do math. A good education is a ticket to an opportunity to a secure economic future in the middle class of the United States. 
As the earning gap between brains and brawn grows even larger, almost no one doubts today the link between education and an individual's prospects for a good and substantial livelihood and a good life in America. That is what the Senate is doing today in improving the postsecondary education system of our country. Incidentally, I said `improving' because it is already the best in the world. There are no countries in the world that have a postsecondary education system that comes anywhere close to ours. 
So we are not here to be critical, we are here to offer improvements. In a nutshell, this bill improves the financial aid opportunities for students, creates a unified program to promote excellence in the teachers of our public schools, and streamlines the Higher Education Act by consolidating overlapping programs and eliminating unnecessary regulatory requirements. 
Before I make some specific comments on provisions in the bill, I will quickly talk about my home State of New Mexico. We are a small State. Approximately 100,000 students are enrolled in New Mexico's public colleges and universities, with about 53,000 enrolled in community colleges and about 47,000 in universities. However, the number of high school graduates is expected to increase during the next decade and members of the current workforce are expected to seek additional education during that period. 
Consequently, we must have a very high quality, low-cost college education available to a growing number of students. We must provide that regardless of income level, ethnic background, or place of residence. Students attending New Mexico institutions received more than $200 million in financial aid, counting grants and loans from all sources, during the 1995-1996 academic year. Thus, I believe that educational performance is a crucial element to our State's future. Speaking as a New Mexican, clearly, our state's future relies upon the capacity to prosper in this extremely competitive national-international economy and is directly related to the education we are able to give our young people. 
Our colleges and universities directly and indirectly contribute to the economic vitality of our country and our State as they produce graduates with considerable intellectual depth and breadth, workers whose skills allow them to meet the demands of their employers, and first-rate research that helps to expand the boundaries of our knowledge. 
Let me make a few comments about some provisions. 
Title II: I congratulate the committee for improving teacher quality. Focusing on the two areas they have with reference to teacher quality and recruitment of teachers for underserved areas, first, the bill seeks to improve student achievement, improving the quality of the current and future teaching force by improving preparation of prospective teachers and enhancing professional development of activities; second, it seeks to increase the number of students, especially minority students, who complete high-quality teacher preparation programs. 
Title III: the institutional aid title, creates a new grant program for tribal colleges--those are our Indian colleges, which obviously are severely underfunded and severely lacking in maximum professional qualities of their teachers--and the universities to strengthen services to Native American students. 
Student financial aid is given a huge boost through several changes which I believe are in compliance with the 5-year budget agreement we made last year, which annually increased maximum Pell grant levels to the following amounts: $5,000 for academic year 1999-2000; $5,200 for academic year 2000-2001; $5,400 for academic year 2001-2002; $5,600 for academic year 2002-2003; and eventually up to $5,800 for academic year 2003-2004. 
There are TRIO Programs that are given a boost through changes to the Student Assistance section under title IV which provides benefits to 700,000 students nationwide. Two-thirds of the participating students come from families where neither parent attended college and incomes are below $24,000. This bill reserves up to 2 percent of that program for the evaluation and dissemination of partnership grants. 
The new Dissemination/Partnership provision would encourage partnerships between TRIO programs and other community based organizations offering programs or activities serving at-risk students. 
The Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL) is stabilized in the following way. Student loan rates will be equal to the 91-day T-bill-plus-1.7-percent while students are in school, and plus-2.3-percent during repayment after graduation. The interest amount is capped at 8.25 percent and for PLUS loans, rates will be the 91-day-T-bill-plus-3.1 percent, capped at 9 percent for borrowers and lenders. 
An innovative loan forgiveness program is also included for teachers. Thirty percent of a teacher's loans will be forgiven after the fourth and fifth complete years of teaching in a high-poverty school and 40 percent after the sixth complete year after meeting certain eligibility requirements. 
Finally, there is the creation of new part within Title V dedicated solely to supporting the needs of Hispanic Serving Institutions that is authorized at $45 million for fiscal year 1999. 
Mr. President, I believe we are taking an important step forward today by making an investment in our nation's future with the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. 
I close by saying, frankly, I believe that we have a magnificent post-high-school education system because there is great competition. As a matter of fact, there is no question in my mind that if we had similar competition or even a little bit of it in our public school system, we would not have the education bills that we bring before the U.S. Congress which are so detailed and give so much direction and have so many hundreds of programs. 
Higher education is competitive. You can make your choice. It can be a private school, a public school. You can find the very best; you can find less than the very best. But everywhere you look, you will find an opportunity to get a good college education. That is because there are so many institutions that want to do this, love their work, and think they are part of America's future. 
I end tonight congratulating the committee, in particular the chairman, for the good bipartisan work that has been accomplished on this bill. I am glad, on a matter of this importance, we are not fighting in a partisan way here on the floor but tonight will approve this bill by an overwhelming bipartisan vote which means we support secondary education in America in a big way. 
It is our future. I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Is it not true that one of the technical corrections has to do with the fact that those who helped write the provisions of the law that attempted to rescind the general counsel's regulation expanding benefits for those who smoked while in the military, that in doing that, actually the drafter expanded that to reduce other benefits that were for veterans who were never even intended to be covered? That is one of the technical corrections, to return it to what it should be, rather than to have an expanded reduction in benefits that go to veterans. Is that not true?

Mr. DOMENICI. Let me make a point to the Senate. If you do not table this, and you accept the proposal of the distinguished Senator from Washington, you have done two things--both of which are probably very, very bad for our country: One, you will kill this bill; secondly, you will dramatically cut veterans' benefits beyond anything anybody intended. Because to eliminate these technical corrections, you leave in place a law that is signed. The highway bill is signed into law, and it has a mistake in it. And the mistake dramatically cuts veterans' benefits beyond what was intended. 
So it may not be the intention of the sponsors, but you will accomplish two things, and I just stated them. And I believe that is the case. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Subtitle A of title IX of the conference report on H.R. 2676, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act, contains a number of technical corrections to the Transportation Equity Act for the Twenty-first Century (TEA-21). This subtitle is essentially identical to H.R. 3978, which passed the House by voice vote but has been held up in the Senate due to objections chiefly over provisions concerning Veterans smoking benefits. 
Mr. President, I want to focus my remarks on the technical corrections to title VIII of TEA-21. This title of the transportation bill did two things. First, it provided roughly $17.5 billion in offsets to pay for the cost of the additional highway and transit spending in TEA-21. With respect to the offsets in TEA-21, the technical corrections in this conference report make a number of changes in the Veterans provisions which will provide a net $959 million increase in Veterans spending as a result of correcting a drafting errors in TEA-21. 
This technical corrections bill modifies provisions in TEA-21 that inadvertently labeled smoking an act of willful misconduct on the part of the veteran. Further, this bill reverses provisions included in TEA-21 that extended the change in compensation law to include those people who are currently serving in the military or have recently left the service but are still within certain statutory presumptive periods where any illness is presumed to be service connected. The technical correction also clarifies that the grandfather clause will include those veterans who have filed a claim before the enactment date, not only those with adjudicated claims upon enactment. Finally, the corrections bill adds a new section which extends the GI bill reimbursement increase to a veteran's survivor and dependents. This rate increase was intended to be included in the original bill but was inadvertently left out. 
Second, TEA-21 established a rather elaborate regimen under our budget laws to ensure a minimum amount of discretionary funding would be set aside for highway and transit programs. The conference report on TEA-21 did not include an explanation of the budget process changes in title VIII and I did not have a chance to discuss these changes in detail when we considered the conference report on TEA-21. 
TEA-21'S HIGHWAY AND TRANSIT `FIREWALLS' 
The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 extended through 2002 the spending limits, or caps, on spending provided in the annual appropriations process, what we call `discretionary' spending. The Balanced Budget Act also provided separate limits on defense, nondefense, and violent crime discretionary spending, which are frequently referred to as `firewalls'. These separate spending limits, or firewalls, effectively segregate a specified amount of spending for defense and violent crime reduction. 
Highways and transit spending are considered nondefense discretionary spending and must compete with other programs under the nondefense discretionary cap. While the Balanced Budget Act made transportation spending a priority, there was a strong desire to provide a means to allow the taxes collected by the Highway Trust Fund to be made available for highway spending. The House-passed transportation bill took highways off-budget. The Senate developed a mechanism in the budget resolution to direct savings from reductions in direct spending programs to the Appropriations Committees to pay for increased transportation spending. 
Trying to find a mechanism to provide a guarantee for discretionary spending for highways without breaking the budget proved to be one of the more difficult tasks for the conferees on the transportation bill. We ended up with a complicated mechanism that kept highways and transit funding subject to the appropriations process, the budget process, and the discretionary caps. 
Subtitle A of Title VIII of TEA-21 amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act to establish new categories on highway and transit spending at outlay levels for certain programs in TEA-21. The Act also made reductions to the nondefense discretionary limits by an amount equal to OMB's estimate of base level of funding for these programs. 
These highway and transit categories are very similar to the current defense and violent crime categories in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act with two notable exceptions. Unlike the defense or crime caps, TEA-21 amended section 250(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act to add a special rule that provides that any spending in excess of the highway and transit limits be charged to the nondefense discretionary or discretionary spending limits. 
Next, TEA-21 amended section 251(b)(1) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act to provide for two adjustment to the highway outlay limits and one adjustment for the transit outlay limit. 
One of our objectives in TEA-21 was to ensure that highway revenues would be spent. To meet this objective, the first adjustment ensures the highway outlay limit fluctuates with changes in gasoline tax levels. The highway spending levels and the outlay limits established by TEA-21 are based on the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) February 1998 estimates of tax revenues to the highway trust fund. To the extent actual revenue levels are different than these 1998 estimated levels or the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) updated estimates for the budget year is different than these levels, OMB is required to adjust highway obligation levels in TEA-21. Next, OMB is required to calculate the outlay changes that would result from the change in the obligation levels and adjust the highway outlay limits by that amount. 
A second concern was raised that purely technical changes in outlay estimates could cause the highway or transit outlay limits to be exceeded. The second adjustment TEA-21 added to section 251(b)(1) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act was to provide adjustments to the highway and transit outlay limits due to purely technical estimating changes. This was a challenge to draft because it is difficult to distinguish between changes in outlays for technical as compared to policy reasons. Under this second adjustment, OMB is required to estimate the outlays that would result from TEA-21 in its final sequester report this fall. Each year, as part of the President's budget submission, OMB is required to update its estimate of the outlays resulting from TEA-21 and adjust the outlay limits by any change in outlays due to technical re-estimates. 
On this technical adjustment for outlays, our intent is that OMB only adjust the outlay limits because of purely technical estimating changes. To the extent Congress makes changes in the appropriations process or takes other actions in legislation that effect the level of outlays for highways or transit, the resulting change in outlays should be absorbed by the respective limits and OMB should make no adjustments to those limits. 
Mr. President, section 251(b)(1)(D)(ii) is vague with respect to how OMB is to adjust the estimate it is required to make pursuant to clause (i) in this fall's final sequester report of the outlays resulting from TEA-21. Our intent is that OMB adjust this estimate of outlays by the adjustments it will make to the outlay limits pursuant to subparagraphs (B) (to align spending with revenues) and (C) (adjustments for technical outlay re-estimates). 
Mr. President, the highway and transit firewalls we established in TEA-21 was a compromise with the House and the Administration. I would have preferred a much simpler and much less rigid approach. I am particularly concerned, and share the concerns of the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, that these new firewalls unnecessarily impinge on the appropriations process. Finally, I am troubled by the complexity of this mechanism and the reliance we have placed on OMB estimates, particularly with respect to the adjustments allowed for the outlay limits. 
In conclusion Mr. President, let me say this. Even with my reservations and concerns about our new discretionary firewalls and the outlay adjustments that will be made to them, I strongly support TEA-21. The conference report is the culmination of over 14 months of effort by many members of the House and Senate. Our compromise allows for highway funds to once again be released to states and avoid delay in this year's construction season. Most importantly, TEA-21 provides increased funding for our nation's infrastructure while maintaining fiscal discipline and our balanced budget. I support this bill and am proud to have played an integral role in its development.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to raise the issue of housing for the mentally ill as the Senate discusses this important VA-HUD-Independent Agencies Appropriations bill. 
I have worked for many years to focus attention on the serious diseases that are mental illnesses. These are devastating diseases that can leave a person significantly disabled and in need of a variety of services, including affordable housing. 
Mr. President, I recently met with representatives of a non-profit organization, Cornerstone, Inc., that has provided capital funding to construct quality housing for the seriously and chronically mentally ill who reside in the District of Columbia. This program began in 1994 when Congress directed that $5 million of funding previously for St. Elizabeth's Hospital be allocated for community-based housing. With $3 million of this funding, Cornerstone has leveraged other resources to a total of $15 million that has been used to construct over 300 units of housing for those with mental illness. 
Cornerstone is now into its final year of funding under the original program. Continuation of this program with another $5 million in capital funding would enable over 350 patients currently residing at St. Elizabeth's to be housed in affordable housing at significant savings over continued residence at the Hospital. Housing supported by Cornerstone, Inc., costs less than $40,000 per unit compared to an estimated cost of $100,000 per patient at St. Elizabeth's Hospital. This is the type of public-private partnership that can do so much to help our communities. 
Would the Chairman agree that it would be worthwhile for the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to consider a proposal for continued funding of the Cornerstone, Inc. affordable housing program for the seriously and chronically mentally ill as the Department distributes its 1999 funding?

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, my support for this amendment must be qualified. I too am concerned about proliferation. However, I do not welcome the potentially negative consequences relying strictly on U.S. unilateral sanctions in this case. I strongly urge we combine sanctions with engagement. This engagement must be based on comprehensive, calculated non-proliferation policies. 
I believe that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction poses an imminent threat to U.S. and international security. The geopolitical strings that contained states' individual aspirations of mass destruction capabilities have been severed. The emerging multipolar world--in which the U.S. is, without question, the dominant economic, military and cultural power--creates new threats and offers new opportunities. 
Capitalizing on opportunities requires U.S. leadership. No other nation has the wherewithal to facilitate the creation and implementation of thoughtful and deliberate strategies to counter threats to U.S. and international security. No other nation parallels the power the U.S. can bring to bear in creating a stable international order. There is no doubt that we live in an increasingly interdependent world. Most major problems--economic, environmental, military--cannot be handled by the U.S. alone, despite our dominant position. 
The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is one such problem. This threat cannot be stemmed by unilateral U.S. actions. The dangers of weapons of mass destruction proliferation--whether by rogue nations or terrorist organizations--poses a threat to the U.S. military and U.S. civilians, as well as the future of humanity. In light of the changed global circumstances and the U.S. position as the global power, we urgently need to rethink antiquated doctrines of defense and provide a coherent approach to non-proliferation policies. 
Our nuclear reality has radically changed in the past weeks. Recent rumblings from the detonation of nuclear devices in Southeast Asia should awaken us to a few simple realities: our non-proliferation policies have failed; any country desirous of nuclear capability can attain it; and sanctions alone are an inadequate deterrent and potentially dangerous approach. 
Sanctions alone will not suffice in deterring would-be proliferators. When leaders of a country are willing to state that the people `will eat grass' in order to obtain weapons of mass destruction capability, this should be a sign of the relative impotence of U.S. unilateral attempts to alter their behavior. 
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty--the lynchpin of nuclear control--is under assault. North Korea, Iraq, India and Pakistan sent clear signals--nuclear proliferation is a threat now. How obvious do the warning signs have to be to evoke an effective response?

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending military construction appropriations bill provides $8.5 billion in new budget authority and $2.6 billion in new outlays for Military Construction and Family Housing programs for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1999. 
When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the outlays for the 1999 program total $9.1 billion. 
Compared to 1998 appropriations, this bill is $417 million lower in budget authority, and it is $477 million lower in outlays. 
This legislation provides for construction by the Department of Defense for U.S. military facilities throughout the world, and it provides for family housing for the active forces of each of the U.S. military services. Accordingly, it provides for important readiness and quality of life programs for our service men and women. 
The bill is within the revised section 302(b) allocation for the Military Construction Subcommittee. I commend the distinguished subcommittee Chairman, the Senator from Montana, for bringing this bill to the floor within the subcommittee's allocation. 
Because Congress has not yet passed the final 1999 congressional budget resolution, prior year outlays for this bill have not yet been revised to reflect Congress' override of President Clinton's Line Item Veto of 37 FY 1998 military construction projects. When this adjustment is made, outlays prior to 1999 will be revised upward by $112 million. It is my understanding that this necessary adjustment will be made when CBO revises its baseline for this legislation, which should be before this bill is reported back to the Senate from Conference with the House. 
The bill provides important increases over the President's request for 1999, and I urge the adoption of the bill.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, partnerships among our federal laboratories, universities, and industry provide important benefits to our nation. They help to create innovative new products and services that drive our economy and improve our quality of life. Today I introduce the DOE Partnership Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 1999. This Amendment improves the capabilities at the DOE sites for effective partnerships and interactions with other federal agencies, with the private sector, and with universities. 
I have personally observed the positive impacts of well crafted partnerships. These partnerships enhance the ability of the laboratories and other contractor-operated facilities of the Department of Energy to accomplish their federal missions at the same time that the companies benefit through enhanced competitiveness from the technical resources available at these sites. 
I have also seen important successes achieved by other federal agencies and companies that utilized the resources of the national laboratories and other Department sites through contract research mechanisms. Contract research enables these sites to contribute their technical expertise in cases where the private sector can not supply a customer's needs. Partnerships and other interactions enable companies and other agencies to accomplish their own missions better, faster, and cheaper. 
I've seen spectacular examples where small businesses have been created around breakthrough technologies from the national laboratories and other contractor-operated sites of the DOE. But, at present, only the Department's Defense Programs has a specific program for small business partnerships and assistance. 
All programs of the Department have expertise that can be driving small business successes. Historically, in the United States, small businesses have often been the most innovative and the fastest to exploit new technical opportunities--all of the Department's programs should be open to the small business interactions that Defense Programs has so effectively utilized. 
I have been concerned that barriers to these partnerships and interactions continue to exist within the Department of Energy. In addition, the Department's laboratories and other sites need continuing encouragement to be fully receptive to partnership opportunities that meet both their own mission objectives and industry's goals. And finally, small business interactions should be encouraged across the Department of Energy, not only in Defense Programs. 
For these reasons, I introduced S. 1874 on March 27, 1998, the Department of Energy Small Business and Industry Partnership Enhancement Act of 1998, which was co-sponsored by Senators Thompson, Craig, Kempthorne, Bingaman, Reid, and Lieberman. The National Coalition for Advanced Manufacturing, or NACFAM, endorsed our actions with S. 1874, describing it as `a crucial step in reducing barriers to cooperation between the national laboratories and private industry, higher education institutions, non-profit entities, and state and local governments.' NACFAM also noted that this `bill supports our shared conviction that collaborative R&D will further strengthen America's productivity growth and national security.' 
Today I introduce, with Senator Bingaman as a co-sponsor, language for amendment of the National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 1999 that accomplishes almost the same goals as S. 1874. This Amendment was developed through consultation with several of the co-sponsors, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Senate Committee on Armed Services, and the Department of Energy. 
This Amendment removes barriers to more effective utilization of all of the Department's contractor-operated facilities by industry, other federal agencies and universities. The Amendment covers all the Department's contractor-operated facilities--national laboratories and their other sites like Kansas City, Pantex, 
Hanford, Savannah River, or the Nevada Test Site. 
This Amendment also provides important encouragement to the contractor-operated sites to increase their partnerships and other interactions with universities and companies. And finally, it creates opportunities for small businesses to benefit from the technical resources available at all of the Department's contractor-operated facilities. 
This Amendment supplements the authority of the Atomic Energy Act, which limited the areas wherein the Department's facilities could provide research and other services, not in competition with the private sector, to only those mission areas undertaken in the earliest days of the AEC. My Amendment recognizes that the Department's responsibilities are far broader than the original AEC, and that all parts of the Department should be available to help on a contract basis wherever capabilities are not available from private industry. 
One barrier at the Department to contract research involves charges added by the Department to the cost of work accomplished by a site. At some laboratories, these charges now range up to 25%. This Amendment requires that charges to customers for research and other services at these facilities be fully recovered, and sharply limits addition of extra charges by the Department to only 3%. The Amendment further requires waiver of these extra charges for small business and non-profit entities and provides a process for the Secretary of Energy to continue any pre-existing waivers. 
The Amendment creates a five-year pilot program for external customers that enables facilities to examine their overhead rates and determine if an alternative lower rate serves to cover services actually used by these customers. For example, where companies or universities do not require secure facilities or do not utilize the extensive special nuclear material capabilities of the laboratories, then the customer will be charged an overhead rate that excludes security costs and environmental legacy costs. This pilot program will enable the Department and facilities to evaluate the impact of these lower overhead rates for one important class of external customers. The Department is required to report in 2003 on the interim results of this Pilot and to provide recommendations on possibly continuing this Pilot and even extending it to include other federal customers. 
The Amendment provides direct encouragement for expansion of partnerships and interactions with companies and universities by requiring that each facility be annually judged for success in expanding these interactions in ways that support each facility's missions. The Amendment requires that the external partnership and interaction program be considered in evaluating the annual contract performance at each site. 
And finally, the Amendment sets up a new Small Business Partnership Program in which all of the Department sites participate. This action will enable small businesses across the United States to better access and partner with any of the Department's contractor-owned facilities. A fund for such interactions up to 0.25 percent of the total site budget is available for these small business interactions. 
With these changes, Mr. President, the Department of Energy facilities will be better able to meet their critical national missions, while at the same time assisting other federal agencies, large and small businesses, and universities in better meeting their goals and missions.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to provide $5 million for programs that will radically reduce space launch costs. I understand that this amendment has been accepted by the Chairman and Ranking Member, and I thank them for their cooperation in this regard. 
This amendment will provide support for further development of robust and cost-effective launch vehicles. One such program, the Scorpius Low Cost Launch Development Program, has met development goals on or under budget in every instance. Delays in the program have been a result of bureaucratic delays, rather than technical problems. This is a solid program, and it deserves our full support. 
In addition to a need for the U.S. to regain a competitive position in the international market for space launch, critical national security concerns can be addressed by reducing these costs. 
Achieving reduced launch costs is clearly in the national interest. From 1993 through 1997, the United States spent roughly $11 billion for unmanned space launches--well over $2 billion annually. Due to these unnecessary and exorbitant costs, we have lost the commercial space launch industry, which America pioneered, to overseas competitors. 
Moreover, the excessive costs of space launch in this country have induced current and past Presidents to allow satellite launches from China, Russia and France. It currently costs $10,000 to $12,000 a pound to launch a payload using U.S. rockets. In contrast, China charges $4,000 to $5,000 per pound. Thus, satellite companies can save up to $50 million by using foreign source to put their satellites into orbit. 
There is a further national security objective that demand cheaper space launch capability. Command and control elements of our military force increasingly rely on digital and satellite communications capability. These communications capabilities and global positioning systems require sufficient satellites for effective implementation. The U.S. can either pay exorbitant amounts to attain adequate communications capabilities or we can support low-cost launch programs now that will radically reduce the costs incurred later. 
I have been following closely the progress of Microcosm, a small California company, and its Scorpius program. This is an effort to lower space launch cost from the current level of over $7,000 per pound to low Earth orbit to under $1,000 per pound. If successful, the current launch cost for a 15,000 pound military communications satellite would drop from over $75 million to less than $15 million. The over $2 billion per year U.S. cost would drop to less than $255 million per year--for the same level of effort. 
The design of these systems is robust with a margin of two-to-one compared to current rockets with a near one-to-four factor, almost nothing. Its launch crew is comprised of 12 technicians, not the current hundreds, even thousands of engineers needed today. Those same 12 technicians, when not actually firing the rocket, would be assembling them. It is truly a simple design. 
Scorpius would be a bona fide `launch on demand' vehicle, able to lift off within 8 hours after the payload arrives at the launch site. Its short, squat design, though less elegant than present rockets, makes it oblivious to weather limitations, such as high wind. It would not require the extensive launch infrastructure, such as gantry, providing great flexibility of where it could be fixed. If desirable, Scorpius could even 
be sea-launched. Our military field commanders would be able to request and receive the satellite resources they need when and where they need them. 
Microcosm has already received 12 SBIR contracts for Scorpius totaling roughly $4 million. All SBIR contracts were awarded competitively. In Fiscal year 1997, Congress specifically funded Scorpius with the program receiving $7.5 million; in Fiscal Year 1998, Congress again specified Scorpius funding, this time at $10 million. The results have been impressive: 
19 5,000 pound thrust engines built, each at a cost under $5,000--establishing a benchmark cost per pound of thrust of less than $1, a significant improvement over current engines; 
19 engines test-fired including 8 each for 200 seconds of continuous burn--the performance required to get a payload to LEO (low Earth orbit); 
the 5,000 pound thrust engine, with injector, completed and qualified for flight; 
design completed, including the Critical Design Review, for the 20,000 pound thrust engine; 
the entire avionics package completed and successfully qualified at Marshall Space Flight Center: Huntsville, Alabama; 
fuel and cryogenic tanks, with liners, designed and fabricated for the SR-1 sub-orbital vehicle; 
a new test stand, designed for engines up to 100,000 pounds of thrust; and 
technical spin-offs that could benefit non-Scorpius programs as well, such as the gas generator. 
The funding requested for Fiscal Year 1999 would yield similar results. With adequate funding in 1999, Microcosm could achieve the following: 
design, development and test Scorpius engines through 80,000 pounds of thrust; 
preliminary design and testing of the 320,000 pound thrust engine; 
test flights of the sub-orbital vehicles; and 
preliminary design of the light-lift orbital vehicle. 
The program has been subjected to many senior technical reviews by both government and industry experts. No significant technical problem has been identified. 
Low cost launch programs are a bargain. We have a simple choice. Either we will continue to fall behind in our competitive position for space launch costs and risk U.S. security through the transfer of sensitive technologies to be launched by other countries, or we can attain over 85% savings to taxpayers for space launch needs in the near future. These leap-frog technologies could make space launch truly affordable. With our support these efforts will recapture an American industry--and jobs--now lost to foreign countries.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent this morning and I missed the vote on the Conference Report for H.R. 1882 the A+ Savings Account for Public and Private Schools. 
I am pleased that this bill was approved by the Senate by a vote of 59-36. This legislation has my wholehearted support. 
Several significant reforms in the bill are based, in part, on findings of a Senate Task Force on Education that I was privileged to be a part of. These include testing and merit pay incentives of teachers, and tax incentives for parents who save for their children's K-12 education needs. 
The President should look at the merits of this bill and sign it into law. It is time that the federal government stops enabling an entrenched education bureaucracy that resists every attempt at exponential change. 
New Mexicans, I believe, are ready to embrace such change, and this legislation is the vehicle to begin making our schools ready for the twenty-first century. 
I am pleased this bill includes a provision to provide incentive funds to states that establish periodic assessments of elementary and secondary school teachers, including a merit pay system to reward teachers based on merit and proven performance. The provision permits the use of federal education dollars to establish and administer these programs. 
Teacher testing and merit pay is an important philosophical shift. It is reasonable to expect teachers to know the subject matter they are responsible for imparting to our young people. 
The centerpiece of the bill is the establishment of tax-free savings accounts that can be used for qualified education expenses from kindergarten through twelfth grade. 
Main provisions in the bill, beyond the merit pay and block grant provisions, are: 
A+ Savings Accounts: These accounts are similar to the current Education IRA for college tuition. Under this bill, the annual contribution limit will be increased from $500 to $2,000 a year. This gives millions of famlies the opportunity to save tax-free for their children's education. 
Extend employer-provided education benefits to 1 million employees--The bill extends this popular provision that allows employees to accept employer-provided education assistance without having to declare it as income (up to $5,250 a year). The tax exclusion will apply to assistance for undergraduate courses. 
Allow 1 million students to benefit from tax-free state pre-paid tuition plans--Many states have established pre-paid tuition plans to make it more affordable to attend state colleges in the future, and to help families save for this important expenses. The bill goes a step beyond tax deferral of such savings as currently allowed--this bill makes such savings tax-free. (The New Mexico legislature is expected to consider a pre-paid tuition plan.) 
School Construction: Assists local governments in issuing tax-exempt bonds for school construction by increasing the small-issuer exception from $10 million to $15 million, provided that at least $10 million of the bonds are issued to finance public schools. 
Health Scholarships: Provides tax-free treatment for National Health Corps Scholarships. In addition, the conferees extended tax free treatment to Hebert Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarships. 
Student Improvement Incentive Awards: Allows State education agencies to make awards to public schools that demonstrate a high level of academic achievement. 
State Incentives for Teacher Testing and Merit Pay: Authorizes the Department of Education to provide awards to states that test their K-12 teachers every three to five years in the subjects they teach and that have a merit pay program. 
Same Gender Schools and Classrooms: Allows federal funding for education reform projects that provide same-gender schools and classrooms, as long as comparable opportunities are afforded both sexes. 
Reading Excellence: Authorizes a literacy program that focuses on training teachers to teach reading using scientifically proven methods such as phonics. The President supports the program and $210 million was appropriated by Congress last year to establish a literacy program. 
Safer Schools: Includes language providing that weapons brought to school are admissible as evidence in any internal school disciplinary proceedings. 
I genuinely hope that the President will sign this bill.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate today has passed the National Drought Policy Act of 1998. I introduced the National Drought Policy Act of 1997 a year and a half ago in response to the devastating drought suffered in New Mexico and the rest of the Southwest in 1996. The Senate passed that legislation, and Representative Skeen introduced H.R. 3035. The time is indeed ripe to send this legislation now to the President, as once again the Southwest may face devastating drought conditions. 
The drought of 1996 was a natural disaster that cost $5 Billion in the Western United States. Already this year, drought conditions in Texas are parching farming and grazing lands that will cost an estimated $1.7 Billion in crop and livestock losses. Drought conditions are also being reported in areas throughout the South. And the summer of 1998 has not yet officially begun. 
Every region in the United States can be hit by these catastrophes. Yet, while drought is so pervasive and affects the economic and environmental well-being of the entire nation, the United States is poorly prepared to deal with serious drought emergencies. As a result of the hardships being suffered in every part of my state last year, I convened a special Multi-State Drought Task Force of federal, state, local, and tribal emergency management agencies to coordinate efforts to respond to the drought. The Task Force was ably headed up by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and included every federal agency that has programs designed to deal with drought. 
Unfortunately, what the Task Force found was this: although the federal government has numerous drought related programs on the books, we have no integrated, coordinated system of implementing those programs. Drought victims in this nation do not know who to turn to for help, and when they finally do find help, it is too late and totally inadequate. The gradual nature of drought devastation underscores the need for drought management rather than drought response. 
This legislation will be the first step toward finally establishing a coherent, effective national drought policy. The House-passed bill only slightly modifies my original language which passed the Senate in November. The National Drought Policy Act of 1998 creates a commission comprised of representatives of those federal, state, local, and tribal agencies and organizations that are most involved with drought issues. S. 222 charges the commission with providing recommendations on a permanent and systematic Federal process to address this particular type of devastating natural disaster. 
Unfortunately, drought conditions are a way of life in my region of the country. But better planning on our part, and with the recommendations of the Drought Commission established by this legislation, may limit some of the damage. I look forward to the President's prompt signing of this important legislation.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to compliment the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee on his very skillful handling of this important legislation and for his statesmanlike approach to some serious and troubling budget issues in this year's defense budget. 
This year the defense budget is once again confronted with a serious mismatch between the DoD/OMB and the CBO estimates of the outlays needed to execute the programs in the budget. CBO's estimate was $3.7 billion higher than OMB and DoD's estimate. 
Becuase the President's proposed defense budget was right up against the discretionary spending caps adopted in the Bipartisan Budget Agreement, compensating for CBO scoring would require large reductions in manpower, procurement, or readiness, or all three. Cuts like that are simply not acceptable. 
Thanks in large part to the cooperation we received from the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee and of the Appropriations Committee, from CBO and from OMB, we were able to devise a solution to much of the problem. The solution has three parts: 
First, Congress would legislate policies recommended by the Administration to better manage cash in DoD's Working Capital Funds. This would lower fiscal year 1999 outlays by $1.3 billion. 
Second, Congress would agree to changes in two classified accounts in the Air Force budget that would lower 1999 outlays by $700 million. 
Third, Congress would enact asset sales amounting to roughly $700 million. 
The Chairmen of the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee have assured me that taken together these actions reduce the 1999 outlay shortage to manageable dimensions and help avoid the negative effect on readiness or modernization that was feared. 
Mr. President, I have reviewed the text of the 1999 Defense Authorization bill, and I believe we are within reach of the solution. However, I have a concern. 
The cash management provisions of DoD's Working Capital Funds contains a waiver clause for the Secretary of Defense that is very broad. I am concerned that some in the Department may find this waiver authority too tempting to resist and will use up the outlays intended to be left in the cash reserves of the Working Capital Funds. Unless there are truly extraordinary and compelling reasons that are not now apparent to us, I believe it would be a very serious mistake to use the available waiver authority. Doing so would certainly destroy the cooperation and trust that has been built up this year with the Defense Department and OMB as we worked together to address this outlay problem. 
Assuming there is no unwarranted use of the waiver authority granted in the amendment, I believe we can say we have bridged this problem this year. Next year, I very strongly hope we will receive more accurate outlay estimates from those who have in the past tended to underestimate them. It is unacceptable to receive such miscounts of outlays and then to be told that for Congress to adopt more accurate estimates, the readiness and modernization of our Armed Forces must be reduced. I hope this is the last time we are forced to address this issue.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, partnerships among our federal laboratories, universities, and industry provide important benefits to our nation. They help to create innovative new products and services that drive our economy and improve our quality of life.

This Amendment improves the capabilities at the DOE sites for effective partnerships and interactions with other federal agencies, with the private sector, and with universities.

I am agreeing to accept the amendment and we will take it to conference on those terms. The Senator can rely on what I have just said.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have no further debate on the amendment. We are going to accept it. 
I will make a little comment about what happened to the budget from the President of the United States as it pertains to this bill. First of all, the President of the United States, in the budget he submitted to the U.S. Congress, is responsible for the fact that we don't have enough money to do the renewables that the distinguished Senator from Vermont comes to the floor and adds money for. The President of the United States took the water projects of this country--and these are not pet projects, these are the ports that have to be dredged in our country, dams that have to be built for flood protection, just a whole litany of them everywhere--he cut them $1.3 billion. 
Frankly, all I can see in that kind of a cut is that he expected us to put the money back because we could not have kept the Corps of Engineers together with their projects out across our land. We could not have kept a viable program. Mr. President, $1.3 billion is a dramatic cut from what was needed for funding at the acceptable rate that the projects were in last year--not new ones. That money makes up the same pot of money from whence comes all of the DOE's nondefense research projects and all the water projects. 
So we start off with that one pot of money, short $1.3 billion, and the President picked and chose what he would like to increase. As a matter of fact, he increased certain water projects that he has been for and forgot about the water projects that the rest of the Congress has been for, including very important projects. 
Now, in order to get around that, we had to find money from places that he had dramatically increased. Even at that, we only funded those projects at between 60 and 70 percent, meaning it will cost us more money in the long run, the projects will be delayed, and some of them are very big, important projects for commerce such as ports that are to be dredged, with facilities to be built. 
It wasn't, when we put this bill together, that with some kind of gusto we set about to dramatically reduce the programs that are the subject matter before the Senate right now. It was that we had an obligation to fund that fund at 60 or 70 percent. That is all we could do for the myriad of water projects across this land which have a tremendous economic impact and which save much property and save much life when they are completed. 
Now, that puts in the position we are when we come to the floor here. Everybody understands that we are not going to have it much easier in conference, although thanks to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee a little more money was allocated to this committee than the President's budget because of the water project dilemma that I have just described. 
Now, that is the essence of why this bill has difficulty. It is not even funded in many areas as high as it was last year. Certainly, the water projects don't have sufficient resources to stay on the course that was there. That was the best course, the optimum course, in terms of efficiency and getting the projects done so that we would save lives and save property at the earliest time. 
Having said that, with no objection from the ranking member on the other side, we will accept this amendment and do our very best in conference to see that solar energy and the items mentioned in the amendment, that the funding is increased from what we had in our bill.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in stark contrast to the last 3 1/2 weeks, this bill is moving along very rapidly. I announce to the Senate that we can, indeed, finish this bill by midafternoon. The amendments that we are aware of that have come either through the minority, through my good friend, Senator Reid, or through our side, are being worked on and we don't think there is a rollcall vote necessary on any of those. There is one amendment that the distinguished Senator from Indiana, the junior Senator from Indiana, intends to offer. It is not related exactly, to this bill, but he indicates that he will be here about 2 o'clock. 
In the meantime, we are going to try to work on the amendments we have and see if we can put a package together and accept them. That will be all we will have until 2 o'clock, unless some Senator has some amendment of which we are unaware. 
I really want to make sure that everybody knows I have checked with the leader. He knows of no other business on this bill, and he wants to finish this afternoon. By 2 o'clock I hope we can have the Indiana Senator call up his amendment. Again, I indicate that is the last amendment we know about.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say to Senator Allard and to the people of your State, because the community of interests have come together--and much of that is attributable to your leadership--we are now able to say to all of the country that we finally have one of these sites that must be cleaned up, that has a date, a date certain, that it will be cleaned up. Now, that is a rarity. 
If the American people knew how long it takes us to clean up one of these sites because of a variety of reasons--some of which are not very good, yet we are stuck with them--they would be delighted, as I am, that we now have one that can be cleaned up and completed and we can say this is part of history in that area, and the surrounding communities are rid of this waste. 
We saw that daylight, and we put in extra money. We are not apologetic in a tight budget year to say we put more in because we have to have some successes. We are busy spending our taxpayers dollars in projects of cleanup that we cannot even tell you will ever get cleaned up. Some of the things causing that we can't even change here on the floor of the Senate unless we go back and undo State law and have more hearings and look at contracts. Maybe that ought to be done, because there is a bit of irrationality regarding some of the projects of cleanup that now turn out to be situations where, when the project was in full bloom and operating to produce whatever it was producing for the nuclear deterrent system, they had fewer workers then than they have cleaning up. The Senator probably found that in his research as he familiarized himself with this particular dilemma. 
I am very pleased that people like you went to the community and clearly indicated that there aren't a lot of options. If they don't want to let some of these things happen, it will all stay there. You told me that. You took the lead in convincing many people that those who didn't want one thing done, unless it was absolutely beyond perfection, with no possible risks involved for anyone or anything, that we wouldn't move a bit of this waste under those conditions. I laud you for that. I am glad we found money to put in to take care of it quickly.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we want to say to the leadership of the Senator's community there in his State, at least you understand we don't have a clean project that is going to go on forever. We are not past that stage in some areas. Some people think that paychecks by the hundreds of millions ought to be coming on for another 100 years. I don't know how we are going to be able to do that. Costs will keep going up. We have to find some satisfactory ways, with our intelligence, science, and innovation, to do some of these things better. That is what is happening there.

Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his continued interest and involvement in the Devils Lake matter. The answer to both of the Senator's questions is `no.' The bill language that you cited, which was originally negotiated by the two of us, Senator Bond and our colleagues from North Dakota last year, would be fully applicable. The committee report does not waive NEPA, the Boundary Waters Treaty or any of the other conditions found in the bill language. In summary, the Executive Branch would need to fulfill the economic and technical justifications, the reporting and budgeting requirements, as well as the NEPA and Boundary Waters Treaty terms, before any of the appropriated funds can be expended for outlet construction. The report language signals our expectation that the Executive Branch would make full use of the emergency provision currently available under NEPA and that all steps would be taken to expeditiously fulfill the requirements of the Boundary Waters Treaty in the event that rising lake levels warrant accelerated construction of the outlet.

Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, the Senator is correct. In Fiscal Year 1998 and 1999 we included funding for the Remote Power Initiative to support deployment of solar, wind, fuel cell, biomass, and other energy technologies in remote areas to address their energy challenges. Last year, you highlighted the energy demands and environmental constraints of ski area operations as one example of this problem facing remote areas. As you noted, ski areas in Vermont were one of the leading sources of NOx emissions due to use of inefficient and polluting diesel engines for operations. This is the kind of problem the subcommittee had in mind when proposing the Remote Power Initiative.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, S. 2138, the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1999, complies with the Budget Act's section 302(b) allocation of budget authority and outlays. 
The reported bill provides $20.9 billion in budget authority and $13.1 billion in new outlays to fund the civil programs of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, certain independent agencies, and most of the activities of the Department of Energy. When outlays from prior year budget authority and other actions are taken into account, this bill provides a total of $20.7 billion in outlays. 
For defense discretionary programs, the bill is at its allocation for budget authority and below its allocation for outlays by $2 million. The Senate- reported bill also is below its nondefense discretionary allocation by $38 million in budget authority and $1 million under its allocation for outlays.

Mr. DOMENICI. This is a good bill we passed. It has a lot of interesting and needed policy decisions, projects and programs. We will have a very difficult conference with the House because they have some noticeably different priorities, especially when it comes to spending more money on water projects than we were able to spend. There will be less on research on DOE's nondefense research projects. But, overall, I am most particularly pleased with the nuclear part of this bill, for nuclear research, which we have five or six more new nuclear research projects, three that the President asked for, three that we asked for. 
You know, the United States is very much behind the world on matters of nuclear power and nuclear science and nuclear engineering. Frankly, the world is moving in that direction. We were the beginners. We were the ones who started it. We were heralded as the world's most knowledgeable and efficient, and we are going to play some catchup, but catch up we will do, in the next decade, because nuclear power and nuclear energy will come back in the world. Whether America makes policy decisions sufficiently to give it a chance or not, only time will tell. But some decisions of the past 20 years, with reference to nuclear activities, have been about as inconsistent with what is happening in the world as anything anyone could imagine, based on wrong premises, expecting action in the world that never occurred. 
Those things are going to have to be debated. A few of them start to move here. But, over the long run, there will be very significant debate about what happens to nuclear power and nuclear activities in the United States. 
Right alongside that, while all that is going on that I have described, be it negative or however one would categorize it, clearly the Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship, which we are using in lieu of any further underground testing to protect our nuclear arsenal and make sure it is safe and trustworthy, is generating some of the most exciting new physics and science of anything going on in the world. Indeed, our great scientists and engineers are producing instrumentation, computerization, and new methods of looking inside of nuclear bombs to see what is really going on so we can replace the right parts, since we do not make any new ones. This is all very exciting and is adding a great dimension of science activity while a very valuable thing is being done for our country. Expensive it may be, but the right thing, without question, it is. 
With that, more will be said during the year on those issues. I thank, in conclusion, my ranking member, Senator Reid. I believe between us we not only work well together but I think we have helped each other make this bill a better bill. For that, I am very grateful to the Senator from Nevada, and I thank him very much. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to join with Senator Kennedy in support of the PRIME Act, `Program for Investment in Micro-Entrepreneurs Act of 1998.' 
Starting one's own business is a part of the American dream. There are thousands of creative and hardworking men and women who believe they have a solid idea for building a new business. The realities of beginning a business are that it takes more than luck, hard labor, and dedication to make it work. There are often overwhelming obstacles for would-be small and micro entrepreneurs, due in part of the complexity of local, state and federal laws, the necessity of understanding the intricacies of marketing, feasibility studies, and bookkeeping practices, as well as finding a source for capital. Entrepreneurs usually need basic assistance to bring their idea to a viable business enterprise. They need training, technical assistance, and mentoring. 
Under this bill grants will be available through the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, matched at least 50 percent in non-federal funds, to help experienced non-profit organizations provide the assistance these new businesses so urgently require. Fifty percent of these grants will be awarded to applicants serving low-income clients, and those serving equally both urban and rural areas. From so many case studies and histories of successful businesses, we know that enthusiastic entrepreneurs can sustain and build their businesses when these organizations are available to provide critical training and professional, technical assistance. 
I have had the pleasure of visiting countless new micro-level businesses in my State of New Mexico, a great majority of whom received assistance from the very competent WEEST Corp organization, now located in five different sites throughout our State. This organization not only provides key technical assistance and training and access to low interest revolving loans, but it also provides mentoring and information about sound business practices to ensure their creative ideas become viable business entities. 
Micro and small businesses are an absolutely critical component of our national economic growth. The Small Business Administration, for example, lends excellent support to entrepreneurs. At the small time, the PRIME Act will establish a complimentary program by enabling intermediary organizations to serve a more micro-level entrepreneurs who need specialized and hands-on assistance. This is a good investment for the future, and will be returned many fold by the creation of businesses that can contribute to the growth of the family, local, and national economies. 
There are many success stories we can all point to about the business that began with an idea and eventually grew into a major global corporation. It all began with the basic tenacity of a businessman, woman, or family. We have no way of knowing how many more such success stories will be told in the future. It is guaranteed, however, that there are thousands of such extraordinary entrepreneurs willing to provide the ideas and hard labor to make it happen, and with a little help, they will be successful. 
Again, I am pleased to join Senator Kennedy in cosponsoring the PRIME Act. Whatever we can do to assist who want to be self-reliant, successful entrepreneurs, with a piece of the American dream, is an investment well worth taking.

Mr. DOMENICI. I understand the Senator from Alaska has yielded me control of the time, and I will manage the time. I yield myself 2 1/2 minutes at this point. 
Mr. President, let me make a point first for everybody here. The Budget Act which was passed, with Republicans voting for it and three Democrats, the budget resolution, did three things that we have already forgotten about. 
One, it provided a $15.5 billion increase for NIH over the baseline, over the President's request; $15.5 billion without this bill goes to NIH for cancer research and the kind of things this bill is supposed to do. 
Secondly, the budget resolution provided $800 million--eight-tenths of a billion dollars--for teen smoking cessation. The President of the United States asked for less than that. 
The same budget resolution provides $5 billion for child care, and we are up here debating a bill to impose over the next 25 years $998 billion worth of new taxes, and we are talking like we haven't done anything in these areas that the very bill before us says we are supposed to do. 
Frankly, whether the other side is saying we killed this bill or not, I guarantee you, the bill was subject to a point of order before any of the amendments were attached. So an argument that Republicans added amendments and thus made it subject to a point of order is--it is subject to at least five points of order, and, as a matter of fact, the underlying bill is subject to the worst of all points of order. It kills the bill. That is how bad the bill is in terms of budgets. It kills the bill. We didn't make that point of order. The point of order that was made is one that says it goes back to the committee and they reconsider. 
Let me tell you, when you work on budgets and you all vote and you want to restrain Government spending, all the Budget Act says to you, once you made the deal and said this is the budget, if you want to violate it, you can. 
It does not say you cannot. It says you can. But you need 60 votes. 
That is what this argument is about. If you want to say we ought to pass this bill, it violates the Budget Act. It has far more spending than we agreed to spend. And let me tell you, another portion of this just absolutely says, here are the caps, the spending restraints, and we just do not care about them.

Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself a half a minute. 
We say the taxes do not count as taxes--that is what the bill says--and the expenditures do not count as expenditures. Now, how in the world could that not be subject to the Budget Act if we have any kind of budget restraint at all? So that is the issue. The issue is: Do you proceed with the bill or do you send it back to committee and let them try to fix it so it does not violate the Budget Act, which we spent 20 years developing around here to get our house in order? And all of a sudden, over 25 years, $998 billion worth of new revenues and expenditures are supposed to be forgotten about. 
I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will be managing the bill for the majority and the Subcommittee of Appropriations on Energy and Water Development. I understand that the minority will not consent to any amendments being laid down tonight. So we will just have opening statements, and then I gather we will take the matter up at the earliest opportunity in the morning and proceed until we finish. 
I might suggest, unless there are some amendments I am unaware of--and that could be the case--that there is a real possibility that we could finish this bill tomorrow. We would very much like to do that. That would mean Thursday night we would finish. If that doesn't happen, then we may have a complication with reference to the manager and ranking member, which might carry the bill over for a considerable number of days. 
I want to give a few opening remarks about the bill. First, I thank my ranking member, Senator Reid. This is a very difficult bill and, in many respects, contains some very, very serious, substantive matters for America and some very important defense policies with reference to nuclear weapons, our stockpile, and the like. We have worked very handily together, and I am proud of the bill we have before us. 
This bill was reported unanimously by the Committee on Appropriations last Thursday and was filed on Friday. It has been available to Senators since Monday. 
The committee recommendation provides a total of $20.9 billion in budget authority. Of that, $12 billion is defense and $8.9 billion is nondefense. Especially within the nondefense allocation, the committee has struggled to craft a recommendation that meets the Senate's expectations. The President's request for water projects was $1.8 billion below the level required to continue ongoing construction projects at their optimal level. If we were to truly fix that problem to provide the level of funding of water projects Congress envisioned when it enacted the Water Resources Development Act of 1998, which the President signed, and last year's Energy and Water Development Act, which the President signed, the committee would have to shift $1.8 billion from other programs within nondefense, which is only $8.9 billion of the entire bill. We would have to move that to the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. 
Now, Mr. President, when the President of the United States decided to reduce water projects by $1.8 billion, let me suggest that these are flood protection projects in many, many States. These are dams and reservoirs that have been under construction. These consist of work on channeling our ports. And, yes, there is money that was obligated to build our ports so that they could continue to carry the vast commerce that comes in and out of the United States through these ports. 
Much of the port activity--draining and the like, dredges--is paid for by the Federal Government. And the President decided that he had priorities in water, and he wanted us to pay for those and give dramatic increases. But when it came to all those projects that are all over our country that other Members appropriated last year and that the President signed, those were knocked out. 
Mr. President, that is just not the way to do business. It is all right if the President wants to cut things, but to do it like that and then ask for his special projects to be increased as if they are the only ones that are deserving of any increase, and all the rest of our States and our ports of entry are supposed to be cut, just doesn't make sense. 
So, actually, we are going to have a little difficulty when we go to conference in that part of the bill which is called nondefense. That includes water projects, plus nondefense research projects within the Department of Energy--some very important research projects. 
That much of a reduction would be impossible to impose on the Department of Energy's science, energy, research, and environmental management programs. Fortunately, to reduce our need to cut these programs, Chairman Stevens provided the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee with $238 million in nondefense budget authority above a freeze. 
The committee recommendation is to use all of that increase and an additional $211 million taken from a freeze level within the Department of Energy to add to water projects. I just explained why he wants to do that. Even at that, Senators have been very understanding, because it means two things for all the Senators and their projects. We have been able to provide between 60 percent and 70 percent of the optimal funding level for water project construction, and our baseline for the Department of Energy was a freeze, and we had to go below that. 
As an example, the administration proposed a $90 million increase, $26 million over last year, for solar and renewable energy. We are working with two of our Senators who want to amend what we have done in this bill. Let me just explain what we have done. 
Regardless of any individual's view on solar and renewable energy, the subcommittee does not have resources to provide the kind of increase that the President had in mind. The recommendation for solar and energy is a $780,000 reduction from the current level--that is what we have in our bill--and that is because we have to cut below a freeze in this part of this bill. 
As usual, the subcommittee has received requests for thousands of individual projects. To the best of our ability, we have tried to include those in the water area where requests were generally well founded requests to provide adequate funding for ongoing projects. Unfortunately, because the reductions apply to DOE's nondefense program, there is very little flexibility to add projects within budgets that are already being cut. 
For a specific recommendation--but before I do that--I am not sure that I will deliver my entire summary--I want to yield the floor and ask if my ranking member desires to make some comments at this point. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to proceed for a few minutes and then ask we move off of this bill and go into morning business. 
Mr. President, within the Department of Energy's nondefense accounts we have placed a priority on science. Our recommendation is only $44.9 million below the request, most of which is taken from prior year balances that can be used to offset fiscal year 1999 expenses. 
We are recommending proceeding with the construction of the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. When it is completed, it will be one of America's most significant research tools, and it will add to the versatility and diversity of that great laboratory. 
We have also provided funds for the administration's requests for new nuclear energy programs and have provided a slight increase for the magnetic fusion energy account, just enough to bring it up to current levels. We provided three additional nuclear research programs that we believe are absolutely urgent. 
The bill includes a total of $11.9 billion for the atomic energy defense activities. That is $269 million below the budget request. 
This bill contains $1.048 billion for defense facilities cloture projects. The largest increase is $32 million for Rocky Flats, that project which was significantly underfunded in the budget. Accelerated cleanup at Rocky Flats will save an estimated $1 billion, which would then be available for other 
cleanup work. So it is important that the schedule at Rocky Flats be maintained as much as possible. 
In other defense activities, one of my highest personal goals is to destroy excess weapons plutonium in the United States and Russia. I believe it is the key to permanent nuclear arms control. 
The administration is on a path to begin to fabricate into mixed-oxide fuels, 3 tons of U.S. weapons plutonium per year and is tentatively working to aid Russia to fabricate 1.3 tons per year into mixed-oxide fuel. I think both countries should destroy in the order of 10 tons per year. But more than that, we have to ensure that Russia destroys at least as much weapons plutonium as we do because they have many times as much as we do. Anything else amounts to unequal disarmament. 
So my recommendation is to provide for a full amount of the request, but make a portion of it contingent upon bilateral accords which require at least equal conversion of weapons grade plutonium in the United States and the Soviet Union. 
Mr. President, just one last closing remark, and perhaps we will have to talk about this more tomorrow. But I note, many Senators' offices have had lobbyists come to see them about what is in this bill and what is now called Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship. Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship is an American plan to use the highest of science, technology and computers to measure the efficacy and effectiveness of our nuclear weapons; that is, to determine if they will do what they are supposed to do, if they are safe, trustworthy and sound. 
If someone wants to come to the floor and suggest the $4.46 billion which goes to this Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship should be reduced because it is a lot of money, let me just suggest when the United States of America decided that we would no longer do underground testing, which is one of the methods to determine the validity of our nuclear weapons and of that stockpile--since we do not build any new ones, we are only talking about old ones--if you want to return to underground testing, you probably can get by with less money for Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship, because it takes the place, in a sense, of underground tests as part of the verification of the value of the nuclear weapons, in terms of trustworthiness, accountability, and the like. 
So, for those who do not want to give the scientists and the laboratory directors the tools so they can certify our supply of nuclear weapons every year to the President of the United States as required by law--first to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and then to the President--if you don't want to give them the money to do that, then let's have an amendment on the floor and see if we are going to return to underground testing. I do not believe anyone wants to do that, at least not enough Senators. So we have to proceed doing it through science, through new ways to x-ray, in a sense, what is in these weapons through computerization, which is going to be improved dramatically for America and the world as part of this process so we can use the vast models and research capacity of computers to do this job. 
The day may come when we do not have any nuclear weapons. But for now, Russia still has a lot of nuclear weapons. Within the last month and a half, we have heard about two more nuclear powers. I believe that we have to maintain ours in a solid, ready, trustworthy state, and reduce them as much as possible, consistent with the risks to the United States. That is the kinds of things in this bill--very, very important. 
I must say, all of that money comes out of the Defense Department. So, when you look at the defense moneys for America, you must understand that about $14 billion of it goes to this committee for the nuclear activities and the laboratories that produce and do the nuclear research for us, and for the maintenance of the stockpile. It is very important everybody understand that. That money cannot be spent anywhere else. It is subject to the walls that we have put up around defense spending so you cannot spend it for nondefense work, you cannot spend it for water projects, and I am very, very thankful you cannot. If those walls come down, you will see the pressure for domestic spending eat away at defense needs, including the defense needs as depicted in this bill.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't intend this afternoon to repeat much of the explanation which was made by the distinguished senior Senator from Texas but I just will emphasize it as I see it. 
First of all, it is very important to me that when we articulate an American policy and say we are for this or we are for that, that sooner, rather than later, we look at what our laws are and see if we can make them match the policy that we would like for our country. 
No. 1, everybody on the Senate floor, it seems to me, from time to time has been concerned about families in America. Obviously, the marriage tax penalty works against families, because if a married couple with two or three children are penalized to the extent of $1,400 a year in taxes that they pay--just because they are married, which they would not pay if they had their exact same earnings and filed separately or were not married--that is clearly an American policy out of step with a profamily position of the United States and certainly of this Senator and most Senators I associate with in the U.S. Senate. 
Secondly, maybe it isn't articulated as precisely as the previous one tenet of philosophy, but I say we, as a nation, ought to espouse marriage and we ought to look with favor upon the relationship that is called marriage historically and traditionally. 
As my friend from Texas says, of all the institutions around, it seems to be that marriage is the one that has endured. It also seems to be one that when marriage does not endure or work properly it causes a lot of other problems within a family and throughout society. So to put an extra tax on that institution is wrong. 
In the United States of America, 24 million married couples have endured and paid through the nose because of this marriage penalty. 
I don't think they really thought when they said, `I do,' that they were also saying, `and we shall pay.' I don't believe that is what they thought they were doing when they took their marriage vows. 
The average penalty is about $1,400. I think everybody knows what an average means. Plenty of couples are paying much more. Obviously, there are plenty paying somewhat less. 
In my State of New Mexico, 203,00 New Mexican families will be helped by this change. We are a State with just a little bit over 1,600,000 people. That is a pretty significant benefit we are passing on to people who are married and raising families, and both spouses are working. 
By way of an aside, the second portion of our bill has to do with businesses that are self-employed people. Let me just give you that number. In New Mexico, 222,000 businesses are going to find that health insurance is going to be available to them now and be more affordable because under this provision they are going to be able to deduct the entire health cost, as do corporations and as do many others that are not self-employed. 
So if anybody is interested in how we got into this mess with the marriage penalty, I will put in some facts about it later. 
Obviously, this has come about with each major change we have made in the Tax Code, either to phase something out or to phase something in. There are about 63 provisions in the code, where couples are penalized for being married. The standard deduction and the progressive tax brackets are two of the major contributors to the marriage penalty. So many of these provisions in the code vary, as I indicated, with marital status. The provision that primarily is responsible for the marriage penalty, the standard deduction for married filing jointly, is not two times the standard deduction for filing if you are single. That is the major reason that we have a problem. 
Having said that, I want to relate this proposal to the bill that is before us. Every time we discuss a budget of the United States, or the economy of the United States, somebody talks about--and quite properly--what the level of taxation on the American people is. It is relevant to America's future, in my opinion and in the opinion of most economists looking at our country, that our tax on the American people, the total tax, be at the lowest possible level. Now, this bill before us, whatever its other interests are, is a very large tax imposition on the American people. Although it is not paid by everybody, you add it to the myriad of other taxes, and then you find out America is paying a higher total tax level than it was before this bill was passed. 
So, to me, it is very simple. If this is a tax bill--and clearly there are many people who want to spend every penny of it on some kind of program. In spite of a budget that said we would not spend any more, there are scores of programs on which people would like to spend money. It seems to me that the forgotten people would be the taxpayers who would get no benefit unless we reduce taxes and charge the reduction to the tax income coming under this bill. 
I think it is very logical and very reasonable--$16 billion in the first 5 years, $30 billion in the second 5 years, coming from the taxes raised in this bill from cigarettes. It will ultimately come from consumers. People think the tobacco companies are paying, but actually it will be added to the price of cigarettes and consumers will pay it. 
We are saying give $16 billion back to the taxpayers and $30 billion back in the form of these two tax reductions over ten 
years. That is a third of the tax take in the first 5 years and about 37 or 38 percent in the second 5 years. Under the bill, about 40 percent of the program goes to the States. I am not sure I favor that much going to the States, but we are not amending that provision here. That is to be considered at another time if the Senate wants to consider it. But so long as the states are expected to get 40 percent of the overall trust fund, Senator Gramm and I have agreed we won't offer any more tax cuts. But if indeed that 40 percent is reduced and we attempt to take some of that money back to the Federal Government and spend it, then obviously we reserve the right to offer some additional tax rebates or reductions or reforms at that time. 
I am hopeful that the Senate will adopt this amendment. There may be other tax measures, but I think essentially we are going to be separating Senators into two groups--Group One: Those Senators who want to spend all the money and group two who are Senators who want to give some of it back to the people. That is the issue. Do you want to give some of this back to the people, or do you want to spend it all for one program or regime or another that costs money, or a series of programs by which we give money back to the States for them to spend it? 
I think the American people are going to judge us very, very precisely on this and I don't think the judgment is going to be a difficult one. They are pretty astute. When we have just crowed about a balanced budget with caps on expenditures and we come and say now we found a new source of revenue, all those ideas about keeping Government under control can go out the window. We will spend all of this on new programs. I think they will understand very easily. They will focus quickly that those who vote no on this amendment will be saying they want to spend all the money; those who vote yes on this amendment are saying we ought to give some of it back to the American taxpayer--in this case, to that huge number of Americans who are married, with both couples working, wherein they are being penalized by the adverse effect of our tax laws, and that they must pay a penalty for being married and for earning a living and filing jointly. 
I am rather confident this is the right approach. Why do we stop at $50,000 worth of wage earnings? I will agree that is just an arbitrary number. But we can't fix everything in one bill. If there is a tax bill this year--and there probably will be one--I would think high on the list would be to repair the marital tax problem so the higher brackets of earners are entitled to receive that benefit also. I thank Senator Gramm for his untiring efforts on behalf of this. It is a privilege to work with him. I believe we will have a victory today. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. At 12:30; I hope I don't take that long. 
Mr. President, I wish I could have been on the floor when Senator Gramm spoke a little earlier, because I would have risen when he stated what we ought to try to do and what components we ought to try to agree upon to get a bill. I think he is right on. For those who were not listening, let me see if I can repeat. 
First of all, let me suggest, in the past--I have noticed that we get large groups of lobbyists in a room promoting causes in only two circumstances. One, when there is a giant tax bill or tax reform measure, the halls are lined with them. That prompted Senator Dole, once, to speak of the `Gucci gultch.' The only other time I see a large group in a room joined together lobbying, sending notes, watching television, is when there is a huge amount of money to spend. I have not seen large groups for any other causes. Guess what. In this case, it is obvious. The proponents of the bill have nothing in mind for tax cuts. So this large group meeting, with just scores of people watching every speech on the Senate floor and then sending people out to all the offices to get things done is because this is a giant spending bill. 
There is no one more concerned about what is happening to young people and tobacco than I am. I was a smoker for a long time. I didn't start when I was a youngster, however. Fortunately, for me, I quit. It has been 8 or 9 years--I can't remember--and I am very lucky. I have a large group of wonderful children and not a single one smokes. My wife doesn't smoke. I can hardly imagine what a burden I was on them when I had these cigarettes around all the time. I even remember the chairman of the Budget Committee, the distinguished Senator from Florida, Senator Chiles, who had to sit there while I smoked through all these markups. He bought me one of those suction machines. I would have to put my cigarettes on it and then it would suck up all the smoke. At least, he said, I could make it through these 10- to 12-hour markups. 
But, frankly, if we knew how to make our children quit smoking with $150 billion, and we said that is going to really keep them off cigarettes, and cancer rates are going to come down and the adult population is going to imitate the kids and they are going to stop smoking--because we have not talked about adults. I mean, they are smoking, too. 
As a matter of fact, those in the health business of the United States and health care--clearly something admirable and something we are all concerned about--they are the lobbyists for this bill. They all started off with something in mind. They had their pet projects, and everybody would talk about them as if they were related to teenage smoking. Everybody would come to the floor and speak about the statistics on teenagers smoking and talk about `that is what we were here for,' while the provision of the bill that had to do with teenage smoking is about one fiftieth of the bill in terms of pages. The rest of it is programs, programs we are supposed to fund and money we are supposed to give back to the States. 
I wonder how many Senators know that of the amount we give back to the States, we tell them how to spend at least half of it. When you look at the list, one wonders what the different programs the States are going to spend the money on have to do with teenage smoking. They have nothing to do with it. But it is suggested the Governors chose the programs--and they ought to have the right to--and we ought to comport with it and say `that is all you can use it for,' because, after all, they spent so much State tax money taking care of those people in their States who got lung cancer and were hospitalized, and had these very large treatment expenditures that came out of Medicaid. 
Let me tell you, it is absolutely amazing that we are so willing to put a huge portion--40 percent--of what we are supposed to take in under this bill to compensate the States for health care costs when the big health care costs were actually paid for by the U.S. Government taxpayers and the U.S. Government, because Medicare and Medicaid, in particular Medicare, is an Federal program, not a State program. This bill doesn't put a penny in it. It is still going bankrupt because of the enormous drag on that program of more than $25 billion a year for cancer-related smoking diseases. 
Medicaid, I know in my State, is paid for 75 percent by the Federal Government. Some States were 50; some States were 65. I think it is more than logical that a very large portion of anything we get here, if we put this together, should either go back to the taxpayers or will go back to the U.S. Government to help defray the expenses that we put into programs, like Medicare, which tax the American working men and women in a very, very regressive manner. 
Having said that, I believe, and I state publicly right here today, that I think a bill can be put together. I am not sure that it isn't too late for many because they are already part of the group that wants to spend all this money on all these different programs that are supposed to be directed at our children smoking, but I believe there ought to be a part of this program that goes back to the States. I don't know that there has to be 40 percent, and I don't know that it has to be for the programs that are dictated in this bill for the States. 
I also believe there ought to be a major antismoking and antidrug component to this bill, and it ought to be rather substantial. I certainly compliment the distinguished Senator from Georgia for the amendment that he has which brings front and center an even more disastrous habit which is catching on with our teenagers, more disastrous than smoking, and that has to do with illegal and illicit drugs from marijuana to the hard stuff, to cocaine. Now, the new surge is even something different from cocaine. We thought we were doing some good in that regard. Now heroin is back in vogue and use is growing. I compliment Senators Coverdell and Craig for offering this amendment. 
If we decided to give back to the States some but not necessarily as much money as this bill says, if we had a major program in illegal drug prevention akin to the amendment which the distinguished Senator from Georgia and his cosponsor, Senator Craig, have put before us, and then we did something for research through the NIH, or related, and gave the taxpayers of this country a break, especially those who are going to see the very onerous cost of cigarettes impinge on their lives because cigarettes may be as high as $3.50 to $4.50 a pack, if a bill like this passes, collecting a rather substantial amount of money--and I believe any bill ought to have a component which says let's reduce taxes, and since almost everybody on both sides of the aisle--maybe we quibble over details--but everybody knows the most antifamily, antichildren provision of the Tax Code is the one that punishes families who have two members working for a living as compared to two single people making the same amount--the marriage penalty. It is antifamily, it is antichildren, and clearly, that ought to be fixed. This is a rare opportunity to do that. If we can come together on a stripped-down bill that got rid of a lot of the things in this bill that really are not necessary and are not directly related to the problem at hand, we might make some headway. 
I also remind everyone that whenever any of us come here and say let's not pass a brand new major tax-and-spend bill under the nomenclature and title of helping our children quit smoking--Secretary Shalala said that if, indeed, the FDA regulations that they propose could be put in effect--and I will add, if they are constitutional--that they alone have been predicted by the Administration to reduce smoking by 50 percent in 7 years. That is a rather significant proposal and a rather significant assessment by an administration about teenage smoking. 
Why are we in such a hurry to put this big tax on and spend it for all these other things under the emphasis--I think ill-placed emphasis--that we are helping people quit smoking, when if we just tried those FDA regulations, if they are constitutional, they would restrain it by 50 percent in 7 years? I doubt we would achieve a higher goal even if we enact this huge tax and spend bill. In fact, I am not at all sure that we will do better. 
If you look around the country, as I have in my home State, New Mexico recently completed, I say to my friend from Georgia, a drug, alcohol, and tobacco use survey of public high school students around the State of New Mexico. Not surprising, cigarette use has increased slightly. It is now 54 percent at the 12th grade level. In 1993, it was 47. 
What is more shocking about the results of the survey is how much illegal drug use has increased in the past 5 years. In my State--I was looking at the chart which Senator Coverdell used--and in my State, marijuana use by 12th graders is up 38 percent; cocaine is up 144 percent; and 51 percent of the students in New Mexico who smoke marijuana said they got it from friends at school. We know that drug use often correlates with illegal behavior. I said `often,' I didn't say `always.' 
Sixty-three percent of the kids detained in New Mexico's juvenile justice system for violent behavior reported they used drugs on a weekly basis prior to their arrests. So nationally, the statistics are no more encouraging, and the Senator from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, has stated those in his emphasis as to why we ought to adopt his amendment. 
I support that amendment because it goes after illegal drug use from a number of fronts, and I am particularly pleased that in addition to promoting an anti-illegal drug use campaign, it does give some additional resources to those who are out there in the trenches fighting this war. 
I say to Senator Coverdell, I suggest that in the State of New Mexico, a major group of policemen--probably 40 percent of the law enforcement in the State is one police entity--they informed us and put out an article which they really believe there ought to be more money put into law enforcement. Particularly I will tell you what they are very worried about. They are worried about the fact they are going to get stuck with all the black market and illegal sales of tobacco, and they are going to be the ones to go out and enforce it. They truly believe at these prices it is going to be enormous in a State like ours; that it will come across from Mexico and all different places, and they are going to just be besieged. 
Obviously, I have not thought of a way to help local law enforcement in this bill, but it is not too far-fetched as part of that provision which seeks to help us with reference to the black market, that we ought to give some thought to our local law enforcement people. 
This afternoon or tomorrow I am going to speak on another subject, but I will say to Senators, I am continually amazed at what I find in this bill as page after page is looked at. 
I have two reports here. One is called `Reducing the Health Consequences of Smoking,' 1989. The other is called `The Health Consequences of Using Smokeless Tobacco, Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General.' And there is a third report referred to in a provision of this bill that we can't even get the report, so we have only the executive summary of 1986, a report to the Surgeon General. 
All I want to say about it right now is, believe it or not, there is a provision in this bill--I do not know who wrote it --but it says the burden of proof in the courts of America will be shifted to the tobacco companies with reference to any illness, disease, infirmity, that is reported in any three of these reports--even if it is mentioned. It means all you have to do is go file in the future, file a cookie-cutter lawsuit, and the tobacco company must disprove that your ailment or your disease or your condition came from smoking. 
This afternoon, or when I get the floor again, I will go through a list of what that is going to mean. I mean, if ever--if ever--there was a lawyers' relief bill, beyond that which we have been discussing in terms of their recompense for the settlements, it is here. 
We have been looking around for tort reform. And here we have exactly the wrong kind of tort reform. I do not believe very many Senators know that this provision is in this bill. I do not know whether I will try to take it out. I would just like to make sure it is well known. 
I do not want to leave the impression, and never have, that tobacco companies should not pay for what they have wrought on this society in terms of misleading advertising and the effects of smoking. But to say that three reports that compiles the research of every ailment or disease that has been researched to try and find a causal relationship between that ailment and cigarette smoking should be incorporated by reference in this bill is not a good way to legislate. Under this provision a plaintiff would not have to worry about proving it anymore, just allege it, sue for it, and the tobacco company must then prove that they did not cause it. 
That provision has been researched of late, and we will talk about it in a little more detail--how many thousands and thousands of lawsuits that would precipitate from people with diseases and ailments who never even gave a thought until now that they might find somebody who would pay for that; namely, the tobacco companies. 
So I say to those who are very, very well-intentioned, who support this measure, I have said before--and the bill was redone--I said before that it was far too cumbersome, had way too many agencies and bureaus and bureaucratic innovations in it that nobody should really support. It was fixed somewhat. And I still seriously question how it got put together, how these kinds of provisions could find themselves in there with no discussion. 
To me, this is one bill that I am very glad is taking a long time to get through the Senate. We normally say discussion on the Senate floor is good because it lets everybody understand what is going on and what the issues are. Frankly, I do not think we would have found out about all the things in this bill if we had not been down here for a couple weeks. It is just a very difficult job, very hard to do. 
So let me summarize. I believe the amendment ought to pass, because if we are going to raise significant money, as purported in this bill, we ought to go after more than just the problems that teenage tobacco smoking brings to our country. We ought to try our best, in a very reasonable and well directed way, to spend money trying to get a better handle on illicit and illegal drug use by our children and, in fact, by the American population. So I hope that passes. I hope cloture is not invoked. 
But I say that I believe it is beginning to come to the surface that a bill could be put together. It surely cannot be the bill that is before us. As a matter of fact, I think probably it ought to just get redrafted, if people want to put a bill together. 
Essentially, it ought to take care of the States in some way, not necessarily 40 percent. It ought to have a very significant tax cut, especially for those American families who are going to pay the tobacco tax--pay most of the tobacco tax. If we do that, it ought to be directed at the marriage penalty, perhaps some health related tax provisions, but that ought to take the lead. And we ought to put a major program together in trying to really declare war through advertising and other initiatives to aid in the prevention of smoking among kids. And, as I indicated, it is corollary with reference to illegal drugs. 
Another component could be research at NIH on cancer and related kinds of research. And that is probably doable in this country. And if you are going to spend some additional money, you can probably justify it there as well as anywhere else, although I would suggest that if you have a big bill like this with a lot of resources, we can bring amendments to the floor, one after another, showing areas where the U.S. Government is not doing what it ought to do in certain areas of endeavor that are our responsibility as a nation. And if it is needed, and doing a better job, we could have a myriad of amendments that we could let people vote on and decide what to do. 
For instance, I give you one. It is totally unrelated, but some provisions in this bill are also. When will the U.S. Government pay for Indian schools in America?--which are falling down around the kids, totally ill-equipped, are way beyond anything we would have non-Indian kids in in the United States. And the only entity that is supposed to pay for it is the Federal Government. It is not a school board, not a State; it is the Federal Government. There is a backlog of over $750 million. And we are leaving those kids out there, watching the suicide rates go up, watching the illegal drug rate go up, watching all the social problems they have, and every year we take care of one or two schools.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to just take a couple minutes to express my respects for Senator Barry Goldwater. I was unable to attend the services yesterday with Senators. I was just getting over a very bad chest cold, and I decided that I would try to recoup a little here. I wish I could have been there. 
Senator Goldwater was obviously an unflinching patriot whose life, in many ways, mirrored the American experience. He was rugged, independent, and unarguably his own man. 
I am deeply saddened by his passing. When I first arrived as a freshman Senator, Senator Goldwater offered me encouragement, and when I became budget chairman, provided inspiration when I first tackled the tough budget issues we faced in the early 1980s. 
He was a dedicated American and Senator, always willing to fight the tough battles. I was better for his fine support and his wise counsel. 
`Barry Goldwater cared deeply about America. He believed that our Nation must always remain strong and that Government should stay off the backs of our people and not stifle their innovative spirit. As an American, he never shied away from honestly stating his beliefs; and as a politician, he led by example, not by polls. 
He will be greatly missed. And Nancy and I send our sympathies and prayers to his family. 
U.S. Senator Barry Morris Goldwater, born in Phoenix AZ., Jan. 1, 1909, was elected to the Senate from Arizona in 1952, and later was defeated in his bid for the Presidency in 1964 by Lyndon Johnson. Senator Goldwater served in the Senate until retirement in 1987. 
I served with Senator Goldwater. He took me under his wing when I first arrived in the Senate, and he was a good counsel. 
The first year I was the chairman of the Budget Committee was 1981.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't know where the bill before the Senate goes next, but obviously I have joined with Senator Gramm in trying to make a statement about this bill. In the process of trying to do that, there are many ways to make statements and there are many ways to talk about what is in a bill, what is out of it, what is not in the bill, to argue about what its value is, what its ultimate goal is, and what it might achieve. 
There is another way, and that is to offer an amendment or amendments. There are a lot of amendments pending. As I indicated, I don't know how many of them are serious. I have five or six myself that I think are serious that in due course I will offer. I would like to discuss, from the standpoint of those who are wondering about the Gramm-Domenici amendment to cut taxes on a very deserving group of Americans, what it is all about. 
When you raise taxes on anybody in the United States, you have to ask yourself a very fundamental question of what you ought to do with the taxes you raise. Now, if America were undertaxed and we were taxing Americans--be it a cigarette tax that at $1.10 a pack would yield over time $750 to $800 billion, or whether it is an income tax or sales tax--you have to ask yourself, if America is being taxed too much already, shouldn't something very high on the list of considerations for what to do with the increased revenue be a consideration of lowering the taxes on Americans? 
Obviously, there have been some arguments already, and there will be more about the amendment which we offered which, hopefully, will be modified, that says let's give back some of the taxes we pick up here to Americans who are suffering the penalty of a Tax Code that punishes people for being married and earning a living by both spouses working. For they, in most cases, pay more in taxes than if they both had the identical jobs, at the same annual earnings, and were not married and filing separate returns--one of the most onerous, ill-conceived uses of the Tax Code. 
How in the world can we run around, as policymakers, and say we favor the family and then add a burden of taxation to spouses, who are part of a family, by taxing them more because they are married and working than if they were single and working? That has to be an absolutely absurd policy in light of the problems we have in this country that are family oriented, and many of them have to do with income of families. 
Secondly, it is obvious that every cent of a cigarette tax that we all of a sudden came up with and has been debated on the floor as a tax that should be $1.10, maybe $1.50, maybe 75 cents, and then for somebody to come to the floor and assume that whatever the level is, every penny of it ought to be spent for new programs--now, that isn't the way it is said; it is said, new programs to do some great things. 
Well, I think everything the Government tries to do and spends money on ought to be things we really believe are important things, important aspects, important events, important projects. Now we are reinventing a bunch of new ones, and then we are saying to the States: You spend your money in very specific ways. 
I don't care who agreed to the ways that we are going to 
send this money back to the States to be spent, it seems to me the question has to be asked first, How much is needed to direct a program that has a probability of success in terms of making our young people alter their smoking habits and quit smoking? And nobody can say that you need a huge portion of this tax bill to run advertisements on that, to have programs in our schools or wherever to try to inhibit that. That can't come close to spending the amount of money that is in this bill.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is my first speech in a couple of days. I am sorry. I will yield soon. In fact, I will yield the floor. 
Mr. President, the point is that nobody can stand up on this floor and say we knew when we started talking about cigarette taxes and how much it would yield precisely how much ought to be spent for some American programs that would help alleviate the smoking problem, or even research more into the cause of cancer and try to cure it. Nobody knows what is the right number, but everybody knows that as much money as this bill will raise is not needed for that. 
Anybody in their right mind would look at how much is coming in and how much you need to do precisely the kind of things that people say this bill ought to do, and it is not close to the amount of money that is coming in. So that leads you to a conclusion, in my humble opinion, that you ought to give some of this money back to the taxpayers of the country. 
I cannot believe we are so unconcerned about the taxpayers of this country that we would sort of block off this $700 billion in new revenues--if that is what it is over 25 years--and say, look, the American people and their tax-paying requirements have nothing to do with this new tax imposed on them. Why not? Why do we say that? We are adding to the tax `take,' and we give no benefit to the American people for these new taxes we are going to raise. 
Back to my argument. One way to try to send a message and distinguish between various approaches, which I choose to call tax and spend it all, or another group who would say tax and give some of it back to the American people who already feel, in many instances--and they are right--that they are paying too much in taxes. 
Now, that is why the Gramm-Domenici amendment is important. I have already stated its precise purpose is to try to ameliorate the negative tax treatment on married couples, both of whom work, from a Tax Code which penalizes that versus the same two people making the same amount of money, but not married, and are part of a family--they pay less. 
So the purpose is good, but the message is completely different. The message is, when you have this much new revenue, shouldn't you give some of it back to the taxpayers of America? Nobody is going to be able to come to this floor, with our ability to proliferate in producing charts, and tell the American people with any credibility that every single dollar coming in on this tax has a nice precise niche that it should be spent for, all of which is aimed at helping to try to get kids to stop smoking cigarettes. 
Or I am willing to add one--doing research and trying to prevent the diseases that come from smoking. Take the two together and you could not produce a credible chart showing how every penny in this bill must be spent for that or you are not doing your job. 
So I believe that, sooner or later, we deserve an opportunity to have an up-or-down vote on the proposition that I have just described here today. It is very simple. One, do you think you should change the Tax Code as it pertains to the marriage tax penalty and help families and married couples out who are being penalized because of this Tax Code? And, two, do you think that, with this large new tax being imposed, you ought to give about a third of it back to the taxpayers of this country? We want the public to just focus, very simply, on those two issues. 
This bill will permit us to do both. I have no doubt, Mr. President, that what is left over is more than adequate. In fact, I am not sure I would vote to spend all of the money that is left over for the program described in this bill. Nonetheless, that is not at issue with reference to the Gramm-Domenici amendment. 
The issue is a simple proposition: Do you think the marriage tax penalty ought to be fixed? Secondly, do you think when you have this huge new tax increase, you ought to give some of it back to the American people? We want to vote on that. That is a way of distinguishing between the feelings of various Senators about a new tax bill that is essentially, in its current form, tax and spend versus another approach that says tax--which may be helpful, we are not sure--and give some of it back to the American people. Under that is the very interesting proposition that there probably is no fairer thing to do with better, positive American policy than to fix the marriage tax penalty while you are at it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Bingaman from New Mexico, I am pleased to introduce today what we will call the Route 66 Preservation Act of 1998. Some here in the Senate may recall that I introduced the Route 66 Study Act of 1990, which directed the National Park Service to determine the best way to preserve, commemorate and interpret `America's Main Street'--Route 66. 
Public Law 102-400 directed the National Park Service to conduct a study on the impact of that route, that highway on America's culture. The study was completed in 1995, and addressed the feasibility of preserving what remains of the highway and the facilities associated with it through private and public efforts. 
Most nonprofit Route 66 organizations and other interested parties preferred preservation Alternative 5, asking for national recognition of Route 66 and partnerships between private and public groups for preservation. This bill is based on that alternative, and authorizes the National Park Service to join with Federal, State and private efforts to preserve aspects of historic Route 66, the Nation's most important thoroughfare for east-west migration in the 20th century. 
Designated in 1926, the 2,200-mile Route 66 stretched from Chicago to Santa Monica, CA. The thoroughfare became the first completely paved highway across the United States in 1938. It rolled through Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. In my home State of New Mexico, it went through the communities of Tucumcari, Santa Rosa, Albuquerque, Grants, and Gallup. 
The Legislation I am introducing today would have the National Park Service designate an `Office for Preservation of America's Main Street' with officials from the 8 affected States. The Preservation Office would be authorized to: 
Support State, local and private efforts to preserve Route 66 by providing technical assistance, participating in cost-sharing programs, and making grants and loans; 
Act as a clearing house for communication among Federal, State, local and private entities interested in the preservation of Route 66; 
Assist States in determining the appropriation form of a non-Federal entity or entities to perform functions of the Preservation Office once it is terminated 10 years after enactment of this legislation; and, 
Sponsor a road sign program on Route 66 to be implemented on a cost-sharing basis with State and local organizations. 
Route 66 is really a modern-day equivalent to the Santa Fe Trail. I believe this bill will provide States and local communities a more tangible means of gaining Federal assistance to preserve aspects of Route 66. 
At one time, Route 66 was the most famous highway in the United States. Now it is fading from the American landscape. If we want to preserve Route 66, it is now time to act. 
Up to 500,000 Americans--one quarter of all entrants to California during that era--migrated to California from the Dust Bowl on Route 66 from 1935 to 1940. John Steinbeck captured this journey and christened Route 66 the `Mother Road' in his classic novel of the Depression: `The Grapes of Wrath.' 
After World War II, another generation of Americans trekked across America on Route 66, not to escape despair, but to embrace economic opportunities in the West. Songwriter Bobby Troup expressed the enthusiasm and sense of adventure of this generation in his song, `Get Your Kicks on Route 66!' 
Route 66 also allowed generations of vacationers to travel to previously remote areas and experience the natural beauty and cultures of the Southwest and Far West. 
Route 66 began to decline with the enactment of the Interstate Highway Act in 1956. In 1984, the last federally designated portion of Route 66 was decommissioned when interstate 40 was completed in Arizona. 
Hopefully, the Senate will join me in once again allowing another generation to `get its kicks' on Route 66. 
The study has been completed, and now it is time to give the Park Service some direction--let them set up a small office for the preservation of Route 66. The bill authorizes partnerships between the private sector, State entities and the Federal Government through existing programs in an effort to preserve various aspects of this rather magnificent American roadway--Route 66. 
Many songs have been written about it. Many dreams are described by people who lived part of their lives there. Part of the Grapes of Wrath took place on Route 66. I think before all of what remains of America's Main Street disappears, it is a good time to pass this kind of bill and see if we can't preserve parts of it. Much is made of preserving historic things in the United States. It would be a shame, since there are so many people out there who care about this piece of American history and want to try to preserve the remnants of Route 66, if we did not do something now to help them in that effort.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just wanted to say where you thank me, for whatever you did, I want to add to that statement to the best of our ability we have not sacrificed the other appropriated accounts to the increases in the highway bill. We have found offsets and other things. They could suffer at some time in the future, but what we put before the Senate when we approved this with the offsets already in there, even with the new programs for veterans that are in here, $600 million, we will not take the extra money out of the NIH and other accounts of government. 
I told you I wanted to do that and you did not object on the floor, but this is the first time we could actually do it in the bill. We could think about it on the budget resolution, but we could do it on the bill.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me first say that I think everybody knows that I have the highest regard for the distinguished Senator from Alaska, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. There should be no doubt in this body of my very, very high respect and honor for the Senator. Let me repeat. Everybody knows I have the highest honor and respect for Senator Byrd, also. He has known that for a long time. I have to say that Senator Gramm started off to do something and he didn't mince any words. He said what he was going to do. Joining together with Senator Byrd, he has done that. 
Now, frankly, I believe I can say to my good friend, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, that this is not what I would have done with reference to trying to minimize the way this fund looks. Does it look more like a real appropriations bill, or does it look somewhat like a mandatory program? I guess I would have to say, for all the accolades of trying to keep it from being an entitlement, it probably is a bit more on the mandatory side than it is on the appropriations side. But at least it does get appropriated every year. There is a firewall, much like the trust fund established for crime by the same distinguished two Senators. If you look in that appropriation bill where we set aside some of the savings that would be forthcoming from a reduction in Federal employees, as I recall, you will find it every year listed as an entrusted amount. If you don't spend it in that bill--Senator Judd Gregg's bill now --you can't spend it for anything. So it is there every year. 
On the other hand, there is some concern that if you put a 5- or 6-year program on track and it is not subject to appropriations review, which I submit--be it the most in-depth 
or not--is the only annual review we have around here. Others are done willy-nilly and some don't get reviewed for 10 years, and some do often. The truth is that you can't get away without appropriations review every year, because you have to appropriate every year. This is going to have to be appropriated every year. So that part is still there. But essentially, in the quest to see that every penny of the 4.3 is spent, there is a recognition and a very strong position by the House that the resources, the taxes that are estimated could be up or down from the obligational authority we attribute to them, because if we assume we are using them all and then the tax comes in higher, we haven't used them all. If we assume they come in lower, then we are spending taxes that didn't come in. 
Essentially, what the Senator from Alaska, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, is concerned about is--and I think Senator Byrd and Senator Gramm, who was an appropriator for part of his life in the Senate, would be concerned--if, in fact, you were obligated to spend an amount that represented an increase, because the reality was that the tax was higher and by doing that you had to cut other appropriation committees, which would make that excess a mandatory demand on you--well, I told my friend that I didn't read the language when it was last drafted. I haven't seen it yet. In fact, for that eventuality, if it is higher than expected and you have to spend it, it holds the appropriators harmless. We don't need to talk about what that means. If you want to say what that does to the caps, you say that, I say to the Senator from Texas; but for the time being, I am saying it holds them harmless. I would not have spent the extra amount based on estimates. I think we are accurate and I would have used them like we have done in the past. 
Having said that, obviously, a lot of Senators are not going to be pleased with the allocations and other things. I didn't have anything to do with that. It is not my assignment. I felt somewhat uncomfortable. I don't have authorizing authority or appropriation authority. Nonetheless, it fell on me to try to make this a fair bill. 
When it comes to the appropriations process, I am going to put in the report right now the offsets that are in this bill. It is not bill language, but we insisted early on that we offset the increased expenditures from the appropriated accounts, so that by spending more money, we wouldn't be cutting the appropriated amounts which we have set in place by operation of law for a number of years. So we used the word `offsets,' and we found some. 
Maybe there will be a further debate on the offsets. I am prepared to debate them. I don't like to be responsible for all of the offsets. Some are found by us. I am more than willing to say I think they are fair. We have committed ourselves to increasing the expenditures for highways and mass transit and not to diminish the amount of money available for the remainder of domestic expenditures under the overall agreement that we made with reference to the budget. That is the best that we can do. 
That does not mean there will not be added pressure for the appropriators because of this. It does mean if you wanted more flexibility in the highway programs, you won't have that much. But I surmise that before we are finished there will be some flexibility, because there are needs. 
I also want everybody to know, when we have departed significantly from the obligational authority for highways and mass transit and increased it dramatically in the appropriations bill, for the most part it was when we had an emergency. All that money went to freeways that went to highways. It didn't come out of the regular trust fund, nor would it come out of these dollars that are in this bill. You would have an emergency just like you had in the past.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I am proud to be joined by Senators McCain, Hatch, DeWine, Chafee, Lugar, Hagel, Grassley, and Abraham in submitting a Senate Resolution entitled `English-Plus.' By this, we simply mean to reaffirm the importance of mastering the English language plus other languages of the world, such as Spanish, Italian, German, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and many, many more. 
As English becomes the world language of finance, trade, technology, diplomacy, and entertainment, the reality of international markets and international learning require a greater sensitivity to local languages. In our hemisphere, Spanish is clearly a dominant language. 
In my home state of New Mexico, 37 percent of the people are Spanish-Americans or Mexican-Americans. These days, the term `Hispanic Americans' is used to include Americans whose roots are in Spain, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central America, and South America. As U.S. News reported in the May 11, 1998, issue, `the label Hispanic obscures the enormous diversity among people who come (or whose forebears came) from two dozen countries and whose ancestry ranges from pure Spanish to mixtures of Spanish blood with Native American, African, German, and Italian, to name a few hybrids.' 
U.S. News also reported in the same issue that `The number of Hispanics is increasing almost four times as fast as the rest of the population, and they are expected to surpass African-Americans as the largest minority group by 2005.' In the October 21, 1996, issue, U.S. News reported that `Nearly 28 million people--1 American in 10--consider themselves of Hispanic origin.' This 1996 estimate was based on 1994 Census data. Current estimates are that there are 29 million Hispanics in America, or 1 in 9 Americans. By 2050 projections are that 1 in every 4 Americans will be Hispanic. 
As our world economy barges into the next century, it has become clear the `domestic-only market planning' has been replaced by the era of international trade agreements and the creation of regional trading blocs. In 1996, the total volume of trade with Mexico was estimated at $130 billion. Our trade with the rest of Latin America that same year was $101 billion. 
Spanish is clearly a growing cultural and economic force in our hemisphere. It is also the common language of hundreds of millions of people. New Mexico is the only state that requires the use of both English and Spanish on every election ballot. 
As the son of an Italian immigrant, I can personally testify to the importance of English Plus. My father did not read or write in English, yet he insisted that I learn English and do my best at some Italian. My parents both spoke Spanish--a skill which they found very useful in establishing a wholesale grocery business in Albuquerque. 
Tens of thousands of New Mexico families still speak Spanish at home. Spanish remains a strong tie to their culture, music, history, and folklore. After decades of being taught to learn English first, most New Mexico Hispanic families also know English very well. 
It is ironic that recent economic trends of this decade show Latin America as the most promising future market for American goods and services. An article in The Economist of April 21, 1998, stresses the value of the Spanish language to America's fastest growing minority group. 
`America's Latinos are rapidly becoming one of its most useful resources.' The Economist, however, also goes on to note that, `The Spanish language, which is their glory, also consigns too many of them to jobs not far removed from indentured slavery.' 
`Although they often meet discrimination, they have little taste for the politics of quotas or compensation. And although they have always supported `affirmative action' programmes, they now loathe bilingual education, the programme most specifically devised to give them a leg-up into American life.' 
`Even poor Latinos retain a sturdy distrust of government preferring to rely on their families. Relatively few Latinos are on welfare; most believe that a man ought to help himself first by his own efforts.' 
It is no longer accurate to say that we are perched to enter a global economy--rather, we are well into it. With Latin America as the next great market partner of the United States, those Americans who know both English and Spanish will have many new grand opportunities. Mexico's recent hiring and celebration of its one-millionth maquiladora worker in international manufacturing plants mostly along our border, the value of knowing two languages to function with the hundreds of Fortune 500 companies now manufacturing in Mexico is unquestioned. 
Mr. President, I have long believed that New Mexico and other border states are uniquely poised to create the focal point of North American trade with South America. I agree with The Economist observation that `America's Latinos are rapidly becoming one of its most useful resources.' I predict that English Plus Spanish will be one of the major marketable skills for the next century. 
In conclusion, I would like my colleagues to see the shallowness of thought behind the idea that `English Only' should be the wave of the future. If we want to miss our best potential markets in Mexico, Central America, and South America, then `English Only' should be our intent. If we want to become a more powerful cultural and economic American force in the world--including both North and South America into the meaning of `America'--then we should adopt `English Plus' as approach. 
As stated in our resolution, `English Plus' includes many if not all of the languages of the world. No one disputes the importance of English as the leading language of science, technology, the internet, finance, and diplomacy. By acknowledging our heightened abilities through the addition of other languages to our national strengths, the United States will benefit greatly by expanding its cultural life and economic potential through the application of the notion of `English Plus' other languages of the world.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act before us today. At the same time, I am uncomfortable about the implementing legislation for the Chemical Weapons Convention attached to it. 
Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction poses the gravest risk to domestic and international security in the post-Cold War era. Based on this assessment of U.S. security concerns, it makes sense for the Senate to pass legislation designed to prevent or, at a minimum, curb proliferation threats in every possible instance. 
The Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act will help to attain our non-proliferation objectives. A very important national security objective is to prevent Iran from obtaining and improving its weapons of mass destruction. A critical concern is Iranian acquisition of ballistic missiles, especially those with a range of 1,300 kilometers or more. Such capability would pose an unacceptable threat to U.S. forces in that area, not to mention our allies throughout the region. 
This Sanctions legislation is a careful and sound approach to non-proliferation. The legislation should offer the Administration additional leverage in curtailing Russian assistance to Iran's missile programs, and I applaud those objectives. 
Ideally, the implementing legislation for the Chemical Weapons Convention would have similar objectives--stemming the threat of proliferation. The goal of the Chemical Weapons Convention is to create a sufficient web of deterrence and detection capabilities so as to minimize the potential threat that chemical weapons pose to U.S. and global security. In order to attain this objective, the CWC relies on the most stringent verification regime ever before codified in an international arms control instrument. 
The verification measures set forth in the CWC were carefully crafted over many years to ensure that the attained transparency in no way impedes private industry's ability to protect proprietary information. 
In addition, measures for `challenge inspections'--a verification measure initially proposed by the Reagan Administration in negotiations over a decade ago--allow for inspection at any time and in any place. Otherwise, the CWC is rendered incapable of ferreting out undeclared activities. I remind you that this was a weakness of the nuclear nonproliferation regime that Iraq successfully exploited to hide a covert weapons program. 
The proposed CWC implementation legislation, attached to H.R. 2709 `Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997,' seriously weaken the Chemical Weapons Convention in such a manner as to pave the way for rogue nations to capitalize on U.S. short-sightedness. 
There are several aspects of the proposed legislation that are problematic. First, however, the following is clear: if the U.S. Senate ratified an international ban on poisonous gases, it makes no sense for the Administration to have negotiated legislation that renders the Convention impotent. Secondly, the U.S. Senate cannot ratify a treaty and then renege on its own commitment to provide effective and reasonable measures for implementation. 
Mr. President, this legislation includes three provisions that are of concern:

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, every year, New Mexico recognizes some of their own citizens who have contributed to their communities in extraordinary ways. Today, along with the citizens of New Mexico, I am grateful for this opportunity to recognize Dr. Pete Lyons for his civic service. As a Legislative Fellow in my office he serves as my science advisor and during his time with me, I have benefitted from his good advice and diligent work. 
Service to one's community can be expressed in many different forms. However, it is rare to find someone as dedicated to so many diverse activities as Pete Lyons. He is a 29-year employee of Los Alamos National Laboratory while serving for 16 years on the Los Alamos School Board. Whether it is his scientific work, his initiative to help rural communities, his dedication to education and young people, or his work to improve policy in the international area, Pete shows the same integrity, insight and old-fashioned hard work. 
Pete moved to New Mexico 29 years ago to work for the Laboratory as a technical staff member. He went on to serve in a number of management positions. In his career at the Lab he was the first Director of the Industrial Partnership Office where he expanded and created programs to encourage economic diversity in Northern New Mexico. He continued efforts to improve cooperation with the surrounding community through the Lab's office of Regional Economic Development and Technology Commercialization Office. Through a wide range of critical projects involving issues from telecommunications infrastructure, to telemedicine capability to improve rural health care, to technical assistance for water quality his work has been hallmarked by a dedication to the entire community both related and unrelated to the Laboratory. Since the Lab's beginning during World War II, it has been a stark contrast to the economy and cultures of the surrounding region. Through this work, Pete has helped to bridge that gap to begin a new era of cooperation and interaction for the Laboratory and the nearby communities. 
In addition, I believe his service that is the most commendable is his active involvement in education. Pete recognizes that our children's future, our nation's future, is dependent upon the quality of our education system. During his sixteen years on the Los Alamos School board, he was instrumental in helping to create University of New Mexico-Los Alamos Branch College. He represented the Laboratory during negotiations with the local school district to form a foundation to provide financial support from the Lab and the Department of Energy to provide financial support for school districts where lab employees lived. During his time in my office, he has worked to bring attention to our nation's need to improve science and technology education so that America will remain competitive well into the next century. 
Pete also knows that personal involvement can mean so much to young people. He has spent several years coaching soccer, sponsoring Boy Scouts, and serving as deacon in his church. 
In a sense, Pete continues his civic service as a congressional fellow in my office. Over the months, he has proven to me his immense value to New Mexico and the nation. Whether the issue be rural economic development or nuclear non-proliferation, Pete brings thoughtful knowledge and keen insight to the table. He is willing to tackle controversial issues with a open mind and commitment to truthful dialogue. 
I hope my colleagues will join me and my fellow New Mexicans to recognize this remarkable American.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have not but for a few minutes spoken about the issue before the Senate. 
I want to make it very clear that I understand the difficulty in managing a bill of this size. It is an enormous and contentious issue, and Senator McCain should be commended for taking on such a difficult task. I have nothing but admiration for those who are attempting to develop this legislation. 
But I can say to the Senate that I cannot imagine that the rules of this Senate are going to preclude Senators like Gramm and Domenici from offering amendments to this bill. We want to vote on whether we want to have a tax cut as part of this new tax increase. Sooner or later we will vote. I don't know what the two amendments offered by Senator Daschle are. Whatever they are, in due course we will vote on them. If by chance one of them wipes out ours, we will be back to offer other amendments. 
Let me talk about the history of imposing taxes on cigarette and related tobacco products. I am sure that I am not as good of a historian as my friend from Texas is, but is he aware the first reported effort to put a tax on tobacco was done by King James I in 1604. 
King James just didn't like the odor of tobacco. He wasn't a U.S. Senator and he wasn't part of a democracy. He simply issued a proclamation. `Smoking is a custom loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the brain, and dangerous to the lungs.' 
In 1604, King James said that. Now I used to be a smoker and I enjoyed it. I am just reporting on what King James said so I don't want the smokers listening to this debate to get mad at me. 
Then he proceeded to put a 4,000 percent increase on imported tobacco. 
He didn't pretend that he wanted to accomplish some worthy public purpose. He just wanted to raise revenue--and a lot of it. He was a dictator, king, benevolent, whatever they call them. But he didn't have to worry about what we have to worry about. And that is the impact on our citizens of this huge tax and the size of government. Frankly, there is not a word in history about this which said he was concerned about kids. He just said what I had described to you, and put the tax on and spent the money. 
Frankly, people were no better off in those days. Even with a 4,000-percent increase people continued to smoke. 
It is most interesting that without all of our science--I really think our science is great to find cures for cancer--King James I said that smoking was harmful to the brain and dangerous to the lungs. Having said that, he wasn't concerned about teenagers or about cancer because he didn't know about cancer. 
But as we proceed to work on this bill, I want to ask myself and ask those who are working on this bill: 
What do we really want to accomplish? 
First, we contend that too many young people are starting to smoke. And we want to stop that. Make no bones about it. When we offer our substitute bill, we have done the best we can with a reasonable amount of money to try to stop teenagers from smoking. 
Too many young people are using drugs, and we want to try to stop that. And we want more research on serious illnesses, including cancer, so that someday we will stop them in their tracks. 
Now, that is the kind of substitute amendment we are going to offer. But nowhere can anybody tell the Senate or the people of the United States that you need over the next 25 years $868 billion in new revenue from cigarette-related products. 
Where do I get that number? 
I don't think it has been said this way, but I want to make it simple. 
The current Federal excise tax on tobacco is 24 cents a pack. It is scheduled to go to 39 cents a pack under current law. This bill includes an increase equal to $1.10 cents. That is 1.49 in straight arithmetic. And then the $1.10 is indexed for inflation or 3 percent, whichever is greater. 
Frankly, we are not really sure how much this bill raises, but an acceptable number is $868 billion, I say to my friend from Texas. 
Now, I want to try to put that in perspective. The biggest program we have taking care of the most people committed to monthly checks is the Social Security Program. $868 billion would pay for Social Security for 2 full years. $868 billion would pay for the entire Defense Department of America for 3 years. 
This proposed tax increase in the McCain bill is bigger--when you put it into one basket, it is bigger than the gross domestic product of any of the following countries: Belgium, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Switzerland, et cetera. 
Now, where did anybody come up with the idea that we needed every single penny of that to be spent on programs related to reimbursement to the States, to research, or to whatever? Where did the miraculous relationship of $868 billion, the total receipts, to the need for programs come from? There is no reason to it. There is no magic. I can assure you of that, if you only had a $300 billion tax increase, everyone would get by with $300 billion for this anti-smoking program. 
But now we have gotten so grandiose about it that it is going to raise, over 25 years, over $868 billion under this bill. 
Now, frankly, I believe it is only reasonable that part of this tax increase be given back to the American people, and I am going to have a lot more to say about that. 
But a tax is a tax. This tax has a good motive: to stop kids from smoking. It may work--raise the price of cigarettes, and certain parts of the population may not buy them as much or may stop buying them. There is not conclusive evidence as to what price point you have to raise the price to, to have the most effect. But I can tell you, in our substitute we are going to propose 75 cents, period--no increases, just 75 cents. We believe that will keep the black market from going rampant and has as good a chance as any other number, by way of a tax, of deterring young people from starting smoking or encouraging them to quit smoking from the economic standpoint. 
Having said that, I want to tell you that there is nothing more onerous in the United States than the marriage penalty. Every once in a while, you will hear about a couple--it is not very frequent, but it gives you the dimension of this penalty--who will go to Mexico and get divorced the day before Christmas, and then they will go to Las Vegas and get married after New Year's. And guess what. They don't have to pay the marriage tax penalty. I am not sure if 500 do that, but we know some used to. I am not sure if it is 5,000. But imagine that you have a law on the books of America that invites that kind of conduct. 
In the extreme, the marriage penalty is punitive. And it is just wonderful to hear Senators and political leaders say, `We are for the family.' I assume that when you say, `We are for the family,' without regard to one's philosophy, I guess you would have to say marriage is pretty important, too, because I think in some way it is related to the families. It used to be 100 percent related, but it is still very important. 
Now, why would you impose a tax that would say to those two people who are married, `You pay more if you are both working than if you are both working and living together and not married'? Frankly, I will tell you that I have heard, personally, in my own ear somebody say, `We are not getting married because, after all, we love each other, but we would have to pay $2,800 more in taxes, and it is just crazy, so we are not going to get married.' 
Now, I don't like to say that, but that is the case. And there are worse examples because they are much broader in terms of impact. The average marriage penalty in this country is $1,400. In some cases, it is much higher; in other cases, it is somewhat lower. 
In fact, if you look at comparable countries, Mr. President, 27 of the OECD countries--they are tied together in terms of economic evaluations and assumptions and the like--19 countries tax husbands and wives separately, so there is no marriage penalty. What keeps the United States from doing that? Frankly, what has kept us in the past is that we had too big a deficit, and if we cut taxes, then we figured we were losing money and we would take it easy and careful and not fix everything in the Tax Code. 
We have balanced the budget. Senator Gramm and I do not intend to change a bit that approach to more and more surpluses. But when you impose a brand new tax--and it is inconceivable that you would need every penny of that tax for a program that deals with tobacco--frankly, there are organizations running around that have never seen so much money. I have stopped some in the hall with buttons saying, `Cigarette Tax Now,' and have asked them, `Which one?' Well, they said, `We like Senator McCain's improved.' I said, `Oh, but what's the goal?' `Well, the goal is the highest tax we can get and the biggest program we can get to spend money on teenagers and all kinds of health programs.' 
Growing a big government is not why we are raising the cigarette tax. I thought our big goal was to try to stop our young people from smoking. Increasing the price of cigarettes plus a pro-active advertising campaign against smoking and drugs could be effective. We also need an attitude change at the cigarette companies. We also need a little more research. We need new penalties against those who sell to teenagers when they should not, and even to teenagers who smoke three or four times and they should not and know they are wrong. That is provided for in the Gramm Domenici substitute. We would like to increase the budget DEA, FBI, Customs, and DOD drug interdiction programs. 
But beyond that, what do we need all this money for? It is absolutely logical--I have been here a long time. I have worked on appropriations. Every year the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee comes to the floor. I will say, `You can't imagine, fellow Senators, how many requests I had for money from my bill that I could not comply with.' In fact, I have seen some where you take out a batch of letters and say, `This is what I was asked to do that I can't do.' But there is no relationship between the country prospering and being a great country and that pack of letters. 
But now, look, here we have concluded--some have--that we would be remiss if we didn't dream up an expenditure for every penny of these tax dollars. Right? Now, why is that rational? Why should those of us say, how about one-third of it going back to the taxpayers and going back to fix the most onerous, discriminatory tax against an institution that we cherish and respect, one-third of the money. 
I have not heard anybody say--and I hope, when we finally vote on the marriage penalty, and that is not going to be the only tax cut amendment offered, because if this one does not pass, there will be an amendment to cut 1 percent from the lower brackets. There will be a tax cut amendment to expand child care credits. There will be a number of tax cut amendments that should be considered. 
But how can anybody stand up in the Senate and say, if you take a third of this huge tax increase the tobacco program for kids is not going to work? 
I defy anybody to come up here and say, out of this pot of money and all these programs, if you don't keep them all, if you take one-third of the money and say, look, let's give it back to the taxpayers so we begin to get rid of this marriage penalty, at least for those families with $50,000 of income and under, I cannot imagine somebody will stand up and say: 
`But we won't be doing what we must do for our kids.' I mean, if it is $868 billion, and you have $650 billion instead of $868 billion, can you not put an effective anti-smoking and anti-drug program together?

Mr. DOMENICI. So, from my standpoint, as I told some of my friends to whom I said I was not in a hurry to pass this legislation, I said, why don't we continue to work on this bill until we get back. I said that because it is very contentious and Senators ought to have a chance to vent their positions and let the American people try to understand. 
I have not been able to come to the floor because I been trying to help finish the ISTEA bill. I have noticed that the Senate floor time has been filled with Senators talking about this bill. There have been no long quorum calls. I do not think there has been anything dilatory. 
But, frankly, I have a number of amendments that I believe should be offered. This is our best opportunity to consider tax cuts. I intend to talk about this bill. 
I have dedicated 20 years of my career in the Senate getting our Government's size under control. I have had Senators congratulate me, saying we are finally getting Government down a reasonable in size; it is not going to be so big. And then all of a sudden I see this bill that will supersize Government--and I will gather more information for you so I can do more comparisons--but this bill will add probably as much in new programs to this Government as we have been able to cut from this Government in our deficit reduction programs of the last 4 or 5 years combined. 
Government is government. Taxes are taxes. And, in our system, there is a relationship between the two. The higher the taxes, the bigger the government. And the higher the taxes, the less free are people. 
I will commit that we ought to tax cigarettes to discourage kids from buying and smoking cigarettes. Senator Gramm and I will propose taxing cigarettes at 75 cents a pack in our substitute. But I do not believe there is any magic formula as to how much you have to spend to try to dissuade kids from smoking. 
If $600 billion is not enough, and we need $886 billion over 25 years, then you cannot give anything back to the taxpayers. 
But what if $500 billion is enough? 
Or $400 billion is enough? 
Then I believe that some of the money should be given back to the people? That is essentially the issue. 
It is as big an issue as any issue before us, because we do not need all the money called for in the McCain bill I have just told you about--a dollar and a dime plus 49 cents plus 3 percent added on every year. We do not need all that money for a cigarette program so we ought to not use it all. 
Senator Gramm and I are going to offer the Senate an opportunity to give some of the money back to people in the form of a tax cut. 
I will be glad to yield for a question.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I regret that I have to take a few moments and keep the distinguished Senator here, but I don't know whether I will get a chance to talk about the India nuclear blast if I don't do it today. I will be as brief as I can. 
Yesterday, two committees of the Senate held hearings on India's recent underground nuclear tests. It is my understanding that those committees, particularly the Select Committee on Intelligence, which heard testimony from CIA Director Tenet, are most interested in why the United States had no advance warning of India's plan. I think the Senate needs to be very careful as it reviews the India situation not to kill the messenger. 
The simple fact is that covert nuclear operations are extremely difficult and sometimes impossible to detect. Even before its tests, we knew a great deal about India's nuclear weapons program. We were cognizant of the readiness of their weapons, that because their test site had been prepared for tests in 1995, they could test on very short notice, and that the newly elected party had campaigned on a platform that included the development of nuclear weapons--all signs that should have made this week's tests less surprising. Yet, we were caught off guard. But I do not think that it is entirely the responsibility of our intelligence agencies. 
Since the fall of the Soviet Union, U.S. policymakers have been subject to two sets of pressures, both of which have led us to consider reducing our nuclear stockpile to the lowest possible levels and have reduced our vigilance. 
One of those pressures comes from an anti-nuclear movement which feels a moral imperative to abolish nuclear weapons. Everyone knows that we would like to abolish nuclear weapons, but what is going on in the world indicates that that will not occur just because the United States decides to do so. 
The second pressure comes from our military, and it is felt largely in the authorization and appropriations process in the Congress. 
Today, the emphasis in the Pentagon is on readiness, warfighting capability and nuclear weapons, and the strategic command which is responsible for their use has taken a second-class status to those branches of the service interested in tanks, planes, ships and troop readiness. As a result, we are seeing a diminution of the strategic command within the Pentagon and across policymakers in the Congress, as well as the administration, and a failure to recognize how attractive and important nuclear weapons are. 
It takes the actions of an India to remind us that for a nation that perceives itself as threatened, wants to threaten, demonstrate its technical prowess or simply wants to join the elite nuclear club, nuclear weapons are extremely attractive. That is a deplorable situation, but it is a fact. 
Unfortunately, in taking the actions it has of the last 2 days, India has destabilized an already precariously balanced region of the world. Although Pakistan and China were previously aware of India's nuclear capability, India's demonstrated willingness to further develop and demonstrate those capabilities is, by its nature, threatening to Pakistan and China. In turn, China and Pakistan, but Pakistan in particular, may also take steps to demonstrate their nuclear willingness. 
The United States is correct to impose sanctions on India and to prepare to do so on Pakistan if they test. I hope that Pakistan will recognize by evaluating the situation in Russia that superpower status built on economic prowess is significantly more desirable than superpower status achieved through nuclear weapons at the expense of economic prowess. 
Regardless of the achievements of the high-level U.S. delegation dispatched to Pakistan yesterday, it is obvious that there could be under consideration by both Pakistan and China the effect of nuclear weapons in the hands of India, which might force both countries to proceed with nuclear weapons. 
We learned about India's tests first through a press announcement and then through our seismic monitors. India could just as well have tested their devices thousands of miles offshore on ships or drone planes. We would certainly have registered the tests, but we might never have known who tested. That was the situation in 1978 when a device exploded in the Indian Ocean and it took us many years to determine whose it was. 
Incidentally, although today our satellites can detect atmospheric nuclear explosions, there has been some consideration of not replacing that capability when our current systems reach the end of their true lifetimes. This is just one symptom of our lax policy and declining attention to the threat of nuclear weapons. 
Until they are disproved, and by that I mean something more than reassurances from the Indian Government which has already demonstrated a willingness to be misleading about these issues, we need to consider the possibility that India cooperated with other countries in conducting these tests. 
We currently assume that all the devices that were detonated were Indian, that all the technicians on the site were Indian, and that the data has not been shared with other nations, but we cannot base our final analysis on assumptions. 
India's tests cast a long shadow over the ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. To date, Chairman Helms, chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations which has jurisdiction over all treaties, has indicated he is not in a hurry to report the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I know some in arms control may have been frustrated by his position. Today, I think they are fortunate that the treaty will not be considered in the near future. 
In light of the event which occurred in India, we need some time and, obviously, we need to think through the application of resources to the information necessary to make sure the test ban treaty can be carried out. India's willingness to test reminds us that global nuclear capabilities will not remain static if the United States agrees to lock in its nuclear capabilities pursuant to a test ban. 
In the coming decades, other countries, whether they are signatories to the treaty or not, may develop nuclear capabilities and, given time, may even develop significant threatening nuclear capabilities, which is not the case at this point. 
The United States nuclear posture is not established in response to the threat posed by a single country, but also considers threats that may be posed by strategic alliances. We need to recognize that the nuclear buildup we now expect to occur on the Pakistan-India border and that may spread to China could one day not be directed against one another, but there could be alliances which put America's future in jeopardy. 
More so, we need to recognize that the nuclear arsenal of the United States, one that we maintain today and will maintain into the indefinite future, has to be able to respond to all potential scenarios that might unfold in an uncertain and changing world. 
That means at a minimum, our weapons must be safe and reliable, not just theoretically so. We must have confidence in them as our tools of foreign policy and military policy. That requires our potential adversaries, whether they are our current adversaries or our current allies, be aware of our formidable scientific skills and our willingness to direct them toward the maintenance of our stockpile. 
While there is some uncertainty, and my skepticism can be expected to continue to demand improvements, I am reasonably confident that the United States has the scientific ability to maintain our stockpile if we make that a priority. That requires that we make it a priority today, even though current focus is more on conventional warfighting capabilities, and we make it a priority into the future. 
Everyone should understand that the United States has made a commitment that we will not test nuclear weapons. So we are not going to have any underground tests or any other kinds of tests. That means our scientists have to be capable of telling us that our stockpile is secure, safe and trustworthy. 
That requires that we pay attention to what is needed to do that. The reason for the explosions in India is to make sure they can say, `We now know how to build a bona fide weapon, and that it will work.' If they did not do the testing, they would be acting theoretically, they would be basing it on science, on modeling, on previous data about other weapons and weapons they might try to duplicate. But the only way to be sure and to have it right is to do tests. 
We have done those. We are not doing them anymore. But everybody in this body and in the House and in the White House have to be concerned that if we have them, they have to be trustworthy. And to do that, we may have to spend a little bit of money on science and technology to make sure that without testing that they are valid. 
We are not building any new nuclear weapons. We have committed to that. We have not for some time; and for the foreseeable future we will not. 
Our nuclear posture cannot be based exclusively on our dedication to maintaining our own stockpile so it can respond to any potential threat; we must also work to understand and then reduce that threat. India's ability to conduct five tests without our previous knowledge, even though we should have been on alert for them, demonstrates how easy it is for a nation to develop such a capability. 
So while I began my remarks by saying that the focus of our frustration should not be on our intelligence agencies alone, that they were unable to provide us advanced warning of India's plans, I also believe that in the future we must improve by an order of magnitude our ability to understand the nuclear threats we face. 
We are considering entering into discussions on a new round of arms control agreements that would, for the first time, limit the number of nuclear warheads in the United States and Russia. We need to approach the notion of counting warheads and of entering into limits with a single country with great skepticism. Our inability to monitor India's nuclear activities should make it clear that we are far from having the ability to monitor a warhead limitation treaty now and for some time to come.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will not use that amount of time. 
I just want to say how pleased I am that today we are going to close the loop and make sure that the small group of entrepreneurial plaintiff lawyers who were taking advantage of our securities laws are now going to follow a uniform law in the States and in the Federal courts. 
It was in 1990 that Senator Sanford of North Carolina, who passed away just recently, and I introduced the first legislation on this issue. We did so because we found that a small group of plaintiff's lawyers were engaged in the business of finding meritless lawsuits to file, but since they were class action lawsuits, they would have to get settled. We found a trend across the country where they settled all these cases rather than have jury trials. A small cadre of lawyers became rich, and, as far as we can find out, very few stockholders benefited. 
We passed the first bill to tighten up the rules in the Federal court system in 1995. It is the only bill where we overrode President Clinton's veto. And tonight I think we will pass, by an even more overwhelming number, the culmination of this effort. The bill will keep plaintiffs' lawyers from picking State courts to do what we have precluded them from doing in the Federal courts. This bill will stop them from doing what we know they already are doing--they look for a sympathetic state forum where they can get these lawsuits filed. 
This is legislation that helps the high-tech companies that get started in America. We have testimony that the Intel company--that great American company--had they faced one of these kinds of suits when they were in their infancy, they are almost certain that they would not exist today. We do not know how many other companies now do not exist because they faced these kinds of lawsuits. 
But essentially we are doing an exciting thing for growth, prosperity, and we are harming and hurting no one with legitimate complaints against corporations for fraud, misrepresentation, and malfeasance. 
As I said, I rise today in strong support of S. 1260, the `Securities Litigation Reform Uniform Standards Act of 1998' and I want to commend the Majority Leader for bringing this bill to the floor this week. Few issues are more important to the high-tech community and the efficient operation of our capital markets than securities fraud lawsuit reform. 
I am pleased to serve as an original co-sponsor of this legislation with Senators D'Amato, Dodd, and Gramm--a bill to provide one set of rules to govern securities fraud class actions. 
As I said previously, this bill completes the work I began more than 6 years ago with Senator Sanford of North Carolina. Back in the early 1990's, Senator Sanford and I noticed that a small group of entrepreneurial plaintiffs' lawyers were taking advantage of our securities laws and the federal rules related to class action lawsuits to file frivolous and abusive claims against high-technology companies in Federal courts. 
Often these lawsuits were based simply on the fact that a company's stock price had fallen, without any real evidence of fraud. Senator Sanford and I realized a long time ago that stock price volatility--common in high tech stocks--simply is not stock fraud. 
But, because it was so expensive and time consuming to fight these lawsuits, many companies settled even when they knew they had done nothing wrong. The money used to pay for these frivolous lawsuits could have been used for research and development or to create new, high-paying jobs. 
So, we introduced a bill to make some changes to the securities fraud class action system. Of course, since we were up against the plaintiffs' lawyers, the bill didn't go anywhere for awhile. 
After Senator Sanford left the Senate, the senior Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, and I continued to work hard on this issue. In 1995, with tremendous help from Chairman D'Amato and Senator Gramm, we passed a law. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 passed Congress in an overwhelmingly bipartisan way--over President Clinton's veto of the bill. 
And since enactment of the Reform Act, we have seen great changes in the conduct of plaintiffs' class action lawyers in federal court. Because of more stringent pleading requirements, plaintiffs' lawyers no longer `race to the courthouse' to be the first to file securities class actions. Because of the new rules, we no longer have `professional plaintiffs'--investors who buy a few shares of stock and then serve as named plaintiffs in multiple securities class actions. Other rules make it difficult for plaintiffs' lawyers to file lawsuits to force companies into settlement rather than face the expensive and time consuming `fishing expedition' discovery process. 
Now, it looks like our new law has worked too well. Entrepreneurial trial lawyers have begun filing similar claims in State court instead of federal court to avoid the new law's safeguards against frivolous and abusive lawsuits. Instead of one set of rules, we now have 51--one for the Federal system and 50 different ones in the States. 
According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, this migration of claims from Federal court to State court `may be the most significant development in securities litigation' since the passage of the new law in 1995. 
In fact, prior to passage of the new law in 1995, State courts rarely served as the forum for securities fraud lawsuits. Now, more than 25 percent of all securities class actions are brought in State court. A recent Price Waterhouse study found that the average number of State court class actions filed in 1996--the first year after the new law--grew 335 percent over the 1991-1995 average. In 1997, State court filings were 150 percent greater than the 1991-1995 average. 
So, there has been an unprecedented increase in State securities fraud class actions. In fact, trial lawyers have testified to Congress that they have an obligation to file securities fraud lawsuits in State court if it provides a more attractive forum for their clients. Imagine that--plaintiffs' lawyers admit that they 
are attempting to avoid federal law. 
These State court lawsuits also have prevented high-tech companies from taking advantage of one of the most significant reforms in the 1995 law--the safe harbor for predictive statements. Under the 1995 law, companies which make forward-looking statements are exempt from lawsuits based on those statements if they meet certain requirements. Companies are reluctant to use the safe harbor and make predictive statements because they fear that such statements could be used against them in State court. This fear chills the free flow of important information to investors--certainly not a result we intended when we passed the new law. 
So today, the Senate will vote to create one set of rules for securities fraud cases. One uniform set of rules is critical for our high-technology community and our capital markets. 
Without this legislation, the productivity of the fastest growing segment of our economy--high tech--will continue to be hamstrung by abusive, lawyer-driven lawsuits. Rather than spend their resources on R&D or creating new jobs, high-tech companies will continue to be forced to spend massive sums fending off frivolous lawsuits. 
When I first worked on this issue, executives at Intel Corporation told me that if they had been hit with a frivolous securities lawsuit early in the company's history, they likely never would have invented the microchip. We should not let that happen to the next generation of Intels. 
This bill also is important to our markets. Our capital markets are the envy of the world, and by definition are national in scope. Information provided by companies to the markets is directed to investors across the United States and throughout the world. 
Under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Congress has the authority to regulate in areas affecting `interstate commerce.' I cannot imagine a more classic example of what constitutes `interstate commerce' than the purchase and sale of securities over a national exchange. 
Not only does Congress have the authority to regulate in this area, it clearly is necessary and appropriate. Right now, in an environment where there are 50 different sets of rules, companies must take into account the most onerous State liability rules and tailor their conduct accordingly. If the liability rules in one State make it easier for entrepreneurial lawyers to bring frivolous lawsuits, that affects companies and the information available to investors in all other States. One uniform set of rules will eliminate that problem. 
Mr. President, I again want to commend my colleagues for their work on this important bill. I understand that this is a bi-partisan bill which has the support of the SEC and at least 40 Senators. I think by the end of the day, many, many more Senators will join us in supporting this bill. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, advanced technologies drive a significant part of our nation's economic strength. Our economy and our wonderful standard of living depend on a constant influx of new technologies, processes, and products from our industries. 
Many countries can provide labor at lower costs than the United States. As any new product matures, competitors using overseas labor can frequently find a way to undercut our production prices. We maintain our lead by constantly improving our products through encouragement of innovation. 
The majority of new products require industrial research and development to reach the market stage. I want to encourage that research and development to create new products to ensure that our factories stay busy and that our workforce stays fully employed at high salaried jobs. I want more of our large multi-national companies to select the United States as the location for their R&D. R&D done here creates American jobs. And frequently the benefits of R&D in one area apply in another area; I want those spin-off benefits in this country, too. 
The federal government has used the Research Tax Credit to encourage companies to perform research. But many studies document that the present form of this Tax Credit is not providing as much stimulation to industrial R&D as it could. Today, I introduce legislation to improve the Research Tax Credit. 
The single most important change I'm proposing in the Research Tax Credit is to make it permanent. The credit has never been permanent, since Congress created it in 1981. Many studies point out that the temporary nature of the Credit has prevented companies from building careful research strategies. A recent study by Coopers and Lybrand claimed a $41 billion stimulus for the economy by 2010, with $13 billion added to the economy's productive capacity by 2010. Many of my Senate colleagues have endorsed legislation that includes this critical action, more than twenty at last count. 
My legislative proposal goes further. The current Credit references a company's research intensity back to their level in the 1984-88 time period. That time period is too outdated to meet today's dynamic market conditions. Many companies now are operating in dramatically different markets, many with totally new product lines. My legislation allows a company to choose a four year period in the last ten years that best matches their own needs. This allows companies to tailor and optimize research strategies to match current market conditions. 
The current approach has a provision that severely restricts the ability of many start-up companies to benefit from the full impact of the Credit. Recent analysis shows that 5 out of 6 start-up companies receive reduced benefits because of a provision that limits their allowable increase in research expenditures to half of their current expenditures. I'm concerned when start-up companies aren't receiving full benefit from this Credit. These are just the companies that tend to drive the innovative cycle in this country, they are the ones that frequently bring out the newest leading-edge products. My legislation allows start up companies for their first ten years to take full credit for their increases in research costs. 
My legislation addresses several other shortcomings in the current Credit. Now there is a Basic Research Credit' allowed, but rarely used. It is defined to include only research with `no commercial interest.' Now, I don't know too many companies that want to support--much less admit to their stockholders that they are supporting--research with no commercial interest. The idea of this clause was to encourage support of long term research; the kind that benefits far more than just the next product improvement. This is the kind of research that can enable a whole new product or service. We need to encourage this long term research. My legislation adds an incentive for this type of research by including any research that is done for a consortium of U.S. companies or any research that is destined for open literature publication. These two additions will include a lot more long term research that has future product applications. I've also allowed this credit to apply to research done in national labs, so companies can select the best source of research for any particular project. 
And finally my legislation recognizes the importance of encouraging companies to use research capabilities wherever they exist in the country, whether in other businesses, universities, or national labs. The current credit disallows 35% of all expenses invested in research performed under an external contract--my legislation allows all such expenses to apply towards the Credit. This should encourage creation of partnerships, where different partners can leverage their individual strengths. These partnerships enable our companies to perform research more efficiently, that can further strengthen our economy. 
In summary, Mr. President, this proposed Bill significantly strengthens incentives for private companies to undertake search that leads to new processes, new services, and new products. The result is stronger companies that are better positioned for global competition. Those stronger companies will hire more people at higher salaries with real benefits to our national economy and workforce.

Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Senator Gramm. 
I did not really think my few words would be this controversial, but I want to share with the Senate a concern. It is not just about this bill. But it seems to me that every day or so we are talking about an approach here in the U.S. Senate which essentially wipes out last year's budget agreement. The cornerstone to last year's budget agreement was the caps we placed on discretionary spending, both defense and domestic. That means, written in the law are numbers that we said we will not violate; that we will not exceed this level of spending. 
Everybody who is getting anything from Government would like to turn those discretionary programs into mandatory programs, so they are not subject to the caps. Everybody would like to have a guarantee that their program is going to get funded. That is what we call an entitlement or a mandatory program. We are talking about that in this bill. We are talking about that in the tobacco bill in a very big way. 
What is happening now is that we are absolutely breaking the agreement we made, which was so solemn, about getting our budget under control. Every time the budget bites and it squeals a little because a decision is tough, we find a way to avoid it and spend the money in another way. It is money nonetheless, and it is adding to the size of Government nonetheless. 
Frankly, I do not agree with Senator Gramm's position on this bill in terms of the food stamps provisions. But I, frankly, do not believe we ought to shut our eyes to a tendency that could become a very big stream. We are forgetting about appropriated accounts and caps, understandings and agreements, and finding brand new ways to fund programs that will be on automatic pilot. 
I submit to you, from the taxpayers' standpoint, there is absolutely no difference. If you are using a dollar of taxpayers' money to break the caps that we agreed upon or if you are spending a dollar for a new entitlement program, it is the same effect. 
I hate to make this statement on this bill because I am not necessarily saying the bill should go down to defeat. But I want to warn the Senate--and I am going to warn the Senate on every bill that circumvents the caps--that this is not the way we got to balance. This is not what we promised the American people and the marketplace in terms of where we were going as a Congress, and I plan to call that to everyone's attention on a regular basis. 
I yield the floor and thank the Senator for time.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have two amendments that I understand are going to be acceptable, but they are being drafted in a manner to comply with the wishes of the committee. I will refer to the two. Then I understand that, in due course, the chairman and ranking member will be introducing amendments and mine 
will go in as one of their en bloc amendments, but I will have spoken to two of them for just a minute, and then for a couple of minutes on the overall bill. 
The first one of my amendments is cosponsored by Senator D'Amato and Senator McCain and anybody else who would like to join. I welcome them cosponsoring it. The IRS already provides forms and instructions in the Spanish language. I commend them for that. Obviously, we are now being told that, while the Hispanic population in America is very large, it will soon be the largest minority by far. And by middle of the next century, one out of every four Americans will be of Hispanic origin--which will be the largest by far. 
This first amendment, that is currently sponsored by Senators D'Amato and McCain, would have the telephone help line mandated to provide communications in Spanish to those who can more easily communicate in Spanish. 
I indicated that we already have forms in Spanish. I am for English-plus, in America, which is English--clearly, we should all learn, but I think that instead of talking about English only, we should talk about plusing it up with other languages. That would mean that English and Spanish would be very much appreciated and used in many parts of the country as we educate our young people. 
That is one of the amendments. I understand neither the floor manager nor the minority opposes this amendment. Again, I ask if anyone would like to join in cosponsoring that amendment. It is going to be offered by the floor manager as one of the en bloc amendments in the not-too-distant future here on the floor. 
Second, I don't know how many Senators have participated in making enough of their own telephone calls these days to find that large institutions have an automated system when you call. 
Let's say you want to call, I say to the occupant of the Chair, Sears and Roebuck. Understand, it used to be 25 years ago you would call up and say, `I'd like the sporting department.' They would say, `Just a moment, sir.' And the next person answering would be somebody in the sporting department. 
If you made that phone call today, the answering voice would likely be a recording. `If you want somebody in the merchandising, punch 1. If you want somebody in'--this area-- `punch 2.' And when they get on, they say, `If you are looking for this department'--or that department--`punch 4.' 
The IRS has a similar system. If you want information on withholding press 1; If you want information about filing separately press two; If you want information about the new child credit press three. Too often, unfortunately, there isn't a number to press for the question you want answered. My amendment would correct that problem. 
I am told as of yesterday in the State of New Mexico, my home State, if you are trying to get a voice to respond to you, believe it or not, in the State of New Mexico, if you want a voice to answer you at the IRS, it now takes 45 minutes for that event to occur. That means you are going through telephones one after the other: Punch this one, then you wait and you tell them what you want; punch another one. 
All this amendment says is, if you are going to have these automated lines with press 1, press 2, press 3, you have to have one early on in the numbering system that says, `Press if you want to speak to a person who can either answer your question or direct you to a person who can.' 
I think the American people calling the IRS would be thrilled to death if sooner, rather than later, it did not take you 45 minutes of going through the press 1, press 3, press 28, and you could press something that would give you a live IRS person to talk to you. That is the second amendment. 
It is obvious to me that this bill is telling the IRS how to manage things, but it is pretty obvious that those of us who have constituents and go home and ask our office staff what the constituents are saying, they are saying the kind of things that I am telling Senators right now really bug them. 
They lose hope when they are 35 minutes on the line and haven't gotten a person yet, so they hang up. I don't think we want that. That isn't good government. 
I am hopeful that the new management and the person in charge, who is a manager and businessman, will not see this as trying to micromanage, but sees it is obviously as something they ought to be doing. I don't want to take a chance and not put it in this bill and, in 4 years, when we have oversight, find we are still where we are. 
These two amendments, in addition to those other provisions crafted by the committee make up a good bill. The Committee incorporated a number of the recommendations that came from our State as I went through my offices asking what kind of things were not working in dealing with the IRS. 
Having said that, I would like to speak for a few moments on the bill. 
There are more than 168 ways that this bill makes the IRS more service oriented, and taxpayer friendly. It cracks down on abuses highlighted in the hearings. It corrects some problems called to my attention by constituents. Chairman Roth and the Finance Committee should be commended for the fine job they did on this bill. 
Often when we pass legislation, I ask the question: Who cares? 
I can assure you that this is one piece of legislation that everyone cares about. No agency touches more Americans than the IRS. Yet one out of two Americans said they would rather be mugged than be audited by the IRS. This bill should reverse that prevailing view. 
Among the key provisions the bill strives for better management; better use of technology; reinstatment of a checks and balances system so that the IRS will no longer be the judge, jury and excutioner; discipline for rogue IRS agents; taxpayer protections including the right to a speedier resolution of a dispute with the IRS; fundamental due process and a long overdue reorganization. Hopefully, these reforms will change the environment and change the culture at the IRS. 
The bill prohibits the IRS from contacting taxpayers directly if they are represented by a lawyer or an accountant. The IRS called this practice of bypassing the tax professional and visiting the taxpayer at work or at dinner `aggressive collection' techniques, my constituents called it harrassment. 
The bill attempts to make the IRS employees more accountable for their actions by putting their jobs on the line when they deal abusively with taxpayers. 
The bill requires the IRS to terminate an employee if any of the following conduct relating to the employees official duties is proven in a final administrative or judicial determination: 
Failure to obtain the required appproval signatures on documents authorizing the seizure of a taxpayer's home, personal belongings, or business assets. 
Falsifying or destroying documents to conceal mistakes made by the employee with respect to a matter involving a taxpayer. 
Assault or battery on a taxpayer or other IRS employee. 
Under the bill, the IRS will no longer be allowed to send out tax bills with huge penalties compounded with interest and cascading penalties just because the IRS was years behind in its work. 
If the IRS does not provide a notice of additional taxes due (a deficiency) within 1 year after a return is timely filed, then interest and penalities will not start to be assessed and compounded until 21 days after demand for payment is made by the IRS. (This excludes penalties for failure to file, failure to pay, and fraud) It isn't fair for the IRS to wait years before contacting a taxpayer who honestly believes he has paid the correct amount, only to deliver to him years later a tax bill with interest and penalites that dwarfs the original underpayment. I had a constituent who was told he owed an additional dollar--one dollar--in taxes but owed more than $2,500 in penalties and interest! The IRS agent's response when asked about it was, `Well, I guess we gotch ya good.' 
Small businesses have been the target of some of the worst abuses. I will always remember the day a good friend, a restaurant owner in New Mexico called my office, justifiably hysterical. The IRS had just padlocked her restaurant! What was she to do? What could I do? 
This bill codifies the proposition that all men and women, even if they work for the IRS, shall follow fundamental due process requirements. Padlocks and raids should be a last resort under this bill. 
The bill requires the IRS to provide notice to taxpayers 30 days (90 days in the case of life insurance) before the IRS files a notice of Federal tax lien, levies, or seizes a taxpayer's property. 
The bill gives taxpayers 30 days to request a hearing. No collection activity would be allowed until after the hearing. 
The bill requires IRS to notify taxpayers before the IRS contacts or summons customers, vendors, and neighbors and other third parties. 
The bill requires the IRS to implement a review process under which liens, levies, and seizures would be approved by a supervisor, who would review the taxpayer's information, verify that a balance is due, and affirm that a lien, levy, or seizure is appropriate under the circumstances. 
The bill requires the IRS to provide an accounting and receipt to a taxpayer including the amount credited to the taxpayer's account when the IRS seizes and sells the taxpayer's property. It seemed ironic that an agency that requires a receipt if a taxpayer is claiming a $5 business lunch wouldn't provide a receipt to a taxpyaer when it seized and sold all of a taxpayer's earthly belongings. 
The bill legislates common sense. It prohibits the IRS from seizing a personal residence to satisfy unpaid liabilities less than $5,000, and provides that a principal residence or business property should be seized as a last resort. 
In addition, the bill expands the attorney client privilege to acountants and other tax practioners. 
Under this bill, the IRS could no longer insist that a taxpayer waive his rights. In particular, the IRS could no longer insist that a taxpayer waive the statute of limitations before the IRS would settle a case. The bill requires the IRS to provide taxpayers with a notice of 
their rights regarding the waiver of the statute of limitations on assessment. 
The bill makes it easier for a taxpayer to settle his or her liability with the IRS. 
If the IRS cannot locate the taxpayer's file, the bill prohibits the IRS from rejecting the taxpayer's offer-in-compromise based upon doubt as to the taxpayer's liability. I have known constitutents who are left in an IRS twilight zone because the IRS lost their file. I know of one constitutent who had his file lost five times. Fortunately, he kept a copy of the file himself, and worked next door to a Kinko's copying center. 
This bill allows for a prevailing taxpayer to be reimbursed for his or her costs and attorney's fees if the IRS is found not to be `substantially justified.' The substantially justified standard in consistent with the little-guy-can-fight-the-federal-government-and-win philosophy. I am glad this standard is being expanded, and incorporated into this bill. Originally, the notion that a citizen should be able to recoup attorney's fees and costs when the federal government was not substantially justified was a concept in the Equal Access to Justice Act which I authored in the early 1980s. It is historically interesting to note, and perhaps prophetic, that the IRS lobbyied very hard to be exempt from that law. In fact, the IRS was exempt when the bill was first enacted. When the Equal Access to Justice was reauthorized five years latter, Senator Grassley and I worked to include the IRS. It was a big fight but Congress prevailed and got the IRS under the Equal Access to Justice Act's umbrella. The federal government with its deep pockets shouldn't be allowed to simply `outlast' the average American taxpayer. That isn't what our justice system is about. 
The bill also clarifies that attorney fees may be recovered in a civil action in which the U.S. is a party for unauthorized browsing or disclosure of taxpayer information. I have heard a lot about this abuse both from constituents and from the witnesses in the Campaign Finance investigation. 
If a taxpayer makes an offer to settle his or her tax bill and the IRS rejects it and the IRS ultimately obtains a judgment against the taxpayer in the amount equal to, or less than the amount of the taxpayer's statutory offer, the IRS must pay the taxpayer's fees and costs incurred from the date of the statutory offer. I am pleased this provision is included in this bill. The offer and settlement provisions are patterned after the Securities Litigation Reform bill which Senator Dodd and I authored last Congress. 
I can't believe we have to pass a federal statute to accomplish this next task but apparently we do. 
The bill requires all IRS notices and correspondence to include the name, phone number and address of an IRS employee the taxpayer should contact regarding the notice. To the extent practicable and if advantageous to the taxpayer, one IRS employee should be assigned to handle a matter until resolved. 
In New Mexico, a notice can come from the Albuquerque, Dallas, Phoenix, or Ogden IRS center. Taxpayers are often left with no option but to contact my office asking for help in simply identifying who they should talk to at the IRS to settle their tax matter. The caseworkers are experts, but it would take them two days to track down the right IRS office so that the constituent could try and solve their problem. It was so commonly befuddling to constituents that my caseworkers asked that this identification provision be included in this bill. 
Movie stars, rock singers and hermits like, and need unlisted phone numbers. The same is not true for federal agencies. The bill also requires the IRS to publish their phone number in the phone book along with the address. We have a beautiful new IRS building in Albuqueruque, but the only phone number for the IRS is the toll free number that is too frequently busy. If you didn't know the IRS building in Albuquerque existed, you wouldn't find a clue of its location in the telephone book. 
We experienced a lot of complaints about the IRS toll free numbers. I am glad that an amendment that I authored to this bill includes a provision requiring that automated phone lines include the option to talk to a real, knowledgable person who can answer the taxpayers' questions. This would be an option in addition to merely listening to a recorded message. 
I am pleased that the Senate was willing to accept a Domenici amendment, cosponsored by Mr. D'Amato and Mr. McCain that requires IRS helplines to include the capability for taxpayers to have their questions answered in Spanish. 
In addition, the bill establishes a toll free number for taxpayers to register complaints of misconduct by IRS employees and publish the number. 
The bill requires the IRS to place a priority on employee training and adequately fund employee training programs. The IRS is making progress. The accuracy of the advice that taxpayers received when they called the IRS was very bad. For example, in 1989, the advice was correct only 67 percent of the time. The accuracy has fortunately improved. Training is the key. 
The bill requires the Treasury to make matching grants for the development expansion or continuation of certain low-income taxpayer clinics. 
The bill requires at least one local taxpayer advocate in each state who has the authority to issue `Taxpayer Assistance Order' when the taxpayer Advocate believes it is appropriate. 
Mr. President, many, in fact most, IRS employees work very hard and do a good job. Perhaps the best way to reform the IRS is to reform the code to make it simpler. The doubling from $100 billion to $195 billion of the tax gap--the difference between the amount of taxes owed and the amount actually paid--is evidence that the system is breaking down. 
The last point I would like to make is that I was going to offer an amendment to provide for a biennial budget and appropriations cycle because if Congress took this step, it would give us more time to do adequate and more aggressive oversight. If we had biennial budgeting the Finance Committee would have more time to focus on keeping an eye on the IRS. Senator Moynihan is a distinguished student of history and he told the Senate that the IRS was created in 1862, but it wasn't until 1997 that the full Finance Committee exercised its oversight jurisdiction. Other committees could, likewise, exercise better oversight of all federal agencies if we had biennial budgeting. We would have better run programs and an opportunity for a truly more efficient federal government. 
The Majority Leader has agreed to schedule time for the Senate to debate this bill in the near future. I am pleased that we were able to reach that agreement. Thank you Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about my amendment to the Workforce Investment Partnership Act of 1998 and to make a few comments about the overall bill. 
Simply put, my amendment allows consortia applying for a Tech-Prep the additional option of using the money to locate high schools at Community Colleges. The Tech-Prep section already seeks to create consortia of local schools, post-secondary schools, and employers to form a cohesive link between the entities. 
My amendment merely goes one step further and simplifies the process by allowing grants to be used for the placement of high schools at community colleges. The idea is not without precedence, in fact the Middle College Consortium is a national network of twenty two high schools located on college campuses. 
Mr. President, I think the fundamental question becomes what is education? I believe education is far more than books, classrooms, and teachers, it is about learning and preparing for life. I want to mention several points I have heard from students and employers that reinforce my belief. 
A high school student stated to me that often he and his classmates are simply bored in class and that creative learning concepts must be put forth. Amazingly, an employer stated that only one in forty applicants were qualified for even an entry level position. All of us, businesses and individuals are paying taxes and I think it is only fair that we expect some kind of return in terms of our schools producing qualified graduates. 
Is there a one size fits all solution? Of course not, because not everyone wants to pursue the same career path. However, my amendment enables those desiring to pursue a vocationally based career yet another option and tool to help ensure their success. 
I am very pleased that an integral part of a Tech-Prep Program is a focus on math, science, reading, writing, communications, economics, and work-place skills. Also Tech-Prep Programs integrate the academic and vocational instruction with work-based learning. 
My amendment ensures this by requiring a consortium to contain a business partner. Industry will have the opportunity to take an active role in ensuring graduating students possess the tools and knowledge that they will need to succeed in the local workforce. The business partner will also act as a gateway for student and teacher internships and also provide students a head start in obtaining a job. 
Mr. President, there is one point I want to make absolutely clear: student attendance at a high school at a Community College will be voluntary. However, many high school students have already decided to pursue a vocationally based career and are even now taking those kind of classes. My amendment is aimed at those students in an effort to ensure they will succeed. 
Community Colleges often have more resources, like vocational facilities and business partnerships, than a traditional high school. Students choosing to participate will become acquainted with the instructors, facilities, and application process for admission, and a natural path to at least a two year degree will be created. 
Mr. President, my amendment is about creating yet another option so our children will be empowered with every available resource to succeed. 
Now I would like to make a few remarks about the Workforce Investment Partnership Act of 1998. First, I would like to compliment Senators Jeffords, DeWine, Kennedy, and Wellstone for all of their work on this bill. Second, I am very pleased the Senate will shortly vote on this very important piece of legislation to reform the Federal job training and education related programs. 
Like many Federal programs, current job training and education related programs are a maze of 
overlapping and duplicative programs. The bill incorporates close to 70 programs under three titles: Adult Education, Vocational Education, and Job Training. 
The streamlining of the current voc-ed programs into a manageable system will allow for the delivery services in the most effective manner possible. By delivering services in the most effective manner we can accomplish two important things: a prepared workforce and a business community that is confident in the workforce. 
I believe one of the keys to the bill is the transfer of power from Washington to the individual states. States will have the flexibility, authority, and means to design a vocational educational system that best meets the needs of the state because decisions will be made by state officials and not Washington. By eliminating multiple Federal requirements and mandatory set-asides, states obtain that flexibility. 
States will also have the option to submit a unified plan or a single State plan for all of the education and training programs incorporated in the bill. Again, this is another example of providing states with the ability to design programs that best meet their needs. 
The Bill also greatly simplifies the process for individuals seeking to obtain voc-ed services through a `no wrong door' approach. This `one-stop customer service system' will allow individuals to receive comprehensive information about the availability, eligibility, and quality of the programs at one location or via a computer network. 
Mr. President, I also want to say how pleased I am that Senator DeWine's amendment will reauthorize the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. As my colleagues are aware, the Rehabilitation Act is our country's primary Federally funded job training program for disabled individuals. I believe the reauthorization takes on even greater importance since the authorization for the act expired in September of 1997. 
Among other things the reauthorization will: link the Rehabilitation Act and the Workforce Investment Partnership Act of 1998; streamline current vocational rehabilitation systems to increase efficiency and access; and improve the delivery of services to individuals with disabilities by providing more choice and a greater number of quality jobs. 
Again Mr. President, the changes I have just mentioned create more options and allow for the best possible delivery of services. 
And that is exactly what my amendment and the overall bill are all about: creating more options and providing for the best possible delivery of services.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, it was many days ago, it seems to me, that I spoke on this treaty. We have been on it for 4 days. I accepted the invitation to speak early on, like the leadership suggested. All this time has passed. Tonight, as we choose to do something rather historic, which I have no doubts about it in my mind and I believe it will be proper and I believe America will be very proud that we enlarge NATO tonight, all of the ominous predictions I believe will not happen and we will just have laid out another great big giant American stake for freedom, prosperity, and democracy. 
I believe that is the way it is going to work. 
I was most impressed as I studied this and met with different people in my office. I met with the Ambassador of Hungary, Gyorgy Banlaki. He was in my office visiting. My reason for being overwhelmingly in favor of this is what he said to me in the office. Let me quote it. It is very simple. It is two sentences. 
The people of my country would like to be able to choose our own allies. We would like to enjoy all those things that history has denied us. 
A few days ago I was here to say this is the Senate's chance to make the hopes of Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic come true. Let them choose their own allies, for they have been denied that in the past. They have been denied the right to choose their own allies. We all know that part of history. In fact, they have been forced to choose their allies and to be part of their international arrangement, which was not for peace, as it turned out, but for nothing but troubles for the world and for these countries. We all know that. 
I believe what we are doing tonight is typically American. We are saying to the three countries that were denied freedom and denied the right to choose their allies that we are glad that you are choosing the allied group that we are part of, and we are glad to have you. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to address the legislation before the Senate, the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic as members of the NATO alliance. 
Mr. President, let me begin by sharing a statement made to me last fall by Hungarian Ambassador Banlaki during his visit to my office. He said, `The people of my country would like to be able to choose our own allies. We would like to enjoy all those things that history has denied us.' 
Mr. President, I am here today to say, this is the U.S. Senate's chance to make Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic's hopes come true--let them choose their own allies 
for they are choosing to join NATO where they have been denied in the past the right to choose their own allies. We all know that. We all understand that. 
Let me be clear--I am fully supportive of this treaty before the Senate allowing these three countries membership into NATO. NATO is an alliance that has been a success beyond anyone's expectations--it has never been permeated--and since its inception, no great wars have been fought within its borders. 
NATO embodies our continued commitment to Europe. Its existence ties U.S. security to peaceful relations among our European allies. The historic, political and cultural connection between the U.S. and Europe provide the foundation for this transatlantic alliance. 
The objective of the myriad institutions and organizations created in the aftermath of World War II were a reaction to the carnage of two great wars in the first half of this century. The NATO alliance, the Organization for Cooperation and Development, and the European Union were all created with one purpose in mind--preventing further conflict between the states of Europe. This goal of peace was achieved. The only tragic failure in the history of these alliances was their inability to encompass nations beyond the Iron Curtain. 
Today we have the opportunity to realize what was impossible only a few years ago--expanding a cooperative alliance to the nations previously locked in a coercive pact. 
I have listened to many of the arguments for amending this treaty and for delaying this treaty. I have also heard the criticism aimed at the U.S. Senate for not debating it further. 
So let me make this point--NATO was a defensive alliance. But it was never an exclusive alliance. We in the free world waited for the day when the rest of Europe would be free--free from tyranny, free from communism, and free from the everyday controls placed on the people of Eastern and Central Europe. 
Mr. President, that day is here. These countries are free. They have been free for 7 years. They have struggled to establish democratic, free market societies. 
To a greater or lesser degree, all three of them are being successful. 
They desire a place at the table among the democratic, free states of the West. And in my opinion, we should have allowed them to join NATO sooner than 1999, as this treaty before us states. 
This Senate would be foolhardy to turn its back now on these countries or even to continue to delay the treaty's implementation. 
In January, I visited the NATO headquarters in Brussels and met with NATO officials as well as the ambassadors from the new member countries. I was impressed by their perspective that this was not NATO expanding out to engulf these countries, but rather this was Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic asking to come into NATO. 
It is crucial to remember that NATO is not expanding against any sovereign will, but exactly the opposite. This treaty allows the West to let these countries fulfill their destinies--and if this Senate does not allow the treaty to pass and pass quickly--we are denying them the ultimate freedom--as the Hungarian Ambassador said--to choose their own allies. 
I do not believe that Russia should fear the free association of allies, even those that might have been former enemies. There is nothing for Russia to fear. They should be reassured that the borders of Russia are peaceful today, that there is a united and growing Europe. They should be welcoming of NATO's ability to maintain peace and harmony among its members. 
I would like to address those Senators who have expressed the need to link European Union membership with NATO membership. We must recognize that NATO enlargement, European Union expansion and monetary union are inextricably linked. 
Last fall, I began considering the different arguments for and against this treaty. The Committee which I chair, the Senate Budget Committee, held a series of hearings on U.S: European issues which gave me a different perspective to the many questions about the U.S. and Western European roles in Eastern Europe. 
We cannot ignore that it was the presence of a U.S.-led NATO that provided the security for European Union that has facilitated its economic development. Without sovereign security, economic security cannot happen. These are exciting, new times in Europe. We have Europe in the next months uniting beyond its original common market alliances to become a monetary union. 
While I know European Union membership is desired by Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, EU membership is very different from NATO membership. And Monetary Union cannot even be considered until membership to the EU has been granted. Someday, I am convinced, they will become members of the European Union. 
Some day, when they have developed their free markets which are emerging and their emerging new democracies, they will also be part of the new monetary union, the new single currency that many European countries will have in the not too distant future. They need the security and the structures of democracy to make capitalism work. To tie NATO membership with European Union membership at this time would not be wise. Defense security first will then lead to economic security. 
On costs, over the last few months, I have had CBO, GAO and the administration explain their estimates of the costs of NATO expansion. CBO estimates that the costs to the U.S. will approximate $100 million per year for the next four or five years. 
From the perspective of the Budget Committee, this cost is very affordable when compared to the overall levels of defense spending this year of $272 billion that we approved for the 1999 budget resolution. 
Let me conclude Mr. President, that while the debate on NATO has raised several issues, one issue keeps dominating my thoughts. Here is an alliance, that once was designed to respond to the threats of the Cold War. Those threats included the armies of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Now this same alliance is being asked by those same three countries to be allowed to join today. How can we possibly say no? 
I have no doubt that we are witnessing a major event in the histories of these former Warsaw Pact countries as well as the Free World.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is a very important education bill before us today. 
It is a revolutionary education bill. 
It encompasses a major philosophical shift. 
This legislation is as significant as when we, as a society, decided that it was okay, in fact desirable, to teach girls to read. It is as big of a philosophical shift as when the Supreme Court struck down separate but equal schools in the 1960's. 
This bill stands for the proposition that during a time when our technological capability is undergoing exponential change, education also needs exponential change not incremental tinkering. 
To understand the magnitude of this proposed change, start with old adage `follow the money.' 
The Gorton amendment takes the money and provides three different paths for it to follow. Instead of a myriad of overlapping programs, each with its own set of guidelines, principles, and educational commandments, states are given maximum flexibility. Flexibility not only on `what' to do with the federal education dollars but `how' those federal dollars should be delivered to states. 
States can opt to send funds directly to local school districts minus the federal regulations; or--states can decide they want their federal money to be sent to the state education authority without federal regulations or--states can opt to continue to receive federal funds under the current system. 
States are supposed to be laboratories for government experiments. The Gorton amendment allows this experimentation so that Congress will have some concrete examples and data to see how each approach works. 
This bill stands for the proposition that the best decisions regarding education are local decisions and this amendment gives the federal purse to the local decision makers. 
This bill stands for the proposition that our schools need to do things differently. Too many kids are merely getting `social promotions' to keep them in a class with their age group regardless of whether they have learned their lessons. It is a sad state when many of our graduates can't read the diplomas they receive at graduation. 
Too many schools don't teach the basics any more, and what they do teach isn't taught very well. 
Another important philosophical shift encompassed in this legislation is the long-overdue, common-sense revelation that it is reasonable to expect teachers to pass a competency test before we can expect our students to be able to pass tests. I am pleased that this bill includes a provision providing for teacher testing and merit pay. 
The bill now includes an amendment to provide new grants to states that (1) test K-2 teachers for proficiency in the subject area they teach and (2) has a merit based teacher compensation system. 
In line with my belief that teacher competence is key to improving American education, this bill creates incentives for states to establish teacher and merit pay policies. 
I believe the best teachers should be rewarded for their efforts to educate our children. A little competition in our public schools would be a good thing for rewarding these teachers who excel at their profession and motivating those who may need to improve their performance. 
The MERIT amendment would use the Eisenhower Professional Development Program (Title II) to provide incentive funds to states that establish periodic assessments of elementary and secondary school teachers, including a pay system to reward teachers based on merit and proven performance. 
The legislation would not reduce current funding for the Eisenhower Professional Development Program. Incentives will be provided to states that establish teacher testing and merit pay programs. The amendment permits the use of federal education dollars to establish and administer these programs. 
The Eisenhower program, established in 1985, gives teachers and other educational staff access to sustained and high-quality professional development training. In 1998, the Congress approved $28.3 million, $10 million more than in 1997, for the Eisenhower program to provide in-service training for teachers in core subject areas. 
The President requested $50 million for the Eisenhower 
program in 1999, an increase of $26.7 million above the $28.3 million provided in 1998. New Mexico received $2.4 million in 1997 for all 89 school districts. The President funds his 1999 request at the expense of Title VI, Innovative Program Strategies, which New Mexico also heavily utilizes. He requests no funding for this program, which received $350 million in 1998. 
This is but one step forward in our bid to improve the educational performance of American students. This amendment supports the principle that all children deserve to be taught by well-educated, competent and qualified teachers. 
This bill also builds upon the education savings accounts enacted last year. It expands the amount of money that can be saved and expands its uses to include K-12. 
About 14 million individuals are expected to sign up for these accounts by the year 2002. Contributions can be saved to cover college expenses or used when needed to pay for a wide range of education expenses during a student's elementary and high school years. Examples of eligible expenses include text books, computers, school uniforms, tutoring, advanced placement college credits, home schooling, after-school care and college preparation courses. 
A tutor can make the difference between success or a student falling hopelessly behind. 
A computer can open the world, as well as cyberspace to a child. Children growing up in homes with computers will be the achievers. I am afraid children growing up in homes without computers will be at a disadvantage. This bill will allow money from an education savings account to be spent on a computer, software, and lessons on how to use the computer. 
The bill has several solid worthwhile provisions. 
It raises the limits on annual contributions to an education IRA from $500 to $2,000 per year, and allows accounts to be used for K-12 expenses. The bill allows parents or grandparents to make the contribution in after-tax money each year. 
The Accounts would grow with interest, and withdrawals for educational expenses would be tax-free. A+ accounts, as under current law, are targeted to middle income taxpayers. Eligibility phases out beginning at $95,000 for individuals and $150,000 for joint filers. Under these terms almost all New Mexicans would be eligible to set up one of these accounts. 
The bill allows parents to purchase contracts that lock-in tomorrow's tuition costs at today's prices. This bill would make these savings completely tax-free. 
Families purchasing plans would pay no federal income tax on interest build-up. Under current law, state-run programs allowed tax-deferred savings for college. However, savings in such plans, when withdrawn, are taxable as income to the student. This provision would benefit one million students. 
Twenty-one states have created tuition plans. New Mexico has not yet implemented one but it does have a proposal under consideration. If the state finalizes it pre-paid tuition plan future students would be able to benefit. Pre-paid tuition plans are a great way to secure the future. 
The bill extends through 2002, the exclusion for employers who pay for their employees' tuition and expands the program to cover graduate students beginning in 1998. The exclusion allows employers to pay up to $5,250 per year for educational expenses to benefit employees without requiring the employees to declare that benefit as income and pay federal income tax on the benefit. One million workers including 250,000 graduate students, would benefit from tax-free employer-provided education assistance provision. 
The bill also creates a new category of exempt facility bonds for privately-owned and publicly operated elementary and secondary school construction high growth areas. The bill makes $3 billion in school construction bonds over five years. This is enough to build 500 elementary schools. 
I hope the Senate will complete its work quickly on this bill and that the President will sign it. 
Mr. President, this education bill is a revolutionary education bill. When you look at it on its four corners as it has finally passed the Senate, it is not nibbling around the edges. It is asking we make some fundamentally different decisions about the Federal involvement in public education. 
I am not sure everybody understands that the Federal Government's involvement is about 7 percent. So when we talk about our U.S. Government having an impact on education for kindergarten through 12, about 7 percent of the money spent in the public schools across this land comes from the Federal Government. That means 93 percent comes from the States, municipalities, counties, boroughs and the like. 
From what I can tell, the Federal Government has been doing too much dictating for 7 percent of the resources that they give to the States, too much of a heavy hand trying to dictate outcomes with very little money. One of the worst examples of the Federal Government's involvement is when we decided we should help the disabled young people get into the mainstream of our public schools, a wonderful idea. Then we said we will pay 40 percent if you pay 60 percent. To this day, to this night as we stand here on the floor, the Federal Government has paid 9 percent, yet we impose regulations. The latest ones on the IDEA bill that implements our desire to help public education mainstream and educate disabled young people, this 9 percent has for many schools dictated such onerous mandates that some today are willing to violate the law in order to get before a judge to show that some of what we are doing is so arbitrary that it is not even common sense. 
Now, frankly, the revolution is twofold, as I see it. One, we are going to take a third of our public education money and say to our States: You have three options. You can take this one-third of our funding, a number of programs, and leave it just like it is. You can stay with these categorical programs where we put up a tiny bit of money. We have bureaucracy and regulations coming out of everybody's ears as we try to impact on education with a little sliver of money, with a marvelous purpose and goal attached to it. So, one, you can take it and keep it that way. The other is, you can say: State of New Mexico, State of Alabama, you send that money right to your school districts to be allocated to them proportionately and let them decide how to use the money in the best interests of their problems. Third is for the State to say: We will administer the money to the school districts and let them spend it the way we dictate. In all events, it is a marvelous research project. There is no downside for our kids. 
What we are doing is not working. So for those who stand up and worry about this new change, what is working today? Things are getting worse. We just had a TIMMS report that looked at our math and science kids, and it said the following, plain and simple: Up to the 5th grade, we are doing great. From 5th to 12th, we go right off the log, like the Titanic, into the ocean. 
We are at the bottom of the heap by the time the 12th grade arrives in the United States of America, the highest technology and science country in the world. We are sitting around worrying about one-third of the programs that we have been dumping on our school systems with highfalutin goals, and we are saying to the school systems that you can decide where to put that money. The other two-thirds we will leave the old way. 
Now, that is a revolution worth putting right before the public and seeing what happens. The other one is a little bit of a movement in the direction of merit pay and expanded teacher education. Both of them are revolutionary ideas and neither of them will harm anyone--in particular, the young people of our country. The chances are they will help our young people. 
I know the President is going to veto this bill, but I am as positive as anything that the change in public education from the U.S. Government will start with this bill. This bill is going to start a change that is going to be borderline revolutionary. We are either going to do more and accomplish more, or essentially we are going to find out why not. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is a real honor today to introduce legislation, together with Senator Bingaman, to honor Representative Steve Schiff. This legislation designates a special auditorium at the Sandia National Laboratories as the `Steve Schiff Auditorium.' Steve spoke in this Auditorium on several occasions, as part of his long service to the people of New Mexico. 
I think everyone knows that Steve Schiff exemplified all that was good about public service: integrity of the highest order, deep and fundamental decency, and an acute and open mind. He went about his business quietly, but with wonderful efficiency. He was great at telling stories, usually about himself. He was a model for all politicians to admire. 
Steve came to New Mexico from Chicago, where he was born and raised. He served the people of New Mexico in different capacities since 1972, when he graduated from the Law School at the University of New Mexico. Before election to Congress in 1988, he served as District Attorney for eight years. 
One of Steve's favorite local programs was his Tree Give-Away Program. For eight years, Steve held a Saturday tree give-away day at the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center. He gave away more than 115,000 trees. Through those trees, he shared his own hope, faith, and love. Those trees now flourish throughout the Albuquerque area in New Mexico as lasting symbols of this man. In a similar way, his legislative achievements continue to serve the American people as another reminder of this great American. 
Along with those trees and his legislation, the Steve Schiff Auditorium will serve as a lasting memorial. I am happy and honored to have been a part of his life. 
I think he would be pleased that this major facility at Sandia National Laboratories, an auditorium where many events occur, many events he has sponsored, that he desires that we talk about in our Federal Government as it pertains to nuclear weapons and research, that it be designated after him.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate both Senator Gorton and Senator Frist. Senator Frist conducted a series of hearings in his Budget Committee task force from which came much of the factual information and evidence of the great need for reform in the programs that are now in the Gorton amendment. 
Frankly, I think what has happened is some are still looking at last year's Gorton amendment and assuming that is the bill before us. This is about one-third of the Department of Education's programs, a little over $10 billion out of a little over $30 billion. So one-third of it will be block granted. 
But the point of this amendment this year for those who thought we were going to in some way dismantle the programs nationally, this bill has options in it so if anybody wants to stand up and say these Federal programs are the greatest thing and the States love them and the school boards love them and they participate wholeheartedly and they are effective, they can say that. It really isn't true, but they can say that, and we can stand up and say, well, fine, if they are that good, obviously, the States and school boards across the land will choose the option to keep them just like they are and let the Federal Government run them. The healthy part of this is it is going to be a wonderful experiment.

Mr. DOMENICI. This will be a wonderful experiment, for if, indeed, some States choose to remain under the bureaucratic programs that in many cases do not even fit the needs, and in many cases States do not even participate because they are so far from what the needs are, if they want to, they keep the programs. And then a number of States may go the other route, it will be marvelous for Americans to be able to see, in about 5 or 6 years, which approach helped the kids more, which approach got more education dollars into the classroom on a day-by-day basis, addressing the major problems that the school boards and State school boards find to be the real areas of need at the State level. 
I think it is time to let States make that choice. Let us see which one works best--categorical strings attached, Federal programs that frequently miss the mark, or the approach that Senator Gorton has. I am delighted to be a cosponsor. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a distinguished scholar and son of New Mexico. This year, Dr. Richard Greenleaf, Professor of Latin American History and Director of the Center for Latin American Studies at Tulane University, ends a remarkable career of more than a half century of research and teaching. Dr. Greenleaf has now returned to new Mexico to enjoy his retirement. 
A few weeks ago, Dr. Greenleaf's students and colleagues gathered at Tulane University to honor their mentor and friend. One of Dr. Greenleaf's former students, Dr. Stanley Hordes of the Latin American Institute of the University of New Mexico, wrote an essay to commemorate that event. The essay recounts Dr. Greenleaf's extraordinary career and warmly expresses the deep affection his students hold for him. 
For all his accomplishments, I salute Dr. Greenleaf. I welcome him home to New Mexico, and I join all those who are indebted to him for his lifetime commitment to scholarship and teaching.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to take the opportunity to address our environment and energy resources this Earth Day 1998. 
My perspective is derived from my quarter-century in the United States Senate, wherein I have devoted much of my time to environmental and energy concerns. When I started my tenure here in 1973, the commemoration of Earth Day was three years young. During the ensuing years, I have witnessed great strides towards the improvement of our nation's environment. We are uniquely fortunate to be prosperous enough to consciously choose to promote environmental concerns and conserve resources. This Earth Day 1998 should focus on creating ways to not only continue these improvements in our own country, but also assist other nations in improving their ability to protect the world's environment. The earth is currently the only home we all share. 
I would like to think that I have contributed to the continuing United States environmental improvement during my years of public service. I actively participated in the multi-year debate on the 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act, and I am pleased to say, played a key role in shaping the 1990 amendments which has reaped substantial decreases in air pollutants since the first Earth Day in 1970. 
Through passage of the Clean Water Act and reauthorization of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the United States of America has vastly improved the quality of its rivers, lakes, and coastal waters, and has the safest drinking water in the world. Communities, while suffering some hardships, have been able to decrease emissions, provide clean, safe public areas for their citizens, and still remain a world economic leader. We have learned that costly regulation is not the solution, but cooperation with and incentives for the business community, as well as providing local control over local concerns, improves everyone's way of life. 
It is from the vantage point of my years of service in environmental and energy issues that I speak today about the divergence in regulation and policy from the best interests of our global climate. Several examples can be gleaned from the recent debates regarding emission standards and the global climate change document which emerged from Kyoto, Japan in December. 
Remember, since 1970, air pollution in this country has been steadily declining, despite the fact that the U.S. population has increased by almost 30% and vehicle travel has more than doubled. Now, I believe anyone will tell you they want clean air. However, one must also realize that any environmental improvement comes at some economic cost in our industrialized world. The United States may be responsible for 20 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, but it also responsible for producing 26 percent of the world's goods and services. And we still have some of the most stringent environmental standards around. We need to keep finding ways to improve air quality, while maintaining a standard of living that is envied the world over. 
American cities have just recently been able to achieve the stringent air quality standards, and air quality is improving. In my home state of New Mexico, Albuquerque was one of the first U.S. cities to be removed from the list of violators of national carbon monoxide standards. Let's let all communities continue to improve, rather than impose strict and costly new air quality standards before we know that they are based in sound science. 
I believe that many of my distinguished colleagues here in the Senate know I have long been a strong proponent of basing governmental decision making on sound science. Indeed, in both the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the Safe Drinking Water Act of last Congress, I fought hard to make sure `sound science' provisions were included in the legislation as a matter of policy. There has been some question about the scientific validity of the global warming theory. Theories do change. It was not all that long ago that my children were being taught in school that we were approaching another ice age. 
However, assuming that global climate change is occurring and emissions need to be reduced to improve the global climate, what is the logic of exempting developing countries from any global treaty aimed at reducing those emissions? Many developing countries, like China or India, are predicted to rapidly exceed developed countries' emission levels. Shouldn't every country be bound to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions? Why should this country bear the burden in this inequitable arrangement that will not reduce net emissions levels? 
Do not misunderstand me. We all have to live on this planet; we all should live well and live in a clean environment. I do not believe these goals are contradictory. Progress is not a curse. This nation is blessed to be leaders in Environmental protection and to also enjoy modern conveniences. I do applaud the fact that the climate change debate has focused some attention on looking to alternative and cleaner fuel sources. 
I do sometimes find it ironic that those environmental activists who speak the loudest about a dirty environment oppose development of the safest, cleanest energy source available in quantities to sustain our modern needs: nuclear energy. 
As we leave the 20th Century and head for a new millennium, we truly need to confront these strategic energy issues with careful logic and sound science. 
We live in the dominant economic, military, and cultural entity in the world. Our principles of government and economics are increasingly becoming the principles of the world. We can afford a clean world. As developing countries try to emulate our nation's success, we will find ourselves competing for resources that fuel modern economics. 
I have pledged to initiate a more forthright discussion of nuclear policy. We often define environmental debates in terms of `us versus them.' When it comes to global environment there is no them. We are all environmentalists. Nobody belittles the fundamental need for clean air and water. Some activists make their cause all-important, from whichever direction they come, and do not focus on what is right or fair. I believe that the emotional response is not always the logical alternative. 
As Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I have faced criticism from both sides on some of my positions. Now, the President has outlined a program to reduce U.S. production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases below 1990 levels by some time between 2008 and 2012. Unfortunately, the President's goals are not achievable without seriously impacting our economy. 
Our national laboratories have studied the issue. Their report indicates that to get to the President's goals we would have to impose a $50/ton carbon tax. That would result in an increase of 12.5 cents/gallon for gas and 1.5 cents/kilowatt-hour for electricity--almost a doubling a of the current cost of coal or natural gas-generated electricity. However, Nuclear energy can help meet the global goal. 
I was very disappointed that the talks in Kyoto did not include any serious discussion about nuclear energy. As I have pointed out before, in 1996 alone, nuclear power plants prevented the release of 147 metric tons of carbon, 2.5 million tons of nitrogen oxides, and 5 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. Nuclear power is now only providing 20% of the United States' electricity, but those utilities' emissions of greenhouse gases were 25% lower than they would have been from fossil fuels. 
In the aspect of recognizing nuclear energy as a clean, economic fuel alternative, the United States has thus far failed to take the lead. Other countries, such as France, Japan, and Russia, have recognized the importance of nuclear energy sources. And there are many more beneficial uses of nuclear technologies, from the destruction of dangerous organisms in our food to enjoying healthier lives from medical procedures dependent on nuclear processes. The notation on our calendar should read that today, Earth Day, is the day we should begin to catch up with other countries that have prudently decided to use more nuclear power because it is good for the environment and makes good sense. 
I realize, however, that we cannot address the issue of nuclear energy without discussing the problem of nuclear waste. This should not deter us from a prudent course; we must, and we can, find ways to address nuclear waste safely. Currently there are exciting scientific ideas being developed to utilize the 60-75% of energy available in spent nuclear fuel rods while still reducing the half-life of residual material. 
I encourage debate this Earth Day on ways to improve the world's economy while maintaining a clean environment. Exploring nuclear energy issue is but one way. And indeed, the issue of energy use and environment is pertinent on more than one day a year. Let us just reflect on the possibilities for the new millennium as we proudly review our past successes.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the current royalty system is an elaborate after-the-fact game of `Gotch ya.' 
Producers are put in the unenviable position of being second-guessed, some times years later, by the Minerals Management Service (MMS). This current system is unfair to oil and gas producers. It is expensive and inefficient for the federal government. 
Under the current system, only the lawyers benefit. It results in a lot of law suits and big legal bills. 
The MMS tried to fix the system by proposing a `producer is always the loser rule.' 
Under the proposed rules, (now abandoned) the producers would have always lost. The MMS tried a rule tying the fair market value to the NYMEX. 
If producers sold their production for less than the NYMEX price, they would have had to pay the royalty on the `phantom' income i.e. the difference between the price they actually received and the NYMEX price. If, on the other hand, they sold their production for more than the NYMEX, they would have had to pay the royalty on the amount they actually received. This would have been a very unsatisfactory approach. 
Fortunately, most independent producers don't have to use that approach. However, the existing valuation formula for calculating fair market value is complicated, fraught with exceptions, and hard to administer. 
The question: What is fair market value for oil is not as simple as it sounds. 
Some of the variable factors include the quality or refinery value of crude oil; the transportation costs necessary to move that oil to a refiner; relative access to various refineries or markets which may value a particular type of crude oil differently; the supply, vis-a-vis, the demand for certain types of oil or alternative supplies, and whether the contract is a long-term or short-term commitment made by either the refiner or the producer. 
Other factors that influence value include: the volume of the crude oil produced at the lease. This could affect the unit logistical costs; seasonality; and service requirements of the producer. 
Another question more complicated than it sounds is this: What are the appropriate, allowable, deductible expenses? 
Under the current system it costs the MMS about $60 million annually to debate this question and to administer our royalty collection program. It takes several hundred employees, many of them auditors, to oversee the current royalty program. In contrast, royalty-in-kind programs in Canada need only 33 employees to administer their approach. 
With a royalty-in-kind system, the producer would give some of its production from the federal lands as a royalty-in-kind payment. 
A royalty-in-kind program is an accurate way to determine a fair market value. The federal government would sell its share of the oil on an open and competitive market. What you can sell it for is, per se, fair market value. That is the essence of what the `Royalty-in-Kind' Program, along with the use of the Qualified Marketing Agents (`QMA'), would allow. 
The goal should be treating the producers fairly, maximizing revenues for the federal government, and distributing an accurate amount of royalties to the states. 
The bill being introduced today by Senator Nickles, Murkowski, Hutchinson and I would provide a better way for the federal government and the Minerals Management Service (MMS) to collect, with certainly, a fair value for its crude oil.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume consideration of S. Con. Res. 86, the budget resolution, with the time until 9 a.m. equally divided on the Bumpers amendment relating to mines. At 9 a.m., by previous agreement, the Senate will proceed to a series of seven consecutive rollcall votes. The first two are in relation to two judicial nominations, the nominations of G. Patrick Murphy to be a U.S. district judge for the Southern District of Illinois and Michael P. McCuskey, of Illinois, to be U.S. district judge for the Central District of Illinois. The remaining five votes are on or in relationship to amendment No. 2218, Senator Dorgan's amendment relating to the Tax Code; amendment No. 2170, an Allard amendment regarding Federal debt; amendment No. 2195, a Lautenberg amendment on environmental programs; amendment No. 2213, a Bond amendment on housing; and then amendment No. 2228, a Bumpers amendment relating to mines. 
It is hoped that during all of these votes Senators will contact the managers to inquire as to if their respective amendments may be accepted or if they require a vote on their amendment or perhaps indicate that they have decided to withdraw their amendment. 
It is the intention of the majority leader to complete action on this measure as soon as possible. We ask all Senators to cooperate in that regard. Senators should be aware that today will be a busy schedule. Rollcall votes will be occurring throughout the day and into the evening, as necessary. In addition, Members are reminded that all consecutive rollcall votes are limited to 10 minutes in length. All Members' cooperation is requested with reference to the timely manner of the disposition of each vote. 
As a reminder to all Members, the first rollcall vote will occur at 9 a.m. this morning.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, many of us have heard people say, `Kick them when they're down.' I guess we all recall when we were in high school. If you went to a high school football game, the cheerleaders would say, `Hit them again. Hit them again, harder, harder.' 
Mr. President, the mining industry in the United States led by the copper industry is in a deplorable economic state. As a matter of fact, copper is down 30 percent. Already in America, copper mines have been closed. All mineral resources in the world are down substantially. Oil production in the United States is down. Stripper wells are going out of business rapidly. We are more and more dependent upon foreign sources for our mineral resources, and for our oil. 
Frankly, the GAO tells us that the mining industry pays an enormously high tax. In fact, the study says on average they pay 32 percent of the income. They already contribute $14 billion to the Federal Government in revenues. 
Mr. President, it is obvious that this amendment will cause more disrepair in the industry, fewer jobs, laying off people. In fact, we might call it the `Unemployed Miner Act.' 
Second, in terms of money for disabled young people, let me first say the budget before us has $2.35 billion in new money for IDEA, for the disabled young people of our country. We think that is a very, very significant add-on when the President only put a few million dollars in his. We think it is the right place to put the money. But we have already put it in our budget. We don't need to destroy the mining industry in order to live up to our responsibility under IDEA and to disabled children. We found the money to do it in our budget. 
It seems to me that to pick one tax, one deduction, the depletion allowance, and from that assume that the mining industry, coal mining and all the others, are not paying any Federal taxes is an absolute gross exaggeration, if not an untruth. As far as environmental degradation, since we have had environmental laws, our mining companies are not causing environmental degradation. They are bound by every single environmental law of this land. And a statement that they are polluting today is also a gross exaggeration, if not truly an untruth. 
When time is all yielded, I will move to table and ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, for the benefit of the Senators, and this has been agreed to by the ranking member, we will now start the 1-minute `vote-arama.' From the list we will call up an amendment and it will be taken up. When it is finished, we will call up another one. We will alternate back and forth. 
We are getting it down to a reasonable number on our side. We are hoping the other side will get rid of three or four more there, but we are going to start this way. 
The first amendment on our side is the amendment of Senator Grams, No. 2222, and that will be followed by Senator Kennedy, amendment No. 2184. For each one, they will tell you the title and then the Senator will have 1 minute to explain it. 
Amendment No. 2222 by Senator Grams is called up.

<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. This sense-of-the-Senate amendment requests that the functional total in this budget that we assume in the EEOC should receive $279 million in budget authority. This is the level requested by the President. The amendment would raise a freeze baseline we assume by $37 million. 
From my standpoint, ultimately the Appropriations Committee will determine between a freeze and a $37 million reduction, but if the Senator insists on this, then I have to move to table and ask for the yeas and nays. 
I think you are just as apt to get the money without the amendment as you are with it, because it will be up to, incidentally, the man sitting in the chair, coupled with a couple of other Senators, which of the two levels will be funded. There is plenty of money for them to go either way. 
Having said that, I urge you to withdraw your amendment. We stated the case here, but if you would like to vote.

I think what we could agree to here is that the amendment provides for an assumption that increases the level to the exact level you have recommended in your sense of the Senate. Thus, I don't think we need a sense of the Senate.

I didn't hear much of what Senator Murray said. But, Mr. President, let me say what I understand this amendment does. It asks for a $2.5 billion increase in education for special ed. It doesn't say where the money comes from, but it comes from somewhere in the budget. 
The Republican budget before us asks $2.5 billion more for special ed than the President of the United States asked for. As a matter of fact, the President, after committing to dramatically increase special ed, increased it $38 million while we increase it $2.5 billion. We said where we took the money so that it is doable. This one does not even indicate what programs in the Government would be cut to pay for this. I don't believe this is the way we ought to do business here, and if the time has been yielded back, I yield mine. I move to table the Murray amendment.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I compliment the occupant of the Chair, the distinguished Senator from Kansas, and I compliment the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson. They have given us an opportunity to see to it that we reform the Tax Code of the United States. It has been talked about for so long and nothing ever happens. They have devised a way where they are saying to the committees of the U.S. Congress, and to the President, let us get on with it. And here is the leverage: If you do not, we will not have a Tax Code in the year 2001. 
I believe this is the only way you are going to get tax reform when those who are in charge of the job--with all the special interests gobbling them up not wanting any change. I think the only way it will occur is if this sense-of-the-Senate proposal becomes law. It is not law today when we approve of it. It will become law when a committee sends a bill to the President. But we ought to go on record saying we want reform, we want major reform of a broken down code, and we want it soon, not 15 more years of debate. 
If I have any additional time, I yield it.

Mr. DOMENICI. This is another reserve fund. The reserve fund has the advantage, for the proponent, of creating a new series of entitlement programs, thereby indirectly breaking the caps. If you would try to spend these in the normal way, we would be breaking the budget. 
So it creates a series of potentially new entitlement programs. If we ever get taxes increased or other programs cut, the resources can be put into this reserve fund. I don't believe we ought to be doing this. I have objected to them regularly here on the floor when there is no real source of money. 
I think we should sustain the budget point of order on this one and not start another approach to a new series of entitlement programs.

It does not mean we have yet arrived at how many would be entitled to a vote under the `vote-arama' with 1 minute. We are working on that right now. We need a lot of cooperation. But I think it is fair to proceed, I say to the leader, with this amendment. This is not one of the three or four we would choose to resolve these issues, but we had already made that commitment.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is a budget year when the total amount of money available for discretionary spending out of which the NIH is funded was agreed to last year in the bipartisan budget agreement. It is a total dollar number for all of the Government that is not entitlement programs. 
So it is for education, it is to run the agencies of our Federal Government, it is for the money the IRS needs to pay its workers, and on and on. 
While it is very close to a freeze this year, there is an additional budget authority of $1.9 billion year over year and an additional $6.1 billion in outlays, about one-half percent. For those who say this portion of Government is growing dramatically, for the next 4 years, because of the agreement, it will be growing at about this amount or less, literally close to a freeze for a sum total of 4 additional years. Very tough. 
Nonetheless--nonetheless--the President of the United States, in the President's budget, provided some restraint by way of reductions in expenditures. I will just go through to give you examples. The President's budget, in function 150, international affairs, reduced that total function by $530 million; function 300, that is the environment, a $260 million reduction; function 350, agriculture, $240 million; function 370, housing and commerce, that is $640 million; function 400, a $1.25 billion reduction. 
They go on all the way through. And the sum total in cuts is $7.83 billion. That means the President provided room for programs that he wanted and reduced these. What we have done in our budget resolution is we have taken these reductions but we have given different priorities to how we would spend the money. 
I want to say to my good friend, Senator Specter, there is no one here who, when it comes right down to being in the trenches where you provide money for NIH, there is nobody who has been more of a leader than he. And, frankly, his subcommittee, which covers a myriad of programs--education, NIH, and on and on--is a subcommittee that is constantly under pressure. 
I am not going to suggest, as some, that it always needs more and more money. Rather, I will say it is under difficult pressure because of the kinds of programs they have to fund. Having said that, in the budget resolution, where we have some responsibility to establish priorities, somebody else follows us and perhaps can change some, but we know that their subcommittee has most of the priorities that we are for and that he would like to fund. There is no other function with more priorities, other than perhaps the function of defense, which stands there singularly all the time. 
What we did, we funded that program, because of its being a priority, by increasing significantly the NIH assumption for expenditures. We also increased in that function education because we knew that from the Republican standpoint we wanted to fund the disability program in education, and we wanted to fund some flexibility programs for the States so they could do some things on their own, being relieved of some mandates that we had given them. 
In that alignment and that set of determining where we spend money and with that backdrop, we have provided in this budget resolution a larger increase in NIH, in the assumption for NIH--the assumption; the budget resolution isn't binding--we have provided the largest increase of any domestic program that is appropriated. That amount is $1.5 billion in the first year. That is an 11 percent increase. Then, in estimating our assumptions for the remaining 4 years, we increase that a total of $15.5 billion for the premier institution researching health in the world--the American National Institutes of Health. 
We do not determine in the budget resolution which of the 
numerous NIH activities get what amount of money. I have been to the subcommittee with the distinguished chairman presiding, making a very strong, strong pitch that we put more money in researching mental illness. He recalls that. We were able over the years to raise those kinds of institutes to a level of funding where I can give you two or three which are now on the cutting edge again and which have excited young scientists and the very best to get into fields they might not have that are critical to our solving some of the enormous problems of the suffering of human beings, not only Americans but humans. 
So I am an advocate. But I guess I would say, in a tight budget, `Enough is enough.' And $1.5 billion is enough; $15.5 billion over 5 years is enough. And I cannot do any better. I cannot make the funding any more sure in a budget resolution than I have done in this budget resolution. If Senator Specter is to prevail, we cannot assure anyone that the desired level of NIH funding will be what Senator Specter assumes by his amendment, because he is once again going to be back into the competition of taking all the money that his committee gets, and deciding among hundreds of programs how much the NIH gets. So that is one side of this coin. 
Now, with every coin, there are two sides. When you add, you have to take away. Because the distinguished Senator did not try to break the budget. He did not try to break the caps, because he pledged last year--and he kept his pledge--that we would stay on this path of a balanced budget and the caps. 
There are some who would like to break the caps for any good proposal. The distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania is not doing that. He is saying, let us cut other domestic programs to pay for the new increase over and above the $1.5 billion that we provided. And the Senator included defense in the .4 percent cut. So defense gets cut across the board, and domestic programs get cut across the board. So defense gets cut $1.1 billion over 1 year in order to pay for this $2 billion increase. I will just tick off some so everybody knows. The veterans get a $76 million reduction; the environment gets an $89 million reduction; agriculture, because it is smaller, gets a $17 million reduction; transportation, $160 million; and on and on. 
It may very well be that the U.S. Senate today wants to say, in addition to what the budget resolution contains, with all the other programs being restrained dramatically, that in order to give it $2 billion more, we ought to do these things, including cutting defense $1.1 billion. I do not believe the Senate will do that. But if they choose to do that, then obviously the appropriators will have to give that every consideration. I do not see how we can do the defense one, because we are already having a very difficult time meeting the defense needs with the numbers that are in the budget and the firewall that protects. 
Let me just share a thought with the distinguished Senator. I say to Senator Specter, you said you want to do this to defense also. I would like you to think about that, because if you do, then I believe the firewall prevails and you may have a supermajority requirement. But I leave that to you; that is not for me. 
Having said what I have said, I do not want to detract from the fact that the National Institutes of Health are a fabulous community of the best scientists in the world. When you really look at what they are doing, they are on a course to cure many, many aspects of human suffering and human disease. When you add to what they are doing in the normal research, you add something like the genome mapping, the mapping of all the chromosomes of the human body, 
and those are being looked at in terms of their relationship to disease. You have a formidable group of scientists and research equipment moving in a path of, perhaps, what may be called the generation yet to come, which will be a wellness generation. That could be, when the dread diseases are no more. 
So I don't want to sound like this is just a typical entity. It is a very prominent and important one. I do believe, consistent with limited resources and because we have to tax our people, we have limited resources. Some think they are taxed too much already. I believe the budget resolution treats this formidable research community fairly well. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Don Nickles is on the way. I want to discuss the issue a little bit with the Senate. 
Mr. President, my good friend, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, said that he doesn't know how anyone could disagree with these findings--the findings of a national commission appointed by the President. Well, just so everyone understands, the very commission made the findings, and then the commission itself split on whether they should be put in law or not. So I say, with reference to a sense of the Senate and whether we ought to adopt them in law, at least we ought to start with the premise that half of a commission was concerned about the broad picture of health care costs in America and other things and suggested that perhaps it would be better not to put them in law but to handle them some other way. 
Let me talk a little bit about the upside of what is going on in America with reference to health care costs during this very short era when we have moved away from fee for service toward managed care and HMOs. In doing that, let me hearken back to the joy that permeates this body and the American people when they hear that we have the budget under control. We are in an era of balance. 
Mr. President, it is almost unequivocal that had we not gone to managed care and HMOs, we would not be celebrating a balanced budget today. That is because under the other system--and I note that the doctors support regulating HMOs more--but under the doctor system, up, up and away went the costs. We had 3 or 4 years when the Federal Government's accounts that paid for health care were going up, compounded in double digits every year, which meant that in short order you would not be able to pay for Medicare, you would not be able to afford Medicaid because, even if we had the ability to borrow and borrow and incur debt, the States would not have been able to pay for it. So let's make sure that everybody understands this short era of moving to managed care and HMOs has brought within the reach of many, many Americans and many American businesses health care coverage they could not have afforded under the old system. 
As a matter of fact, it was interesting. As I listened to my friend from Massachusetts, I thought about a couple of speeches I gave when we were talking about our not being competitive with Japan on automobiles. I was able to say to audiences that one of the reasons we are not competitive is because the automobile is carrying around in the trunk four times the health care costs the Japanese car is, because our health costs were so enormous as compared with theirs. I am not suggesting theirs is as good as ours, but neither am I suggesting that ours is four times better than theirs. 
So I think when we talk about tying HMOs and managed care into some kind of rigidity in an effort to solve some problems that may be solved otherwise, we better be careful as to how much we do and how much we mandate versus how much we handle in other ways in an effort to get quality. 
I also indicate, just by way of an observation, that it is a lot easier to find the shortcomings of HMOs and managed care than it was the old system, because this one is all focused in on management running a system. Before, it was hundreds and hundreds of doctors. To be able to focus on the lack of quality care is much easier. That works both ways. It is good because it calls it to our attention. But it ought to be easier to get quality care than it was before without having to write it into rigid law. 
I note the presence of my friend, the Senator from Oklahoma. 
I want to close by just saying that before we make it so impossible for managed care and health care to control costs within reason and deliver health care, everybody should understand that whatever we do we ought to get quality at the best price. We ought not get quality at the expense of those who are paying for it, and at the expense of the U.S. Government. That is what I think ultimately we should do when we get down to trying to legislate. This isn't legislating. It is just us giving our opinion and our ideas as a Senate. When it comes right down to it, that is what we are going to be talking about sincerely in our committees and on the floor. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have?

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, at approximately 4 p.m: it looks like it will be a little bit after that--today, the Senate will begin what has been fondly called a `vote-arama.' Some might not want to say `fondly'; they may have other words to describe it. I choose that today for no particular reason. If all Senators will remain in the Chamber and refrain from insisting on rollcall votes on their amendments, all Members will survive this cruel process and the Senate can conduct the final vote on this resolution within 3 or 4 hours after 4 p.m. 
I understand that is wishful thinking, I say to my fellow Senators. Nonetheless, I urge my colleagues, once we start the `vote-arama,' to remain here in an attempt to work with us on the amendments that they may have to be included in the `vote-arama' or be disposed of otherwise. We still have a lot of amendments that we have not reached agreement on that might end up in the `vote-arama.' 
We are making some very significant headway. We started today with 72 amendments. We have worked to clear a number of those. Today, I think, with the amendments we will shortly adopt by voice vote, we are probably down to about 30 amendments that will fall into the `vote-arama,' and we have not had a chance on each of them to discuss them with the Senators. Perhaps a significant number of those will not require votes. 
I yield so that my distinguished friend, the ranking member, can address the Senate.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, following the next amendment, which I think will be the Lautenberg amendment, we will propose to the Senate a long list of amendments that we will accept and propose to accept by voice vote or by accommodation by both sides agreeing. So we will do that and that will take care of another long list of amendments. Then what will be left will be the `vote-arama,' and we will try to narrow those down in our personal conversations with Senators. Our leader will be along shortly to discuss this with Senators, also. 
According to the order, Senator Lautenberg's amendment will now be the pending business.

Mr. DOMENICI. I see the minority leader is here. Maybe he wants more than 18. He can try to get it off the bill, but I remind him that we made a deal we weren't going to do that, so I will keep my remarks brief. 
First, Mr. President, I would like to say the basic difference between this proposal and the President's--and it is very fundamental, and everybody should understand it--is that we thought if there was going to be some new money to spend, that we ought to take a look at what American programs were most in need of money, and we found that there are two American programs. They are not State programs, they are not city programs, they are not school board programs--they are `the U.S. Government does them, or they don't get done.' They are the Social Security system and the Medicare system for our seniors--but we are all going to get to be seniors, so therefore all of us. 
What we did in our budget was say very, very simply: If you settle this tobacco agreement--which seems to me to be getting further and further from reality, but let's just say if it gets settled--put all of the Federal Government's receipts from it into the program that is most in need and that has been most adversely affected by smoking. That is the Medicare Program. 
It is interesting that while the President's program and the Democrat program--the President suggests $124 billion in new programs, and the litany sounds wonderful. We have heard some of it here this afternoon. I can't tell for certain, but it looks like the budget before us does a little better. It looks like it has $88 billion to $100 billion in new programs, new spending. 
I ask, whether it is $124 billion in new money or $88 or $90 billion, is it right? Is it correct? Is it the right thing to do, to put not one nickel toward Medicare, which is the largest American program in jeopardy? And, as I debated this earlier in the week, I showed in a very simplified, simple chart, what will happen to the Medicare trust fund starting in about 10 years. And the deficit line goes in a line downward as if we are aiming it towards the middle of the Earth--which we used to say that's where Hades was, when we were little kids. 
For starters, that is one big difference, and we are proud of that difference, for we put a very substantial number of billions into that very needy program so those national commissioners trying to put it together will have some extra resources to save Medicare for the seniors of today and the seniors of tomorrow. 
When you do that, you cannot pay for all the new wish list of programs that have been alluded to here today and that our President alluded to in a dramatic speech to the American people as the State of the Union. As a matter of fact, had that wonderful pot of gold--to wit: the cigarette companies' agreement--not been around when the President of the United States was preparing his speech, he could not have told the American people that there were any new programs. You know why? Because he agreed. He agreed that for the next 5 years there would be little or no increases in the discretionary programs of this country. That was the deal. That was the agreement. 
So, lo and behold, the expectation quotient rises from that night to this moment on the floor of the Senate, when the big pot of gold is there, to start a whole bunch of new American programs. Frankly, as I indicated, everybody should know that most of the list of good things that we cannot afford, that the Democrats are speaking to, most of them won't come into existence if we don't have a big, gigantic pot of gold coming from the tobacco companies. That is point No. 1. 
Point No. 2: With reference to smoking and its relationship and cost to the American taxpayer, and to our programs, the distinguished occupant of the chair has the most forthright sense-of-the-Senate resolution that he will offer during this debate, and I hope we adopt it. It just says that every penny we get out of the tobacco settlement should go to Medicare, because Medicare suffers a $25-billion-a-year hit because of seniors who, when they were young, smoked, got sick, and Medicare pays their bill. Pretty logical. I commend him for it and for his leadership in that regard. 
Nonetheless, they would ask, aren't we going to take care of some of the needs that we know about because of smoking? And we say yes. But we didn't wait around to do them based upon a settlement; we did it by reducing other programs and paying for them. So, for those who wonder, the National Institutes of Health, which everybody says should be increased so they can work on some prevention areas of cancer that have been affected by smoking, gets a $15.5 billion increase in the next 5 years, the largest in the history of any research entity that the United States funds. 
And then, education. You see, we don't forget what we agreed to last year. We have a 5-year agreement on education, and it is one of the high-priority agreements between the President and the Congress. We didn't forget about it in the second year. We fully fund the increases in education, and they are very significant. What we said is, we should put $2.5 billion, minimum, for the disabled of our children being educated by our public schools. 
A disgrace exists today with a Federal Government which mandated this assistance years ago, committed to pay 40 percent of its cost, and is still paying 9 percent as of this day. While the schools foot the bill, we write the laws, even though we agreed last year that education money would first be applied there to bridge the gap between the 9 percent and the commitment. The President saw fit to go with new programs and not that; but not us--$2.5 billion. That means those school systems can hire new teachers. We don't have to pay for teachers from the Federal Government's tax coffers, which we have never done in history. We say relieve the burden on the schools and they can hire them. 
We put an additional $6.3 billion in education--an increase--so that we can fund in due course some programs which will have flexibility built in for our public schools, including such things as teacher training and those kinds of things that will bring some accountability to the public school system of our country. And we are proud of that, too. It is not as if there is nothing in, it is just we chose these instead of others, and we think these are prudent choices. 
Then we could go on from there and talk about criminal justice. We all know we cannot cut that; it must go up. We increased that in our budget, because it was a high priority item when we made our 5-year agreement that we worked so hard together on, Democrat and Republican and President. 
So it is not as if we did not do some of these things that the Democratic leadership is here touting that they would do and we didn't do. It is just that we did not increase net spending by $84 billion. The Democrat budget does. Net tax increases of one type or another--$80 billion in that proposal. We did not do that much. The reduction in the surplus--there is a cutting of the surplus in half, under their proposal, from 8 to 4. That is not a lot of billions, as we throw them around here, but nonetheless a significant thing to note. 
Mr. President, I believe the budget we produced in the Budget Committee, if it were to become the cornerstone for this year's appropriation bills and tax reduction--for there is $30 billion worth of tax reduction in ours. It is provided for by closing loopholes and other tax advantages, many of which have been listed as items that we should consider for more than a decade, and some of them 15 years. 
So ours is pretty well balanced. I am convinced, having familiarized myself as best I can, and I think perhaps with a few exceptions as well as anyone in the Senate, ours would be good for the future growth of the American economy and would continue this dramatic, sustained economic growth that is bringing us revenues and bringing us jobs. 
Frankly, Mr. President, I don't believe there is very much in the Democratic budget or the President's budget that would contribute significantly to those positive things that we all cherish and want so much. 
I yield the floor and reserve whatever time I have.  
Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't know how we judge right and wrong, whether I am right or wrong after an eloquent speech, as my friend called it. But, look, this afternoon we are going to vote and sometimes in America, democracy says the one that gets the most votes wins. I don't know if that means you are right, but I can tell you we are going to win and they are going to lose. I don't know what that means, but I think that is pretty good. 
In addition, let me suggest, I, too, am worried about what is happening to our young children who smoke. It is wonderful for me to be able to say that I smoked heavily until 8 years ago. I have eight children and not a single one smokes. So I am very pleased about that. I don't know what that means either, except it is just a statement of fact.

Mr. DOMENICI. They did not. But they used to leave all kinds of little notes on my pillow and stuff them underneath. 
Mr. President, let me just say, it is a question in politics if there is ever enough spending by a Government. How much is enough, I ask? Is $825 million provided in this budget resolution to take care of advertising to have a positive impact 
on our children smoking enough or should we have more? 
I tell you, that is twice as much as the President asked for. I assume if a Democratic President has some $400 million and we have $825 million, that probably--probably--we have enough. Having said that, there are so many programs being talked about to come out of that pot of gold, that giant piggy bank, many of which nobody knows will even work. If you have national advertising programs and preventive programs in drugs where you are going into schools, talking to the kids, running advertising and it is not working a bit--in fact, there are more drugs--one would have a tendency to be a bit skeptical, it seems to me, about whether we know how to do that, be it for drugs or for cigarettes. 
In the final analysis, we have decided in our budget resolution to take every priority that we can find consistent with our 5-year agreement and fund them as best we can consistent with the agreement; that there be no new discretionary spending. 
What is happening now, just so everybody will understand, we asked those experts who talk about our money supply, our interest rates, the wonderful economy, what are we supposed to be most concerned about to keep the message out there that we are fiscally responsible and we are aiming at a balanced budget for a long time? They tell us, `Don't breach the agreement that you entered into with reference to how much you can spend each year as you appropriate annually.' 
We all say we will not do that. That is right. But, Mr. President, what this budget that is before us and what the President chose to do is to take another pot of money and say, `We'll spend it another way and it won't count against those agreed-upon expenditures.' 
That is called new entitlement programs. 
So this litany of new programs cannot be paid for under the budget agreement. But it can be paid for if you choose to create new entitlement programs that will go on forever even though the money from which they are paid has a terminal time. So I believe we did the right thing. We look forward to an era of balanced budgets, an era of solid economic growth, an era during which we fix Social Security permanently and during which we fix Medicare permanently and we actually put our budget where our mouth is, and that is to do those things. 
I yield back any time that I might have. And in due course I will make a point of order against the budget. But I do not choose to do it now. 
I say to Senator Hutchison, if you would let me dispose of a series of amendments, I would really appreciate that.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is very difficult to listen to words like, `The President of the United States is looting a veterans' health care program,' and `the Senate Budget Committee continues to loot.' Mr. President, almost everybody on that Budget Committee who voted for this probably votes for everything the U.S. Congress proposes for veterans. But what has happened here is very, very interesting. Here is the expansion of a program in a dramatic way. One would assume it is rather dramatic, since it is going to cost about $10 billion over 5 years. Congress has never voted on the program, number one. It is so inconsistent, in terms of causal connection between something that happened while you are in the military and your death, that the President of the United States, on two occasions --not one, but two successive budgets--has not funded any money to administer this expanded program. 
As a matter of fact, this year the President refused to fund it and removed the money needed from the veterans' overall available moneys, 
I assume because the President believed it probably was never going to happen. That is two points. The third point: Not a single claim under this proposed expansion has ever been granted to this day. I take that back. The staff says 200 claims have been granted. 
What we are saying is the President is right on this one. Before the afternoon is finished, we hope we can talk about another way to see who is right without having to do what the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, asks for. We are working on that, because, if anything, Mr. President, and fellow Senators, we ourselves need some clarification about what this program is all about. I want to give two examples. I am not an expert like my friend Senator Rockefeller, who is on the Veterans' Committee, apparently is, or Senator Specter, who works hard in that area and is chairman. 
Here is one example. If a young man started to smoke when he was 16 years old and he smoked for 4 years, and he joined the Army when he was 20 and he smoked for 4 more years, and he only served 4 years and he got out, and then he continued to smoke for 40 years, and he got cancer, this expansion of the program never before considered says that the Federal Government, the military, is responsible for his cancer. Do you have that? He started smoking before he went in. He smoked for only 4 years while he was there. Now he gets a benefit for cancer. If he dies, his widow gets a widow's allowance because something happened to him in the military and we should pay for the death and a widow's allowance. Frankly, I do not believe anybody who has been talking about this veteran's benefit understood that. 
I will give you the more typical one. You join the military. Most of these are going to be people who were not in for a long time because they are the veterans who were coming in while we had the draft. So you have a 20-year-old joining and he smokes. Here is one. He smokes for the 2 years that he is in. Then he continues thereafter to smoke for 40 more years. He dies of cancer. His widow gets a benefit allowance because he smoked for 2 years in the military, and continued thereafter on the premise that he became addicted to nicotine in the military and, therefore, we should pay for it. 
There are all kinds of examples like that. I don't know all of the examples. Of the three that I stated, one of them may not be exactly right. But I am in the ballpark about what is happening. 
I believe we ought to follow the lead of the President and not permit this program to go into effect now. I did not say that we should kill the program. I said I believe we should come up with a way so that we don't implement the program now so that we don't create any false hope immediately, but that we find a way to get this program appropriately evaluated and that we find out here in the Congress what it is all about. I am hopeful before too long that we will have an approach to try to do that. I know frequently in these kinds of situations it doesn't do a lot of good to talk and to explain because maybe people have already made up their minds. I hope not on this. 
Let me tell you, there is no question that we are not denying veterans any health benefits they are getting today. If 200 people have gotten the claims, it certainly is just the beginning. There will be many more. We ought to take a good look at it before we decide that it is right. Frankly, I look forward to taking another look at this in some appropriate way for a reasonable period of time. I hope the veterans' groups in 
this country will say, well, the Senate quite appropriately wanted to take a look. They did not say we weren't entitled to this. But it is very, very different than anything we have done before. In a sense, it is sort of saying if you smoked at any time in the military and smoked thereafter, that the military is responsible for everything that happens to you if you smoke for 25 more years because somehow or another you became nicotine addicted in those years while you were in the military. 
I repeat: This does not change all of the veterans' benefits with reference to existing programs that are being carried out. I understand with reference to hospital treatment that Senator Rockefeller is alluding to the fact that if this isn't continued on and if it doesn't continue starting right now that some veterans will not be as high up in the rank of using the veterans' facilities as they would be if this program were in effect. But I suggest even there that we ought to take a look for a reasonable period of time and get this analyzed thoroughly before we proceed. 
I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have never been so certain that my eloquence had that much to do with matters, as to whether I spoke first or last, but normally I have been speaking last here as the floor manager when we are opposing an amendment. But I will not follow that now. I will speak now and let the Senator close. 
I don't have much additional to say. Frankly, I think it is a mistake, however, to categorize the money that the President saved in the budget by saying he was putting this program off. I think it is a mistake to categorize it that it all went for highways. The truth of the matter is, it goes to discretionary spending for programs across the board, which include highways. Frankly, what is going to happen is, the programs of this country all go to the Appropriations Committee; if there is not enough money for highways, then they are apt to fund highways and cut NIH, or anything else, if they would like. It is going to be a matter of what is the highest priority. 
So it seems to me we are talking about a program that the President of the United States for 2 consecutive years has said should not take effect, has provided no money to let it take effect. That, at least, is very questionable, whether the general counsel ruled or not. Congress never voted. And we believe some additional time ought to be taken on this matter. 
Whatever time I have I yield back at this point.

Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 2. 
Mr. President, this amendment is very simple, and I think it is a fair amendment. This amendment says that for the next year this program will be held in abeyance. And during that year, the Veterans' Administration, the General Accounting Office, and the Office of Management and Budget will meet, analyze, and make recommendations to the President of the United States and to the Congress of the United States. 
I believe that enough has been said here on the floor, enough is there by virtue of the President of the United States deciding what he has decided for 2 consecutive years, that we really ought to make sure we receive the best information about what is the right and fair and honorable thing to do. 
I do not believe that anybody expects we should pay a widow's allowance, and for cancer, for a veteran who spent 2 years in the military and smoked, or for a veteran who spent 4 years in the military and smoked, and then smoked for 40 years thereafter. I believe we need some clarification and some real details on this, because this is a very large expenditure of money and it should not be denied to veterans if, in fact, there is a reasonably causal relationship between a veteran's service and the illness from which a veteran died. If there is a reasonable causal relationship and it does encompass as many as might claim under this, then we ought to have this group of people spend at least a year, or whatever time it takes, and report to us on the effects of the General Counsel's interpretation of a general statute with relationship to nicotine. 
I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished Senator from Idaho.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, without this counting as part of my 1 minute, if I could remind the Senators of where we are now. We have seven amendments stacked with reference to the previous order. Then we will start the 1-minute amendments, and on our side we have about 10. I am not sure how many are on the Democrat side, but we will work with those 10 and see if we can put those down. They are mostly sense-of-the-Senate amendments. For now, we are in a position to take up about six more. The time is supposed to be 10 minutes on the votes. I know that is difficult. For all additional time we take, we will be here later and later tonight in order to get it finished. This is a 10-minute vote on the Lautenberg amendment. 
Now, let me say this is the Democrat amendment offered in committee. In the committee, it did not even receive all of the Democratic Senators' support. If you want to spend more money, like $88 billion more, vote for this. If you want to vote to put the moneys that we get from the tobacco settlement on Medicare instead of six new programs, vote for theirs. If you want to spend new money on at least eight more domestic programs, vote for theirs. 
We have provided increases in NIH, education, the environment, and the criminal justice. We think that is a good priority.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, we have $1.5 billion next year for NIH. We have added $1.5 billion to NIH in this budget; $15.5 billion over 5 years. The amendment would add another $2 billion. That would cut defense $1.1 million, environment $88 million, agriculture $17 million, veterans $76 million, justice $86 million, and so on. 
I believe we have done enough with the $1.5 billion increase and $15 billion over five years. We should not now add $2 billion more and propose that we restrain every department of Government, including the Defense Department, for half the cuts. 
I yield any time I have remaining.

The President has denied it twice and taken it out of his budget. We believe the best thing to do is to have one more solid look at it by the GAO, OMB, and the VA. They ought to report to us and the President before we engage in a $10 billion-a-year program which is built around the notion that if you ever smoked in the military and then you got out and smoked for 40 more years, you are to collect benefits from the military because you started smoking in the military. That is the essence of this debate.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, essentially the Domenici amendment says this program, which has never been voted on by Congress, which has been put into regulation by order of the counsel for the Veterans Administration, which will cost ultimately $40 billion, we are saying let us wait 1 year and have the GAO, the Veterans Administration, and the OMB study it and report to us and to the President. The President has denied this program's efficacy, because of concern about the kinds of benefits and whether they are relevant to service in the military, 2 years in a row. We ought to take a little bit of time before we get involved in a $10-billion-a year program. 
I will give you one example. A veteran who smoked 3 years before he went into the service, 4 years in the service, and 40 years thereafter his surviving spouse might very well collect a widow's benefit and other benefits under this particular program.

We have denied any new reserve fund where specific revenues or resources have not been allocated. That is the case here. We think we have adequately taken care of the disabled under our budget. In many cases, we have done more than what the President has done. So with that, I make a point of order that the amendment is not in order under the Budget Act.

So what we have now is an attempt to say, no, let's change it just a little bit, let's add another use to that fund. I don't believe we should do that.

Mr. DOMENICI. First, I would like to state for the record that 302(b) allocations for the Committee on Appropriations are solely within the purview of that committee. The Budget Resolution is an expression of the Senate's priorities, and as such, makes recommendations to committees. However, the Budget Resolution assumptions do not bind the Appropriations Committee to any particular course of action, other than meeting the discretionary caps. 
That being understood, the Budget Resolution assumes a substantial increase over the Freeze Baseline for the Labor-HHS subcommittee. The Freeze Baseline levels are based on FY 1998 appropriations action.

Mr. DOMENICI. I fully understand your concern, and the agriculture community's concern, about the current position of MAP in the Budget Resolution. During the Conference on the Budget Resolution we will have an opportunity to take another look at this issue. In that event, I will commit to working with you to find alternatives. I want to assure you, the Committee went to great lengths to identify offsets for highway spending. As you know, we included MAP because it is one of several export programs through USDA.

Mr. DOMENICI. I thank everyone for their patience and in particular staff on the Republican side and the Democrat side for the marvelous work they have done. Let me say we are going to vote on this shortly. I feel rather proud. What we are going to do is move in a strong direction toward saving Medicare, saving Social Security, a significant tax cut, increases in education, and increases in criminal justice, the National Institutes of Health and programs of that sort. Yet we have not broken the caps and we will have balanced budgets for quite some time if we follow this format as we implement it during the year. 
Once again I thank everyone in that regard.

<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, unless my friend from New Jersey desires to speak, I will not use my entire 15 minutes. I will make a point of order that the Senator's amendment violates the Budget Act and requires 60 votes. 
Frankly, I do not understand what the distinguished Senator is talking about. He has been a longtime friend, and he has been on the Budget Committee. He has served on it. Actually, the Budget Committee is the source of the firewall that protects Social Security now. This amendment says he is taking away our jurisdiction, that we can't do anything with reference to Social Security, and we are the committee to make the recommendations. 
If, indeed, the recommendations in some other provision of law requires 60 votes to pass, that is a different thing. To say to a committee of jurisdiction that you cannot pass on anything because there is a supermajority requirement just seems to me that we could take every committee of jurisdiction, we could take away their jurisdiction all under the rubric that we are trying to keep them from spending money. Maybe we don't like Commerce. They have been putting out too many bills. So we adopt a process that says whatever your jurisdiction is, you can't report out any bills without a supermajority in these different areas. 
That is not right. The Senator apparently has some great goal in mind. I remind the U.S. Senate and my friend Senator Hollings, he does not like us to use the word `balance,' that we are in balance. So every time we use it, we better say the `unified budget is in balance.' 
Let's acknowledge that only 6 years ago, 5 years ago, if he is worried about Social Security, the unified budget was $300 billion in the red. Have we made any headway in keeping the Social Security trust fund from getting spent? Of course. For starters, we have made $300 billion worth, and right now we have a $10 billion surplus. That does not mean we have a surplus without the Social Security trust fund, but it means that we are borrowing $10 billion less from the Social Security fund because of the balance in the unified budget of the United States. Is that bad? That seems to me to be good. 
If some think that they can wipe out the nonunified deficit quicker, then there are only two ways to wipe it out quicker: One is to cut more expenditures or to raise taxes. 
That is what somebody has to be talking about if they want to make us stop the $90 billion worth of borrowing, which used to be more, and it is down from $100 billion to $90 billion this very year because of the surplus. Instead of talking about the Budget Committee doesn't have any jurisdiction without supermajorities to move anything with reference to Social Security--all we are doing is making recommendations to the Senate. 
To act as if this will in some way make the Social Security trust fund more solvent, frankly, in all honesty, I just don't understand how this is going to do any good, and I have not heard anything from the Senator yet that indicates that it will do anything good. 
In all respect, I just do not believe it is going to accomplish what the Senator wants. Social Security is not going to be any more protected, and we are just going to say that there is a 60-vote point of order against anything the Budget Committee would do with reference to recommending Social Security changes or reforms, which just seems to me doesn't have anything to do with the problems that he describes because we are still borrowing from the Social Security trust fund. 
I repeat, we are doing a lot better than we were 5 years ago, 6 years ago, and a lot better than we expected to do. That means 
Social Security is getting closer and closer to a stable state because the unified budget is getting more and more surplus, which the surplus is for now being applied to that debt, and we are borrowing less, which is now easy to understand. There is all kind of confusion. There are trust funds, IOUs. But the truth is, on paper, we are borrowing $10 billion less when we have a surplus than otherwise. If it gets up to $100 billion, we won't be borrowing anything. That is pretty good, and that is reality. 
The Budget Committee had something to do with that. There is a firewall that does not permit us to spend any Social Security money that would, in any way, affect the actuarial soundness of the Social Security system. That is a firewall of 60 votes. That was recommended by the Budget Committee. If we put that in before and came to the floor, it would require 60 votes to become law. It doesn't seem to me that is right. 
When the time has expired, I will make a point of order and then we will have a vote and try to stack it as early as possible so we can dispose of the amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. I compliment the Senator on his remarks. They are right on point. As a matter of fact, the resolution as drafted says to the U.S. Congress to begin to cure this marital tax inequity this year. In essence what we are saying is, if we are going to have a tax bill, we have no authority to dictate its content, but we are saying it is the sense of the Senate that we shall start down the road of eliminating that this year. 
Now, I might add----

Mr. DOMENICI. Is this what you mean? If you have two single people earning a combined income, that are single and filing separate returns, and you have a married couple with exactly the same amount of income, the married couple, everything else being equal, will pay $1,380 more in taxes per year?

<DOCNO>105-domenici-nm-60-19980401</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. 
I have 1 minute on this amendment. Let me just say there is a statement behind me that was made in the budget by the President of the United States. It is very simple. It says: 
The construction and renovation of school facilities has traditionally been the responsibility of State and local government, financed primarily by local taxpayers; we are opposed to the creation of a new Federal grant program for school construction. 
I acknowledge that is a grant program. But I believe that we should change that word and say, `We are opposed to tax credits for school construction,' because I don't believe the U.S. Government ought to change its tax laws to allow a total tax deduction, which is what a credit is for the interest that a bond will yield if it is for construction of schools in the United States. 
There is no formula. We don't know how we will do this. We don't know whether poor districts will get it. I think we ought not start down this path. I know for some any education program is difficult. I understand this may be one of those. But I truly don't believe we ought to do this. 
I remind everyone, in any event, this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It is not binding. That will give you latitude to vote differently than I recommend, since it is not binding. But I don't believe we ought to tell the Finance Committee we want them to start down this path in a big way with reference to school construction. 
Having said that, I move to table, and I ask for the yeas and nays on my motion to table.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I announce that when we finish this series of votes tonight, there will be no more votes tonight, but we will stay and debate five additional amendments --three from the Democratic side, two from the Republican side. Those will be stacked in the morning under the previous order, a 15-minute vote followed by 10-minute votes. 
I will tell everyone, we now have in excess of 75 first-degree amendments filed. We will take care of five of them tonight, and that will probably leave us with about 70. Obviously, we could not dispose of 70 amendments at 10 or 15 minutes each in a very short period of time. So tomorrow morning, we will have, and my friend Senator Lautenberg says his staff will have some charts to show you your amendments while we are voting in the morning. 
We would like you to be honest; we don't ask you tonight in the full light of everybody which ones you really want to vote on and which ones you would like for us to consider and which ones you might withdraw. We are going to work on accepting as many as we can, with the idea that there is still a conference to go to, during which time those accepted amendments will be given due consideration.

Mr. President, fellow Senators, I understand we have one vote scheduled on or in relationship to the Kyl amendment at 12 o'clock. The distinguished Senator is here. He would like to speak for 1 minute, and there will be 1 minute in opposition. I make that request and ask unanimous consent.

Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to just tell Senators that we now have about 29 amendments that are pending, for all intents and purposes. I consider that everybody wants a vote on them, although I hope not. And we still have about 18 hours, so there is plenty of time for more amendments. And, frankly, I just hope everybody understands that today is Wednesday, tomorrow is Thursday, the next day is Friday. 
I think that everybody should share with me some concern about whether we can finish this resolution unless there is some cooperation with reference to amendments. I do not ask anything of anyone specifically at this point, but I hope and I urge that, if there are more amendments, you start getting them in to us. There is no time by which you are bound, but I urge that, if you have additional amendments or second-degree amendments, you let us see them. I am sure my friend from New Jersey will join me in that. At some point we have to try to make a little 
sense of the process on this to see if we can get this work done in a timely manner.

<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. I have 2 1/2 minutes--it was 5 minutes equally divided. 
Mr. President, this is a very simple proposition. Do you want to start and create five new entitlement programs or do you want to save Medicare? It is a very simple proposition. We suggested, as Republicans, that Social Security and Medicare are the two most important American programs to save, reform, and make available well into the next century. 
We put our money where our mouth is, and we put whatever is left of the cigarette settlement on the highest priority health expenditure of this Nation: the salvaging and reforming of the Medicare system. 
In contrast, my good friend who offers this amendment says, `Let's create five new entitlement programs.' Even though the money will run out someday, we will have some permanent programs. 
Everyone knows this Nation should not have new entitlement programs, and everyone knows that there are many high-priority items in the American budget. We have said in our budget that we have made room for high-priority expenditures, and I will tell you quickly what they are: 
$15.5 billion increase in the National Institutes of Health. We have taken Presidential reductions and said we will spend them here; 
$825 million for a smoking cessation program, twice the size of the President's; 
And then we have said in our settlement of the tobacco fund, if it ever occurs, we pay the States their share and the rest of it goes to the program most in need--Medicare. 
Let me tell you, there is no relationship between some of the new entitlement programs that some want to create out of this tobacco settlement, but there is a direct relationship between the insolvency of the Medicare fund and tobacco smoking. As a matter of fact, in 1995 there was $25 billion of costs in the Medicare system that came from smoking. So if you are going to get money from the tobacco settlement, put it where the damage to the senior citizens is occurring, and it is occurring by virtue of their fund for medical care going bankrupt. 
I believe the issue is very simple--very simple: Do you want a budget that begins to help with Medicare, or do you want a budget that says not one nickel for Medicare; let's take care of that later with money from somewhere else.

Mr. DOMENICI. What has been amazing to the Senator from New Mexico is the way the U.S. Government fails to recognize its sole and singular responsibility. We are busy all the time, every year, with budgets that try to do new things. Frankly, the President of the United States had a very long list of new things, new programs. In fact, he had a suggestion that we use a lot of the money for helping classroom size, helping build public schools. But the real problem here is that if we do not rebuild the Indian schools that are run by the Government and put them under some management and maintenance, nobody will. They don't belong to anybody else. They are not being run by the State of Georgia, or the school board of Bernalillo County, Albuquerque. It is either we do it or the Indian young people go to school in buildings that are not fit for occupancy, much less for Indian education. 
I don't know what to do about it. The Senator from New Mexico doesn't know what to do about it. I work at it every year. We need to get some proposal to get this huge backlog taken care of and get on with being able to say to our Indian young people and the teachers who are in those schools, `We think enough of you to give you a school that offers you an opportunity like the rest of Americans to get educated.' The school building doesn't make the child, but I tell you, you can have a bad enough school building that the child can hardly learn. 
So I have asked that this resolution contain another provision, just in an effort to see if we can get there, and that provision, which was in the modification that Senator Johnson sent to the desk, asked the President of the United States--if I am not correct--it asked the President to submit to us by a date certain a 5-year plan to see to it that, regarding the Indian schools the Government owns, the Government must maintain them or they will not get maintained, and those where we have to build a new one because the old one is decrepit, that entire package be put in a 5-year plan and the President recommend to us how we might get that done. 
Frankly, I believe unless and until that shows up in a Presidential budget, we are not going to find the resources in the Senate or the House to do what we must do. This is not a little $50 million problem; this is a hundreds-of-million-dollar problem. So I believe we are on to something here in this resolution. It is not just a hollow one; it is one that is to get something back from the Chief Executive of America, and it is going to tell us whether we agree on this problem, and if they do, how do we take care of it in a given number of years. 
I anxiously await, and I will see to it that we hold this in conference, because I think it is the kind of thing that should be in the budget. Some sense-of-the-Senates don't belong in, but this belongs in because this is a problem we can't fix in a budget resolution. We can hardly fix it in appropriations, as you know. So, Senator, thanks for your leadership. I am glad to be on board. This will be welcome news in Indian country.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Roth amendment. Clearly, there is a long way to go before we have rendered Social Security solvent way into the next century. But it is even more obvious that this is the era when part of what a citizen who is working should have for retirement should be a personalized savings account or an annuity that comes from that personalized savings account. There can be no doubt that it can be structured in such a way that it will turn out to be better for the senior citizen. They will be assured of the benefits that they are getting now and, in most cases, will come out far, far ahead. 
In the meantime, if it works right, the surpluses of the U.S. Government, if used partially for this, will be invested in a safe way, not solely in IOU's from the Federal Government, which is where they go now, which is the law now; rather, they will be invested where they can, without much risk, yield significantly more and, when compounded, the power of compounding is enormous. 
So in a very real sense I come here today saying to the distinguished Senator, Senator Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee, that the time has come for some significant reforms that will not put in jeopardy the Social Security system, but rather in the long run make sure that it is not short of money, that its liabilities will not be there to destroy the system, but rather that in years to come, it will be more solvent, and that ultimately, with part of it being compounded because of the 
annual return that will come from safe investments, it is clear that everyone gains. The seniors gain, the 21-year-old paying into the system today gains, and the American economy is the beneficiary of individuals investing in this economy across the board so that the working people of the United States will own an interest in the American companies that produce our wealth. 
Frankly, I am delighted that we are going to discuss this today. If we discuss it for a long time, that is fine with me. If we discuss it for a short time and it passes, that is fine with me. But clearly, we discuss a lot of things that are not nearly as important to our future, and we adopt sense-of-the-Senate resolutions that are, in many instances, not even important to the fiscal policy of our Nation and the future well-being of our people. 
This is moving in the direction of reform and personalized accounts, and is a very appropriate thing to be doing on a budget resolution. It has everything to do with what we do with our surpluses, if we have them, what we do with capital needs in the future, and how we assure senior citizens that they are going to be guaranteed a Social Security check or better, because they will have invested some portion of it in personalized accounts. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I want to suggest that when we entered into the unanimous consent agreement, the idea was that we would 
expedite the voting on amendments and minimize the number perhaps that was going to be voted on in the so-called `votarama' with 1 minute on a side by amending the statutorily allotted amount of time for amendments and second-degree amendments. And we did so agree. But we were not specific in saying that there shall be no time yielded off the bill to those new time agreements. So I just ask, with the concurrence of my friend from New Jersey, unanimous consent that there be added to the unanimous consent agreement regarding the time allotted on amendments and second-degree amendments, the following language: And that no time, no additional time, shall be allotted from time remaining on the bill by either side.

A further vote will occur at 2 p.m. in relation to the Conrad amendment relating to tobacco. In addition, several additional votes will, hopefully, be ordered to occur in sequence at 2 p.m. following the Conrad vote. 
Also, Members can anticipate rollcall votes an a number of pending amendments to the resolution and other amendments which are expected to be offered. Therefore, Members can anticipate votes throughout today's session. 
Also, the Senate may consider any executive or legislative business cleared for Senate action. As a reminder to all Senators, the first rollcall vote will occur at 12 noon today.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my fellow Senators, if I thought this amendment would do anything to save or preserve Social Security, I would be for it. In my humble opinion, it does absolutely nothing to save Social Security. What it does is attempt to change the process and procedures so that if the Budget Committee reports out for Senate consideration anything on Social Security, it is subject to a 60-vote point of order. 
We could get to the point where we will take every committee of jurisdiction and pass a process rule because there was something in their jurisdiction we didn't want them to do business on. We could say anything you report out has to have 60 votes. Then we would take that to the floor, and the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction would stand up and say, `What have we come to?' 
This seems like some kind of exuberance that is not calculated to do anything except have some words suggesting we are trying to save Social Security. I raised a point of order. There is a motion to waive it. I hope we do not waive it. I urge Senators to vote `no' on the motion to waive. I yield the floor.

Mr. President, before we start the order here, might I suggest that Senator Bumpers would be our fifth amendment tonight, but we have agreed with him that we will come in at 8:30 in the morning instead of 9. He will offer his amendment, and thus the half-hour between 8:30 and 9 will be available for the agreed-upon time, which is a half-hour, equally divided, for the Bumpers amendment. He is here. 
I ask unanimous consent that when we start up in the morning at 8:30 the order of business be the Bumpers amendment, and pursuant to the previous order there be a half-hour equally divided on that and the vote eventually be on or in relationship to that and we waive no points of order.

Mr. DOMENICI. I think that 3, 4 years ago, 5 years ago, someone might have walked up to me and said, `Senator Domenici, why are you on such a measure?' But for many years, more than 5, I have been telling New Mexicans and every American that I could speak to that we are going to reform the tax laws of America. And guess what has happened. They now consist of 17,000 pages of laws. That is not the regulations and all the other things--17,000. And every year that passed, since that 5 or 6 years ago when we started talking about basic reform, the tax laws got more complicated, more difficult, cost more money, and more detrimental to the American economy with the passage of each year. 
Frankly, I am on this bill and I decided to put it in the budget resolution because it seemed to me that we were muscle bound. We could not get anything done. I believe the right thing to do when you are in that condition, and the people are suffering from it, and the country is suffering from it, is that you say there is going to be an `or else' to this--`you fix it or else.' 
That is what sunsetting is. But nobody should think that we are talking about sunsetting a code without prescribing some basic fundamentals about the code we intend to replace, that defective, deficient one. And anybody who is interested in knowing whether we just said, `Let's do away with the code,' or whether we spoke intelligently and with great common sense, right to what the American people are worried about, just turn to page 33 of S. Con. Res. 86--and if my time runs out in the middle of these next two or three paragraphs, just stop me. But the findings are found in this resolution. And it says:

My question is, do you like the Tax Code the way it is? Do you like tax reform, which has never been passed yet? We don't know what it will be, except it will be better than this one.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the proposal by the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. 
At the appropriate time I will raise a point of order. 
First, let me say that this proposal exceeds the spending caps set in the balanced budget amendment by $600 million in budget authority, and $900 million in outlays. 
The budget before us assumes $1 billion in additional spending over 5 years of the Superfund as originally agreed upon in the balanced budget amendment. 
The budget resolution provides $1.4 billion in budget authority, and $1.3 billion in outlays to fund critical construction programs within the Corps of Engineers rejecting the proposal of the President to cut it 47.4 percent. 
It fully funds the President's request for National Park Service operations at $1.3 billion; $1.2 billion in outlays. It fully funds the President's request for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, with $2.3 billion in budget authority; $2.19 billion in expected expenditures. 
It assumes funding for the Landowner Incentives Program of the pending Endangered Species Recovery Act, a step forward for both the environmental community and private owners and protecting the Nation's endangered species. 
It rejects the President's proposed reductions in the Environmental Protection Agency and tribal assistance grant funds; $2.7 billion above the President's budget over 5 years for clean water, drinking water, and targeted wastewater funds. 
It provides $1.1 billion more in budget authority over 5 years than the alternative that was provided in the committee by the minority. 
Frankly, when all of that is said and done, this is another one of these funds that is set up. The money that is going to be needed to do all the things that Senator Lautenberg contends should be done is not provided for, nor are cuts in programs provided for that would go into the fund. 
I guess while it sounds good, I firmly believe that it will never really happen. 
But, in all events, it is not germane. I will make that point of order as soon as time is available. 
I yield any additional time that I may have. 
Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I share the Senator's concern about this issue. It is correct that when inflation increases less than projected, the buying power of a dollar increases. According to CBO, inflation projections for the National Defense Budget Function for 1999 through 2003 have decreased from the 2.6 percent of the GDP Price Index projected last year to rates varying from 2.2 percent to 2.4 percent. This translates into a 1999 inflation `dividend' for National Defense of $1.7 billion in budget authority and $0.8 billion in outlays. For 1999-2003, the amounts are $13.2 billion in budget authority and $10.3 billion in outlays. 
The Department of Defense reports to us that it has already reinvested this dividend in other defense programs. Therefore, taking this money out of the 050 budget this year will cause real program reductions, and I would strongly oppose that. However, DoD does not routinely report these budgetary data to Congress, and I agree that it is important for us to have the data for oversight purposes. I also agree it would be useful to have similar data for both defense and nondefense purchases. 
I am concerned, however, that an appropriate methodology needs to be developed that is applicable to both defense and nondefense agencies. I am also concerned that we collect information from each major agency and analyze what they do with the additional funds, when such `dividends' are generated. Also, I would argue that when inflation is increasing faster than projected, we need to know from the Department of Defense and others what constraints this imposes on purchases. 
I believe the appropriate agency to develop the methodology and to perform the agency-by-agency research is the General Accounting Office. Once appropriate methodologies have been developed for making estimates of economic changes, we could ask CBO and GAO to perform further research. 
I am happy to work with the Senator from Oregon on this issue, and I will gladly join with him to request the GAO to perform the needed work. I look forward to starting this research in a timely fashion and making it a part of the information we use to exercise our oversight. 
Mr. President, I ask that Senator Wyden's amendment, No. 2203, be withdrawn.

<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. Let me say we now have a starting list of about 12 amendments. When we start at 2:15, I will make sure everybody knows what they are. We are asking that we sequence them in some way so we know where we are going. Frankly, I think either we are going to have to be relieved of some time on the resolution or we are going to stay in tonight and use some time because we really have to finish this this week. 
Mr. President, let me use the remaining time that I have, with Senator Murray having half of the 5 minutes, to debate her amendment prior to the vote. 
First, let me say I understand the sincerity and the genuine concern that the distinguished Senator who proposes this amendment has expressed here on the floor, and that she genuinely and generally expresses with reference to education. But I think it is very interesting; we all want to educate our children, but it seems that we are having a little trouble with math, mathematics, adding and subtracting, right here on the floor of the Senate. 
I have read and reread the amendment of the distinguished Senator, and I cannot find any way that it truly means anything with reference to classroom size. A reserve fund is set up and there is nothing in it, zero. There are no dollars, there are no taxes, there are no statements that we should cut certain programs. As a matter of fact, this amendment says at sometime in the future we sure hope Congress will find a way to cut spending someplace, perhaps cut a mandatory program, that is an entitlement, someplace; or perhaps increase taxes sometime. Then it says: Put those in this reserve fund, this box, and we will spend it for reducing classroom sizes. 
That is very interesting. If somebody thinks he or she is going to tell the American people that Senators who vote against this measure voted against a reduction in classroom size, then just take it from me, we will put an ad right up under that that says, `The program had no money in it, no way to pay for it, did not have enough courage to say what program you would cut or 
which taxes you would raise. It just said, I am for--and I want--and I hope--and I wish--and it would be great if we have--a reserve fund someday, if we use it for classroom size reduction.' 
That is essentially the amendment. It is out of order under the Budget Act and under the processes, and we will raise that point. The vote will be on whether or not it is out of order, for I assume the distinguished Senator will move to waive it. But I cannot find it. 
Normally, you set up a reserve fund and you say, We are going to put taxes in this reserve fund or receipts from someplace, or we say, We are going to cut certain entitlement programs and use that money for some program, project or activity. What has happened here is the following: No one yet on that side of the aisle who wants to spend more money than required in this budget resolution has found a way to cut any program to pay for it--not yet. I have been looking. There are already a series that I have looked at. None cut any program to pay for a higher priority program. 
Second, none say, even though we insist on keeping a balanced budget, and they do also, these amendments--they don't want to break that balanced budget era we have--nonetheless, the amendments go right back to the era when we had programs for which we did not know how to pay. I defy anyone to tell me how we are going to pay for this program if we ever did it. 
Frankly, that is a statement of where we are. The same is going to be true for the amendment of my good friend, Senator Dodd, on child care. They found a way to set up a reserve fund with nothing in it and they say, `When something happens, then we will pay for this wonderful program for the American people.' I use that word in its fairest sense. Some people think these programs ought to be paid for by the Federal Government. I do not. 
I just want you to look at one chart. Everybody can look at it here. The business of classroom size in the United States is the business of the sovereign States of America, and they know there is a problem. Mr. President, they are spending more and more money in the school districts across America to reduce class size than on almost anything else they are doing, and they are doing a wonderful job of it. This simple chart up here says from 1960 to 1996 classroom sizes have been reduced 51 percent, from 25.8 to 17.6. That is the green line. That is because the red line shows how many more teachers have been added. Not because we are paying for them at the national level, but because our States are paying for them and the school boards are paying for them. In New York, where the cities pay for it, they are paying for it. 
Now we are going to come along in an amendment and try to tell the American people if you don't vote for this, you are against education, which amendment has no way of paying for the teachers. These States cannot do that. You know that green line did not come about because somebody set up a reserve fund and said if we ever find that we raise taxes, we can put the taxes in that reserve fund--`if'--or we can cut some other program and put that in there--`if.' You know that green line would not have come down one bit if that is what States said. That is what we are saying here today. 
The truth of the matter is the teacher ratio is coming down and it is coming down dramatically. Frankly, I am not very 
impressed with Senator after Senator from whatever side of the aisle coming down here and essentially saying, `Education is not going well in America and we know how to fix it up here in Washington. What we ought to do is have a new program, a new mandate.' But this one is even worse than that, because it suggests we ought to do that, and there is no money to do it, which is a very interesting phenomenon--if you can help education without putting any money into a program but saying you wish it would happen. 
The truth of the matter is that the National Center for Educational Statistics, commonly known as NCES, projects that trend is going to continue and, I might say, continue without anybody ever having thought the Federal Government would start paying for reducing classroom size. They estimate, in their publication, that by the year 2006 there will be as many as 3 million K-12 public school teachers, an additional 16 percent over the 1996 number. This same organization, highly renowned, says that the pupil-teacher ratios will continue to decline and they will continue to drop as low as 15.4 in the year 2006, an 11 percent decrease from 1996. And, Mr. President and fellow Senators, let me repeat: They did not expect that the Federal Government would get involved in telling these schools how they can reduce class size. 
Let me also suggest this is an interesting reserve fund in another way, because it proposes to fund a program that is unknown. The President suggests that there be this program. And, incidentally, for those who wondered how he paid for it--for he paid for it--he paid for it out of the cigarette tax, the settlement. But the budget office said you can't do that, because in doing that you break the budget. But he did plan to pay for it. Let me suggest that NCES projects these without ever contemplating that the United States of America would get involved in paying for pupil-teacher ratio reductions. 
Where is the program? The White House has not sent up their program, but let me tell you there is a formula about. For Senators who might think this amendment is determinative of something--I don't believe it is determinative of anything, but let's assume you really think it might be--then I suggest you might not like the proposal if it was to be carried out, because, since 20 States have invested additional funds in targeted efforts to reduce class size, that means that under the formula they are not even given credit for that. They are penalized, for more money goes to States that have not done that. You know if we get a bill, if ever--and I don't think it will ever happen that we get a bill on the floor of the Senate that attempts to get the U.S. Government into determining class sizes--you know that the formula is not going to work. But there is no bill, no substance. Nobody has written the flesh on the bones that will tell us what kind of program this is. 
Senator Murray does not know how much or how it is paid for. The President's plan actually estimates $12 billion over 7 years --$12 billion. If that is the plan, I wonder why the sponsors --and there are more than one--don't look through the budget and find $12 billion to spend. I wonder why they don't say maybe we are going to increase taxes to pay for it. Is the era of balanced budgets gone? Are we going to come up with a program we don't know how to pay for and try to let somebody think it is a real, vital, operative set of words called a `reserve fund' that will get anything done about classroom size? 
Frankly, I am very grateful that to this point in our history we have not asked the Federal Government to do this kind of thing. I am very grateful because, as a matter of fact, everything they get into of this type ends up with more bureaucracy, more redtape, more mandates on the States than do most programs that truly produce beneficial results. 
But I am also thankful we are not in it because the States and school districts see the problem. They do not come up to the floor of the Senate when the problem is getting solved. They start solving it. They didn't start solving this problem when we were already down to about 16.8, they started solving it when it was 25. So it is obvious to me that there is a reason for this amendment being subject to a point of order. That point of order should be sustained. 
I am not going to second-degree amendments which should fall by a point of order, because I believe that is what we should do to them: One by one, every one that is subject to that, like this one is, we ought to quickly not waive the budget process and not waive the rules of the Senate and say the program just doesn't fit. Having said that, I will have 2 1/2 minutes later. Let me conclude. 
Mr. President, I do want to say to the distinguished Senator, Senator Murray, I, too, was a schoolteacher--not with the great prowess and experience that she had, but I taught one of those subjects we are all worried about, mathematics. I taught that. I didn't take political science; I took chemistry and math. I don't know how that prepared me to be a Senator, but I did teach algebra and arithmetic. Frankly, it is hard work. Frankly, believe it or not, I believe I taught every single child in my class who knew how to add and subtract--I believe I taught them algebra. 
Frankly--God forbid--I have to tell you, I had 44 students in each class. I am not suggesting we do that. I am delighted to see this green line. In fact, for some of our children--and our States are on to this, too--with great disabilities, we are going to have to do better than this. And they are, they are. They are doing better than this. 
Let me just close by suggesting that if this program which is encapsulated in these reserve language words is as important as my good friend contends, then it would seem to me we ought to find some other program in the U.S. Government's litany of programs--which is still around 2,600 and growing--we ought to find some programs we could terminate or cut to pay for it. As a matter of fact, the entitlement programs of America, while somewhat under control, are a burgeoning part of the American budget. Essentially, if you want a real reserve fund, you ought to be able to find something in this enormous number of billions of dollars of entitlement programs that is a little less important than the program the distinguished Senator says is so important. 
Frankly, I do not in any way contend that we know that classroom size is the answer to every issue. I don't want to get into a debate on that. We will just accept the Senator's language and words about how important it is. But there is a growing dispute, nonetheless, between competent schools of academics and education, as to whether the current problem in the American schools is as much related to classroom size as one of the other groups says. There is one group of experts who say it is not as important as some other things. 
The reason I say that is because that is exactly the kind of thing we should not be resolving up here. It is right at the State legislatures, it is right in the offices of superintendents and boards of education, and it is not right in Washington with another Washington-based program. 
I see that the time for recessing has arrived. I will be asking Senators to concur with me that this amendment should fall because it is subject to a point of order under our rules, and in this case the rules make great sense, for to vote on a program like this as if it did something, as if there was real money in it, as if there was a way to find real money--our processes are pretty good when they say that kind of amendment, for whatever reason, is subject to a point of order in the Senate. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with regret that I, once again, tell the Senate that this is an empty amendment--empty. It states a wish, a hope, and maybe a prayer, and it couches it in language that says we are setting up a reserve. 
Reserves normally have something in them. This reserve says maybe at some point in time we will have something to put in this reserve. Maybe we will raise taxes and put the raised taxes in this reserve. Maybe we will cut a mandatory program, take away from some entitlement program and put it in there. Otherwise, it is an empty amendment. To have an empty amendment on a budget resolution ought to violate some rule, and, as a matter of fact, it does. This is subject to a point of order. 
I think from time to time we wonder whether points of order really contribute substantively to an argument. This one does. For anybody who thinks this amendment proposes anything real for the classrooms of America--if one wanted to have the Federal Government involved in a program and if one knew what the program was--the truth of the matter is that this is empty and, therefore, is subject to a point of order. 
Mr. President, I yield back any time that I have remaining. The pending amendment is not germane to the provisions of the budget resolution pursuant to section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act. I raise a point of order against the pending amendment.  
Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.

Mr. DOMENICI. I do not need time in opposition for another 5 or 6 minutes, if he wants to speak some more. He is eloquent on the subject. Even though his amendment is quite deficient, he is spectacular in terms of his presentation. 
Let me just ask a question. 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>105-domenici-nm-8-19980331</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. You said even if you wanted to present a child care proposal, you would be precluded from doing that unless there were something in this budget resolution that allowed it. I don't believe the Senator meant that. For, let me tell you, this budget resolution does nothing to the right of anyone to bring up a bill with a new entitlement, which is what you are contemplating, so long as it is paid for. You would have to provide tax increases or entitlement restraint. And you can offer all the child care add-on mandatories you would like; they may not pass, but they would not be subject to a point of order. The budget processes are complicated and in some cases arcane, but there is a simple one: You pay for entitlements with entitlement cuts or tax increases. So you could do that. 
I am not suggesting that is the best way, or the only way, but I believe you said you could not, and I just wanted to make sure that, at least from my standpoint, you either--if you meant what you said, you at least take into consideration what I have said--or perhaps you could suggest that I am in some way in error?

Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct. But I didn't raise that point. I answered a statement you made that you would be precluded from offering it under this budget resolution. All I said is, anybody can offer a spending bill, an entitlement, mandatory spending bill. It will not be subject to a budget point of order if it is paid for, and the `paid for' is either cutting other similar programs or tax increases that you use for it. 
You raise a different question. You raise the question now, which I did not think was in your reserve fund, because the reserve fund is set up for all of the tobacco settlement receipts. If you want to take something out of that, then, like others, you might want to amend that. If you try to amend that, we suggest that money should go to Medicare. So that will be the battle, and we will have that out. There will be a number of amendments which handle it that way. 
Let me just also suggest that you mentioned appropriated accounts. I don't want to get this to be a mumbo-jumbo `budgetese' discussion here, but your amendment is not one that has anything to do with discretionary programs. It creates an entitlement program. So the discretionary caps which we are all--excepting maybe three Senators or four--coming down here saying we want to keep--and I don't know where you stand on that, whether you want to break them or not--you break those by spending discretionary money. You don't break them by creating a new mandatory program, a new entitlement. Although nobody thought we would be creating new entitlement programs once we got the budget balanced; most people thought we would not do that anymore because we want to keep it balanced. But if you want to do it some more, you have to pay for them in the ways I have described.

Mr. DOMENICI. Clearly, Senator Dodd has perceived my position correctly. I will make a point of order with reference to his amendment. It clearly is subject to a point of order, and then I presume he would like to vote on a waiver. That is probably what the vote is going to be when it comes to the amendment of Senator Dodd, because we have waived no points of order as we have gone through this process. 
Mr. President, I say to Senator Dodd, while I believe I am entitled to the rest of the time, of course, in the interest of half the time to each side, if the Senator from Connecticut needs some time, he can call on me and I will relinquish some of my time. 
I will discuss various reserve funds shortly, but I would like very much to talk about this amendment which, in essence, as to its substantive effect, is very, very similar to the Murray amendment which was denied germaneness by the Senate in the last vote, and it fell. With regard to what it attempts to do, it is a different subject matter but the same kind of process. 
There is a little-used process called a reserve fund. There is nothing wrong with trying to expand. We will get a proliferation of reserve fund attempts this year. It is interesting, and perhaps, Mr. President, you would be interested in why there will be a proliferation of reserve funds. 
First of all, most reserve funds create a new spending program, and almost all reserve funds--there have been very few--when it comes to a new program, they are entitlements that are created. Essentially, reserve funds say that if you want to fund a new transportation program or Amtrak, that if, in fact, you put into that reserve fund the resources to do it, then the chairman of the Budget Committee says the budget accommodates it, and it would, obviously, be neutral, by definition; it would not increase the deficit or the expenditure. 
The problem this year is most interesting. The era of the balanced budget is bringing forth a plethora of suggestions--get this--that we increase entitlement programs, not necessarily in dollars spent on each one, but brand new ones. Isn't that interesting? At the time we finally have our budget under control, when we have spent the best part of 18 years, that I am aware of, saying, `Let's get entitlements under control'--that is, the automatic spending items; they just spend pursuant to a formula or the letter of the law, and they spend until you change the law, whereas appropriations you do every year--every year. 
The plethora of these new ones is because we found a way, believe it or not, to say you can't spend any more money on this other kind of account, the annual appropriations bills, in which these programs belong. This child care program belongs in that category called an annual appropriation. But if you put it in there, you have to do two things, and that is why there will be reserve funds, because you have to cut some domestic program to make room for it, or you break the budget, which has a dollar number in for each year. 
So now that that is firmly fixed and we have it under 
control and Wall Street and Alan Greenspan and those who make interest rates in America are saying, `The one thing you really did'--now let's follow through--`is you placed that cap, annual amount, that dollar number, that you can't exceed, you put it in each year,' now they said, `Prove it; do it.' What we do is say we don't want to provide any cuts, reductions, or eliminations, so we are coming around and creating new mandatory expenditures. 
Frankly, the problem with mandatory expenditures is, they go on almost forever, but, secondly, you frequently underestimate them. Yet, if they spend out above the estimate, they just spend out. An example is Medicaid. Medicaid was created on the floor of the Senate with an estimate of less than a billion dollars in cost. It became an entitlement. I don't remember, when we finally reformed it and made it a block grant, how many billions it was, but it was many tens of times bigger than the estimate. When we changed it, we usually changed it to spend more. 
You can see why we were so worried that if we wanted to get to an era of balanced budgets and surpluses--`Good for America,' everybody in the world said; `It is great for America that our unified budget is balanced; you have to try to keep those caps in place, and you have to try to not create any new entitlement programs.' But if you cannot spend any more on this side of the ledger, then go over to this side and say we will create a new one over here, and we will try to pay for it one way or the other so it won't increase--it won't affect the budget surplus. 
The problem with this one is very, very simple. Just like Senator Murray's reserve, it said we would like to spend more money on child care and we would like to have our programs expanded rather substantially--I don't know how many billions; it just says child care program. 
Then it says here is a reserve fund, but the reserve fund is only half filled, because it says what we want to spend the money on but it does not say where we get the money to spend. It does not say increase taxes $15 billion to pay for it. It does not say decrease entitlement programs in some way to pay for it, because what no one wants to do is, no one wants to go home and tell their constituents that in order to have a new program, `We had to raise your taxes.' They just want to say, `We are giving you a new program.' 
No one wants to go home and say, `We got you a new program, and we had to cut these other programs,' because, obviously, there will be people who like the programs that were cut, too. 
So here we are with, as I said, a number of these proposals going to be forthcoming, and they are going to sound, for all intents and purposes--and I really give Senator Dodd credit in this area. He has been a leader in bringing everybody's attention to child care needs and getting it started in one very serious way. We had a big compromise battle one time. He gave, we gave, and we actually got a bipartisan bill, the first one that was bipartisan. He deserves credit, no doubt about it. 
What we are doing now is saying we want more of those but we don't want to tell anyone what we have to do to pay for it. We just want to put it in this reserve fund, and that will happen some other time, but let everyone know the sponsors want an expanded child care program. I have no doubt that they do. It is just that the budget law says you can't do it this way. 
It is going to be subject to a point of order, and I am 
very hopeful it will fail on that. I am very hopeful that those in the country who look at this will conclude that it was not a proposal that had much of a chance to ever be carried out, because there was no money to do it. If you are going to spend $12 billion or $16 billion, keep a balanced budget--and you know how that is already planned; it is called the baseline--if you already know that, and then somebody comes along and says, `We want $16 billion more,' it is pretty obvious you have to raise taxes or you have to cut something. That is one argument for today. But I want to give you a couple others. 
First of all, according to the General Accounting Office, there are now 22 separate programs and tax expenditures which support and fund child care. The combined Federal programs provide child care services and subsidies to over 5.1 million children, or half the children under 5 with working mothers. The Federal Government, as one part of government in America, pays for 40 percent of all child care expenditures that are governmental. 
In 1997, the Federal Government spent $13.8 billion on child care programs. And I will give you the range of them: 
Dependent care tax credit, child care programs ranging from Head Start to the program I just mentioned, and a couple of others. The military has the largest single program, $302 million, 166,000 kids. 
The Federal Government spending on child care has increased $6.1 billion, for an 82-percent increase since 1990. Not too shabby. Under current law, by 2003 the Federal Government will spend almost $17 billion for child care programs and subsidies. The budget resolution would increase this spending to $20 billion and an increase of almost 20 percent. In particular, the budget resolution more than doubles the size of the child care and the child care development block grant, increasing the funds from $1 billion in 1998 to $2.2 billion by the year 2003. 
The budget resolution also assumes that tax relief of up to $9 billion could be afforded as a portion of the funds and a portion of the funds could go to tax relief to stay-at-home parents if the tax-writing committee so decides. 
All of these funds are within the $1.7 trillion budget. They are all within the $1.7 trillion. We do not increase taxes to pay for them; we do not worsen the deficit to pay for the new spending. The amendment before us is different from that, albeit, in the mind of the principal sponsor, totally justifiable. But the $1.7 trillion is not enough, and we must ask the taxpayers to give us, the Federal Government, more so that we can spend even more on child care than is assumed in this resolution. 
In short, while I am not necessarily arguing that under no circumstances should we ever put any more money in child care, I am suggesting that this year in this budget resolution we do provide some significant increases. 
Let me make one other statement and then call one precise item to the attention of the Senate. I know this sounds like a lot of money and, on the other hand, my friend Senator Dodd might say it is not enough money, but just prior to the budget markup I asked for a breakdown of all of the money being spent on what would commonly be called child care. 
Mr. President, Senator Dodd may still maintain that we need more and he may have evidence that we need more, but, obviously, there are a lot of things we need more in America, and we can't afford to pay for them all. The Senator from Connecticut voted many times not to pay for something because we didn't have enough money. 
I went through and looked at the total amount of money that we will spend under this 5-year budget, under the discretionary part of this budget--that is, the annual appropriations for child care of various types, special education for infants and toddlers, development block grant, head Start--we will spend $31 billion in just that one category over these 5 years. 
Then I looked and said, what about mandatory programs, those that you do not have to appropriate each year? I found a child care development fund, which is a perpetual fund, not one that you feel you must vote on each year, a child care feeding program, social service block grant, and I found that $23 billion is spent over the next 5 years for that. 
Then I looked on the tax side to see how we were doing, and I found that dependent-care tax credit, $15 billion for 5 years; employer-provided child care exclusion, $22.3 billion; dependent-care assistance program, $800 million. Now if you add them all up, it is $76.8 billion that goes out of the Federal Treasury in this area helping little children with developmental funds, feeding programs and child care. This number is without the add-ons. This is if we started off the budget process and said we are going to make no reductions and no increases; that is it. 
I want to raise one other program with you, I say to Senator Dodd. Maybe you are unaware of it. Maybe you and others, if you are made aware of it, might say we should do something about this. But I think you recall--you probably were part of it--when we did the welfare reform, we put $1.7 billion in there for child care. 
Remember the package. We said, let us help with child care, let us help with training; and all that went into welfare. I understand that 55 percent--just a moment. CBO estimates, and this is a current estimate, that States will use only 80 percent of the available funding in 1999. States have obligated all funds, but if they do not obligate, they lose any rights to the funds. So they are not going to be able to draw down all the money. Frankly, I think we ought to try to do something about that. That has already been provided for. I do not know what we can do about it.

Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, let me tell you, we are both right. It is just that those numbers of what HHS is telling you about are the moneys that the Treasury of the United States has turned over to be spent. But now we have to have the States literally draw them down. The Congressional Budget Office is saying that they estimate that the States will draw down and use only 80 percent, and there is a chance they will lose some money, according to what my staff says. So maybe we can work on something there saying that they are extending something so they will not lose it. That might be one thing we could work on. 
Now, Mr. President, let me ask my friend, Senator Dodd, if he needs another 5 minutes or so.

<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. I will give you each 1 minute on mine. I will try to go quicker than that. 
The argument has now reached the point where everybody can understand it. Although the amendment which the Senator offered does not address the reserve funds set up with the tobacco settlement money, he has clearly stated his case. He would like to be able to spend some of the tobacco settlement on his ideas on child care. 
Even if his amendment passed, he could not do that. But let me just tell you what this means. This means that the Senator from Connecticut wants to spend tobacco settlement money on child care where the Budget Committee wants to spend it on Medicare. Medicare spends $25 billion a year and thus it is in default and will be bankrupt in 10 years because of cigarette smoking which causes illness and cancer in the seniors covered. 
The Budget Committee said the best place to use the money is to put it in the Medicare fund so we do not let the program go bankrupt. I continue to say that is the best place and the highest priority. 
Today is another good example. No matter what the Government of America is doing, we must do more. Whatever we are doing in child care, we must do more. Whatever we are doing in some other area, it is not enough. Now we have heard that for a long time, but I believe we are passed that stage. I think we are in an era of balanced budgets and surpluses. You will not stay there very long if you return to the day that whatever the Government is spending, it is not spending enough, let us have a new program.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say this in all sincerity, because the votes were very long. One was in excess of a half hour, and quorum calls before the votes don't count and the vote time doesn't count. We have not even used 5 1/2 hours today from starting at 9:30 this morning. We still have 29 hours remaining at this point, and we have essentially 2 days, Wednesday and Thursday, to get it done. That is going to be very difficult. 
I am going to stay here, and we are not going to close the Senate. We would like Senators to come down and offer amendments. 
I propose the following so there will be a sequence: First 
of all, there will be no votes until 12 noon tomorrow, and then there should be three votes. While this is not a unanimous consent request--it will be proposed later--let me say those votes will be on or in relation to the Kyl amendment, on or in relation to the Conrad amendment, and on or in relation to the Coverdell-McCain amendment. We are expecting to debate at least, if not more, Senator Conrad's amendment and the Coverdell, McCain, et al. amendment. We are trying to get Senator Conrad, and I hope Senator Coverdell is on notice we will be ready soon after that. With that, I yield to my friend from New Jersey.

<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me start by saying that the Senator that has proposed this amendment, in my opinion, even though we may not have agreed on a number of things, as I have watched things evolve on matters pertaining to fiscal policy, has grown tremendously in his understanding and his forthrightness and his ability to articulate the fiscal condition of this country. 
I want to acknowledge right up front that there are some who worry about this budget resolution, but there are some who worry about 10 years from now. And, frankly, we have an awful lot of new sources of information and new sources of estimating that have become very, very reliable so that as adult leaders of our country we ought to be able to look at a budget 10 years from now and 15 years from now in terms of some big big-ticket items and be able to honestly and forthrightly indicate where we are. 
I just say to him, he has done a very good job in that respect, and I thank him for that. Like I say, I do not necessarily, when he gets up and makes his frequent speeches about how wonderful America has become since the Democrats voted in a budget, I join him in attributing to that the great success of the American economy. But I do acknowledge that he has a perfectly valid opportunity to so allege to the world. I have not yet really found enough time to really talk with the American people about how that is impossible in terms of having been the primary reason for America's sustained economic recovery. I am not going to do that tonight either, but in a sense--in a sense--I am going to talk about something that I believe my good friend, the proponent of the amendment that is before us, has stated as well as I will or better time and again in the Budget Committee and in the Committee of Finance. 
That is what this chart before us, in back of me, shows to all of us--a very, very simple chart. You see that red line, and you see 2021. That red line is the Medicare hospitalization trust fund balances at the end of each year. 
Now, you see, anything close to that zero line means that the balances are pretty close--the outgo and the intake. But look what happens to that red line out there in the future, but not so far in the future that people like Kent Conrad would not stand up and say, with Pete Domenici, for all the accolades we 
 are giving ourselves about how great we have done on fixing the fiscal policy of our Nation, if we sit back and do not fix that, where that red line can, in a year or so when we have reformed this program, start to move up and parallel the line that is at about zero, we have failed the American people in a most serious way. 
Because of that we could put one up here on Social Security. We could argue about their trust fund. And, frankly, that is a very, very exciting argument for 2 or 3 hours, if we want to do it. But essentially, in terms of the impact on America, if we do not fix something, the impact is apt to be more severe if we do not fix this than if we do not fix Social Security. 
Both are serious. Both are predictable. We understand all the reasons for what is happening. And we can choose, as we have in the past when we did not know any better, we could wait 10 years. We could all be running around saying how wonderful everything is. Probably 25 years ago nobody could run around after us as we campaigned and say, `You're not facing up to the facts.' But I tell you, they can now, because we know that red line is a pretty accurate presentation of the most serious fiscal and social problem that this country has--bar none. 
Now, having said that, the budget I chose to present, after much consultation with the Budget Committee, which was adopted by the Senators on that committee, I regret, on a party-line basis--but I actually believe the total reason for that party-line vote had to do with this issue that is before us, because I do not believe that every Democrat who voted against the Domenici mark voted against it because they want to spend a lot more money on new programs. 
As a matter of fact, if this tobacco settlement, as fragile and as amorphous as it is, had not come along--and it was not available either to the President in his budget or to us in our markup--there would have been little to argue over, because we do not have any money to spend unless we want to break the agreement and knock those caps on discretionary spending off of their pillars and say, `We just made a deal, but we're going to break it.' I do not believe that would have happened. And I do not think Senator Conrad, who is here with an amendment tonight on the tobacco settlement--I do not think he would have joined in saying, `We've got to invent some new programs and spend some new money and break those caps.' 
Essentially, we got off on the wrong foot, because the President of the United States gave a speech called a State of the Union Address, and, in his normal manner, he was eloquent. The problem was, nobody had an opportunity to check his budget. So America got excited about an era of balanced budgets where all of a sudden we could spend a lot of money that we did not spend the year before. And it was interesting. Some of us listened and said, what's happening? I mean, we have a literal freeze on all the programs the President is talking about--more education money, classroom sizes, interest reduction so you can build more classrooms, child care--you know, on and on--oh, more health programs for children who are smoking, and a huge advertising campaign for that. 
And I was thinking, `Man, all of those belong over here on that side of the ledger where already we've agreed we can't spend any more money.' The President said, `Well, we'll spend it out of the tobacco settlement' that may never occur. If it 
 occurs, it might be very different than he assumed. And lo and behold, the Congressional Budget Office told us, he cannot spend it the way he says without breaking the Budget Act of the United States and breaking the caps by $68 billion over 5 years. 
That is where we found ourselves, with everybody getting excited that we could have some new programs, we could preserve the surpluses, right--which my friend from Colorado is going to speak to in a minute--and we could spend on at least six new programs that pop in my head, and a whole bunch of add-ons, we could spend $124 billion over 5 years on things we were not paying for last year. 
Mr. President, that sounded like a fairy land, that we would have tombs and beautiful songs and we could dream and say, `Boy, isn't that just fantastic?' Sort of like Alice in Wonderland. But we soon found out it was all predicated upon a tobacco settlement that the tobacco companies agreed to with the attorneys general. And we had no more idea up here how that was going to get resolved than the Man in the Moon. 
And I regret to say, while I think we ought to try to settle that dispute--I am not averse to raising cigarette taxes--we are still not very close, when you look at the House and the Senate, to coming up with a way to do that which has enough votes to do what Howard Baker used to say, `Whatever the rules and procedures are, don't worry about it if you've got enough votes.' Nobody has enough votes yet. But I believe there are enough votes for this budget resolution, because it does the right thing. This Republican budget--which I wish some Democrats would vote for--says: Don't spend the surplus in the regular budget of the United States on anything but Social Security, or, as we put it, `Social Security reform.' 
My friend from Colorado has another suggestion--it is intriguing, and I hope everybody looks at it--as to the surplus. But we said that. And the President said it a little differently than us. But essentially, for the year 1999, don't touch it. For those who might think it is very big, let me remind you, `Don't touch it '99' means don't touch $8 billion worth of surplus, I say to my friend in the Chair, not $30 billion, not $60 billion, not $100 billion--$8 billion. 
So this euphoria about, `We've got to protect that, we can't spend it,' with others saying, `Let's cut taxes'--it is $8 billion. So we said two big goals: Save Social Security--and I might add, under our budget resolution that is before us, we literally use the word `reform,' so that we do not just contemplate putting the surplus into the Social Security trust fund; we contemplate having it available for those who will reform and rewrite Social Security to use, if they need it, to make that program one that is far better for America's retired people in the future and which has a chance of making the fund itself more solvent. 
The second thing we said was once the next program that the American U.S. Government has a responsibility to pay for--not a State issue, not a city issue, one of ours--and lo and behold, we find the American U.S. problem is that one, Medicare. Medicare. We found the second big problem is that, one, that huge red line on the chart going down. It almost moves in a direction like when you are a young kid and you wondered where hell was--that is sort of looking like it is going down to hell, down into the depths of the Earth, in the red, going broke. 
We said, what do we do about that? There is nothing more important than doing what we can to start fixing that. We said whatever the Federal Government keeps from the settlement--if it ever happens, and we assume the President's number, but we said whatever it is and whenever it happens--put the Government share in that fund. 
What we are going to do with the amendment of my friend, whom I have just spoken to, is to say we are not going to put all the money in that hospital insurance fund for seniors that is going bankrupt; we are going to spend it on some other things. Frankly, I believe for a budget, a blueprint, that is a mistake. It will be subject to a point of order, and I will make it. It is not with any reluctance that I make it, because I think what we have planned in the budget before the Senate is better for our country, so long as we have no agreed-upon plan to do otherwise. I remind the Senators, and the occupant of the Chair was working hard and very knowledgeable about the tobacco settlement, we don't have a plan. We have a lot of people talking about a lot of things, and a lot of wonderful things we ought to buy, but we don't have a plan that has broad-based bipartisan support. I believe unless and until that happens, the money ought to go where this budget says--every nickel should go in Medicare. 
Now, I am amazed--and I want to allude back and forth to other proposals--that the President of the United States in his State of the Union Address, and in his budget which followed, which not even the Democrats have used in budget debates, that budget that he told the American people about, that he sent us, I am amazed in that budget there was $124 billion in new expenditures from this, that, and the other, but a huge amount of it from the tobacco settlement and not a penny for the second worst problem that America has. Not a penny. 
Not so with the budget that is before the Senate. The reverse. Not a penny for any other new program but all the money for that one. 
Now, from this Senator's standpoint, I did not set about to ignore what many people said we ought to pay for if we get the tobacco settlement. Fellow Senators, I want you to know if there is never a settlement of the cigarette controversy, if it is never settled and never resolved, the budget before the Senate, because we chose to prioritize, to put first things first, has the largest increase for the National Institutes of Health over the next 5 years for research related to the effects of cigarette smoking that we have ever put together in the history of our biological and chemical research programs of America, the largest. On average, 11 percent a year. We are not waiting for a cigarette settlement to pay for that. 
When you vote for the budget before the Senate that I put together--and I hope it is not just Republicans--we will 
have dramatically increased the National Institutes of Health because we chose to look at the President's cuts, and he had many. And we said, amen. But we want to spend it where we think we should spend it and we put it in NIH. This afternoon we argued about child care, and we put it there, too. We put $5 billion there in a new block grant to add to what we are doing, and we don't have to wait for the tobacco settlement to do it. 
A number of other items, such as an advertising campaign to address the issue of trying, with advertising, to mellow the effect of cigarette advertising on young people. We don't have to wait around for the cigarette settlement. We have funded that to the tune of $825 million. 
Now, frankly, we will never have enough for some. There are some who would think we should spend $2 billion a year on children's programs and on health programs for children out of this settlement. Mr. President, what is intriguing about it all is that in order to get that done, most amendments around here, and the amendment that is presently before the Senate, attempt to solve these problems by creating new mandatory permanent programs for ideas that are being implemented about which we have little certainty they will succeed. If anything, they ought to be annually appropriated so we can look at them each year. Mr. President, you understand that can't be done without breaking the budget agreement because we don't have any more room in our budget for that kind of expenditure. So this amendment and others spend it in a new entitlement program for kids' advertising or for tobacco research or whatever the five or six programs are that are there. 
Now, $825 million over 5 years for various antiteen smoking and public health initiatives--I have heard from some of my colleagues we have not put enough resources into these antismoking initiatives, without a settlement. I have even heard that we need to spend, maybe, and I repeat, `multiple billions of dollars, perhaps even as much as $2 billion a year,' on such a campaign. Frankly, fellow Senators, I find those proposals hard to believe. First, the President's budget identified $400 million over the next 5 years for antismoking initiatives at the Federal level through the Centers for Disease Control. 
Let me quote from the HHS 1999 budget press release. This was when the President was still living off the budget that turned out not to be doable because it violated the budget but they had money to spend. It said, `We will expand our support for State and community programs from $34 million in 1998 to $51 million in 1999,' a 50 percent increase. `The Centers for Disease Control,' the quote continues, in their public relations submission, `will now fund all States and the District of Columbia to implement innovative tobacco prevention programs as a core component of the public health.' We fund that much and more without waiting around for the tobacco settlement. Now, it more than doubles the funds identified in the President's budget for this initiative. 
Let me also point out that we have some history with public campaigns aimed at youth. According to this administration, we have increased our efforts to prevent and treat drug use from $4.1 billion in 1992 to $5.4 billion in 1998. Much of that funding was aimed at young Americans. Nonetheless, teenage drug use has increased from 15 percent in 1992 to 22.2 percent in 1995, the last year we have evidence, and everyone here knows it 
 is higher now than 1995, and the campaign continues to spend money, to affect their lives on drugs, with advertising and other programs. 
I only say that not because I do not think we should continue trying, but I firmly believe it would be wrong to put huge amounts of money in an entitlement program in this area and just say for the next 5 to 10 years, that is where it goes. So, wherever I look and however I think about this, I say to those committees and those assigned by our leadership to try to work a tobacco settlement--good luck. I also say, if you put it together and you can find 60 votes, you will pass your program in the Senate. And if you do, who knows? I may be one of the 60. I haven't said I would not, but I believe since we are not anywhere close to that and we have no consensus on that, that we ought to do what is the most prudent thing. 
I have failed to discuss and I have failed to put up the chart that clearly depicts what is happening to Medicare spending on tobacco-related illnesses. It is there now. It is simple and frightening. 
The hospital insurance trust fund for the seniors of America has been made stable for about another 10 years. But we didn't really reform the program; we reformed the payment plan. It will, once again, as that red line on the previous chart, it will start to go down again, and when the baby boomers hit entitlement age, it will go broke. But look at that, one of the reasons it has gone broke is we never could have estimated the costs that program would bear on its shoulders from tobacco-related illnesses of senior citizens. And there it is, $25.5 billion, 14 percent of total Medicare spending, in 1995. Mr. President, 1995 is the best we can do. Say it got better. I don't believe so. In fact, I am prepared to speculate with a bit of intuition that I think is right that it is higher now, not lower. 
So I submit the budget that is before us is better for America and has a better chance of solving our serious problems than a budget with the amendment before the Senate added to it, because I do not believe there is a better way to spend that money than on the program that is going bankrupt and is so necessary and was so infringed upon by smoking costs that we cannot ignore the reality of the relationship between the smoking and the bankruptcy of the hospital insurance program. 
Now, this does not mean, Mr. President, that the Senator from New Mexico thinks the distinguished Senator, whom I have spoken of this evening with great affection and as honestly and positively as I have spoken about a Democrat Senator since I have been here-- 
 perhaps my friend Sam Nunn has had me do that once before, and perhaps my friend, the ranking member, has had me do that before. But in any event, that is not to say that this is a wild idea. It is just that I believe if you have the facts before you and you don't know how the tobacco is going to come out at all, we have no idea--and there are all kinds of things people want to spend it on, right? We could add to this list here, in the next 48 hours, another six or seven things, and we might, I say to my friend from Colorado. If this amendment fails, we are going to see more. They won't all try to do the same things. They will have other things we ought to do and pay for it out of this fund. 
So the best I can do is to say that I believe the best budget we can do is to save the surplus for reform and solvency of Social Security, save the Government's share of the cigarette tax to save Medicare, increase the National Institutes of Health, put some additional money in child care, add about $9 billion to education. A whole bunch of amendments are going to say we didn't do enough about education. I just want to say to everybody that we will take those one at a time, one at a time. But we put everything in this budget on education that the bipartisan administration budget agreement contemplated for the year 1999. There is an $8 billion-plus increase year after year on education, which is exactly what we contemplated. It is there. When the appropriators finally do it--we don't know what they are going to do, but we suggested some things that were very interesting. We don't wait around for the settlement of the tobacco issue for those educational add-ons. The President did. We don't. We put $2.5 billion in IDEA or disability education to try to move forward in our commitment to pay our share. It is embarrassing that we have mandated that disabled young people be educated in a certain way from here down to our school districts and we are supposed to pay 40 percent of the tab. Senator, if you are not embarrassed that your schools have never seen the Government put up more than 9 percent of that program, I am. We are going to start putting more in there, and do you know what. They are going to be relieved of expenditures and be able to hire new teachers, as they see fit, and do the other things they may need. We will live up to our responsibilities. They will have money left over to do theirs. That is in our budget. 
Yet, whatever you do, it isn't enough. Tomorrow, we will speak about building classrooms. Let me suggest, for those who want to build classrooms and think the President is for it, you will have a surprise tomorrow. Two budgets ago, the President said in his Department of Education that it is no business of the Federal Government to build schools in the school districts of America. He said it even better than that. And then he canceled the $100 million worth of programs to build schools. All of a sudden, it's the greatest program ever and we better do it from up here, even though we have never done that in any big way as part of American Government's help to our schools. We will debate that. Some will say we should pay part of that out of the cigarette settlement. Can you imagine. If you are talking about things related to cigarette smoking, isn't that one more related? Isn't that fund more bankrupt than any other fund around and any other obligation? So, Mr. President, when the time comes after tomorrow--we have a few more minutes, and I hope some people listened tonight--we will vote. The point of order will be the issue. I have no doubt that significant 
numbers of Senators will vote with my friend. I have nothing but praise for him, and if they do that, that is OK. But I don't believe there are going to be enough votes to get around the point of order. We will be back to where we started, which we think is a very good place to be. That is, we are going to spend the money, if we ever get the tobacco settlement, to pay for making that Medicare Program solvent. 
Mr. President, make no bones about it; we have appointed a national commission. It is bipartisan. I have already seen them on C-SPAN, and they disagreed violently. I don't know if the chairman is going to be able to ever get them together. We were all wondering who ought to be chairman and we said, `Senator Breaux, you ought to be.' I like him very much. He is a Democrat. Frankly, the more I look at the different views, I am glad that he is there because, frankly, it is going to be hard to put them together. If we have a few tens of billions of dollars to help them get this reform put together, it will be one of the best things we have ever done. It may just be the ointment, along with reforms, that will glue it together. And, conversely, if we throw it away on programs that we are not sure will work, we will be real sorry if they can't put together a Medicare reform package because we spent the money that might have helped them do it. 
With that, I don't know how much time remains, but from my standpoint, I yield the floor on this. I will shortly be prepared to move with the distinguished Senator from Colorado.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me just say, when we were attempting to come up with a constitutional amendment that would work with reference to a balanced budget, Senator Craig was the leader, and we all worked with him in an effort to get an amendment which controlled spending through controlling the amount of debt that could be issued. And, frankly, that was a lot better approach than many before it because it was actually doable, it was achievable, and it was understandable. 
And it controlled spending in the right way, because essentially spending is one thing, but spending when you do not have the money is another thing. And we have such a powerful country that we can borrow and borrow and borrow. It is just in recent years that we have finally got a hold of our senses and have taken such a lead in the world, the industrial world where we have competition and capitalism and free enterprise. We have taken such a lead of late because we are getting our debt under control. 
I think it is fair to say we are also getting our entitlement programs under control. We have never before, before the last decade, been so concerned--and rightly so--about entitlement programs as part of the package of expenditures that make up our budget for which we either pay or, if we do not have enough tax receipts, for which we borrow. And while I am not certain that I will support the amendment exactly as it is--I have not made up my mind--I do think it is welcome here on the floor, because we 
have been talking about a lot of new entitlements in an era where we are proud of balanced budgets and an era of surpluses. 
While they are not totally inconsistent--to be talking about an era of surpluses and balanced budgets for many, many decades--it is obvious that the biggest danger is new entitlement programs. And since we cannot increase discretionary programs, as the Senator well knows, because we finally found a way with the caps and the automatic sequester at the end of the year--found a way to control them, and everybody now expects us to, the next front is to increase entitlements and in some way find money to pay for them, but that will just make a much bigger, bigger budget and it will be more and more dangerous than even if you increase discretionary spending. 
If you increase discretionary spending 1 year, you don't have to the next year. But if you increase entitlements, you have to change entitlements. If your estimating is wrong, you have to have an amendment. By then, you have people who have been receiving the entitlement; right? Not so easy to change. 
So I commend you on the thrust of the amendment and the remarks tonight. I think they are welcome in the debate we have had for the last 2 years.  
Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I announce that this morning the Senate will resume consideration of S. Con. Res. 86, the budget resolution. Under a previous unanimous consent agreement, at 10 a.m. the Senate will resume consideration of the Sessions amendment, No. 2166, with 30 minutes of debate equally divided, with a vote occurring on or in relation to the amendment at approximately 10:30 a.m. Following that vote, the Senate will resume debate of the Murray amendment, No. 2165. 
During today's session of the Senate, Members can anticipate debate on a number of amendments expected to be offered to the budget resolution. Any Members wishing to offer amendments should contact the managers with their intentions. Any Members, I repeat, wishing to offer amendments should contact the managers with their intentions. 
In addition, the Senate may consider any executive or legislative business cleared for Senate action. Therefore, Members can anticipate a very busy day of floor action. As a reminder to all Senators, the first vote will occur at approximately 10:30 a.m. 
Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats, wishes a few moments on the Sessions sense-of-the-Senate resolution. He cannot be here at 10 or later, which is the time prescribed for discussion on that resolution, so I ask consent it be in order for the distinguished Senator from Indiana to discuss this sense-of-the-Senate resolution that Senator Sessions offered before 10 o'clock, as he arrives on the Senate floor. I will yield time to him off our side of the bill at that point.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, partnerships among our federal laboratories, universities, and industry provide important benefits to our nation. They help to create innovative new products and services that drive our economy and improve our quality of life. 
I have personally observed the positive impacts of well crafted partnerships. These partnerships enhance the ability of the laboratories and other contractor-operated facilities of the Department of Energy to accomplish their federal missions at the same time that the companies benefit though enhanced competitiveness from the technical resources available at these sites. 
I have also seen important successes achieved by other federal agencies and companies that utilized the resources of the national laboratories and other Department sites through contract research mechanisms. Contract research enables these sites to contribute their technical expertise in cases where the private sector can not supply a customer's needs. Partnerships and other interactions enable companies and other agencies to accomplish their own missions better, faster, and cheaper. 
I've seen spectacular examples where small businesses have been created around breakthrough technologies from the national laboratories and other contractor-operated sites of the DOE. But, at present, only the Department's Defense Programs has a specific program for small business partnerships and assistance. 
All programs of the Department have expertise that can be driving small business successes. Historically, in the United States, small businesses have often been the most innovative and the fastest to exploit new technical opportunities--all of the Department's programs should be open to the small business interactions that Defense Programs has so effectively utilized. 
I have been concerned that barriers to these partnerships and interactions continue to exist within the Department of Energy. In addition, the Department's laboratories and other sites need continuing encouragement to be fully receptive to partnership opportunities that meet both their own mission objectives and industry's goals. And finally, small business interactions should be encouraged across the Department of Energy, not only in Defense Programs. 
For these reasons, I introduce today the Department of Energy Small Business and Industry Partnership Enhancement Act of 1998. This Partnership Enhancement Act removes barriers to more effective utilization of all of the Department's contractor-operated facilities by industry, other federal agencies, and universities. The bill covers all the Department's contractor-operated facilities--national laboratories and their other sites like Kansas City, Pantex, Hanford, Savannah River, or the Nevada Test Site. 
This bill also provides important encouragement to the contractor-operated sites to increase their partnerships and other interactions with universities and companies. And finally, it creates opportunities for small businesses to benefit from the technical resources available at all of the Department's contractor-operated facilities. 
This bill amends the Atomic Energy Act, which limited the areas wherein the Department's facilities could provide contract research, not in competition with the private sector, to only those mission areas undertaken in the earliest days of the AEC. My bill recognizes that the Department's responsibilities are far broader than the original AEC, and that all parts of the Department should be available to help on a contract basis wherever capabilities are not available from private industry. 
One barrier at the Department to contract research involves charges added by the Department to the cost of work accomplished by a site. This bill requires that charges to customers for contract research at these facilities be fully recovered, and stops the addition of extra charges by the Department. The bill requires that any customer of these facilities pay only the direct charges at that facility for their contracted work, plus an overhead rate that is calculated for broad groups of customers. For example, where other federal agencies, companies, or universities do not require secure facilities or do not utilize the extensive special nuclear material capabilities of the laboratories, then the customer will be charged an overhead rate that excludes security costs and environmental legacy costs. This will ensure that each class of customers is paying for the services they actually utilize. 
The bill provides direct encouragement for expansion of partnerships and interactions with companies and universities by requiring that each facility be annually judged for success in expanding these interactions in ways that support each facility's missions. The bill requires that the external partnership and interaction program be considered in evaluating the annual contract performance at each site. 
And finally, the bill sets up a new Small Business Partnership Program in which all of the Department sites participate. This action will enable small businesses across the United States to better access and partner with any of the Department's contractor-owned facilities. A fund for such interactions up to 0.25 percent of the total site budget is available for these small business interactions. 
With these changes, Mr. President, the Department of Energy facilities will be better able to meet their critical national missions, while at the same time assisting other federal agencies, large and small businesses, and universities in better meeting their goals and missions.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I say that I understand that Senator Conrad is going to manage the bill for the Democrats. He didn't know exactly when we were going to start. We are calling now to tell his staff, which is observing that maybe he could come down. I say to the Senate, however, that we don't intend to do a great deal today on the budget. We have agreed that when we are finished with some preliminary remarks--and I don't even know how long they will be--the majority and minority have agreed that we would then, by unanimous consent, take 6 hours off the bill, which has 50 hours, as everybody knows. So we would have accomplished a reduction in the time by 6 hours. That is not an exorbitant amount. But we will wait for the Senator before we do that. In the meantime, while we are waiting, we need unanimous consent, and I will wait for his arrival.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me respond in this way. Normally what time we start Monday would be up to the distinguished Republican leader. I strongly recommend and concur with the Senator that there is no real need to start early. They are going to have plenty of time. I concur with my colleague and want to make sure everybody knows, we are not going to cut off any debate as far as debate on this resolution. As a matter of fact, what is going to happen is unless we fix the process up a little bit, we are still going to have, at the end, 10 or 15 or 20 amendments. I would like to find a way to alleviate that. 
But in the meantime, it seems to me, it would be better to start sometime after lunch. We will have somebody here representing me. I think the Senate knows I cannot be here until sometime shortly after 5. The distinguished Senator from New Jersey is not going to be available in the morning either, is he?

I want it understood that we have not agreed as to the timing of this amendment in that it has usually been a Republican has an amendment, then a Democrat.

Mr. President, I assume until the leadership decides otherwise, we will be in open session in quorum calls or other business. But if Senators want to speak to the budget resolution, I assume for a significant amount of time the floor is going to be open for them to do that. I have already indicated that I cannot stay here and manage under these circumstances, but I assume that, with the Parliamentarian, things will run pursuant to the unanimous consent agreement.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't need more than 3 minutes. Mr. President, my State borders Mexico. A year and a month ago, I was on the floor of the Senate complaining about a failure on the part of Mexico to do its job in terms of restricting drugs coming across the border. We all got into a tremendous argument with the republic of Mexico. And, as a matter of fact, it did no good whatsoever. 
So to those who have taken the time of the U.S. Senate, in very brilliant ways, with wonderful charts, and told us how badly Mexico has failed to pass the test, I just ask this: If we vote to decertify them, are they going to get better? Is there a correlation between saying they should not be certified and getting some real cooperation out of Mexico? I ask any Senator who says, `let's go ahead and decertify and say to Mexico, you are not cooperating,' to stand up and tell the Senate that if we did that, things would really get better. 
As a matter of fact, Mr. President, there is a good chance, because this process is so outrageously stupid, that if we decertify Mexico, things will get worse. All of these things people are worried about--and I see them in my State and I am worried about them, too--are just going to get worse rather than better. If you pound the Mexican economy and penalize Mexico because they haven't been cooperating, do things like take away IMF, the World Bank, and other assistance, all in the name of making Mexico cooperate, do you know what will happen? Every headline across their country will clearly state: `Los Americanos no quieren los Mexicanos,' 
`They don't like Mexicans.' That is what it will say in big headlines this thick. That is not going to result in cooperation. 
What we need to do is repeal the certification statute. It is useless. And we need to replace it with something that will measure cooperation by law enforcement people. 
Let me ask you one more time. If things are not going well between Mexico and America regarding drugs, you stand up and tell the U.S. Senate that you will vote with us to de-certify and things will get better. You stand up and say that--any Senator. Just give us a minute or two so we can get up and tell you they will get worse, and that is because this certification law is some kind of an anomaly that doesn't really fit the relationship between Mexico and America today. 
Let me close. For the Mexicans who are listening, don't think the Senator from New Mexico is excusing your lack of performance. I was the first one to jump on Mexico for not extraditing Mexican drug lords back here to be tried. 
But let me tell you, they have to do better. I don't believe they will do one bit better if we decertify. I don't believe the President ought to sign the decertification, and we ought to get on with doing something constructive, instead of destructive which will cause no good to America or Mexico. 
Thank you for the time.

Mr. DOMENICI. I waited on the floor to see if Senator Kennedy was coming back, and I am glad he is here, because I have reviewed this as best I can and I am going to support the amendment that Senator Nickles has offered. 
There is a very good argument that can be made that, in fact, this request that the administration puts forth in a two-thirds sheet of paper, may be justified. Let me suggest there is equal reason to say the administration has done a very poor job of preparing for the implementation the law has referred to with reference to access, with reference to portability, and with reference to another law that is different from that that has to do with mental parity. 
As a matter of fact, it seems to this Senator that if Senator Nickles prevails--and I don't know whether he will or not--HCFA ought to get the message that they have two very difficult statutes to enforce and they ought to get ready for enforcing them in an orderly manner, not to come up here 6 months into a year with a request that all of a sudden they found out that they may have to enforce, because of the absence of State willingness, they may have to enforce in a number of States. 
Who would ever have thought you could put together a HCFA budget charged with these two responsibilities and assume that States will all enforce them? Is there anybody who knows what goes on who would agree with that? They should have at least in their regular budget anticipated that they would have a very major enforcement requirement and responsibility. 
Now, I also want to say to those who think that maybe this is harsh on HCFA, I have not said this before, but if you want to see some action that is harsh on HCFA, look at the President's budget. The President's budget on HCFA does the following: It assumes a 
series of user fees, one of which is extremely high that one would hardly believe would ever pass, and the President assumes those user fees are going to pay for HCFA, so he doesn't put enough money in HCFA. Forget this little $6 million. He shortchanges it by many, many millions on a wish that user fees will be adopted because he has requested it. 
Now, frankly, I think they better get their act together, and they will find a very sympathetic Senator Domenici. 
My second point. I have read everything I can from this administration, and I say to my wonderful cosponsor and hard worker on mental parity that I find nothing in the written material that suggests that mental parity is an issue here, mental illness parity. They are talking about the statute that Kennedy referred to. 
Now, they can get up this morning and say, `Maybe we need some more support on the floor, so let's talk about mental illness parity also.' If that is the case, let me just ask, did they ever assume that all the States would have taken up the enforcement of mental illness parity? Of course not. They should have been prepared for it. They just prepared a budget and they will have another one in 6 months. So essentially, while I will do everything within my power to see that the letter of the law on mental illness parity is enforced, I don't think we ought to just accept from the administration, from a HCFA that is rather disorganized, to say the least, another request for $16 million. 
Now, I understand $10 million is not nearly as urgent, and probably even those who oppose Nickles can agree that the $10 million is not necessary. So perhaps I am erring on the wrong side here, but I think my judgment is to send a signal back to them, loud and clear, that the Senate will put up the money to enforce these two provisions because we voted for them very heavily. In fact, we voted almost as heavily for parity as we did for the rather famous Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. 
I am very pleased people supported my efforts and the efforts of Senator Wellstone on that. I won't take a back seat to anyone in my willingness to do anything I can to see if mental illness parity will work. I don't think this is necessary to move it down the line and see it work. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Bingaman and I are on the floor of the Senate today in a sense to report bad news to the Senate about a wonderful New Mexican. 
Late this morning, in my home city in Albuquerque, New Mexico, U.S. Representative Steve Schiff, 51 years of age, died as a result of a lingering cancer. We both felt we ought to share a few thoughts with the Senate and with our people. 
So I would just like to say to the Senate that you know when you meet different people in political life certain things stand out about them. 
Steve Schiff used to almost brag about the fact that he came from Chicago, that he was a Jewish boy from Chicago who came to New Mexico. Some would not want to talk about being from Chicago if they were representing New Mexicans, but somehow or another he kind of thought he would like to tell them that, so he told it to them so often, they never cared. He served as a district attorney and probably was the best prosecutor we have had in terms of getting his job done. 
As I was coming over, I told Senator Bingaman I was voting one day in a precinct of my home in Albuquerque and I saw two elderly women behind me checking off whom they would vote for. One said to the other, `Vote for Steve Schiff.' And the other lady, probably about 75 said, `Why?' She said, `Because he was a great district attorney and he did his job well there. He'll do it well in Washington.' That said to me that people really understand when you have a real public servant. 
In behalf of my wife Nancy and myself, I guess I want to say that we have been very lucky because we got to know Steve Schiff. We are very fortunate because we got to know a public servant who just exemplified what we would think a public servant should be. He was of the highest integrity, he had a deep and fundamental decency, and, yes, he had an acute and open mind. He was very, very bright. 
New Mexico and the rest of this Nation have lost a wonderful public servant. He was the best of political leaders. And I lost a good friend. He was of my party, but he had great bipartisan support. He was always around to listen and always gave great advice. 
Today on the Senate floor I extend, on behalf of my wife and myself, our condolences to his many close friends, to his wife and their two wonderful children, and I look forward to seeing all of them when we attend his wake. But here today in the Senate, I just want to say, `Thank you, Steve. Thanks for what you were, thanks for what you left us to understand and remember about you, and may more people try to be like Steve Schiff, a real, decent, honest public servant.' 
Thank you, Mr. President.

I do not want to mention names, except I want to mention one freshman Senator--Chuck Hagel. I say to Senator Hagel, it has been a pleasure working with you on this. And I compliment you for your leadership. 
Mr. President, fellow Senators, there will be some Senators who disagree with this statement, but I think the final test of how you ought to vote in the Senate is whether the measure before you is the right thing to do. I do not think there is any question that, looking at our country and how we might suffer, if the countries that are in trouble in Asia do not have an opportunity consistent with reasonable reforms to get their economies back as soon as possible, we are going to suffer. 
I am already suggesting that inland States, like New Mexico, are suffering immensely by way of layoffs in the computer chip business because of the slowdown in that market. 
Now, I do not know that we are smart enough to know how to fix everything that went wrong there, but the amendments and this extension will, indeed, give the international community an opportunity to see if they cannot get vital reforms and make this International Monetary Fund functional and operative as those countries in that part of the world attempt to put their banking system and their monetary policy back on sound ground. 
Ultimately, it will never cost America anything. I do not believe it is going to cost us anything but reserves behind these loans. And participatory arrangements are adequate to cover any obligation that will be forthcoming. But we need a significant reserve. This amendment will let the other countries come in with their part and we will have a significant reserve for the future. 
Mr. President, I support the pending amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill, authorizing and providing appropriations to the International Monetary Fund. 
Primarily, it is the depletion of funds at the IMF that has brought the urgency of this matter to our attention. There are two funding issues before the Congress in the supplemental request: a $3.5 billion appropriation to the IMF's emergency reserve--the New Arrangements to Borrow, and the periodic appropriation for the US quota subscription, the regular pool of money at the IMF, equal to $14.5 billion. 
The Budget Committee in February held a meeting with the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Mr. Michel Camdessus to engage us in a frank discussion about the IMF. What I learned then I hope to share with many members inclined to vote against the IMF funding today. 
I know that many Members are very suspicious of foreign aid--but let me explain today why this is not foreign aid and why the Senate should do everything possible to fund the IMF. 
First, last Thursday we received the most current economic data and it shows the effects of the ongoing Asian financial crisis. January's US trade deficit surged to $12.0 billion, its highest level since 1987. This was led by a near doubling of our deficit with Asian countries excluding Japan and China. 
This is a direct result of the Asian financial crisis--which has cut demand in Asia for U.S. exports. Because of the cheaper Asian currencies against the dollar, now Asian imports are much cheaper and much more competitive in the United States. 
Second, the Asian crisis has convinced many of our top technology companies to warn of lower profits, including IBM, Compaq, Intel, Motorola, as well as many smaller companies. 
In my state of New Mexico, the result has been announcements by Philips and Motorola that they will furlough or lay off hundreds of employees. 
Mr. President, let me explain the problem facing the IMF and why the Senate must act and act quickly. 
Presently the IMF has uncommitted resources to lend a further $10 to $15 billion to its members before its liquidity is reduced to historically low levels. 
The lowest ratio ever allowed at the IMF by its members was 33%. Historically a comfortable level was 120-140%, but after the Mexico and Russian loans, liquidity fell to 88%. Presently the liquidity ratio is 47%. To lower today's ratio to 33% would require only $10-15 billion in possible loans to countries in crisis. 
Mr. President, the 182-members of the IMF decided last year before the Asian crisis that the reserves of the IMF were too low. That was before they lent $20 billion to Korea, $10 billion to Thailand, and $5 billion to Indonesia. 
Mr. President, let me be clear about one fact--If the US chooses not to fund our share of the increase, there will be no increases from the other 181 members of the IMF. 85% of current members must increase their quotas for it to be implemented, and since the US holds over 17%, no US participation would guarantee no world participation in the increased funding. 
This would mean that any more crises in Asia or other emerging markets, could see the IMF run seriously short of cash. And that is a risk neither America nor the US Senate should take. 
While the IMF was created in 1944 originally to support global trade and economic growth by helping maintain stability in the international monetary system, as the monetary system has evolved, so has the IMF's duties. 
With the Mexican peso crisis in 1995 and the current Asian financial crisis, this new IMF has become more apparent to all of us. 
While the exact economic causes of the Mexico crisis are quite different from Asia, Mexico and Asia have one striking similarity. They represent a major structural change in international capital markets that has occurred over the past decade--the increasing capital flows into and out of emerging economies. Capital flows into emerging markets rose from $25 billion in 1986 to $235 billion in 1996. 
Given the potentially destabilizing role of investor confidence especially when directing capital flows, we must ask --what is the role for domestic government policy or the IMF in addressing instability? 
Mr. President, the Asian financial crisis has also raised an important policy question for the IMF--whether the Fund's willingness to lend in a crisis contributes to `moral hazard'--the tendency for countries or investors to behave recklessly while expecting the IMF will likely bail them out in an emergency. 
There is no consensus on what role private financiers play in such crises and how they should bear the consequences of their actions. The IMF and the US still need to figure out how to safeguard a financial system without bailing out investors who are guilty of making bad decisions. 
Mr. President, I believe most Senators can agree on one factor: the IMF is too secretive in its operations and escapes accountability and public debate. 
The bill as written by Senator Hagel would address this concern by requiring greater transparency by the IMF in its lending practices, its strategies with respect to borrowing countries, economic data collection, and its own accounting and financial information. 
Demands for greater transparency at the IMF are forthright and appropriate as we consider the supplemental request, and given the IMF's extreme secrecy, this is an important condition we should insist upon for any US dollars spent at any international organization. 
Mr. President, as more and more evidence becomes stronger on the long-term benefits of free trade, it is surely time that the IMF does more to promote it. In Senator Hagel, he specifically addresses this as a condition of the IMF funding. 
Immediately the WTO Financial Services Agreement comes to mind--what better way for many of the Asian countries to introduce needed competition to their banking industries than by signing on to the WTO Financial Services Agreement. The WTO and the IMF should be working more closely together to achieve the same goals--economic growth through free trade. 
Mr. President, while many US Senators today may debate whether or not we should even have an IMF, a time of crisis such as today in Asia is not the appropriate time for the US to effectively gut the IMF. 
Regarding the budgetary treatment of the IMF, the way we count the IMF contributions is a little unusual. Since 1967, the budget has treated contributions to the IMF as budget authority only; contributions to the IMF do not affect outlays or the budget deficit, or surplus. Only since 1980 has the Congress required an appropriation. 
Last year's Balanced Budget Agreement specifically addresses the IMF funding until fiscal year 2002 and effectively allows legislation that provides an increase in U.S. contributions to the IMF to not be required to offset the budget authority. Section 314 provides a procedure to adjust the discretionary spending caps and budget totals. 
Some in Congress have argued that the IMF is putting the US taxpayer at risk similar to the US savings and loan crisis in the 1980s. There is one stark difference: savings and loan institutions held a US government guarantee. With the IMF, there is no US guarantee in times of default. And even most economists agree that the prospects of an IMF default are negligible. No country has ever defaulted on its IMF loans, arrears on IMF loans are modest, and gold and currency reserves substantially exceed any foreseeable losses in the event of a liquidation. 
The IMF has not cost the US Treasury the loss of any federal resources over the years. 
In a democracy such as ours, the debate over replenishing the IMF's reserves is the perfect time to debate what role the IMF should play in the global capital market and its accountability to member nations. This is no different than the examination we give to our domestic programs to decide if they are still relevant in today's world. 
Mr. President, today's financial world is an uncertain one--but the IMF has been a key component to the stability the United States has enjoyed over the last few years and also a key proponent of many US economic policies around the world. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, my amendment does not increase the cost of the emergency supplemental in any way. 
What it does is it freezes in place the current posture of civilian personnel authorizations at all Army Test Ranges, including White Sands Missile Range until such time as the Congress, and this Committee, has an opportunity to consider the merits of the President's fiscal year 1999 budget as it relates to this installation. 
It is a very simple, straight forward amendment, and it is necessary for me to proceed in this way at this time because the Department of the Army has chosen to circumvent the congressional oversight process. Let me tell you how: 
Because of budgetary constraints, the Department of the Army made a distributional decision that would reduce White Sands Missile Range's WSMR's, overall RDT&E budget by approximately $17 million in fiscal year 1999. As a result, WSMR was asked to plan for a reduction of as many as 550 full-time civilian positions. 
Subsequently, in late December 1997, the Army agreed to provide approximately $11 million to WSMR for the purpose of offering Voluntary Early Retirement Authority, VERA, and Voluntary Separation Incentive Pay, VSIP, benefits. This ameliorated some of the civilian personnel reductions that are scheduled to take place in fiscal year 1999. With the VERA and VSIP benefits, the Army's plan for WSMR is to reduce approximately 350 civilian personnel. 
I do not believe it is prudent for the Army to be reducing civilian personnel authorizations at WSMR until such time as the Congress has an opportunity to consider the merits of such actions during the fiscal year 1999 defense appropriations process. Unfortunately, the Army has directed WSMR to open the window of opportunity for retirement benefits from now until March 31, 1998. 
This action effectively precludes the Congress from exercising any oversight responsibility of the Department of Defense decisions in this regard. Once civilian personnel at WSMR elect to take the benefits, those civilian personnel positions are essentially eliminated. 
In addition, if the Army does not find enough personnel who are willing to take the benefits, a Reduction In Force, RIF, will have to occur and its timing will be such that the Congress will have little or no ability to address these issues. 
Finally, what should cause great concern to every member who is interested in Congressional oversight, the Army is using fiscal year 1998 funds to implement reductions that are planned to occur in fiscal year 1999. This circumvents the Congressional oversight process. 
Again, my amendment prohibits the Department of the Army from continuing to move forward with any civilian personnel reductions at WSMR until such time as the Congress has the opportunity to consider the merits of such action during the fiscal year 1999 Defense Appropriations process. In addition, the bill language requires the Department of the Army to offer such VERA and VSIP benefits as are currently being offered should such benefits be necessary at a future date.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today with the distinguished junior Senator from Texas (Mrs. Hutchison) to introduce a bill to bring some much needed credibility and flexibility to the drug certification process. 
As my colleagues are aware, the President recently announced his annual decision regarding which countries would be certified as `fully cooperating' with the United States in the drug war. Once again, in the face of overwhelming evidence that full certification was unwarranted, the President found that Mexico has fully cooperated. This decision essentially means that the President has announced to the American people and the world that Mexico is a full partner in our anti-narcotics efforts. 
Mr. President, I understand that Mexico has made some progress in recent years in combating the drug cartels. And for that, the Mexican government deserves some credit. But, I simply cannot accept the Administration's flawed decision that Mexico has fully cooperated with the United States. There were too many instances of drug-related corruption and violence in the past year which support the opposite conclusion--that Mexico deserves something less than full certification. 
Mr. President, I could take all day to explain to my colleagues in the Senate why I believe that Mexico does not deserve full certification this year. Instead, I would like to point out a just few facts which lead me to that conclusion. 
First, I would direct my colleagues to a Washington Post article dated March 9th--just this week--entitled `2,000 Miles of Disarray in the Drug War--U.S./Mexico Border Effort `A Shambles.' The article points out what I think everyone, including the President of the United States, knows about our border drug effort with Mexico: it simply has been a failure. 
The article notes that despite the official rhetoric from Washington praising Mexico's cooperation, U.S. law enforcement officials on the ground are saying that the joint U.S.-Mexico effort to establish Bilateral Border Task Forces to combat the drug cartels has been a disaster. I think the time has come for Congress and the President to pay more attention to what our law enforcement officials at the front lines of the drug war are saying about Mexico and its level of cooperation. It's clear the views of law enforcement are far different than those of the diplomats at the State Department and the embassies. 
According to the news article, for the past 14 months, DEA, FBI and Customs agents have refused to cross the border into Mexico because Mexico will not allow them to carry weapons to protect themselves. These agents were supposed to be the front line in the U.S. contribution to the joint border effort, but Mexico's unwillingness to allow them even the most basic protections has rendered our agreement to work together meaningless. 
The news story also states that corruption has almost completely eroded the trust and confidence of U.S. officials in the integrity of Mexican law enforcement. The report notes that at least five senior Mexican officers involved in the Border Task Force program have been arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from the drug cartels, participating in the kidnaping of key witnesses or stealing confiscated cocaine. 
One former Mexican federal police commander in charge of intelligence gathering for the Border Task Forces was fired last year for taking bribes from the cartels. U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials now have identified this individual as a suspected drug trafficker in Arizona, but U.S. requests for information from Mexico about his activities have gone unanswered. How is that `full cooperation?' I can tell you that U.S. law enforcement officials do not think this is full cooperation--Tom Constantine, the head of the DEA said as much in a recent Senate hearing. 
Mexico also has failed to cooperate in another key area: extradition. Once again, the Administration claims that Mexico has increased its willingness to cooperate with the United States on extradition. Yet, once again, there is no evidence that Mexico has made efforts to capture and extradite to the U.S. for trial any high-ranking Mexican national drug lords. Our law enforcement officials risk their lives gathering information to obtain indictments against Mexican drug traffickers, yet very few are ever captured and sent here for trial. In fact, the President's own 1998 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, which is full of information which is supposed to justify the President's decision, states that `to date, no major Mexican drug traffickers have been extradited to the United States.' To this Senator, that is unacceptable. 
Mr. President, I realize that drug related violence has become an epidemic in Mexico. The recent death of Amado Carillo Fuentes, the cartel kingpin known as `the Lord of the Skies,' has lead to increased violence as the other cartels work to realign themselves in an attempt to take over Carillo's turf. In fact, recent reports are that two of the largest remaining Mexican cartels (the Caro Quintero and Arellano Felix organizations) have joined together to form `The Federation'--the largest drug cartel in Mexico. This presents new and more difficult law enforcement questions for the United States and Mexico. 
But until recently, I did not realize how deeply the drug cartels have become embedded in Mexican and even parts of U.S. popular culture. Then I read a March story in the Washington Post about `narcocorridos,' Mexican folk ballads which tell stories about the violent exploits of drug smugglers. Narcocorridos glamorize drug-related shootouts with the police, betrayals, paid executions and the wealth associated with narcotics trafficking. There apparently are hundreds of music groups recording and singing these songs, which are wildly popular in Mexico and parts of southern California. That is a disturbing comment on the power the drug cartels possess. 
Mr. President, I have not sought recognition today simply to talk about Mexico's shortcomings and what I believe are the flaws in the President's certification decision. I realize that the certification statute itself is flawed. It's too inflexible and is written in a way which leads to the absurd results we have seen with respect to Mexico in the last several years. We in Congress have a duty to take a look at this law and figure out a way to fix it. 
So today with my colleagues from other border states, we have introduced a bill which I believe is a good starting point in the debate about the certification process. Our bill would take what I think are two important steps in improving the certification statute. The bill: (1) provides the President with a new option, called `qualified certification'; and (2) emphasizes the important contribution our drug-fighting U.S. law enforcement agencies make by giving them a greater role in the certification process. 
Under our bill, the President would no longer be forced to make the decision between `full certification' or decertification, as is the case under current law. The fatal flaw of the certification statute is that it rigidly requires the President to make a choice between `full cooperation' and `no cooperation', when in reality many countries fall somewhere in between. 
Our bill allows the President to make a `qualified certification' of countries which have cooperated with the United States, but have failed to make adequate progress in certain areas. Countries which receive a designation of qualified certification would continue to be eligible for the full spectrum of multilateral and bilateral assistance--they would not be penalized as they are if they are de-certified. 
Instead, qualified certification would trigger the creation of a high-level contact group headed by the Attorney General and consisting of the Secretary of State, the heads of the DEA and FBI, the Drug Czar and others. The members of the contact group would be tasked with meeting with their high ranking counterparts in other countries to set measurable goals relating to law enforcement matters like extradition, eradication, money laundering or other appropriate counter-narcotics concerns. 
The President then would consult with the Attorney General and issue a report to Congress setting forth the goals established by the high-level contact group and report back the following year on the progress made in meeting those goals. The President also would be required to take a country's progress into consideration when making the certification decision the following year. 
Mr. President, I have long believed that law enforcement agencies are capable of providing the most accurate picture of whether a country has fully cooperated with our anti-drug efforts. I also have felt that the certification statute is too rigid, too punitive and fails to recognize the critical role U.S. law enforcement plays in our counter-narcotics strategy. I think this bill is a step in the right direction, a step towards fixing the certification process. I thank my colleague from Texas.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished manager of the bill for accepting my amendment to establish a much-needed commercial zone in my home state to facilitate trade and transportation of raw materials and goods across our border with Mexico. I agree with him that we need to take a comprehensive approach to opening the entire border with Mexico. 
In the past, commercial zones were established by the Interstate Commerce Commission in numerous states to improve local border trade activities, as well as to control movement and uphold American safety requirements for foreign vehicles operating within the United States. 
Within these zones, commercial vehicles of Canadian and Mexican registry are authorized to deliver products from their country of origin to United States' distribution points or warehouses without extended delays at the border or the need for unloading the cargo for reloading and shipment by American vehicles. These same vehicles also are authorized to pick up products in the United States for export to their respective countries. 
Since the passage of NAFTA, New Mexico has witnessed its exports to Mexico increase by over 1,000 percent. Unfortunately, New Mexico still lags behind 35 other states in the amount of exports it sends to Mexico, and it has become increasingly clear that establishing a commercial zone is a necessary step in improving New Mexico's economic relationship with our neighbor to the south. 
The need for a commercial zone in New Mexico is most critical to the continued viability of several food processing plants which employ thousands of New Mexicans in the southern part of the state. Later this year, Mexican farmers will harvest their chili crops and sell them to the plants in New Mexico for processing. Right now, without a designated commercial zone, Mexican farmers must transport the chili crop to the border, unload the cargo at an off-loading site, and reload it onto an American carrier to travel the remaining 30 miles to the processing plant. Clearly, without a commercial zone, there is large economic disincentive for Mexican farmers to do business with New Mexico food processors. 
This amendment should be non-controversial. It allows New Mexico to compete for NAFTA-related business on the same level playing field as our neighboring border states--California, Arizona and Texas--all of which already have established commercial zones. 
This amendment is supported by New Mexico's Governor Gary Johnson, the State Economic Development Department, the New Mexico Border Authority, the U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce, the New Mexico food processing industry and the New Mexico Motor Carriers Association and the cities Las Cruces and Deming. Again, I thank the manager of the bill and the Ranking Minority Member for accepting this amendment and I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. I agree implementation of the cross-trucking border provisions of NAFTA has been delayed far too long. Our states were prepared to go forward in 1995. Had that occurred, my amendment today would not be necessary. 
The state of New Mexico has been seeking to establish a new commercial zone since 1992, prior to passage of NAFTA. In 1995, the Interstate Commerce Commission, which had jurisdiction over commercial zones, essentially announced the State's effort was moot since the border was to open shortly. Yet here we are, more than two years later, and nothing has changed. New Mexico's economy has been held stagnant because not only did the border not open, but we are precluded from any trade benefits associated with a commercial zone--benefits enjoyed by the other border states.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to commend the many Senators whose cooperative efforts have brought this vital legislation to the Senate floor. I personally wish to thank the distinguished Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman John Chafee of Rhode Island for his work in helping negotiate the deal to increase highway funding while maintaining the balanced budget agreement reached last year. When I entered the Senate in 1973 until 1987, I served on the Environment and Public Works Committee. I know the history and evolution of highway programs in this country. We are, Mr. President, a country on wheels. 
I know the importance of highways to our economy. Every dollar invested in the highway system yields $2.60 in economic benefits to the nation. A transportation system that works without traffic jams, and efficiently moves goods across town or across the state, is an important asset for economic development. Good roads lower the price consumers pay for food, clothing and other goods. Lower prices can increase disposable income, attract new business and new jobs to an area. 
The highway system is the economic lifeblood of our nation, and of my home state of New Mexico. Good roads get us where we need to go, on time and safely. President Eisenhower recognized that roadways are the arteries of American body politic when he created the Interstate system following World War II. 
My constituents in New Mexico have indicated their biggest concern is roads. 
Bad roads constitute 43% of the New Mexico road system, placing us, Mr. Chairman, behind only Rhode Island in the highest percentage of bad roads in the Country. Driving on roads riddled with potholes, bumps, buckles and cracks costs New Mexico motorists $281 million a year just in additional mechanic's repair bills and operating costs. 
Highway improvements are urgently needed in New Mexico, and this agreement will assure us of substantial increases for that work over next 6 years. Should the current version of this bill pass, New Mexico would receive more than $1.5 billion for road construction and maintenance funds over the next six years--a 48% increase. 
Financing highway construction and related activities creates jobs. Almost 10 million workers, a full seven percent of the civilian workforce, are employed in transportation and related industries. Each $1 billion in new federal highway investment nationwide generates an additional 439 full-time jobs in my state of New Mexico. 
Repairing the national transportation system will increase productivity in all sectors of the economy. The goal of this legislation is the efficient and safe transportation of goods and people. We have agreed to spend all incoming gas taxes on highways, so New Mexicans can be sure they are getting their money's worth at the pump. We have encountered some potholes on this road of reaching an agreement consistent with the balanced budget agreement. But make no mistake, throughout negotiations, Pete Domenici has been for building roads in New Mexico. 
The New Mexico Legislature recently approved, and Governor Johnson signed, a $1.1 billion highway funding package that depends on federal dollars from this legislation to complete projects in the state. For the first time in history, every community in New Mexico with a population over 15,000 will be served by a four lane highway connected to the interstate highway system. For example, Highway 44 between Bernalillo and Bloomfield, one of the most dangerous stretches of road in the country, will be widened to 4 lanes with the arrival of these additional federal dollars. 
After waiting for more than 25 years, New Mexico will finally be able to complete improvements to highway 70; a vital link on the Eastern side of the state connecting the mountainous community of Ruidoso to Roswell and Portales. 
What we in New Mexico affectionately refer to as `the Big I'--the intersection of Interstates 25 and 40 which bisects the state in Albuquerque--is in desperate need of improvement. Too often this area resembles a parking lot rather than a main thoroughfare. Traffic is so bad that normally courteous drivers often become frustrated and succumb to `road rage;' jockeying for position, cutting each other off, and making single-finger salutes. 
A recent Albuquerque Journal article suggests that motorists in New Mexico's largest city may begin to refer to 1998 as the year of the orange barrel. However, the city of Albuquerque, as well as the nation, will benefit from the long-awaited improvements to this vital crossroad. 
Congestion and traffic have contributed to the `brown cloud' in Albuquerque from carbon monoxide. The $6.6 million provided to New Mexico annually in the Congestion Mitigation Air Quality portion of this bill will continue the programs which have allowed Albuquerque to become the first U.S. city to emerge from non-compliance with air quality standards. 
It may seem unusual to some that a Senator from New Mexico helped protect mass transit dollars in this road bill. However, New Mexico will benefit from these funds in the development of transit systems in, as well as between, her larger cities. Even the smaller city of Roswell as contributed to mass transit technology. The NovaBus Corporation has designed efficient busses which have been utilized in metropolitan areas like New York City. New Mexico has lots to offer our nation's transportation needs. 
New Mexico is the fifth largest state, comprising nearly 3.5% of the land area of the United States, yet it ranks only 36th in population. However, New Mexico is also one of the fastest growing states in the Union, and its traffic volume has tripled in the last ten years. Heavy 18 wheelers moving goods pass through New Mexico, between manufacturing and population centers in Texas and California. We don't directly benefit from the majority of this traffic, but it does tear up our roads. 
As I have been recently reminded, almost 27 million acres of my fair state, approximately 1/3 of its land area, is owned by the federal government, with more held in trust for the many native Americans within its borders. As this nation's Interstate highway ages, repaving and maintenance is endless. Major reconstruction is necessary, which is the state's responsibility. New Mexico maintains highway systems through those lands, while having no tax base to recover any costs. 
I am pleased this bill includes an additional $250 million for roadway improvements on public lands throughout the nation. Perhaps the National Park Service will improve the roads within the Chaco Culture National Historic Park so that visitors from around the country will be able to share in its splendor. 
New Mexico also shares 175 miles of its border with Mexico. Our state has welcomed the increased economic activity associated with the passage of NAFTA, but the nation must also realize the increased traffic and cost to road infrastructure which has followed. I am pleased that this bill includes $450 million for states to meet NAFTA -related road needs. I am also pleased my amendment which amends the Trade corridor and Border Crossing planning program was approved. 
This amendment allows the Secretary of Transportation to consider the projected increase in commercial traffic when selecting recipients of border grants. The current provisions direct the Secretary of Transportation to only consider current and past traffic when allocating funds under this program. Many border facilities, including Santa Teresa in New Mexico, have opened since the passage of NAFTA. This amendment will enable the Secretary to consider the future growth of commercial traffic at ports when awarding grant requests. 
I, along with the other Senator from New Mexico, also offered amendments which enable the Department of Transportation to benefit from the expertise of our nation's federal laboratories in solving transportation needs. In utilizing existing laboratory capability where appropriate, we can ensure past taxpayer investment will earn dividends long into the future. Our amendments encourage cooperation and information exchange within the federal system in development of transportation technology. We should, where we can, avail ourselves of the exceptional talent already available in our federal laboratories. 
I encourage the prompt passage of ISTEA II in the Senate, so that the House of Representatives will quickly address the country's transportation needs and construction can continue without delay. New Mexico is a large state with a small population, many citizens are isolated without adequate roads. Contract authority provided by this legislation is needed to continue federal road and transit construction and maintenance throughout the country. Major construction season is about to commence; states need their highway funds. 
I urge prompt passage of this important bill. 
Mr. President, again, let me thank all the Senators who have worked together to get this bill moving on the Senate floor. In addition to the distinguished chairman Chafee, I thank Senator Byrd and Senator Phil Gramm, who originally brought up the idea trying to spend as much of the 4.3 cents as had been transferred to the trust fund as possible, consistent with the caps we have heretofore agreed upon in the balanced budget. 
During the 14 years I served on the Environment and Public Works Committee I learned that there is nothing more important to the American people and the people of my State than the roads they drive every day of their lives. Many Americans work miles from where they live. Freedom to many is to get where you want to go as easily as possible, and in your own car. 
Frankly, I believe that is as much a part of the good life in America as anything else. 
But while we have been taking highway money and spending it on other projects, congestion grows. While we are all interested in mass transit and transportation technology, it is obvious that you have to spend money on bricks, mortar, cement, and the like, to improve the roadway system. 
New Mexicans are going to be very pleased when this bill clears the House and goes to the President, because our State is going to be able to take care of many projects that have been long delayed. We will try to make improvements to the interstate in our largest city to relieve congestion. A city of 750,000 should not be so congested. 
There are many aspects of this bill that are going to help New Mexico. Many of roads on Indian lands are impassable in winter months. Only in the last 16 years have we been allocating federal funds to improve these roads, and this bill increases that funding by $50 million to $250 million annually. 
Our legislature has cooperated with our Governor, and they have a series of major projects that are going to be funded out of the highway program in, indeed, new and innovative ways, with long-term bonds and financing, if and when this bill becomes law. I look forward to that. 
I have already commented how this highway money is needed in the State of New Mexico. I will conclude by saying that when we have an economy as robust as ours is today, it is not time to let up on road building. Our economy lives on the highways and byways of America. The more congestion, the less efficient, the less effective we are. Moving business efficiently and effectively the length and breadth of this nation, will ensure the American economy continuing its rather tremendous competitive advantage in the world. 
From the smallest town that needs its roads improved to the very big issue of how this Nation remains competitive--I feel that passage of this bill is as important as anything else we do in the next 4 or 5 years.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, most Indians today still live in poverty. This is reflected in a per capita income figure that is one-sixth to one-fifth the national average for the 10 largest Indian reservations. In simplest terms, most reservation Indians have one dollar of income for every five dollars of income available to average Americans. 
On the Papago reservation in Arizona, the per capita income is $3,113 compared to $18,325 for all Americans (1990 Census). At Zuni Pueblo, the per capita income is $3,904 and at that Navajo reservation it is $3,735. These figures have changed only slightly since the 1990 Census. 
Fifty-one percent of American Indians residing on reservations live below the poverty line; and unemployment averages 37%. 
ISTEA has already helped tremendously to increase the accessibility of Indian people, but much remains to be done. 
We can help accelerate the movement of Indian people into mainstream economic activities by improving their accessibility to better markets and better tourism opportunities.

Mr. DOMENICI. I note the presence on the floor of a number of Senators with whom I have worked diligently to try to get this bill accomplished. I am very proud of the result. 
Let me suggest, however, that I now hear rumors coming from, it seems, the direction of the House, that we have not done enough. Well, that may be one thing in terms of how many demonstration projects we have to do. I assume we will go through that general ritual, and who knows where the wheel of fortune--we see that every night at 6:30 or 7 o'clock--will land, who will win, and who gets all the goodies. Somebody, obviously. 
I hear, in addition to that, that there is some thought we ought to go further, that we ought to take the entire trust fund off budget. Let me suggest to my friends in the Senate, obviously, I have little or no impact, I assume, on the House at this point on that issue. Frankly, I thought we engaged in good faith in a way to get us through this transition of 4 or 5 years when we have caps we have to comply with. I have committed to try to do that in a way that doesn't decimate domestic programs that are within that cap. 
Frankly, if somebody wants to go much further and take the entire program off budget, then I don't know how we will meet those caps, for they take with it the few billion dollars in reserves that have accumulated, that are in the unified budget. They are mostly interest payments that have accrued over time. I thought we made a very, very, honest effort to find a way to get through. Those caps are applicable for only 3 more years--after the one that is the prime year in this bill, only 3 years after that--and then they are not there anymore and we all have some work to do. It is not just highways. We have to pay for the National Institutes of Health. We have to pay for education. These programs compete with them. I have said let's compete with them and let's try to find offsets. I submit, to make that job almost impossible would be the result if you took this in conference and took it all off budget. 
Frankly, I don't know that I can do any more than say that and say I hope the Senators won't, in conference, agree to any such thing. I hope that it is left as it is and you make whatever accommodations you have to make and this program will live to be seen and heard from another day, as will the trust fund. I don't believe we can spend much more than we are planning here. I think we ought to leave it alone. 
I urge my fellow Senators, with whom I have worked very hard, try to see that is the result coming out of conference. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me address the question, because my colleague has been very persuasive. When you give a picture with 11 cities getting 90 percent of the transit moneys for mass transportation--about that, or 80 some-odd plus percent for the 11 regions; and I really think they are regions that receive most of the rail modernization, three quarters of the people--so where do you put the money? I don't say this to diminish my colleague's argument in terms of providing funds for those regions which are now developing needs because they have become high-growth, fast-growth and therefore they want to begin to have the people movers. They want to move people, get them off the roads. They want to partake of this program. That is not an issue. 
We will come into conflict with people who say all additional moneys, all new moneys for rail modernization shall go to cities that heretofore have not participated. Then what you are saying is that those communities that are now moving hundreds of millions of people, 1 billion plus riders annually--that is a lot of people; a lot of people going to work--thereafter additional funds can't be used to modernize to keep these systems operational. 
Now, are we saying they have a fixed cost and that their costs don't go up; that they don't have a need for additional funds over and above the levels they have been traditionally receiving? Of course not. That is like saying you can spend the same amount of money to maintain the Nation's highway systems and roads every year, and since you have been getting money, you don't need any additional money over and above. That is silly. The fact is that costs do go up and they are going up. The main thing, as these facilities become older, particularly where you have transit systems that go back 75, 80, 90, 100-plus years--that is why we call it rail modernization and fixed guideway systems--their needs will absolutely be greater than new systems coming in. 
So to simply say that any moneys over and above what they have traditionally received should now go to those who heretofore have not participated is not something that this Senator could accept. I don't pretend to speak for my colleague, the ranking member, the senior Senator from Maryland, but I am quite sure that Senator Sarbanes would have to take that same position, and all of my colleagues who represent these 11 regions would similarly find themselves in a position to say, `Are you saying that notwithstanding you are provided more money, new money for rail modernization, because we are an older system, we are not going to get any of that money?' It is on that basis that I have to oppose my colleague's amendment as put forth. 
However, I want my colleague to know that I am not unwilling to look at an alternative, to say, can we provide funding that will recognize the needs of these other communities that historically have not participated? That is the art, then, Mr. President, of attempting to deal with an issue that will provide equity and fairness for the present system and for those who wish to start systems. 
I see my colleague and friend, the distinguished Senator from Maryland, rising, so I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, last Friday, the front page of the Washington Post discussed solid new evidence for water at the poles of the Moon. That news may have great implications for future lunar colonies. With costs around $10,000 per pound just to put material in orbit around the earth, this discovery could tremendously reduce costs for future manned lunar bases. Future lunar camps may be able to extract their water supplies, rather than hauling water with them. The whole NASA team deserves many compliments for their efforts leading up to this exciting news. 
I want to commend to your attention the role that New Mexico's Los Alamos National Laboratory, in partnership with the Southwest Research Institute, played in this momentous announcement. Los Alamos designed the neutron spectrometer aboard the Lunar Prospector that enabled these exciting measurements. 
The neutrons studied by the instrument come from natural cosmic rays that constantly bathe the moon. The neutrons are then slowed by interactions with hydrogen in water. The spectrometer detects the energy of neutrons leaving the lunar surface. 
The complexity of designing instrumentation and actually obtaining the data for a mission like this is immense. For Lunar Prospector, the instrumentation not only had to survive launch, but also the four and a half day trip to the moon, and the insertion into lunar orbit. 
Bill Feldman is the Los Alamos project leader for the Los Alamos instrumentation package. Feldman has experienced both the ecstasy of a successful mission and the agony of a failed one. He had instrumentation for mapping Martian water on the failed Mars Observer mission in 1993. 
The neutron spectrometer used for this mission builds on a 35 year history at Los Alamos of designing instruments for non-proliferation programs. Feldman's work on neutron spectrometers in space traces back to the Army Background Experiment, that he helped conduct in 1990, that measured the energies of neutrons encountered in orbit. 
For events like the Mars Observer or the Lunar Prospector, the team has to find ways to carefully check out their instruments. Sometimes those approaches are almost as daunting as the actual mission. For example, Feldman and his colleagues traveled to Antarctica where they took more than a ton of dirt and a detection package about 19 miles high on a balloon to see how cosmic rays would interact with the materials to provide practice for later real observations. 
Secretary of Energy PenAE6a sent a nice note to Dr. Feldman and his team that I will read:  
Congratulations to you and your team of researchers that helped make possible this week's announcement that the Lunar Prospector has found evidence of water on the Moon. These exciting results show that research from the Department of Energy's national laboratories is truly `out of this world.' Besides demonstrating the value of the Nation's investment in science and technology, discoveries like this excite and inspire young people to pursue science and engineering as careers. 
Secretary PenAE6a said it well. I add my congratulations in celebrating another momentous achievement from New Mexico and our national Laboratory in Los Alamos.

Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if I might have the attention of the distinguished chairman and banking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, as well as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation. I want to address a program that is authorized under Section 1111 of S. 1173, namely, the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program. 
As my colleagues know, in the wake of the Supreme Court's 1995 decision in Adarand v. Pena, all federal agencies undertook a review of their affirmative action programs with an eye toward ensuring that those programs met `strict scrutiny'--the new standard of review set by the Court. 
Toward that end, the Department of Transportation proposed a revamping of its regulations for the DBE program. D.O.T.'s intent was to ensure that the DBE program satisfied the two requirements of strict scrutiny--that the program met a `compelling government interest,' and that it was `narrowly tailored.' 
It is my understanding that last May, the Department published proposed new regulations in the Federal Register for comment. That comment period closed last September. Since that time, Department officials have been poring through the 300-plus comments received. They hope to have the new regulations finalized within the next two months. 
I believe the DBE program must be implemented in a manner that is constitutional. I believe that that is critical to the integrity of the program, and to the Senate's support of that program. Therefore, I would like to ask the chairman and ranking member--whose committee has oversight over the DBE program--if it is their intention to press the Department to ensure that the new regulations pass constitutional muster.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office released its preliminary analysis of the President's fiscal year 1999 Budget. 
Very briefly, according to the CBO analysis, the President's budget proposal would spend $43 billion of the federal surplus rather than save the money for social security as the President admonished us in his State of the Union Address. 
This results from the fact that the CBO analysts found that his new proposed spending of nearly $120 billion over the next 5 years exceeds his proposed spending cuts and tax increases of $43 billion. 
In other words, if Congress did nothing but abide by the agreement we reached last year, the surpluses projected by CBO would be $43 billion higher than if we adopted the President's budget proposal. 
But that won't even be possible, because under the Budget Act, the President's budget could not even be considered on the floor of the Senate, because it would be out of order. 
The President's budget violates the agreement reached last year by proposing to break the statutory spending caps by $68 billion, making it out of order in the U.S. Senate. 
Further, CBO found that the President's budget dips us back into deficit in the year 2000. 
This is disappointing. But even if the administration proposes to break our agreement from last year, I do not. 
It is my intent to have the Senate Budget Committee report within the next two weeks a budget for fiscal year 1999 that will: (1) abide by the spending caps set in law last year, (2) balance the budget and keep it in balance, (3) hold any budget surpluses in reserve to protect Social Security and provide for any future transition to a modernized system. 
Mr. President, let me make it very simple in this regard. If we did nothing, in other words if the President had not submitted a budget and we just said let's continue with the policies that we have that were established in this bipartisan agreement, the Congressional Budget Office says the surplus would be $43 billion bigger than it is. That is the simple fact which causes them to conclude, and us to concur, that in fact the President has spent $43 billion of the surplus in his budget. It would be $43 billion higher had he not put a budget before the people, which leads you to that one simple conclusion. 
Some may recall when the President announced his budget, there was a lot less noise made about it, excepting some profound questions were asked. How can you have $120 billion in new programs and not break the agreed-upon caps--that is the total amount you can spend for domestic discretionary spending--when that cap is a fixed dollar number? It has nothing to do with inflation; it is just a fixed dollar number. How can you say we will spend $120 billion, more or less, more than we had planned yet we will not exceed those agreed-upon totals? 
So, what we have now, in my opinion, is a President's budget that, if it were submitted on the floor or in the Budget Committee, would be out of order because it breaches the agreed-upon caps by $68 billion. So it seems to me that we have to go into our mark-up here with that in mind. I am sure the President and his people will explain that they thought certain things could be handled differently than CBO handled them, and they are entitled to that position. But that is what we have to follow, and their rules have to be followed by us. We cannot adopt rules that the President establishes. So I believe it is important that the Senators understand the situation we are confronted with as we move in the Budget Committee and on the floor of the Senate. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, thank you, very much. 
Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Amendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell. The Senator from Kentucky proposes to replace the Department of Transportation's Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program with a new `emerging business' program. The amendment is intended to eliminate the DBE program and would have a devastating effect on the opportunities for DBE's to participate in federally funded highway and transit projects. 
The proponents of this amendment urge Senators to vote for this amendment by saying that it is incumbent upon the Senate to bring ISTEA into compliance with the Supreme Court's ruling in Adarand versus Pena. They assert that just this summer, after the Supreme Court sent the case back to the District Court, that it found the DBE program was unconstitutional. Furthermore, they declare that the District Court in Colorado followed the Supreme Court's lead and found that the government, in fact, could not meet the Supreme Court's test. 
The proponents go on to remind Senators that every member of Congress has publicly and solemnly sworn to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, and that we now have little choice but to comply with the unambiguous, unequivocal mandate of the courts and end the DBE program. 
If Senators are considering voting in favor of the McConnell amendment on the basis that the program has been ruled unconstitutional, and that it is now incumbent upon us to bring the program into line with the Supreme Court's rule, then I would ask them to take the time to listen to a different view, and one that I believe is closer to the real facts. 
The proponents of this amendment make the argument that we should stand for the rule of law and on this point we agree. However, many Senators will be interested to know that the District Court itself appears not to have followed the rule of law as outlined by the Supreme Court and therefore should not be mislead. I will say this again, because if you listen to the proponents of the amendment, and I have, you are compelled to consider their argument seriously. But if you look at the facts closely, you will find that the very constitutional rule of law the proponents ask us to uphold was itself not precisely followed by the District Court. 
In 1995, in Adarand, the Supreme Court did not find the DBE program--or any other affirmative action program--unconstitutional. In fact, seven of nine Justices upheld the constitutionality of affirmative action and its continued need in certain circumstances. Instead, the Supreme Court established a new standard of review--`strict scrutiny'--for federal programs using race conscious measures. This new two pronged test requires that affirmative action programs are `narrowly tailored' to meet a `compelling governmental interest.' Without deciding whether the DBE program met this new strict scrutiny test, the Supreme Court sent the case back down to the District Court for consideration in lieu of its holding. 
Mr. President, this is the rule of law the Supreme Court said must be followed, and it is the rule of law I would urge Senators to support. However, it is not the rule of law that the District Court followed on remand from the Supreme Court, and that is why the District Court's finding that the program is unconstitutional should be viewed with skepticism. 
On remand, the District Court accepted Congress' determination that there was a compelling need for the program. The District Court stated, `I find on the record before me, Congress had sufficient evidence, at the time these measures were enacted, to determine reasonably and intelligently that discriminatory barriers existed in federal contracting . . . I conclude Congress has a strong basis in evidence for enacting the challenged statutes, which thus serve a compelling governmental interest.' This meets the compelling governmental interest prong of the Supreme Court's `strict scrutiny' test. 
The District Judge, however, decided that the program was not sufficiently narrow in its scope. In this part of his decision, the Judge 
took a position which directly contradicts the Supreme Court's rule in Adarand. 
While seven of nine Justices of the Supreme Court said that there could be affirmative action programs that are both narrowly tailored and meet a compelling governmental interest, this District Court Judge found, and I quote, `Contrary to the Court's pronouncement that strict scrutiny in not `fatal in fact,' I find it difficult to envisage a race-based classification that is narrowly tailored.' 
Obviously, Mr. President, the key words in the District Court's ruling are `Contrary to the Court's (meaning Supreme Court's) pronouncement. . .' I agree with the proponents of this amendment that every member of Congress took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, and we should be vigilant in adhering to that oath. But, the fact of the matter is that the District Court itself does not view the constitutional rule the Supreme Court set in Adarand as being able to be followed because it found that it would be difficult to envisage any affirmative action program that could be narrowly tailored. The Supreme Court said that it could envision a program that was both narrowly tailored and furthered a compelling governmental interest, and herein lies the flaw in the argument of the proponents of the amendment. On this point, Justice O'Connor, writing for the majority stated, `We wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is strict in theory, but fatal in fact. The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and government is not disqualified from action in response to it.' 
The very District Court ruling that the proponents ask us to rely on is currently being appealed by the Department of Transportation and the Department of Justice in the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. The case has been fully briefed, but no date has been set for oral argument. So while the proponents suggest that a decision on this matter has been fully resolved by the courts and constitutes a mandate that we should follow, the fact is that it is still an open question. 
Furthermore, Mr. President, although the District Court found that the scope of the program was not narrowly tailored, it did not take into account the changes that the Department of Transportation has proposed to the program to respond to the Supreme Court's narrow tailoring guidelines. The Department of Transportation has issued a proposed rule to improve the DBE program and respond to the Adarand decision. The proposed rule is specifically designed to meet the narrow tailoring requirement of the Supreme Court's strict scrutiny test. 
Specific narrow tailoring proposals include: Ensuring that specific goals are set to correspond to the availability of qualified DBEs in a given market. The new goal-setting methods will ensure that DBEs receive the same opportunities they would have but for the presence of discrimination--no more, no less. Giving priority to race neutral measures, such as outreach and technical assistance, in meeting overall goals. Recipients would look to these approaches before using race-conscious measures, such as contract goals. Emphasizing the need for recipients to take good faith efforts to meet contracting goals seriously. Recipients must award a contract to a bidder who documents adequate good faith efforts, even if the bidder does not fully meet a contract goal. Providing waivers that will afford recipients increased flexibility in implementing the program. 
So while the District Court found it difficult to envisage an affirmative action program that could be narrowly tailored, it did not even have before it the proposed rule that purports to meet that test. These regulations are to be finalized within the next month. After thorough review, both the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Justice have determined the DBE program is constitutional. 
The proponents have urged us to comply with the `unequivocal mandate' of the courts and end the DBE program. The only `unequivocal mandate' the courts have stated is that race-based programs must meet the strict scrutiny test. Contrary to the Supreme Court's decision that an affirmative action program could be both narrowly tailored and meet a compelling governmental interest, the District Court found it `difficult to envisage' any narrowly tailored program, and moreover, it did not have before it the very rule proposed to address the aspect of the Supreme Court's strict scrutiny test. 
President Eisenhower, when he was still general, used to say that 
he `. . . never liked to make decisions too quickly . . .' I would urge my colleagues to heed the advice of President Eisenhower, and not make a decision to quickly on this matter prior to a determination being made of whether the proposed rule can meet the narrow tailoring aspect of the Supreme Court's test. 
The Senator from Kentucky's amendment requires states to take action to enable emerging businesses to compete for highway and transit contracts and subcontracts. These actions include outreach to emerging small businesses in the construction industry, technical services and assistance with bonding and lending, and technical services and assistance with general business management. The amendment prohibits discrimination and preferential treatment based, in whole or in part, on race, national origin, or gender. 
Mr. President, the proponents of this amendment have lead members to believe that the DBE program is really a `quota program'. I want to stress at the outset that this program is not a `quota program' as some have suggested. There is a great difference between an aspirational goal and a rigid numerical requirement. Quotas utilize rigid numerical requirements as a means of implementing a program. The DBE program utilizes aspirational goals. 
Under the DBE program, state and local government recipients of Department of Transportation funds administer the DBE program. Each year, they determine how much DBE participation is reasonable to expect based on the availability of DBEs and the types of work involved. The recipient's annual goal may be more or less than the national 10% goal established by Congress, and it is worth noting that if they do not meet that goal there are no penalties. In fact, the Department of Transportation has never penalized or sanctioned a state or local recipient for not achieving their goals. This provides flexibility to meet local conditions. Contract goals are not operated as quotas because they only require that the prime contractor make `good faith efforts' to find DBEs. If a prime contractor cannot find qualified and competitive DBEs, the goal can be waived. 
In as much as the DBE program is not a quota program, neither does it constitute reverse discrimination as the proponents have suggested. The DBE program works to remedy discrimination, not cause it. In fact, non-minority business people who are disadvantaged have applied and been accepted into the DBE program. In fact, any white male, as long as he can demonstrate social and economic disadvantage, can be admitted to the program. 
Let's remember, the Department of Transportation reports that 85% of the contracting receipts under ISTEA programs go to non-DBEs with the current DBE program in place. This figure indicates that minority firms do not dominate the construction industry. The role in the construction industry will only be diminished by the elimination of the DBE program. 
The DBE program works to ensure a level playing field for qualified DBEs which have for years confronted discrimination and been blocked out of contracting opportunities. That discrimination is evidenced by District Court's finding that the program meets the compelling governmental interest prong of the Supreme Court's strict 
scruity test.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, needless to say, the Senator from New Mexico who comes from a State that has about 11 percent American Indians as part of our population mix and about 38 percent Hispanics--needless to say, I have lived my adult life in an atmosphere where I have rubbed shoulders with those members of the minority--American Indians and Hispanics--in my State as they spoke of opportunity and as they spoke of a chance to own a business and of their hope that their children would get a good education so they could have a chance like all of us had in New Mexico who are not Hispanics or Indians. 
I have seen a great number of successes in terms of business by the minority community in New Mexico. Much less by the Indians proportionately--American Indians--than by the Hispanics. And that has a lot of cultural nuances to it also, and tribal nuances and the like. 
But I have strived most of my life to try to be part of the kind of community and the kind of lawmaking that gave the minorities an equal chance to own businesses. That is essentially what we are talking about here. And we are engaged in a debate--I don't think a debate about whether everyone, including minorities, ought to have a chance to own businesses in America. I would assume if we put that question to everyone, they would all say of course. But the question is, even though we all say of course, do they really have an equal opportunity? Is it as easy for an intelligent, well-educated Hispanic American, New Mexican, or a Native American to get into business? I will say that without any of the Government involved, they are getting more and more opportunities. And there is no question that more Hispanics are in business in the United States on their own without the benefit of the Federal Government programs than those who are in business because of the Federal programs. 
But I can also assure you that the Hispanic Americans who live in my State and in other States are genuinely listening today to this debate. And if they aren't tuned in on C-SPAN, they will soon be hearing what people tell them we are doing here on the floor of the Senate. I guarantee you, Mr. President, and my good friend, exceptionally good friend from Kentucky, who happens to be on the opposite side of this issue today, on the precise formulation of the issue--I guarantee you that whether Hispanics and Native Americans, or other minorities, or women who are part of this program and are scurrying around to catch up with the men in business ownership--incidentally, as an aside, the fastest growing portion of the American business ownership portfolio is now women. 
As a matter of fact, as of 2 years ago, women-owned businesses in America, believe it or not, and all by themselves, employed more people than the Fortune 500 in America. And it was the fastest growing piece of those who were entrepreneurs. On the other hand, that doesn't mean that they don't need some help sometime to break into the private sector. 
So I have come to the floor concerned because I do not want to be part of an America that is saying, because we don't want quotas and we don't want set-asides, which I will agree we should not have--we are not going to have a major program within the highway programs of this country, which we are currently thinking is $173 billion worth of business, more or less, over the next 6 years, and add to it $41 billion more or less for mass transit. I do not want to leave the floor with that bill and with people being able to say there may not be any minority participation in the businesses that put this fantastic roadway and mass transit system together. That may be a bit of an exaggeration. But essentially what we have done in the past is to try to make sure that there was participation. And we have broadened that to women as part of a group of Americans that are disadvantaged when it comes to owning their own businesses. 
So I have for the last 3 days--not for months--studied this issue. And I must say I didn't have hours upon hours to do it; I have a lot of other things I have to do around here. But I have come to the conclusion that we do not have to wipe out the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program in this bill in order to accomplish our goal, which I think is rather unanimous, that there be no quotas yet there be some positive direction so that women and minorities will get a reasonable portion of the business under this very, very large multimillion-dollar contract authority that is going out to American business, large and small, to fulfill. 
The more I read, and the more I said, `But you can't be right, Senator Domenici, because of your wonderful friend from Kentucky whose thoroughness and constitutional acumen on the bill called campaign finance'--I read the same cases with him, and I agreed with him. In fact, I told him that I had come full circle and could clearly understand in campaign finance how it was a freedom of speech issue. He recalls that. I would not have gotten to that point. I was still fuzzy about it until I heard his interpretations of the Supreme Court. 
But I tell you that I do not agree that this minority business program that we have in this ISTEA bill before us is a program that mandates quotas and mandates set-asides. In fact, I don't believe it is even fair to just look at the face of the statute, as has been done here on the floor, and read it, and say it is patently a quota system because, Mr. President, it is not implemented without regulations. And the regulations and the way the program is being implemented, from everything I can find out, do not establish quotas or set-asides. 
Then I said, `Well, my friend from Kentucky, whom I have just expressed my admiration for, keeps saying the Supreme Court has already ruled it unconstitutional.' And I said, `If that is really true, he should get 100 votes.' 
So I started asking. I have some lawyers on my staff. I don't think necessarily I have Laurence Tribe on my staff. I could have sent it up to Harvard for them to look at it. Maybe my friend from Kentucky would say that wouldn't be a very good place to send it; I don't know. But maybe over to Stanford. Well, let's settle for old Michigan, the University of Michigan. 
But in any event, the truth of the matter is that I have now received very, very different information that I think makes sense about whether this Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program as currently being administered has been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. As a matter of fact, let me say I am convinced that it has not. 
What I have done--and I hope the Senate will find this interesting--is I have asked the Attorney General's Office of the United States and the Secretary of Transportation to answer some very precise questions. I have them answered. They are so interesting and so precise. Maybe that is because I asked the questions that I wanted answered. I would like to read them. There are only six. When I am finished later this evening, I will pass out the letter to whoever wants it. It will be then signed by the Attorney General of the United States and by Secretary Slater. 
Let me read the letter. The letter is dated March 5, 1998, directed to me. 
It says:  
Dear Senator Domenici: This letter responds to questions that you have posed regarding the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Program currently authorized by the Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act. 
1. Has the text of section 1111 been ruled on by the Supreme Court, and if not, how does section 1111 differ from the statute that was before the Supreme Court in Adarand v. Pena? 
The Supreme Court in Adarand v. Pena did not find this or any other program to be unconstitutional. Indeed, the Supreme Court did not even consider the constitutionality of section 1003(b) of ISTEA, which sets a 10% goal for expenditure of the authorized funds with DBEs. The Adarand case involved a different program: the Department of Transportation's use in its own direct federal contracts of compensation to encourage federal prime contractors to use DBE subcontractors. The compensation was provided through a specific contract provision used only in DOT's own direct contracts for highways on federal lands. Even as to this compensation program, the Supreme Court's opinion merely establishes that federal race-conscious programs, like state and local programs, are subject to strict scrutiny. The Court made clear, however, that such scrutiny is not `fatal in fact,' and that the federal government has a compelling interest in remedying the lingering effects of discrimination through properly tailored programs. 
2. How do you conclude that Section 1111 of the ISTEA bill was not before the Supreme Court in Adarand v. Pena and has not been declared unconstitutional? 
The Supreme Court's opinion in Adarand addresses only the DOT's subcontracting compensation program, not the ISTEA DBE program. The Supreme Court's remand in Adarand makes this clear--it states that the courts below were to determine only `whether any of the ways in which the Government uses subcontractor compensation clauses can survive strict scrutiny.' 515 U.S. at 238. Only one district court judge--the judge who is considering the remand in Adarand--has found the compensation clause program unconstitutional. While that district court judge also ruled the ISTEA program unconstitutionality of ISTEA was not properly before the court. The Justice Department has argued on appeal to the Tenth Circuit that the district court improperly addressed the constitutionality of ISTEA and, in any event, erroneously concluded that ISTEA was unconstitutional. 
3. Section 1111 of the ISTEA bill states, `not less than 10 percent of the amounts made available under this program shall be expended with small business concerns controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.' In view of this language, why is the DBE program not a mandatory set aside or rigid quota program? 
The 10 percent figure contained in the statute is not a mandatory set aside or rigid quota. First, the statute explicitly provides that the Secretary of Transportation may waive this goal for any reason--specifically, the language quoted above is preceded by the phrase `[e]xcept to the extent that the Secretary determines otherwise.' Second, in no way is the 10 percent figure imposed on any state or locality. Under the program, it is the states that really set goals for contracting. They may set goals higher or lower than 10 percent depending upon the local availability of DBEs, projected contracting needs and past results of their efforts. Moreover, state agencies are permitted to waive goals when achievement on a particular contract or even for a specific year is not possible. 
The DBE program does not set aside a certain percentage of contracts or dollars for a specific set of contractors. Nor does the program require recipients to use set asides. The DBE program is a goals program which encourages participation without imposing rigid requirements of any type. Neither the Department's current or proposed regulations permit the use of quotas. The DBE program does not use any rigid numerical requirements that would mandate a fixed number of dollars or contracts for DBEs. 
4. The comments to the new rule states, `[i]f race-neutral means are the first resort under this proposed section, then set asides and other more intrusive means, such as a conclusive presumption, are the last resort.' In view of this language, why is this not a mandatory set aside or rigid quota program? 
The comment is intended to make clear that race- and gender-neutral mechanisms (e.g., outreach, technical assistance) are the means of first resort for recipients to use in seeking to meet overall goals. In fact, the rule itself prohibits setting aside particular contracts unless the state has been unable to meet its goals for a number of years and there is a court-order or state law which directs the recipient to use set asides. Such set asides would not be permitted, even where state law authorizes their use, unless it can be shown that less restrictive measures, including race neutral programs and flexible contract goals, were insufficient to address the demonstrated effects of discrimination. As discussed above, the DBE program thus neither mandates set asides nor permits the use of rigid quotas. 
5. Are there sanctions, penalties or fines that may be imposed on any recipient who does not meet DBE program goals? In the fifteen years that this program has been in operation, has any state been sanctioned for not meeting its program goals? In answering please provide specific examples to support your conclusion. 
No state has ever been sanctioned by DOT for not meeting its goals. Nothing in the statute or the regulations imposes sanctions on any state recipient that has attempted in good faith, but failed, to meet its self-imposed goals. In 1995, two states failed to meet their goals; in 1996, two other states failed to meet their goals; and, in 1997, three states failed to meet their goals. There were no sanctions, penalties or fines of any kind imposed against any of those states. 
6. Is this program only for minorities and women? 
No. Any individual owning a business may demonstrate that he is socially and economically disadvantaged, even if that individual is not a woman or minority. Both the current and proposed regulations provide detailed guidance to recipients to assist them in making individualized determinations of disadvantaged status. And, in fact, businesses owned by white males have qualified for DBE status. 
7. What recourse is available to low bidders who have made good faith efforts to meet DBE contract goals, but despite those efforts were not able to do so? Is it true that low bidders who have tried but failed to meet the contract's DBE goal are automatically eliminated from consideration for the contract? 
Under the current regulations, if a prime contractor is unable to find available and qualified DBEs to meet a specific contract goal, the goal may be waived. Under the proposed rule, the goal must be waived. No low bidder who tried in good faith but failed to meet the goal is automatically eliminated from receiving the contract. 
Thank you for your interest in, and support of, this important program. 
Sincerely,

Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself up to 5 minutes. 
Let me say to my friend from Kentucky, actually, I am very pleased with the remarks he has made, because essentially there is no question that the amendment which he offers, as I view it, is premature if the purpose is to make this bill eliminate any program that has been ruled by the Supreme Court to be 
unconstitutional, because obviously, whatever the district court did with it--and it has not been rendered unconstitutional prior to this district court decree--whatever they did to it is on appeal. As a consequence, we don't even know if the appellate court agrees that it is unconstitutional as determined by the district judge who, incidentally, did not even have ISTEA before the court when this decision was rendered. 
Let's just make one other observation about the administration. And I hope Democrats will join me with this. I have just said they better be right. They just told us what it does and doesn't do and how they are going to make sure it is tailored that way. But I think it is fair to say to the President that some of us remember when the decisions came down from the Supreme Court about set-asides and the 8(a) program and others that, as the President said--and I can't quote him verbatim nor do I remember the time, but I can assure you it was sometime back--`I will have my administration go through all these laws and correct them so that they meet what the Supreme Court's test is.' Frankly, there are a lot of people who have been waiting for them to get that done.

Mr. DOMENICI. As a matter of fact, I understand from conversations this morning, the conversations that preceded this letter, that they are in the process of rewriting rules and regulations for all of them, not just ISTEA, and I said, `You better hurry up.' 
We all know that they have to be rewritten. The minority community knows they have to be rewritten. This debate may have been avoidable. Had they written these both generic and specific rules, we might not have had this argument. 
The answer I received, so the Senator will know, is that it is very difficult when you look at the whole array of programs. The Senator says there may be more than 160?

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I know the time is running out on the debate on this major amendment, the amendment that is in the nature of a substitute. But I wanted to take about 5 minutes and express my views about it. 
Frankly, it is common knowledge around here that I was not in favor of moving quickly with the ISTEA bill. But clearly, we are ready now. We have had ample opportunity to discuss how much money is coming into the trust fund from the 4.3 cents, how much contract authority ought to be obligated to use it up during the next 5 years. Part of that would be in 1998. So it is a 6-year cycle. We arrived at a conclusion that is pretty clear and pretty close to fair, in my opinion. In fact, I think it is about as well as we can do. 
America needs highways. The U.S. Government has a lot of programs it is involved in that are not its responsibility. But there is no question that it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to appropriately handle the gasoline tax money and to let our States build roads with it. So, in a very real sense, it is a very high priority, because for many things that we spend money on, we are not, in a sense, as trustees, obligated to spend money for those things. And there are scores of them. 
So I have come to the conclusion that the dollar number of $173 billion as the total expenditure over the next 5 years is a right number, consisting of the gasoline tax of 4.3 cents which used to be in the general fund and is now in the trust fund. I believe it is going to help our States in many ways, and I think in many parts of the United States it is going to provide some very, very healthy employment where it is needed. 
In addition, it seems to me that the chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, with the able assistance of Senator Baucus as its ranking member, and the entire committee, all of whom have voted in favor of this amendment, have put together a very good cross section of the kinds of things we need in these changing times to carry out our responsibility with reference to this gasoline money and get some national programs that are necessary and put as much of it as we can--91 percent minimum--to every State, as I understand it, in return for their dollars so that they can begin this process of gearing up to build more roads. And they will take a little while for that. This is a very big increase. They are not going to be able to start next month with a maximum effort in this program. It will take the rest of this year and part of next year before it is actually built up to the maximum. 
But I think the American people, probably on more than anything else we are going to be voting on around here--a broad cross section, not a little special interest or a sliver of our society, but a very broad cross section--want more roads, if we have gasoline tax money to pay for them. And many States have put their own gasoline tax on it and are even doing more. 
There is nothing more frustrating for the people in my home State in a growing city to find out--already when we are not even 1 million in population--that their roads are clogged, the freeways are not working, and nothing causes them to wonder more what is going on in terms of planning and appropriate expenditure of resources. We are about to say to them that I think this is about as good as we can do, with all of the competing interests. This is about as fair a program for all of the sovereign States and for the kind of special highway research and the like that is necessary. 
So from my standpoint, I am on the amendment. I wasn't on the original Byrd-Gramm amendment. We had some very lengthy debates trying to arrive at the right dollar number--we did-- that permit me in good conscience to say that we have a good bill. There are some very legitimate questions. And, if there were Senators here, they could probably ask me, with some degree of difficulty--and I would have some degree of difficulty answering them--that is, since every year we put in an appropriated amount for these highways that comes within the annual cap that we must live with, the annual total domestic program spending, how are we going to add this to the entourage of American programs that exist and still meet that cap when we didn't contemplate this program? 
Let me repeat, I see no difficulty doing that for the next year. We have to find just a little over $1 billion to accomplish that purpose in the first year. It grows a little bit, because contract authority is slow to spend, and it will get bigger. In the fourth and fifth year, it will be bigger, and then well beyond the caps that will be spent. But caps won't be around in the last year of this expenditure. Nonetheless, I believe that since this is so vitally important, that we will find the wherewithal to meet our caps--that is, meet our total domestic expenditures--and, yet, be able to fund this program. 
If some Senator, insisting on knowing precisely what program would be constrained, cut back or eliminated in order to pay for it, I wouldn't be prepared to tell you that. But I am prepared to tell you that the Budget Committee will have to do that. It will make some recommendations on how we pay for this program and maintain the authenticity and variety of our caps where we believe that our balanced budget will be a balanced budget. I think we can get there. 
I thank everybody who participated, and all who have joined today in this amendment can say they were part of the original amendment which pushed this forward. And I have no quibble with them. There were a lot of Senators on that--not quite as many as the proponents would have liked. I had a little bit to do with that. I asked some not to go on so that we could make an agreement. I hope they are not feeling put upon, having waited and now to be able to vote for this bill and be on it. I don't like to do that, but I sort of thought it would be better for everyone if we slowed up a little bit. And it turned out well. 
I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, shortly, the Congressional Budget Office--that is the official professional staff that has been in existence for many years that helps the Congress with budgeting--is going to issue--it is already prepared, it is ready for a formal issuance--an analysis of the President's budgetary proposals for the year 1999. 
Before I tell the Senate what they are going to conclude, let me hearken back to when the President issued his budget. There were many Senators who asked me, `How can the President have so many new domestic programs when we have an agreed-upon limit for the year 1999 and the year 2000 and the year 2001, all the way to the year 2003, that doesn't permit any growth in the Federal domestic program?' 
As a matter of fact, to be accurate, it permits .5 percent growth, which the Congressional Budget Office has said, doing the arithmetic, it is even high; you cannot grow that much. 
So I was being asked: Where can the President find money for his education initiative--whether you are for it or against it--for his child care proposal--whether you are for it or against it --and a long shopping list of programs? And I believe I said then, and said on the floor of the Senate, I do not believe he can. I believe he has tried to find a way to spend more than the agreement says we can spend, but says he isn't by transferring revenues and receipts to the Appropriations Committee so they can spend the money and take credit for the revenues and receipts and other matters like that. 
Well, as a matter of fact, the Congressional Budget Office says that the President is $68 billion in excess of the agreed-upon amounts we can spend for each of these 5 years--$68 billion over the budget agreement caps on the domestic discretionary programs, on the domestic program part of the appropriations process. 
Now, that is very important, because to the extent that that is correct, then obviously, unless Senators want to go back and restrain and cut and eliminate domestic programs, they are clearly not going to be able to fund very much of the President's new domestic initiative list that was forthcoming and stated in his State of the Union address. 
Now, frankly, I did not believe, as one who has worked on this for some time, that the President could exchange matters in that way, and what I said has now been vindicated by the professionals who do the work for the Congress. If you could do it that way, then obviously these agreed-upon caps would be meaningless, for all you would have to do is find revenues and receipts, and the Government could grow and grow in terms of the amount that we spend and still say that we are within the agreed-upon caps because you offset the receipts against the expenditures. 
Apparently, the Congressional Budget Office said that is not possible and then found that some of the expenditures are going to spend out more than the President says. Now, that is interesting, because if you wonder where we are on surpluses, you know the President said we had a $220 billion surplus over 5 years. The Congressional Budget Office, in its report, says the surplus for the 5 years, Mr. President, will be less than half of that, it will be $108 billion--slightly less than one-half of what he predicted. 
In addition to that fact, which should sober us up a bit, this professional evaluation done for us by an independent entity--not the economists who work for the President, and not the President's Office of Management and Budget, but an independent group--they also say that the budget, the way the President is spending it, goes out of kilter and that in the year 2000 we are in deficit again. In other words, we come out, have a little surplus--a little surplus--and then in 2000 we are in deficit again. We come out of it shortly afterwards. But it does put us in a very awkward position, as we speak of the accumulation of surpluses over time, to find that the numbers we are going to be forced to use are going to say there is no surplus in the year 2000. 
Now, I wish that the President was right in his $220 billion surplus over 5 years. I wondered about it, especially with all the new spending. But I was today to some extent--some sober language enters our discussions now, a little sobering-up with reference to where we are. And, I will insert in the Record the Congressional Budget Office's analysis in toto for everyone to read. 
One last comment. The Congressional Budget Office has modified the annual surpluses also substantially so that there are no significant surpluses in the early years--maybe 4, 5, 6, 7 billion dollars, but nothing significant. 
Now, that means that our job around here is a lot more difficult, because whenever anybody thinks it does not matter whether we overspend, we are going to be confronted with the sobering fact that we had better not be looking to the President's budget for guidance or advice because it will just make matters worse.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a man who is an accomplished public servant and friend--Ernest Thompson, mayor for the City of Artesia, New Mexico. On March 3, Mayor Thompson retires after guiding this southeastern New Mexico community for the past 26 years. 
Without any hesitation, it can be said that Artesia, the self-proclaimed `City of Champions,' is a better place to live because of Ernest Thompson. 
I want to personally thank Mayor Thompson for being a friend and compatriot over the years. He ascended to the mayorship of Artesia in 1972, the same year I was elected to the U.S. Senate. Since then, we have developed a very good personal and working relationship that I believe has been as rewarding to the people of Artesia as it has been to us personally. 
Having once been in a mayoral position myself, I recognize Mayor Thompson's 26 years of public service as an example for anyone who wants to be in politics at the local level. His tenure represents a shining example of dedication, persistence, hard work, honesty and integrity. 
Like the artesian wells that were once common in the area, Artesians have a certain pride in their community that bubbles to the surface when they look at their past and to the future of their city. They are proud of the steady growth of their quaint town, its schools, and its bedrock values. In many cases, Ernest Thompson has helped foster that pride through his tenacious leadership. 
When he leaves office this spring, he will leave to his successor a city with greater economic growth and job opportunities, better roads and infrastructure, and increased services for children and seniors. Through booms and busts over the past quarter century, Ernest Thompson has been a staunch promoter and champion of Artesia, and a stalwart defender for the rights and needs of small towns throughout the country. 
Mr. President, let me take a moment to recount some background on my admirable friend, Ernest Thompson. 
A native of central Texas, Ernest Thompson moved to Artesia in 1939 to work in the oil and gas industry, which is a major component of the economy in this region. After decades of work and dedication to his family, he retired from his job as a purchasing agent with Navajo Refining Company in Artesia. 
Without previous political experience, Thompson was elected mayor of Artesia in 1972, and has maintained a dynamic presence in the community as a member of the Artesia Rotary Club, New Mexico Gideons, Artesia Quarterback Club, and the Parents and Boosters Club. For almost 50 years, he has been actively involved in promoting the Boy Scouts of America in southeast New Mexico. 
But I believe his most notable contributions to the public have been as mayor. As Artesia has grown, Ernest Thompson has helped to improve the city as a whole. Since 1972, the city has gained extensive infrastructure improvements including a new wastewater treatment plant, water lines, flood protection structures, and street improvements. Under his administration, the city built a new law enforcement center, an airport terminal, a community center, as well as new fire stations. Artesia's public library and senior center have been expanded and remodeled. 
Through it all, Ernest Thompson has worked effectively at state and federal levels to win support for his city. As a member of the Southeast New Mexico Economic Development District, he has toiled to build the area as a whole. A member of the National League of Cities since 1973, Mayor Thompson rallied for towns with fewer than 50,000 residents as president of the Small Cities Advisory Council. He is a member of the League's Finance, Administration, and Intergovernmental Relations Committee. 
It is through this work to improve the City of Champions that Mayor Thompson and I have become friends. 
I take pride in having played a role in winning for Artesia the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. I greatly admire city leaders who are innovative in creating opportunities to bring good jobs to their community. Mayor Thompson, with the support of the city counselors, county commission and citizens of Artesia, exhibited such innovation in attracting FLETC to the city in 1989. He greatly helped in my efforts to convince the Treasury Department that Artesia would make an attractive host city for the training facility. 
Almost 10 years after we landed FLETC, I am still impressed with the innovation displayed by Mayor Thompson and the community to bring opportunity to the area. Buying the abandoned Artesia Christian College campus and actively working to find a suitable tenant--in this case a FLETC satellite facility--added a new and welcome facet to the area economy. 
Taken as a whole, FLETC and other accomplishments will stand as a monument to the 26 years of leadership provided by Mayor Thompson. I will always admire him and his qualities as a leader. I do not say goodbye, but congratulations and thank you. I still look forward to his sage advice and discussions about Artesia, Eddy County, New Mexico and our nation. 
Finally, I think it is appropriate to note that while Ernest Thompson was working as Artesia's mayor, he was at the same time a dedicated husband and father. I know his dear wife, Grace, is thankful for his love, dedication and care during personally trying times. Together they are a marvelous couple. 
Mr. President, I invite the entire Senate to take note of this tribute to an outstanding local leader as he retires from public office. I ask them to join me and the people of Artesia in expressing gratitude to Mayor Ernest Thompson for all he has done on behalf of others.

Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you, Madam President. 
We have reached, to the extent that the budget chairman could have some kind of influence, agreement on making sure that we fund this new 4.3 cents, which Senator Gramm last year had moved from the general fund to the trust fund for highways. My role was to make sure that we did not spend any more than the 4.3 cents portion of that which goes to the highway programs of this country. 
You would be surprised what differing opinions there were about what is the right dollar number, because there are different versions of what one was trying to do with the Byrd-Gramm bill and what Senator Chafee was trying to do with his bill and what I was trying to advocate. 
But let me say to the Senators--some of whom have not gone on the Byrd-Gramm bill because they were wondering what its impact on the budget would be--I cannot say it will not have any impact, because if I showed up here and said that, knowing what I know about the budget, I would be laughed off the Senate floor, because it is a substantial addition to the trust fund, which would not have been there had Senator Gramm not moved that 4.3 cents from the general fund, where it was being used before for deficit reduction as part of President Clinton's first budget, and there would not be this additional money. 
So I had a difficult problem with it. And some Senators were waiting for me to suggest that we would not have to break the caps, that is, the agreed upon annual expenditure levels written into law for the next 5 years which, as I will repeat over and over on this floor, are dollar numbers. And that is not a process. That means we have written into statute, law, how much we can spend in appropriated expenditures--the 13 bills we do plus the highway bill and a few other things. That is the total amount each year. If you spend more than that, then all of Government gets an across-the-board sequester cut. 
We did our best to arrive at, what is the number. I think it is fair to say that it was somewhere between a total of $171 billion and $174 billion or $175 billion; and then we settled on $173 billion. That is a pretty fair number from the standpoint of asking the Congressional Budget Office: How much will it spend? How much contract authority do you need to have all of that money obligated? And that is where we are. 
Now, that will be divided over the 6 years. The first 6 years is already settled, because we have completed it. But the next 5 will have new activity. And I think by the time Senator Chafee's committee produces the bill, each State can look and see what it is going to get in relation to donor and donee States. And I believe it is going to be a very satisfactory bill. 
There are a lot of other things that have to be done besides just pour highways in the country. There is some research that has to be done. There is some money that has to go to States that have special problems because they have an awful lot of public lands in their States. There are Indian roads, which in the last 6 years we have started funding. They are the poorest, in roads, of any group in America, and their reservations are the poorest, in terms of transportation, of any. That money has to be in here. 
But I think under Senator Chafee's leadership there will be no donor-donee disparity exceeding 91 percent. They will get 91 percent of the money back. And the other part will go to the various programs that are national in scope or specific. I think that is a rather good final conclusion. I regret having to have stood in the way of this bill for so long. But when it finally comes down to it, I think we all understand better what we are going to do. 
Now, to the final observation: Can we fund this bill and not have to break the caps? I can tell you that we certainly will be able to in the year 1999 in the budget that we are going to write. Now, this money spends out more rapidly as years go on. I am just bound to do the best I can and to tell it as honestly as I can. 
I believe we will be able to meet the caps and do this, but it may very well be that in a few years we will not be able to do that. I do not think it is going to be a big disparity. And I think that everybody understands that the people of this country deserve that highway trust fund moneys be spent on highways. That is why it has been very difficult to say, we should not have this program. Because that money is there, what can it be used for? Since we voted overwhelmingly to put it in that trust fund, we ought to spend it for highways. There is nothing by way of infrastructure in our Nation--to use the word as generously as you want--there is nothing more wanting in the country than the highway infrastructures of our respective sovereign States. And we will make a pretty big dent in catching up with this bill. 
So I am pleased to be a part of it. I didn't write the bill, 
but it was a good experience. And I want to close by saying in particular, when you have a leader who wants to get things done--Trent Lott, our leader, wants to get things done. We could have gone on for I don't know how many more days, but we finished in about 3 or 4 days of rather lengthy sessions getting as much input as we could. 
Now the Senate will speak. We will look at this bill that Senator Chafee will produce, a substitute that reaches the conclusions that this negotiating team had, and then the Senate will decide what it is going to do. I, for one, have committed that I am going to support the product that is forthcoming. Not every bit of it is what I would do, but I think overall it is probably the best we could do for our country. I hope it leaves the Senate with a very large majority. The House still has to do theirs. We have to go to conference. And States, by May 1, ought to be getting some additional obligational authority. 
I thank the Senators for their participation, and I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce my own version of campaign finance reform, the `Grassroots Campaign and Common Sense Federal Election Reform Act of 1998.' 
During the past several Congresses, I continuously have introduced straightforward reform legislation to deal with four specific campaign finance issues: (1) out-of-state contributions; (2) PACs; (3) soft money; and (4) super-wealthy candidates. 
This legislation again addresses these age-old concerns, and also attempts to deal with some of the new problems we discovered during the investigation of campaign abuses in the 1996 election cycle by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs. 
Before I get to those new issues, I'd like to talk a little about how this bill will address the major problem I have raised over and over again on the floor of the Senate whenever we have debated campaign finance reform. For many years, I have felt that the biggest problem with our elections is that they no longer belong to the voters, to those at the grassroots level, to the constituents we originally were sent here to serve. 
Instead, our campaigns now belong to special-interest PACs, super-wealthy candidates who can essentially buy their congressional seats, and rich contributors who donate large sums of soft money to political parties and groups for use in so-called `issue advocacy' ads and contribute the maximum allowable under the law to candidates, even if those candidates do not come from their own home state. 
My bill begins by making four straightforward changes to return campaigns to the voters. First, it requires that candidates raise at least sixty percent of their money from sources within their own state. In my mind, the best campaigns are those funded by a large number of contributions from among the candidate's own constituents. This bill would make that a reality in virtually every federal campaign. 
Second, the bill bans all corporate, bank and labor union PACs and limits so-called ideological PAC contributions to $500 per candidate. I understand that there are concerns about a PAC ban, but I believe the best way to return elections to the electorate is to eliminate special interest PAC contributions to candidates. 
Third, the bill deals with the wealthy candidate problem in a way that I believe is consistent with the First Amendment. Rather than place arbitrary and unconstitutional limits on the amount of personal wealth a candidate could spend on behalf of his or her own campaign, the bill simply requires the candidate to disclose the fact that they plan to spend their own money and raises the contribution limits for the opponents of Senate candidates who intend to spend more than $250,000 of their own money or House candidates who intend to spend more than $100,000. The bill in no way prohibits wealthy candidates from spending their own money- that is their constitutional right. But the bill does level the playing field by raising contribution limits for candidates who face opponents with massive personal wealth at their disposal. 
Finally, the bill gets at the biggest problem we face today--soft money and its use for so-called issue advocacy. My bill limits soft money contributions to $100,000 per individual per party during each election cycle, while simultaneously increasing and indexing the limits on regulated federal contributions to candidates and national parties. I have long felt that Congress should limit soft money because soft money confuses the electorate and permits campaign contributions to come from clandestine, obscure sources. 
After the hearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee this year, I am convinced now more than ever that we must do something to eliminate the pernicious effect of soft money on our political system. Who can forget Roger Tamraz? He's the oil pipeline financier, who told the Committee that he had given $300,000 in soft money to the DNC and gladly would have given $600,000 for a meeting with the decision-makers at the White House and in the Executive Branch. My bill would prohibit the unlimited giving of soft money by wealthy individuals 
like Mr. Tamraz who use soft money to buy access to government. 
My bill also would deal with one of the most pernicious uses of soft money- so-called `issue advocacy' political advertisements- and it does so in a way that clearly is constitutional. My bill takes the middle ground on issue advocacy and requires anyone who spends more than $25,000 or more on radio or television advertising which mentions a federal candidate by name or likeness to make certain disclosures to the FEC. I have long felt that disclosure is the best way to pursue campaign reform. It has been said that `sunlight is the best disinfectant.' In the context of campaign reform, the sunlight of disclosure also is the best policy because it does no damage to the constitutional rights of individuals and groups to engage in political speech. 
Mr. President, last year's Governmental Affairs Committee hearings exposed repeated and rampant violations of the existing campaign laws. We saw on numerous occasions blatant violations of the prohibitions against soliciting and receiving foreign money contributions, against money laundering- making contributions in the name of another, and the law against raising money on federal property. I thought that these laws were pretty clear. 
Now, the Attorney General tells us that because soft money is not a `contribution' under the federal election laws, it was legal for the President and Vice President to solicit soft money contributions on federal property. While I do not necessarily agree with the Attorney General's interpretation of current law, I certainly believe we need to make it absolutely clear that government officials cannot use federal property to raise any campaign funds, including soft money. My bill does just that. 
Finally, Mr. President, my bill deals with one other major issue- the use of union dues for political purposes. Mr. President, I can think of no other campaign activity which is more un-American than the mandatory, compulsory taking of union dues for political purposes. The essence of democracy is that political speech must be voluntary. For many union workers today, that is not the case. My bill would require unions to get the permission of all members before using their dues for political purposes. I know many colleagues on the other side of the aisle are opposed to this idea, but I think they know it is the right thing to do. 
Mr. President, I introduce this bill today so my constituents in New Mexico will know where I stand on the issue of campaign finance reform. My record is clear- I have introduced at least three bills which have included the reforms I have discussed here today. But, I am unable to support McCain/Feingold for three key reasons. 
First, McCain/Feingold goes too far in its attempts to address the express advocacy-issue advocacy problem. While I am sympathetic to any efforts to deal with the problems of the 1996 election, I believe that we must do so in a way which passes constitutional muster. McCain/Feingold's overly broad definition of `express advocacy' fails that test. McCain/Feingold defines express advocacy to include any radio or television ads referring to a federal candidate which are broadcast within 60 days of any election, regardless of whether those ads truly are `issue advocacy' ads. I believe that such a ban on the exercise of political speech would eventually be found unconstitutional. 
Second, McCain/Feingold fails to ban soft money in a way which will pass Supreme Court scrutiny. Under McCain/Feingold, state parties are prohibited from disbursing soft money for use in `federal election activity.' The bill goes on to define `federal election activity' to include any `generic campaign activity' conducted in connection with an election in which a candidate for Federal office appears on the ballot. To me, this means that a state party could not use non-federal soft money for activity which strictly supports a state candidate just because that candidate appears on the ballot with a federal candidate. While some may believe otherwise, I do not believe that Congress possesses the authority to so regulate state campaigns. 
Finally, Mr. President, I cannot support McCain/Feingold because it does very little to address the problem of the compulsory use of union dues for political purposes. McCain/Feingold codifies the Beck decision, which only applies to non-union workers and only requires unions to provide notice of the workers' right to request a refund of the portion of their dues used for political purposes. I believe unions should be prohibited from using any employee dues for political purposes, whether they are taken from members or non-members, unless the union receives permission up front and in advance from the employee. 
Mr. President, campaign finance reform is an issue which must be resolved thoughtfully and with respect for the First Amendment. I believe that my bill offers just such an approach. I also believe that, despite the earnest efforts of its proponents, many provisions of McCain/Feingold simply would not pass the constitutional scrutiny of the Supreme Court.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this year New Mexico is commemorating the 400th anniversary of its first Spanish Settlement. In 1598, the first Spanish expedition arrived from Santa Barbara, Mexico, and settled near San Juan Pueblo in the EspanAE6ola valley. 
The Spanish settlement of New Mexico in 1598 predates the Pilgrims' landing at Plymouth Rock in 1620, by 22 years. It also predates the settlement of Jamestown in 1607 by 9 years. 
New Mexicans are exploring their roots with a renewed interest. The Pueblo Indians of New Mexico helped the Spanish to survive and flourish. The Spanish brought new crops, mining, weaving, cattle and other livestock, Christianity, and Spanish government. 
Although the history of two cultures meeting in New Mexico has had its difficult times, such as the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, New Mexico is today known for its harmonious intercultural life, including much intermarriage. 
Mr. President, I am proud to have 60 cosponsors of this resolution. Senator Lott, the Senate Majority Leader, and Senator Daschle, the Senate Minority Leader, are both original cosponsors of this resolution. 
This year we commemorate the brave and adventurous Spanish families who first set roots in the beautiful Land of Enchantment. By commemorating these early events, we are also honoring the important cultural, political, and economic contributions those Spanish families and their descendants have made to enrich our state and nation. 
The OnAE6ate expedition was part of a large Spanish effort to expand the Spanish Empire, convert more people to Christianity, and find great wealth in the New World. There was great excitement at the beginning of the 16th Century about these prospects. 
Spaniards like Hernan Cortes and Francisco Pizzaro (cousins from Medelli in and Cuidad Trujillo) left Spain in the early 1500's to seek their fortunes and spread the glory of Spain. 
When Mayan gold was taken back to Spain from the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico in 1517 by Hernandez de Cordoba, it fueled the fires of the Spanish enthusiasm for finding the legendary Seven Cities of Gold in the New World. 
Spanish explorers like Ponce de Leon, Francisco Coronado, and Don Juan de OnAE6ate explored modern-day America from Florida to California. 
Some 400 Spanish settlers were led by Don Juan de OnAE6ate from Santa Barbara, Mexico, through El Paso to San Juan Pueblo (named by OnAE6ate for John the Baptist). The soldiers, priests, laymen, families, servants and their 83 wagons and 7,000 animals formed a 2 to 4 mile-long caravan as they journeyed up the Rio Grande. 
When they arrived at San Juan Pueblo on July 11, 1598, they established the first Spanish capital in the New World. They built the San Gabriel chapel and convento. Today, a beautiful replica of the San Gabriel chapel stands in the EspanAE6ola Plaza. 
It is well known that the Spanish people founded the oldest cities in America. First, St. Augustine, Florida was founded in 1565, followed by Santa Fe, New Mexico, the second oldest city in what is now the United States. In 1610, Santa Fe was named the capital of New Mexico making it the oldest capital city in America today. 
Before Santa Fe became the capital of the New Mexico territory, the San Gabriel mission served as the first Spanish Capital of New Mexico, beginning in 1598. San Gabriel is at San Juan Pueblo where the Rio Chama meets the Rio Grande. Its Indian name was Yunge Oweenge. 
The designation and renaming of this site by its first Governor, Don Juan de OnAE6ate, as San Gabriel del Yunge Oweenge marks the first permanent Spanish settlement in the west. 
1998 marks the 400th Anniversary of the founding of San Gabriel del Yunge Oweenge in the EspanAE6ola Valley of present-day New Mexico. 
This resolution highlights the importance of the Spanish explorations in America and pays tribute to the growing population of Hispanics who are anticipated to be twenty percent of our national population by the year 2030, with a projected population of 60 million Hispanics. Two-thirds of the 26 million Hispanics in America (who make up eleven percent of our population today) are of Mexican origin, and 70 percent of Hispanics live in 4 states: California, Texas, New York, and Florida. 
New Mexico has the highest percentage of Hispanics at 39 percent or about 660,000 residents out of a total 1995 state population of 1.7 million. Albuquerque, New Mexico, will be the site of a new Hispanic Cultural Center to celebrate and preserve Hispanic culture including literature, performing arts, visual arts, music, culinary arts, and language arts. 
New Mexico will be the center of many exciting events throughout the year to commemorate this important historic milestone. New Mexicans are looking forward to fiestas, balls, parades, and other stimulating events to mark this historic occasion. 
The Archbishop of Santa Fe will be opening a Jubilee year in January. Among other events, he will hold an encuentro at Santo Domingo Pueblo to mark the meeting of the missionaries with the Pueblo Peoples. 
The City of EspanAE6ola will have a fiesta in July to commemorate the actual arrival of the Spanish into the area. Santa Fe, Las Vegas, Taos, Socorro, Aztec, Albuquerque, and other New Mexico towns and cities will be holding such special events as fiestas, historic reenactments, a State Fair Pageant, an historic Spanish costume ball, and parades. Seminars and lectures will abound. 
State Fair pageant plans include a reenactment of De Vargas' reentry into New Mexico, a review of the Pueblo Revolt and its ramifications, life under the American flag during the middle to late 1800's, and a patriotic tribute to all Hispanics who have fought for the United States. This reentry spectacular will be performed twice before large New Mexico State Fair audiences. It will also be televised. 
This resolution also asks the President to issue a proclamation declaring 1998 is a year to commemorate the arrival of Hispanics and celebrate their growth in importance in our nation's culture and economy. 
This Senate Resolution calls upon the people of the United States to support, promote, and participate in the many New Mexico Cuarto-centenario activities being planned to commemorate the historic event of the first Spanish settlement in the Southwest Region of the United States. 
Mr President, I thank my colleagues for their overwhelming support of Senate Resolution 148. This resolution designates 1998 as the `New Mexico Cuartocentenario' to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the first Spanish settlement in New Mexico.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the override of the President's veto of the fiscal year 1998 Military Construction Appropriations Bill. On November 13, the President vetoed H.R. 2631 which would have restored funding for the 38 military construction projects he earlier line-item vetoed. It had passed the House by a veto proof margin (352-64) November 8, 1997, and been passed by the Senate in its own version of the same bill by a vote of 69-30. 
Mr. President, I believe the Senate will overwhelmingly override the President's veto of this bill. The President listed as one of the criteria used that none of the 38 projects he line-item vetoed was requested by the DoD in FY98. I want to caution the President. Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution of the United States says the Congress has the responsibility to raise and support the military. That means that he does not have the only say how to raise and support our troops. If the Congress believes that certain projects will support our military, it is our right and responsibility to fund those projects. I supported the line-item veto when it was originally passed, but I agree with the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee and others who have stated that his action on this particular bill was an abuse of authority. 
The President stated in his line-item veto announcement, `The balanced budget that I signed into law this summer will extend America's fiscal discipline into the next century. It will bring enormous dividends in our long term economic health. But it will continue to require difficult choices. American government will live within its means.' 
It should be clear to everyone, neither the Military Construction Appropriations bill, or any other appropriations bill this Congress has passed, violates the Budget Agreement. America is living within its means, and none of the 38 projects the President vetoed changes that fact. 
The President states that the projects he is canceling do not make substantial contribution to the quality of life and well-being of our men and women in uniform. I believe that those who put this list together for the President made a grave error in calculating what exactly can be called a contribution to the quality of life and well-being of our men and women in uniform. It is my belief that calculation should take into account the health and safety of those working at the facility in question. In our case, at WSMR, $6.9 million was appropriated for Launch Complex Revitalization. At the current Launch Complex, personnel are potentially exposed to HANTA virus due to infestation by rodents below existing structures. If that does not qualify as making a contribution to the quality of life, I do not know what else will. 
In addition the President line-item vetoed $14 million for the construction of a new Theater Air Command Control and Simulation Facility and Kirtland Air Force Base. This facility was in the Department of Defense's five year plan, it met the President's requirement for 35% design being completed, and it was deemed to have been a military essential project. 
In both cases, as with the rest of the 38 projects the President vetoed, these items are important to strengthening and protecting the health and safety of the Department of Defense and those who work at these facilities. The President made grave errors when he put this list together, and I am gratified that after a lot of hard work, today we will be correcting his mistake once and for all. All of these projects were scrutinized by the Appropriations Committee in detail. The Committee found that in many cases the criteria were not correctly applied. This effort is to correct those mistakes. 
I ask all my colleagues to support the veto override. I believe it is the appropriate action for us to take. I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate is considering the question as to whether the Senate shall override the President's veto of legislation to disapprove his line item veto of projects in Public Law 105-45, the FY 1998 Military Construction Appropriations Act. 
In his first use of the line-item veto authority on an appropriations measure, the President proposed to cancel $287 million in budget authority for 38 military construction projects. 
The President used three criteria upon which to evaluate these military construction projects for use of his line-item veto authority: The project was not requested in the President's 1998 budget; the project would not substantially improve the quality of life of military service members and their families; and the project almost certainly would not begin construction in 1998 because the Defense Department reports that no design work has been done on it. 
All of these projects were scrutinized by the Appropriations Committee in detail. The committee found that in many cases the President's criteria were not correctly applied. The Appropriations Committee found that in many cases-- 
The project was included in the Department of Defense's future year defense plan; 
The project was mission essential; 
The project would enhance readiness, safety or working conditions for service personnel; 
A site had been identified for the project; 
Money had been spent on the design of the project; and 
The Department could begin to execute the project during fiscal year 1998. 
Based on this information, the Senate passed S. 1292 on October 30 by a vote of 69 to 30. The President vetoed this legislation on November 11. The House voted to override his veto on February 5, by a vote of 347 to 69. While the Supreme Court has not ruled on the constitutionality of this legislation, lower Federal court has ruled it unconstitutional. If that ruling stands, the 38 projects will be restored. We should go ahead now to permit that to happen. Also, the criteria that the Senate Appropriations Committee applied to these projects are still valid. For that reason alone, the projects should be approved. 
Mr. President, this is the first test of the line-item veto on an appropriations bill. I support overriding the President's veto.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if you would remind me when I have used 3 minutes. 
Mr. President, I do not recall the exact day but sometime in the not too distant past the Senate was asked to vote on an amendment by the distinguished Senator, Fritz Hollings. Now I am referring to an amendment that would have amended the Constitution of the United States and permitted Congress to control campaign expenditures. Obviously the Constitution of the United States does not give us the latitude to control expenditures in campaigns that we are involved in, or that House Members, the President and the Vice President are involved in. 
I ask the distinguished manager of the bill, how many votes did the Hollings amendment get?

Mr. DOMENICI. So 38 Senators--excuse my voice. I have a bad cold of some type. And to those listening, it is Pete Domenici even though it does not sound like me. So 38 Senators had the guts to vote on the real issue, and the real issue is that the Constitution of the United States has a great big amendment that guarantees freedom of speech. 
I did not use to understand how the right of freedom of speech was related to campaign expenditures until I read a few of the United States Supreme Court decisions. And I am very pleased that they got the message. The Court understood when it first ruled that you could not limit an individual who wanted to spend his own money on a campaign. You could not limit the amount of money he spent because that money was his freedom of speech. That is what he used it for. 
And I equate it here on the floor, and ask the question, what do we apply, in the largest and greatest sense, freedom of speech to in America? We apply it to the media of America. We have freedom of speech, but really when you look at it, it is the freedom of the newspapers, the radios, the televisions, the editorial writers, the column writers, all of whom have this absolute freedom to get involved in our campaigns. 
That is why the Supreme Court said that spending money on your own campaign is exercising your freedom of speech. If four newspapers in a candidate's State are writing editorials against him, he ought to be able to spend his money even if he bought a piece of the paper and said this is my editorial, and paid for it with his own money. 
Now, what is wrong with the bill before us today--not necessarily the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Maine, who has worked very hard on this, she called me, we talked about it. It is a good idea, but essentially the bill itself is so flawed in terms of the analogy I am using with reference to the right and freedom of speech and the right and freedom to spend money to get your message across, that it is at odds with the decisions of the Supreme Court. 
I don't think there is a chance that the underlying bill comes even close to establishing some balance that would in some way change the Supreme Court's mind about the exercise of this freedom and this right. They have essentially said it is not vested in only a newspaper or a TV station or an anchorman or an editorial writer or letters to the editor. They have also said that right is vested in many, many entities who may want to spend money to get their message across--be it criticism or something that is positive about a candidate. 
I want to thank the distinguished Senator from Kentucky for his stalwart presentations on the floor which have gone to the heart of the issue, the issue being before we jump into abridging freedom of speech we better very much know what we are doing and not speculate and guess about it. And, yes, the Supreme Court has done an excellent job of saying they will be the gatekeeper on this. I think without that we would be trying to tell everybody how to run campaigns and the American people would end up saying, isn't that something? They are telling all of us they know how to run their campaigns and they are ordering us around in their own campaigns. So I think that is the flip side of this.

Mr. DOMENICI. While I am here and while the chairman of the committee is here, let me suggest that it is time we at the national level stop looking at proliferating programs on behalf of education. We don't need any more programs on behalf of education. Let me say what I think we ought to do. Let me state for the Record the General Accounting Office, assisting the Budget Committee, has found the following: We have 86 teacher training programs in 9 agencies and offices of the Government. I repeat, 86 teacher training programs. At-risk and delinquent youth, the Federal Government has 127 at-risk and delinquent programs in 15 agencies and departments. Some of them you don't even have jurisdiction over because they are in Interior and all kinds of departments. Young children, the Federal Government has over 90 early childhood programs in 11 agencies and 20 offices. 
It is time we square with the American people and say we have just been duplicating, adding programs on programs because there is a problem out there. Yet today we wake up and read the article in the paper this morning. One wonders whether we have any idea with all this proliferation of programs that I just read. 
Frankly, Mr. President, if we ask the GAO to take another five areas they will find a proliferation just as large and significant as previously mentioned. When you wake up today and read this article--let's take another look and try to do it. It doesn't mean more. It means go to the problem and try to solve the problem. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, today, for the fifth consecutive year I am going to submit a resolution on behalf of myself, Senators Dodd, Cochran, Bennett, Lieberman, Mikulski, Kempthorne, Dorgan, Frist, and Cleland. This resolution that we have introduced 5 consecutive years sets aside the week of October 18-24 of this year for what we call National Character Counts Week. 
About 6 1/2 years ago, a very distinguished group of Americans from all walks of life met for 3 or 4 days to talk about the character of America and the character of American people and decided after 3 days of debate that there were, in fact, six pillars of character. If these pillars could permeate our society and our children, we would all be better for it, America would be better for it and, most of all, our lives would be better for it. 
These six pillars were determined at that point in time and they have remained ever since as trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. They are referred to as the six pillars of character. 
Mr. President and fellow Senators, when one looks at what has developed in these years, to help our teachers--be they in private or public schools--talk to students and teach them about these six pillars, it is obvious that these are basic concepts, basic ideas that hardly anyone in America would disagree with. That is not to say that anybody is preaching, but would we not like our children to learn the value of honesty? That is what trustworthiness is. Would we not like our young children and even our business community to be cognizant of and practice respect? And would we not want, as our children grow and as people begin to understand what holds a country together, would we not want responsibility to become part of the vocabulary of every child, every young person? 
I can go through all six, and I can find different words to express each of the six. It is obvious, however, if you move throughout the State of New Mexico or the State of Georgia--I note my good friend, Senator Cleland is here--if you ask a group of people from all walks of life, various religions, various degrees of faith, even agnostics: `Do you object to our young people learning trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship?', you rarely get a negative response. 
Now, this six pillars-character approach is spreading throughout our country, and those who came up with the idea and the foundation which has the right to use these pillars of character do not intend to impose from on high; rather they ask that individuals, schools, leaders, organizations such as the Boy Scouts, NFL player groups, adopt these six pillars and then do something about them. 
I would be less than honest if I did not tell you the place these six pillars are spreading most rapidly is the right place--in the schools. Teachers are excited, believe it or not. Some have expressed to me they are now permitted to do what they always thought they should do but because we got all mixed up in terms of what you couldn't do in a classroom, these kind of lessons were left out. It now seems that without much objection, many school boards have said let's do it. Teachers are trying to permeate the halls, the classrooms, the meeting rooms and the minds of young people with these six pillars. 
I will in my prepared remarks talk just a little bit about my State, the State of New Mexico. We organized partnerships with a number of mayors, the Governor joined, and we have now about 90 percent of all the schoolchildren in the State of New Mexico, parochial and private, that are exposed and taught and work with these six pillars--not some other words that describe it--these six words. 
So there is a commonality now of usage of words. A commonality of examples that are used. Mr. President, you might have been thrilled to go to a grade school in New Mexico with me on a given day when the pillar called `responsibility' had been the subject matter in that school for one month. The way a significant number of schools do it is take one pillar a month. Teach everything else you teach, but also include the word of the month in these classes. You would have walked into that grade school and seen the walls plastered with signs and pictures the students had drawn about the word of the month, such as the word responsibility. You could then go to an assembly where all the little children with their teachers talked about responsibility for about an hour and gave awards where young people said that is the most responsible student in the class and this is what he or she did. It is rather exciting. 
Now, frankly, it is not the business of any State Department of Education, If character education is going to be done, each school has to desire to do it along with the principal, teachers, and parents. 
Needless to say, people ask, is it working? Frankly, I can't stand here and tell you I am absolutely certain of all the positive aspects, but I can tell you that we are beginning to get more than anecdotal information from schools that have been doing it for 2 or 3 years. They note that there is a noticeable change in behavior and relationship of children to children and, indeed, of teachers to children. Many would claim, indeed, that this does more for changing the character of our country in the right direction than almost anything that is going on out there except the organized activity of the faith people of the country as they proceed with their faith-filled lessons. 
In our State we are now experimenting with the very first group of businessmen who are trying to inculcate the six pillars of character, in an institutional way, into their businesses. They are going to try to see if they can incorporate these values as a part of the life of a business, the life of the employees, and all of their relationships to the public. They hope that these values will then be passed on to others, if indeed, it has a measure of success. 
Now, we are not unique. I happened to put the resolution in the Senate 5 years ago and asked ten Senators to join me. Former Senator Sam Nunn was one of the original ten. His successor, Senator Max Cleland, has joined us now as an original sponsor. He is here now in the chamber, and I will yield to him in a few minutes. 
I in no way stand here suggesting that there are not many better examples than my State of New Mexico. There probably are. I just feel very good every now and then, once a year, to tell the Senate a few exciting stories about what is going on in our State in this regard. In the prepared remarks I cite many other examples of how the six pillars are working and how the public is responding and how televisions and radio stations help promote these pillars. They are now kind of common, ordinary language among the people in the State of New Mexico. I think that is all a very good start. 
This resolution will designate the week of October 18-24, 1998, as National Character Counts Week, when individuals and organizations may observe specifically their programs and activities supporting character development. 
All of us who have been involved with character education programs know about the extraordinary growth of these efforts across the country. Regardless of our support here in Washington, the development of character programs the grassroots level has been the most exciting. Good character can be endorsed and supported by Government, but it is families, schools, and communities that make the real difference. 
Over the past 4 years since we initiated community-based Character Counts programs in New Mexico, the public and private schools in the State have incorporated the Character Counts message in most of the State's schools. Almost 200,000 students are receiving instruction and are involved in activities that promote the Six Pillars of Character: Trustworthiness, Respect, Responsibility, Fairness, Caring, and Citizenship. Whether the Six Pillars appear on billboards, on town waterbills, or are incorporated into a school's curriculum, the message of good character permeates the community. 
The six simple words are not just words in a vocabulary. They are concepts that have meaning to children and adults alike, resulting in tangible actions that change for the better how they relate to and interact with one another. Today, I would like mention just a couple of examples of how the Character Counts efforts in New Mexico are changing the daily lives of its citizens for the better. 
I would like to recount one of the most inspiring Character Counts initiatives I have seen in New Mexico. It is about Emerson Elementary School in Albuquerque. The school has 800 students speaking more than 11 languages. The school is located in a densely populated, culturally diverse and highly mobile area, with a 98.5 percent poverty rating. Many refer to this area of the city as a `war zone' because of its high crime rate. The challenges facing the school administration, teachers, and its Principal Linda Torres far exceed those of most schools; its academic challenges are as great as the community's social challenges. 
The Character Counts program at Emerson Elementary was initiated as a total Social Skills Curriculum, with the Six Pillars integrated into all its daily classes and reinforced with various activities to reward the students for good behavior. At the same time, the school utilizes a human services collaborative support program for the 500 families associated with the school. It works with social service organizations to ensure the entire family is assisted, whether it is providing nutritional advice or clothing to needy families. In an effort to maximize community involvement of adults and children, the school children adopted the Veterans Memorial Park across the street from the school as one of their civic projects. They help maintain and patrol the park, and since the project began there have been no problems with graffiti. 
Emerson Elementary has become a virtual community center in this area of the city and a true haven for the children and their parents. Principal Linda Torres believes that among all the conflicts that need addressing or resolving within the school and in the community, it is clear that the values that reside `inside a person' are as critical as anything the school attempts to provide. In summarizing the success of Character Counts, Principal Torres says, `the community gives back to the school and the school gives back to the community--it's not just a situation of taking, it's the concept of giving that makes a difference.' 
In another New Mexico community far to the south of Albuquerque near the Texas border is a medium-sized town, Las Cruces, that has embraced Character Counts in both its private and public schools, and within the community itself. 
As an example, the Las Cruces University Hills Elementary School sends parents regularly scheduled communications and newsletters explaining new Character Counts initiatives. Each month the school focuses on one of the six pillars with a school-wide assembly to kick off each new pillar. Teachers include the words in lessons throughout the school day, each day of the month. The students are urged to discuss their experiences and how the concepts relate to their daily lives. The school's monthly newsletters report how students identify with the various pillars. 
I believe the children's own words best express how they apply the Character Counts concepts to their daily lives: 
`Citizenship is caring about our country and other people * * * Make the community a better place by cleaning the environment and taking care of it. Take care of nature, animals, plants, and land. Be a nice neighbor.' 
Jammal: `In our group respect means treating one another equally, even if they are not good looking, handicapped, or if they're slow. Showing respect means not being bossy and treating people fairly. I respect people for what they are, and all their different abilities. When I show respect, I am kind and polite to people. My way of showing respect is by manners and helping others.' 
Brenna, Karina, Christopher, Spencer and Shoji: `If you want to be a respectful person, then it's a good time to start knowing about respect and be one to the end. Be polite and the world will be safe once again. If you respect others, respect is what you will get back.' 
Tyrel: Sometimes we forget that each and every day there are ways of practicing good character traits. Parents, teachers, civic and business organizations, and community leaders are responding with enthusiasm to this fairly simple program of teaching and practicing the tenets of good character. 
Creative community programs are developed so the messages are not confined to the classrooms but are shared by all citizens. In Albuquerque, a new program Character Counts in the Workplace is designed to apply the Six Pillars to workplace ethics. In Lea County, the Character Counts Board of Directors meets monthly to coordinate activities, with each community independently expanding its Character Counts message through its local festivities, service clubs, and schools. In Roswell, the Future Homemakers of America of Sierra Middle School, using the lessons learned about caring, assisted students at Valley View Elementary School with holiday crafts projects. 
In April, the State of New Mexico will host the National Character Counts Conference, followed by 2 days of its own State Conference. Just a quick review of a few of the planned meetings at the New Mexico Conference tells us of the variety of programs being developed throughout the State: the Police Role in Community Character Counts Programs; Join-A-School Projects--What to Do; Character Counts in the Workplace; At-Risk Youth and Character Counts; School and Community Youth Athletics; and Parenting for Character Development. These sessions clearly show how broadly-based the Character Counts activities have become throughout the State. 
When we first introduced the National Character Counts Week resolution in 1994, I doubt we could have envisioned how quickly parents, teachers, schools, towns, cities, and civic organizations would develop programs to address the issue of character building. It has universal appeal, and it has touched the lives of millions of our citizens. The `crisis in character' is being addressed by America's citizens, at the local level, where it matters most. I am very proud to be a part of this effort. Practicing the principles of good character pays enormous dividends not only to each of us personally but to countless generations in the future.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, over the last few months, I have been speaking out regularly on a wide range of nuclear issues that confront our country and the world, issues that have not been carefully addressed to optimize the positive impacts of these technologies and to minimize their associated risks. 
As I began this statement, I noted that nuclear issues are not exactly the ones that most of us focus on to hear cheers of public support. Nuclear issues typically have been relegated to back burners or only to attacks that wildly inflate their risks. 
Based on strong encouragement that I have received from people like Senator Nunn, John Deutch, Allan Bromley, Edward Teller and others, I intend to continue to speak and to seek national dialog on a wide range of nuclear issues. In fact, I will invite each of my Senate colleagues to participate in a nuclear issues caucus focused on issues ranging from nuclear power and waste to nuclear stockpiles. 
My goal is that out of this dialog and out of a rebirth of critical thinking on the roles of nuclear technology, we can craft policies that better meet the needs of the Nation and better utilize the power of nuclear technologies. Let me give you the flavor of some of these issues that I assert need careful reexamination. 
First, in 1997, the United States decided to halt research into reprocessing mixed oxides, or commonly called MOX fuel, in the hope that it would curtail other countries' pursuit of these technologies. Other countries proceeded to follow their own best interests and technical judgments. 
Today, many other countries are reprocessing and using MOX fuel, mixed oxide fuel. Now the United States is unable to use these technologies to meet nonproliferation needs and has largely been left out of the international nuclear fuels cycle. 
I contend we made a mistake then. The reason we made the decision is false. We said it is so that no others will do this and create some risks. Others have assessed that there are no risks, or few, and they have proceeded. 
Let me move on to another example. 
Today, we regulate radiation to extremely low levels based on what we have chosen to call in this country the `linear-no-threshold' model of radiation effects. That model, basically, asserts that the least bit of radiation exposure increases the risk of cancer, but scientific evidence does not support that assumption. As a result, the United States spends billions of dollars each year cleaning up sites to levels within 5 percent of natural background radiation, even though natural background radiation varies by large amounts; in fact, by over three times just in the United States and much larger amounts if we look outside the Nation. 
On another issue, today, nuclear energy provides 20 percent of the electricity of our Nation. In 1996, nuclear energy reduced U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from electric utilities by 25 percent. Does that sound interesting to anyone? Nuclear electrically generated power reduced U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent. That means that we produce that electricity clean in terms of global warming emissions, and we did this without imposing taxes or other costly limitations on the use of carbon-based energy forms, some of the suggestions that are being made now about taxing those energy sources that do create greenhouse gases to minimize their impact by using less. 
On another issue, today, we focus on the creation of bilateral accords with Russia to size our nuclear stockpile, and we expend much energy debating the pros and cons of START II versus START III. Instead, I believe that the United States should move away from sizing its nuclear stockpile in accordance with bilateral accords with Russia. Instead, within the limitations of existing treaties, the United States should move to a `threat-based stockpile,' driven by the minimal stockpile size that meets credible threat evaluations. 
That is just another issue in the nuclear field that we ought to be addressing and debating and thinking about and listening to some experts on. 
Today, many of the weapons in our stockpile and in the stockpile of Russia are on hair-trigger alert. I believe that both nations should consider de-alerting their nuclear stockpiles and even consider eliminating the ground-based leg of the nuclear triad. 
And I know this may not be doable, and the discussion may reveal that it is not prudent. But it should be talked about. 
Today, both the United States and Russia are dismantling weapons, but both nations are storing the classified components, the so-called pits from the weapons, that would enable either nation to quickly rebuild its arsenals. We are in serious need of a fast-paced program to convert classified weapon components into unclassified shapes that are quickly placed under international verification. Then that material should be transformed into MOX--which I discussed earlier--MOX fuel for use in civilian reactors, again with due haste. 
There are some who have prejudged this and will instantly say, no. I am suggesting the time is now to have a thorough discussion of these kinds of issues, because we made some mistakes 15, 20 and 25 years ago when we made some of the decisions that now guide our course in this very, very difficult area that I just spoke of with reference to nuclear arsenal components. 
Today, high-level nuclear waste is stored in 41 States. Much of that is spent civilian reactor fuel that is saturating the storage capacity at many sites. The United States should move to interim storage of spent nuclear fuel while continuing to actively pursue permanent repository. In the years before that repository is sealed, there will be time to study alternatives to permanently burying the spent fuel with its large remaining energy potential. One of those alternatives for study should be a serious review of accelerator transmutation of waste technology. 
Today, another issue, irradiation of food products is rarely used. Nevertheless, there is convincing evidence of its benefits in curtailing foodborne illnesses. I commend the recent acceptance of irradiation for beef products by the Food and Drug Administration. It was a long time in coming, but it is finally here. 
Today, few low-level nuclear waste disposal facilities are operating in this country, jeopardizing many operations that rely on routine use of low-level radioactive materials. For example, the Federal Government continues its efforts to block the efforts of the State of California to build a low-level nuclear waste disposal facility at Ward Valley, CA. 
Today, joint programs with Russia are underway to protect Russian fissile materials and shift the activities of former Soviet weapons and their scientists into commercial projects. These programs should be expanded, not reduced. The President suggests that some should be reduced. I believe they should be expanded. 
These and other issues will all benefit from a careful reexamination of past policies relating to nuclear technologies. While some may continue to lament that the nuclear genie is out of the proverbial bottle, I am ready to focus on harnessing that genie as effectively and as fully as possible so that our citizens may gain the largest possible benefit from nuclear technologies.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a man who has accumulated a remarkable record as the head basketball coach at Hobbs High School in New Mexico. This year he ends more than a half century of teaching and coaching. During these decades of service, he has endeared himself to a community and earned acclaim as one of the most winning high school coaches in the United States. 
To understand the significance of Ralph Tasker's impact, it is useful to know more about Hobbs, the community to which he had dedicated his life. 
Hobbs is a city born of the hard-scrabble oil and gas industry. Situated on the dusty mesquite-laden plains of southeast New Mexico, it is primarily dependent on farming, ranching, and the petroleum industry. It is a proud community that has touted itself as `Hobbs, America.' 
I believe I can safely say that a lot of the pride in this community has been fostered by its school system and, more specifically, the renowned success of its high school basketball team. 
Mr. President, on February 20, Ralph Tasker will coach his last high school basketball game in Hobbs. 
On that Friday evening in the Ralph Tasker Arena, the people of Hobbs--a town accustomed to the booms and busts of the oil and gas industry--will honor the man who since 1949 has lead the Hobbs Eagles to consistent basketball glory. Under Ralph Tasker's steady tutelage, it can be said a most constant sound in Hobbs, beyond the hum of oilfield pumps, has been the swish of basketballs ripping through the hoops, the squeak of rubber on hardwood, and decades of cheering fans. It has been through the efforts of Ralph Tasker, the hard knuckled basketball coach, that Hobbs has become known to America. 
Understandably, Hobbs honors the end of Coach Tasker's remarkable career with a measure of trepidation. 
Mr. President, I believe Ralph Tasker's career as a high school coach has been so outstanding that he deserves the recognition of the Senate. 
Born, raised and educated in West Virginia, Ralph Tasker's life has virtually always involved basketball. His teaching and coaching career began in Ohio. During World Was II, he served with the U.S. Army Air Corps stationed at what is now Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque. Tasker played basketball with the Flying Kellys during his service days. 
Following the war, he earned a masters degree and returned to New Mexico, this time to Lovington where he taught and coached starting in 1946. It was in 1949 that Ralph Tasker began his illustrious tenure as the head basketball coach at Hobbs High School. 
Over the decades, Coach Tasker has compiled the third most winning record of active high school coaches in the United States, with a record of at least 1,116 wins and only 289 losses. 
Tasker's Hobbs Eagles have won a dozen state championships--one in Lovington in 1949 and 11 in Hobbs in 1956, 1957, 1958, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1980, 1981, 1987, and 1988. He is believed to have set a record of sorts by coaching state championship basketball teams in five different decades, from the 1940s to the 1980s. The varsity team has qualified for the state basketball tournaments 36 times, including 24 consecutive tourney appearances between 1961 and 1985. 
In 52 seasons as head basketball coach, Ralph Tasker's teams have suffered only two losing seasons. In comparison, he has coached 36 teams to seasons with 20 or more victories. He led two teams through perfect seasons, 1966 (28-0) and 1981 (26-0). His 1970 squad averaged 114.6 points per game during a 27-game season, which is still a national record. 
All this success has been rewarded with a trophy case of personal honors. Ralph Tasker has been named National High School Coach by the National High School Coaches Association and by the National Sports News Service. In 1991, he was named the National Athletic Coach of the Year by the prestigious Walt Disney National Teacher Awards Program. 
He was a 1988 inductee into the National High School Sports Hall of Fame in Kansas City, Missouri. He has also been inducted into the New Mexico High School Coaches Association Hall of Honor, the Alderson-Broaddus College's Battler Hall of Fame, and the New Mexico State University Aggie Hall of Fame. 
Recognition of Coach Tasker's abilities is underscored by the fact that more than 100 Eagle basketball players have gone to college on basketball scholarships, with 50 named to All-State squads, nine selected to prep All-American teams, and 13 drafted by professional basketball leagues. 
But I know that the citizens of Hobbs are most proud and appreciative of Ralph Tasker for the hundreds of lives he has helped shape as a coach and mentor. Hundreds upon hundreds of youth people have benefited from the hard work, discipline, and sense of comradery they gained under Coach Tasker's direction. For more than 50 years he has given impressionable young men a sense of direction, a sense of being part of something bigger and greater than they could be by themselves. In teaching such lessons through sweat and toil on the varnished boards of a gymnasium floor, he has made Hobbs a better place to live. 
For all his accomplishments, I salute Ralph Tasker, and join those who bring deserved attention to his lifetime of commitment to an honored sport and the youth who play the game.

Mr. DOMENICI. As we know, we have some procedural rules requiring 51 Senators to support a resolution, before it can be considered by the full Senate. I thank Senators from both sides of the aisle. We now have 57 Senators on this resolution and this number assures Senate passage. Our resolution declares 1998 as the `OnAE6ate Cuartocentenario', the 400th Anniversary of the OnAE6ate settlement at San Juan Pueblo, New Mexico, and asks the President to issue a proclamation of similar intent. Besides the historical event, this resolution acknowledges the cultural, economic, and political contributions that these Hispanic settlers of 400 years ago started in northern New Mexico. So I thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, Senator Daschle the minority leader, and the long list of cosponsors for helping us with this. 
I guess right off the bat, it gives me a great deal of pride to remind Americans, especially here in the east where this Capitol lies, that the first Spanish settlement in New Mexico occurred in 1598, when Don Juan de OnAE6ate settled at San Juan Pueblo in the Valley of EspanAE6ola in northern New Mexico. I might say, if one just remembers the dates, this event precedes Plymouth Rock, which landing there occurred in 1620. The Spanish settlers arrived in northern New Mexico 22 years before Plymouth Rock. And they were also settlers who came from Europe. They just happened to come from the Spanish part of Europe rather than that part where our rather famous and much talked about pilgrims came from. 
So this year we commemorate the brave and adventurous Hispanic families who first set roots in this beautiful land of New Mexico. By commemorating these early events we are also honoring the important cultural, political, and economic contributions that those families and their descendants have made to enrich our State, and actually our Nation. 
This expedition was part of a very large effort to expand the Spanish empire, convert more people to Christianity, and find great wealth in the new world. There was great excitement at the beginning of the 16th century about these prospects. Spaniards like Hernan Cortes and Francisco Pizzaro, cousins from Medellin and Ciudad Trujillo, left Spain in the early 1600s to seek their fortune and spread the glory of Spain. When the Mayan gold was taken back to Spain from the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico in 1517, it fueled the fires of enthusiasm for finding the legendary Seven Cities of Gold in the New World. 
Spanish explorers like Ponce de Leon, Francisco Coronado, and Don Juan de OnAE6ate explored modern-day America, believe it or not, from Florida to California. 
Some 400 Spanish settlers led by OnAE6ate from Santa Barbara, Mexico, through El Paso, Texas, to San Juan Pueblo, named by OnAE6ate for John the Baptist. The soldiers, priests, laymen, families, servants and their 83 wagons and 7,000 animals formed a 2- to 4-mile long caravan as they journeyed up the Rio Grande. 
I spoke about this the other night at a very large gathering in our State for the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. Sitting at a table with our archbishop, one of my staff people said, as Senator Domenici explained this 83 wagon and 7,000 animals forming a 4-mile long caravan, the archbishop was heard to say, `The first traffic jam in northern New Mexico.' I don't know if it was that or not. There probably were no intersecting roads in those days. 
When they arrived at San Juan Pueblo on July 11, 1598, they established the first Spanish capital in the New World. They built the San Gabriel chapel and convento. Today, a beautiful replica of the San Gabriel chapel stands in the EspanAE6ola Plaza. 
It is well known that the Spanish people founded the oldest cities in America. First, St. Augustine, Florida was founded in 1565, followed by Santa Fe, New Mexico, the second oldest city in what is now the United States. In 1610, Santa Fe was named the capital of New Mexico making it the oldest capital city in America today. 
Before Santa Fe became the capital of the New Mexico territory, the San Gabriel mission served as the first Spanish Capital of New Mexico, beginning in 1598. San Gabriel is at San Juan Pueblo where the Rio Chama meets the Rio Grande. Its Indian name was Yunge Oweenge. The designation and renaming of this site by its first Governor, Don Juan de OnAE6ate, as San Gabriel del Yunge Oweenge marks the first permanent Spanish settlement in the west. 
1998 marks the 400th Anniversary of the founding of San Gabriel del Yunge Oweenge in the EspanAE6ola Valley of present-day New Mexico. 
This resolution highlights the importance of the Spanish explorations in America and pays tribute to the growing population of Hispanics who are anticipated to be twenty percent of our national population by the year 2030, with a projected population of 60 million Hispanics. Two-thirds of the 26 million Hispanics in America--who make up eleven percent of our population today--are of Mexican origin, and 70 percent of Hispanics live in 4 states: California, Texas, New York, and Florida. 
New Mexico has the highest percentage of Hispanics at 39 percent or about 660,000 residents out of a total 1995 state population of 1.7 million. Albuquerque, New Mexico, will be the site of a new Hispanic Cultural Center to celebrate and preserve Hispanic culture including literature, performing arts, visual arts, music, culinary arts, and language arts. 
New Mexico will be the center of many exciting events throughout the year to commemorate this important historic milestone. New Mexicans are looking forward to fiestas, balls, parades, and other stimulating events to mark this historic occasion. 
The Archbishop of Santa Fe will be opening a Jubilee year in January. Among other events, he will hold an encuentro at Santo Domingo Pueblo to mark the meeting of the missionaries with the Pueblo Peoples. 
The City of EspanAE6ola will have a fiesta in July to commemorate the actual arrival of the Spanish into the area. Santa Fe, Las Vegas, Taos, Socorro, Aztec, Albuquerque, and other New Mexico towns and cities will be holding such special events as fiestas, historic reenactments, a State Fair Pageant, a historic Spanish costume ball, and parades. Seminars and lectures will abound. 
State Fair pageant plans include a reenactment of De Vargas' reentry into New Mexico, a review of the Pueblo Revolt and its ramifications, life under the American flag during the middle to late 1800's, and a patriotic tribute to all Hispanics who have fought for the United States. This reentry spectacular will be performed twice before large New Mexico State Fair audiences. It will also be televised. 
This resolution also asks the President to issue a proclamation declaring 1998 is a year to commemorate the arrival of Hispanics and celebrate their growth in importance in our nation's culture and economy. 
This Senate resolution calls upon the people of the United States to support, promote, and participate in the many OnAE6ate Cuartocentenario activities being planned to commemorate the historic event of the first Spanish settlement in the Southwest Region of the United States. 
Mr President, I ask my colleagues to support Senate Resolution 148, designating 1998 as the `OnAE6ate Cuartocentenario' to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the first Spanish settlement in New Mexico.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise today to support Dr. David Satcher to be Surgeon General of the United States and Assistant Secretary for Health at the Department of Health and Human Services. Let me first say I base this on many things, but I would like to tell the Senate right up front that we have a wonderful doctor who is a United States Senator, Dr. Bill Frist from the State of Tennessee. While I am not saying that he knows everything about medicine, he knows a lot more than I do. We have talked at length about this nominee and he not only knows him, but he knows of him in ways that I probably would not discern from just reading the same things that my friend Senator Frist has read. Because he reads into some of these past performances and past professorships and various things that Dr. Satcher has done--he reads much more into them than I can because he knows what they are all about. 
Suffice it to say that no Senator should rely on another Senator as the only source of why he votes one way or another, but I would like to say right up front that I started with at least a presumption on my part that I would find out a little more and read what I could on my own in addition to receiving some excellent advice. 
On my own, beyond that, I have looked at his career and, frankly, I think the President has picked a very, very distinguished American doctor. He has been a rather reputable scholar, a rather renowned teacher, and obviously a very good physician. In addition to that, he has obviously done considerable research and already in his career has been the head of one of America's premier institutions that pertain to preventive medicine and well-being, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
I have recently been fortunate, in turning the channels as I do with the flipper on cable TV, to see a rather exciting report on how great the Centers for Disease Control are. And then I have been reading about some new breakthroughs they are constantly making, and some of the work they do, to catch viruses and learn about them before they strike. I think it is a pretty good qualification to say that this nominee headed that organization during a period of time that it gained in renown and prestige, and clearly I think that is another significant plus for this nominee. 
From my own standpoint, some may know that I, over the last few years, have added a significant concern regarding a certain illness to the arena that I worry about. That has to do with 
diabetes, in this case because in my home State the Navajo Indian people and a couple of other tribes of Indian people are suffering from diabetes at rates and ratios well beyond any other group of American citizens; not just a little bit more, but way, way more to the point of being significantly in trouble. And I actually believe that if we don't do something about the problem, there are a couple of great groups of Indian people that may not be around in 50 to 100 years. That worries me very much. 
I am very grateful that this good doctor and others helped work on the diabetes issue with Secretary Shalala and others, and our good friend Newt Gingrich from the House, and in the last reconciliation bill, the Balanced Budget Act, we put in $150 million over the next 5 years for enhanced research in diabetes in America and, believe it or not, we put in $150 million, $30 million a year, for special attention to this disease among the Indian people. 
I happened to talk to Dr. Satcher at length about that. While I assume most doctors can talk about diabetes in a very understandable way, steeped in facts, there is no question that he knew precisely what we were talking about. For that I give him another accolade. 
So, I intend, when it is right, to vote in favor of this nominee. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to speak on a subject that is not on the floor of the Senate.

 Mr. DOMENICI. With the completion of congressional action on the 13 annual fiscal year 1998 appropriations bills, I submit a table to the Senate showing the current status of the bills compared to the most recently filed Section 302(b) allocations by the Senate Appropriations Committee on November 13, 1997. 
I note that the Interior and related agencies Appropriations bill under the current 302(b) allocation is over the subcommittee's allocation for both budget authority and outlays. A provision in the final Interior appropriations bill amends the budget resolution to trigger the allocation of an additional $700 million in budget authority and $257 million in outlays to the Appropriations Committee for land acquisition. I have filed that allocation today. 
Once the Senate Appropriations Committee revises its 302(b) allocations to reflect the land acquisition funding, the Interior and related agencies appropriations bill will be within the subcommittee's funding allocation.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, section 314(b)(3)(B) of the Congressional Budget Act, as amended, requires the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to adjust the appropriate budgetary aggregates and the allocation for the Appropriations Committee to reflect an amount of budget authority provided that is the dollar equivalent of the special drawing rights with respect to any increase in the maximum amount available to the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to section 17 of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, as amended from time to time (new arrangements to borrow). 
Section 500 of Public Law 105-83, an act making appropriations for the Department of the Interior and related agencies, requires the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to adjust the allocation for the Appropriations Committee for Federal land acquisitions and to finalize priority land exchanges. 
I hereby submit revisions to the budget authority, outlays, and deficit aggregates for fiscal year 1998 contained in sec. 101 of House Concurrent Resolution 84 in the following amounts:  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Deficit Budget authority Outlays  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Current aggregates 173,512,000,000 1,391,098,000,000 1,372,512,000,000  Adjustments -3,521,000,000  Revised aggregates 173,512,000,000 1,387,577,000,000 1,372,512,000,000  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the final appropriations measure that the Congress passed before adjournment was H.R. 2267, the Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. I today submit a table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the final bill. 
The conference agreement accompanying the bill provides $31.7 billion in budget authority and $21.2 billion in new outlays to operate the programs of the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice, the Department of State, the Judiciary, and related Federal agencies for fiscal year 1998. 
When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the bill totals $31.8 billion in budget authority and $29.5 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998. 
The final bill is within the revised Senate subcommittee's section 302(b) allocation for both budget authority and outlays. 
The bill is $7 million in budget authority and $77 million in outlays below the Senate subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. 
Mr. President, it was my pleasure to serve on the Appropriations Subcommittee with the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire. I commend Chairman Gregg, for completing the fiscal year 1998 bill. It is not easy to balance the competing program requirements that are funded in this bill. 
I thank the chairman for the consideration he gave to issues I brought before the subcommittee, and for his extra effort to address the items in the bipartisan balanced budget agreement.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I submit the Budget Committee scoring of H.R. 2607, the fiscal year 1998 District of Columbia appropriations bill. 
The final bill totals $855 million, including $835 million for Federal payments to the District of Columbia. S12723 
The bill provides $190 million for the Federal contribution to the District of Columbia, $169 million to operate the District's correctional facilities for felons, $302 million to build new correctional facilities to replace the Lorton facility, $151 million to operate the district court System, $12 million to the National Park Service to support U.S. Park Police operations in the District, $8 million to implement management reform initiatives, and $3 million for a Medicare coordinated-care demonstration project. 
The appropriation is in addition to the resources allocated to the District by the Balanced Budget Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Combined, the two laws provide tax breaks and mandatory spending worth $4.5 billion over 10 years. Because the cost of taking over the District's $5.8 billion pension liability is largely delayed until after this period, the total bailout is worth substantially more to the District. 
The final bill is below the subcommittee's revised 302(b) allocation by $7 million in both budget authority and outlays.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I submit the following table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the conference report accompanying the foreign operations and export financing appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. 
The conference report provides $13.1 billion in budget authority and $5 billion in new outlays to operate the programs of the Department of State, export and military assistance, bilateral and multilateral economic assistance, and related agencies for fiscal year 1998. 
When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the bill totals $13.1 billion in budget authority and $13.1 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998. 
The final bill is at the subcommittee's revised section 302(b) allocation for budget authority, and it is $4 million below the revised allocation in outlays. 
Mr. President, I note that the final bill is significantly below the Senate-passed version of the bill due to the deletion of $3.5 billion for the New Arrangements to Borrow for the International Monetary Fund. These funds were requested by the President in his fiscal year 1998 budget.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, with the completion of the 13 annual fiscal year 1998 appropriations bills by the Congress, I believe we can say that Congress lived up to its end of the Balanced Budget Agreement. 
The Balanced Budget Agreement had two major assumptions for the appropriated programs. The first was the protection of 13 priority domestic discretionary programs that were assumed to be funded at the level of the President's request. For these programs, Congress was on, or close to, the President's requested funding level with few departures. 
The second assumption was the protection of funding for five specific budget functions--International Affairs, Natural Resources, Transportation, Education, and the Administration of Justice. Congress came within $0.3 billion of the overall total of $126.5 billion for these five budget functions, a shortfall of only 0.2 percent. 
The funding departures for the 13 priority domestic discretionary programs were largely for items that Congress had not specifically agreed to--Pell grants--for a new program that was advance appropriated and made subject to authorization--Opportunities for Out of School Youth--and where anticipated reform was not enacted--Superfund. S12724 
Adjusting for these three items, Congress exceeded by $54 million, the overall $34 billion assumed in the budget agreement for these 13 protected programs. I will submit a table displaying congressional action on these programs at the end of my statement. 
Mr. President, the Congress matched the BBA assumptions for bilingual and immigrant education, for BIA tribal priority allocations, and for the Job Corps. 
The Congress exceeded the BBA assumptions for the technology literacy challenge fund, for Head Start, for National Park System operations and land acquisition, and for the violent crime reduction trust fund.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I want to talk a little bit about what a joyous day of wrap-up of the Senate in the first year of the 2-year Congress could be if, as a matter of fact, we left here after completing the appropriations bills and went about our business to go home to our home States, had a good Christmas season, worked with all of our constituents, and then came back next year, the second year of a Congress, and the appropriations were already done and the budget was already done. But that is not going to happen. 
We just finished appropriations, I assume we will hear shortly. And what has taken up the entire year? I don't have the statistics. But early next year I will put them in the Record. But I am just going to ask the Senators who have a little recollection of the year to just think about what we did. 
First of all, we worked diligently on a balanced budget. That didn't occur until late May and early June. I am trying mightily to think what was accomplished before that, thankfully. I wish I had a better memory. But I don't think we did a lot. A few bills here and there, but I am sure we didn't have any superb oversight. 
People are all waiting for what? For the budget. And then for what? All the appropriations bills that have to come after it. Oh, by the way, in between, we had to implement the budget with those two big reconciliation bills. 
So essentially we stand on the threshold of wrapping up the Congress for a year, and we start next year. We are going to anxiously await the President's budget--another 1-year budget. Would it have been better for America, for the U.S. Congress, for all the agencies that are funded, from NIH to some grant to a university, to our Armed Forces, and all the money that they have to spend if they could have a 2-year appropriation? Wouldn't we be better off, in a 2-year Congress--that is what we are, by the Constitution--if in 1 year we did all of the budgeting and all of the appropriations? 
I have been working on budgets and appropriations bills long enough to know that there are all kinds of reasons for not doing 2-year budgets. I am an appropriator who thinks we should have a 2-year budget. Maybe many of the appropriators think we are better off sending our little measures to the President every year, and maybe we get more that way. 
Just look at the 2-year appropriations. You get 2 years in there because we do 2-year appropriations bills. If you are worried about getting enough things in it, you can do it twice, even as we appropriate only one time for 2 years. But I don't think there is a great majority who are worried about that. I think we just are fearful to break with tradition. Somehow or another we have been appropriating every year. 
Then when we wrote the Budget Act not too long ago, we said, `Well, we have to have a budget every year.' 
So what do we do? We do that. It is almost like we get started next year, and we are right back at the budget, which many people think we just finished. Sure enough, in the middle of the year, some appropriators will start looking at their bills, and sure enough, we will be back here, predictably--if not at this time a little later--and we will still have two or three appropriations bills that we can't get completed. Why? Because they are being held up by authorization riders that are very, very much in contention. 
I ask, wouldn't we be better off if we had that kind of argument, be it on the money that we now refer to as the `Mexican issue' with reference to birth control and the kinds of family planning that we put money into foreign countries for, wouldn't we be better off if we voted on that only once every 2 years? It would have exactly the same effect. In fact, we could fight just one time out of 2 years. We could send these little bills back and forth between the President and the Congress with these little 1-day extensions of Government. We could do that only 1 year out of 2, and everybody could make the same vote. Everybody could make their case in the same way. But who would gain? 
I believe the institution known as the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives would gain immensely. In fact, might I suggest that what it means to be a U.S. Senator would be dramatically changed if we had 2-year appropriations, a 2-year budgeting, because, if we did these every 2 years, we would be able to have oversight and see what is happening to the programs that we fund and the programs that we put in motion through the process called authorization. 
Then, Madam President and fellow Senators and anybody interested in good government, we have not yet been able to encapsulate into our thinking what the executive branch of Government wastes by having to produce a budget every single year with budget hearings at the OMB, with people who are planning over at the National Institutes of Health to get a program going that is going to be 10 years in duration and come and present this 1-year part of that every single year. As a matter of fact, there would be twice as much time to do the things we are neglecting--to debate foreign policy in a real way, to have a 2- or 3-month debate on tax reform where people would really spend time. And day after day we could be on the floor instead of in some little room under the threat of a bill reconciliation measure from the budget process telling you to get it done in 25 days. We could have people looking at education, at the myriad and scores of bills that are already out there that are funding programs. Instead of finding new ones every year and new problems, we would go back and look to see what the whole entourage of education money looks like. Are there programs there that aren't working? But you need a lot of time to do that. You can't be getting up and running to the floor to vote every single year on 50 to 60 budget amendments, all of the appropriations bills with their attendant amendments, and then have to have your staff focus on what is in each one of those bills only to find you are back again in 6 months doing the same thing over again. 
As a matter of fact, the more I think about that and the more I talk about it, the more I think I am prepared to say for us to appropriate and budget annually when the Constitution says Congress lasts for 2 years, that it is absurd from the standpoint of modern planning with the modern tools we have to do the estimating that we are doing every year instead of doing it for 2 years. 
Some are going to say you are going to have to have a lot of supplemental appropriations. I am sure the occupant of the chair is already hearing that when she speaks about 2-year appropriations and 2-year budgets. Let me tell you, even with 1-year appropriations, we have to have supplementals because some few things break in the Government, and we are not quite right on, and we have to go fix them. But there is a way to limit the supplementals even in a 2-year process to no more than we are doing now. 
Once I asked four different departments of Government, as they reported to the Appropriations Committee, to give us information on the appropriations before us on that particular year and asked how much of it is similar if not exactly the same as last year's. You would be surprised. As much as 90 percent of appropriations bills are the same year after year. Isn't it interesting? We debate them all over again. We mark them up all over again, and we add these amendments that cause us to debate ad infinitum, which could just as well be 2-year amendments as 1-year. But we do it to ourselves by making sure we go through this kind of difficult confrontational atmosphere every single year. 
Put yourself in the position of those in America that we have said should get some Government money for something. I have spoken to large groups of scientists from our universities, from our hospital research centers, from our laboratories, and they all want more certainty of funding. Of course, they would all like more funding. But they shout to the rooftops when you say, wouldn't you prefer to have 2 years instead of 1 year as your appropriation? Could you manage it better? Could you be more efficient? The answer to all of those questions is `absolutely.' Yet, we remain stuck in the mud of tradition saying we have to do it every single year. 
There is a bill pending. It has cleared the Governmental Operations Committee 13 to 1--S. 261. It is here. It is at the desk. I am thankful that since we have a 2-year Congress, it is still at the desk. Congress isn't finished until next year come January. 
I am going to work very hard with others in this Senate to urge that our leader schedule early a lengthy time on the floor in the early days of the Congress to debate this issue. Thirty-three Senators from both sides of the aisle cosponsored the measure before it cleared Governmental Operations. I believe, if I had enough time to circulate it even more among Senators, that I would have had more than 50 Senators supporting it. It might be because of the processes around here that there will be a Senator who will object, and we might have to get 60 votes, because obviously changing the budget to 2 years and the appropriations for 2 years could be a controversial issue. 
So I am prepared for the 60-vote requirement. But even at that, I want to say to those who oppose it, who oppose this modernization, this bringing into modern times of our processes around here, that I believe there are more than 60 Senators if they hear the debate and if we configure that debate so as to make the Senators feel just like we are finished here today instead of next February or March, we could be saying if this 2-year budget, 2-year appropriations bill, had passed, we would be finished for a full year. We could do other things, and the departments of our Government could go about their business without preparing yet another budget and going through all of the rigor, time, effort, and lack of efficiency that comes with that. 
So, Madam President and fellow Senators, I just want to make two wrap-up points. I believe anybody watching this year, if presented with a real opportunity to go through this only once every 2 years instead of twice and have time for other things, we would probably have a huge, huge plurality voting with us. 
The American people can't get excited about process issues, but if they understood what we go through and what we have assigned to ourselves, to the executive branch and to all those that we fund by way of making it difficult and tough and inefficient by doing the same thing over each year, then I think the American people would be excited by this reform. If the people knew we could do it for 2 years at a time, if we could just get that out there, get that debated in a very open manner that everybody understands, then we might have kind of a birth of modernization, kind of a ray of light shining on these processes, and I believe the American people would gain. 
I believe we would do our jobs better. I believe we could do oversight; we could have more hearings; we could actually, every couple of years, take a month or two and go out in the hinterland and hold hearings in our country which wouldn't be all that bad. How are we going to do it under the current annual process? Somebody think of that around here and the first thing you know there will be five appropriations bills ready for the normal 50 votes, or a budget resolution taking 2, 3 weeks, taking vote after vote after vote, half of them being sense-of-the-Senate issues which shouldn't be even allowed on a budget resolution, but that is the current process. 
So that is one point. We would be doing the American people a better job if we could do that. 
And second, the Senate and House would be better places within which to do business for the American people if there wasn't so much redundancy and waste of time and effort. So we are going to try to see if we can accomplish both of those goals which I think are rather admirable. 
I do not want to leave the wrong impression for those who seek to defeat this measure that it violates the Budget Act. The bill is not subject to a 60-vote point of order. It just takes a simple majority. It has been in both committees. That is why we went through that. It's gone to the Governmental Affairs Committee. Then it went to the Budget Committee, which was discharged, and so it is here as any other normal bill. So if we get that magic 51 votes, we can change this process. 
I just want to put in the Record the major legislation that passed this year and even some of our authorizing processes were very late for one reason or another. While a great deal of legislation has passed, we only will clear about three major authorization bills for the President's signature: DOD authorization, FDA reform, SBA reform. The compelling amount of time and the overwhelming majority of effort was spent on the budget resolution, two reconciliation bills, and 13 appropriations bills. And we haven't quite done that; six continuing resolutions before we're done tonight. I do not blame anyone for that. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee this year has been a stalwart in trying to get the appropriations bills done on time. He has not benefited from the two Houses being able to agree on four or five issues and a majority in the House being on the opposite side of the President on two or three issues. 
Besides appropriations, we spent a great deal of effort on the budget resolution and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997--the two reconciliation bills called for by the balanced budget agreement and the budget resolution. And frankly, hardly any time was left for other major bills to be debated for any length of time, and I think we can do our job a lot better than that. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.  
Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.

Mr. DOMENICI. I agree with my colleague from Alaska. Congress added the Line Item Veto Act as Part C of title X of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 
1974, which is more commonly referred to as the Budget Act. This was done deliberately, so that the cancellation authority provided by the Line Item Veto Act is part of a larger, established system of budgetary tools that Congress imposes on itself or has delegated to the President to control federal spending. 
The Line Item Veto Act provides a detailed definition of what represents a `dollar amount of discretionary budget authority.' The definition specifically allows the President to cancel the `entire dollar amount of budget authority required to be allocated by a specific proviso in an appropriation law for which a specific dollar figure was not included,' which appears to be the definition which the President used to justify the cancellation of section 642. However, in doing so it appears that the President's advisors failed to realize that section 642 does not constitute `budget authority' as defined in section 3 of the Budget Act. That definition also applies to Part C of title X of the Budget Act, which as I mentioned is the Line Item Veto Act. 
`Budget authority' is defined in the Budget Act as `provisions of law that make funds available for obligation and expenditure * * * borrowing authority * * * contract authority * * * and offsetting receipts and collections * * *.' Section 642 does not make any funds specifically available, so it does not meet that definition of budget authority. Nor does it provide authority to borrow money or the authority to obligate funds for future expenditure. This means that in order to qualify as budget authority, the $854 million reduction in CSRS employee contributions the President purported to cancel using the Line Item Veto Act would have to be offsetting receipts. 
Unfortunately for the President, his advisors seem to have overlooked that employee contributions to retirement accounts are considered governmental receipts, and not offsetting receipts, so they do not meet the definition of budget authority.

Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from Alaska is correct. In the President's Budget for Fiscal Year 1998 there is a proposal to increase employee contributions to both CSRS and FERS. This proposal is shown on page 317 of the Budget, in Table S-7 that shows the impact of tax relief provisions and other revenue measures, as an increase in governmental receipts. This same proposal is listed under `miscellaneous receipts' in Table 3-4 showing Federal receipts by source 
on page 59 of the Analytical Perspectives document that accompanied the FY 98 Budget. The fact that section 642 would have resulted in a reduction in employee contributions to CSRS does not alter their treatment under the Budget Act; they are still governmental receipts collected from employees through the government's sovereign powers and not offsetting receipts collected as a result of a business-like or market oriented activity.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to address the conference report accompanying H.R. 2107, the fiscal year 1998 Interior and Related Agencies appropriations bill. 
The conference report was adopted by the Senate on October 28. At the time the bill was called up, the Budget Committee had not received CBO's scoring of the final bill. This was due to the significant changes to the bill made by the conferees. I have received CBO's information and now address the budgetary scoring of the bill. 
Mr. President, the conference agreement provides $13.8 billion in new budget authority and $9.1 billion in new outlays to fund the programs of the Department of Interior, the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture, the Energy Conservation and Fossil Energy Research and Development Programs of the Department of Energy, the Indian Health Service, and arts-related agencies. 
When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the bill provides a total of $13.9 billion in budget authority and $13.8 billion in outlays for these programs for fiscal year 1998. 
Mr. President, final action on the conference agreement necessitated a reallocation of funding authority for this bill. I regret that this reallocation was necessary because it was avoidable. 
Section 205 of the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution provided for the allocation of $700 million in budget authority 
for Federal land acquisition and to finalize priority land exchanges upon the reporting of a bill that included such funding. 
The distinguished chairman of the Senate Interior Subcommittee included these funds in title V of the bill as originally reported. As Chairman of the Budget Committee, I allocated these funds to the Appropriations Committee, which in turn provided them to the Interior Subcommittee. 
If the conferees had adopted the Senate language, I would not have been in the position of withdrawing this funding allocation. However, the conferees modified the Senate language to provide only $699 million for land acquisition, and to expand the use of these funds for additional purposes: Critical maintenance activities are added as an allowable activity under this title V funding; $10 million is provided for a payment to Humboldt County, CA, as part of the headwaters land acquisition; and $12 million is provided for the repair and maintenance of the Beartooth Highway as part of the Crown Butte/New World Mine Land acquisition. 
I was a conferee on the bill. The Senate Budget Committee provided clarifying language to the conferees on the Interior appropriations bill during their meeting on September 30. This language simply restated that moneys provided in title V, when combined with moneys provided by other titles of the bill for Federal land acquisition, shall provide at least $700 million for Federal land acquisition and to finalize priority land exchanges. 
This language, which I urged be included throughout the 2-week period when final language was drafted, would have ensured that the section 205 allocation remained in place for this bill. 
However, the Chairman decided not to incorporate the Senate language, and in fact, included language which attempts to trigger the additional $700 million by amending the budget resolution. The language in the conference report is directed scorekeeping, which causes a violation under section 306 of the Budget Act because it affects matters within the jurisdiction of the Budge Committee that were not reported by the Budget Committee. 
Mr. President, I object to the inclusion of this directed scorekeeping language in this bill, or any other bill. If the Senate took language amending the budget resolution into account for determining budgetary levels, the budget resolution levels and our efforts to enforce a balanced budget plan would become meaningless. 
Instead of making the choices necessary to live within the budget resolution levels, committees could simply rely on a precedent to assert, or `Deem,' that they had complied with the budgetary limits, even though they hadn't. 
Such action would undermine the budget discipline of the Senate. 
Since the directed scorekeeping language will not become effective until the bill is signed into law, and the conferees did not clarify that $700 million is included in the bill for land acquisition and priority land exchanges, I had no choice but to withdraw the additional allocation of funding provided in section 205 of the budget resolution for land acquisition and exchanges. 
Mr. President, I ask that a table displaying the Budget Committee's scoring of the conference agreement accompanying the Interior and Related Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998 be placed in the Record at this point. 
The Senate Appropriations Committee has filed a revised 302(b) allocation to reduce the Interior Subcommittee by the amounts withdrawn. 
The final bill is therefore $698 million in budget authority and $235 million in outlays above the subcommittee's revised 302(b) allocation as filed by the Appropriations Committee.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senators Roth, Chafee, Craig, and Rockefeller for bringing this foster care and adoption assistance bill to the floor. 
This bill contains a number of long overdue programmatic changes to strengthen the foster care system. 
In addition, the bill provides more funds to reward states that increase adoptions. These adoptions will preclude children from having long, or even worse, permanent stays in state foster care systems. 
To achieve this additional funding, the bill contains a discretionary spending cap adjustment of $20 million per year for the years 1999 to 2002. 
One could argue that this cap adjustment would result in an increase in the deficit. However, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that spending from this incentive payment will reduce mandatory foster care spending by $25 million over the next 5 years. 
The bill also contains additional mandatory spending for family preservation services. The Family Preservation Program attempts to provide intensive services to families at risk of having children removed from the home and put into foster care. 
This additional money would raise total funding for family preservation services to $1.435 billion over the next 5 years or $80 million above the President's request. 
I want to raise a couple concerns. First, there are a number of minor Budget Act violations, like the cap adjustment. 
Second, and of greater concern, is an offset for the additional Family Preservation spending. The offset was conceived of and added at the last minute. I do not believe the policy was thought out and the effects certainly are not well known to this body. 
The offset would tap into the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families [TANF] contingency fund and could unfairly target small, poor states with volatile unemployment rates. Moreover, the offset would, perversely, take away funds from states when they are needed the most. 
The contingency fund was a vital part of making welfare reform work by increasing funds to states experiencing increased unemployment or rising food stamp caseloads. 
The offset allows states to receive a contingency grant payment in one year, but then require that state to pay back at least a portion in the next year. 
The repayment would be prorated among the states that qualify in any given year. For example if five states qualify for payments in the year 2000, those states would split the $16 million required repayment in the year 2001. 
However, the risk is that one state or a handful of very small states will qualify for contingency grant payments and will be forced to pay back the full amount. 
This risk is justified. In 1997 only one state, New Mexico, qualified for contingency payments. Had this bill been in effect this year, New Mexico would have had to pay back almost all of their contingency grant. 
The economy in New Mexico is currently doing better, unemployment is down to 6.4 percent and the state does not currently qualify for the contingency fund. But my state and many other similar states are always vulnerable. One plant closing can mean a substantial increase in unemployment and need. 
While $16 million with respect to the Federal Budget does not sound like a lot to many people, this is a substantial sum to New Mexico. $16 million represents over ten percent of New Mexico's entire TANF grant. 
In fact this offset would represent over a ten percent reduction in the TANF grant for 31 states and a cut of over fifty percent for 6 states. 
Further this grant reduction would come at time when a state needs it the most, when state coffers are under pressure from an increase in unemployment. 
I understand that this bill enjoys broad support and that the bill on net contains important, necessary changes. I do not intend to hold it up today. 
I wish to enter into a colloquy with Senator Roth to formalize my understanding that next year the Finance Committee will address this problem and restore full funding to the contingency grant.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Senator Roth for bringing this foster care and adoption assistance bill to the floor. The bill contains a number of long overdue changes to the foster care system. However, the bill contains an offset for new spending that would take money out of the temporary assistance for needy families [TANF] contingency fund. It is my understanding that only those states that qualify for contingency payments would be affected by this offset.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I comment this body for passing the National Drought Policy act of 1997. Our Nation must not forget that while the Midwest United States has recently suffered from severe flooding, and my home State of New Mexico is currently not lacking precious rainfall, last year the Southwest experienced the worst drought in over 100 years. The results were nothing less than disastrous. 
In New Mexico, for example, the drought decimated the State's agricultural community. Every county in the State received disaster declarations from the USDA. Farmers in the southern part of the State were forced to go to water wells, depleting an already-taxed aquifer. In northeastern New Mexico, winter wheat crops failed for the first time in anyone's memory. It was estimated that ranchers lost up to 85 percent of their capital, and 40 percent reductions in livestock herds was not uncommon. 
The drought also had a catastrophic impact on New Mexico's forests. The incredibly dry conditions brought on by the drought sparked fires, which were exacerbated by the lack of water needed to extinguish them. In all, there were over 1,200 fires in New Mexico last year that burned over 140,000 acres of land and wiped out dozens of homes and businesses. 
The drought also taxed municipal water systems to their limits, and forced many cities and towns to consider drastically raised water rates for their citizens. And the drought meant that critical stretches of the Rio Grande River were almost completely dry, which in turn meant vastly reduced amounts of water for wildlife such as the endangered silvery minnow. 
However, New Mexico's problems were those of just one State; the 1995-96 drought devastated the entire Southwest. Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and Kansas were all severely damaged by the drought. We in the Southwest are fortunate that this year is proving to be a much better year for precipitation than the last. But we do not know what the next year will bring. Another drought could again send towns scrambling to drill new water wells, sweep fire across bone-dry forests, and force farmers and ranchers to watch their way of life blow away with the dust. 
But I do not want to give the impression that severe droughts are solely the curse of the Southwest. Every region in the United States can be hit by these catastrophes. In 1976-77, a short but intense drought struck the Pacific Northwest, requiring the construction of numerous dams and reservoirs to secure millions of additional acre feet of needed water. The 1988 Midwest drought caused over $5 billion in losses. And the infamous 7-year drought of 1986-93 experienced by California, the Pacific Northwest, and the Great Basin States caused extensive damage to water systems, water quality, fish and wildlife, and recreational activities. 
Recently, areas of Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania suffered unusual drought conditions. 
Yet, while drought is so pervasive and even though it seriously affects the economic and environmental well-being of the entire nation, the United States is poorly prepared to deal with serious drought emergencies. As a result of the hardships being suffered in every part of my State last year, I convened a special Multi-State Drought Task Force of Federal, State, local, and tribal emergency management agencies to coordinate efforts to respond to the drought. The task force was ably headed up by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and included every Federal agency that has programs designed to deal with drought. 
While FEMA has done a tremendous job in responding to sudden disasters such as flooding, the impact of drought emerges gradually rather than suddenly. Unfortunately, what the task force found was this: although the Federal Government has numerous drought related programs on the books, we have no integrated, coordinated system of implementing those programs. Drought victims in this Nation do not know who to turn to for help, and when they finally do find help, it is too late and totally inadequate. The gradual nature of drought devastation underscores the need for drought management rather than drought response. 
We must be vigilant, and prepare ourselves for quick action when the next drought cycle begins. Last year's devastating drought and the chaotic manner in which governments responded to it, confirmed my belief that this legislation is needed. With recommendations from the Western Governors' Association, the National Governors' Association, and the Multi-State Drought Task Force, I introduced the National Drought Policy Act of 1997 in January. This legislation, which passed the Senate today, will be the first step toward finally establishing a coherent, effective national drought policy. S. 222 creates a commission comprised of representatives of those Federal, State, local, and tribal agencies and organizations that are most involved with drought issues. S. 222 charges the commission with providing recommendations on a permanent and systematic Federal process to address this particular type of devastating natural disaster. On the Federal side, the Commission will include representatives from USDA, Interior, the Army, FEMA, SBA, and Commerce--agencies which all currently have drought-related programs. Equally important will be the non-Federal members, including representatives from the National Governors' Association, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and four persons representative of those groups that are always hardest hit by drought emergencies. 
The Commission also will be charged with determining what needs exists on the Federal, State, local, and tribal levels with regard to drought; reviewing existing drought programs; and determining what gaps exist between the needs of drought victims and those programs currently designed to deal with drought. The Commission will then make recommendations on how Federal drought laws and programs can be better integrated into a comprehensive national drought policy. 
In recognition of the national nature of drought emergencies, this effort has garnered bi-partisan support. Senator Bob Kerrey and other witnesses encouraged amendments which include collaboration with the National Drought Mitigation Center as well as the Western Drought Coordination Council. These suggestions ensure that the Commission would receive important input from existing entities on the needs at the Federal, State, local, and tribal levels to prepare for and respond to drought emergencies. 
Unfortunately, drought conditions are a way of life in my region of the country. But better planning on our part, and with the recommendations of the Drought Commission established under S. 222, may limit some of the damage. I look forward to passage of this legislation, which is important to the entire United States, in the House of Representatives early next year.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to authorize the Bureau of Land Management to generate funds for the management of Fort Stanton and the Rio Bonito Corridor in Lincoln County, NM. These funds will be raised by authorizing the use of vegetation sales contracts, which will allow the use of forage for livestock grazing. 
The Fort Stanton and Rio Bonito Corridor Vegetation Management Act will provide livestock producers with opportunities for additional grazing in the Fort Stanton area, while providing the Bureau of Land Management [BLM] the flexibility to manage the lands in this area according to the recently approved Roswell Area Resource Management Plan. 
Mr. President, as background, land in the Fort Stanton area has been acquired by the BLM through purchase, exchange, and transfer from the State of New Mexico. Fort Stanton itself came under the jurisdiction of the BLM by transfer from the U.S. General Services Administration in 1956. Certain tracts along the Rio Bonito in the Fort Stanton area came to the BLM by exchange in 1995. These lands are highly valued for their unique cultural, historic, and natural resources. 
General, livestock grazing is managed by the BLM according to a number of laws, including the Taylor Grazing Act, and the regulations that implement those laws. Currently, the Fort Stanton area lands are not within an established grazing district, and are not administered under the Taylor Grazing Act. To continue maintaining and improving the resources of these lands, and to fulfill the management objectives established through the Federal Land Policy and Management Act [FLPMA] planning process, the BLM needs additional management flexibility. The management of vegetation under this additional flexibility will allow for improvement of watershed conditions and wildlife habitat, and will allow for the development of additional recreational opportunities on these public lands, all of which provide benefits for the people and economy of Lincoln County, NM. 
The use of livestock grazing in this area has been employed successfully by the BLM in the past. Rangeland improvements and vegetation treatments will emphasize the needs of wildlife and improve watershed management as intended under the current management plan. The use of vegetation sales contracts authorized by this legislation will allow the BLM to use livestock grazing without establishing grazing preferences on these lands. 
Finally, Mr. President, the proceeds from vegetation sales contracts will provide additional money for the BLM to use in the management of Fort Stanton and the Rio Bonito Corridor. When offered by the BLM, these contracts will be sold to the highest bidder, who will then be permitted to graze livestock in this area under specific terms and conditions. Some will wonder how the Senator from New Mexico, who has consistently opposed the policy of competitive bidding for grazing permits on public lands, could offer such a proposal. Quite simply, Mr. President, the BLM's management plan for this area provides the rancher bidding on these contracts with facilities and a number of services at Fort Stanton, that it simply cannot provide on the vast majority of the 270 million acres it is charged with managing. This area will be similar to the furnished apartment--where facilities and services are provided by the BLM as a part of the contract--which my colleagues have heard used as a comparison on the Senate floor in the past. Grazing permits offered on other public domain lands remain the unfurnished apartment--where the BLM provides no facilities or services to grazing permittees. 
At Fort Stanton, the BLM will be responsible for maintaining and operating the watering facilities, and will not require the lessee to construct improvements and pay for them out of his own pocket. Additionally, the BLM already owns all of the livestock handling facilities at Fort Stanton, and the lessee will be allowed to use them as a part of the contract. Under this legislation, part of the proceeds from the sale of these contracts will be available for BLM to provide improvements to existing facilities, and a greater level of onsight management than is available on other public lands. An additional difference is that this public land has not been an integral part of an established ranch for the past 60 years, at least not in the same manager as public land ranches governed by the Taylor Grazing Act. This means that providing opportunities for competitive bidding in this area will not remove the heart of an existing family ranch that has been in operation for several generations.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation that I believe will provide long-term benefits for the people of Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. This legislation will direct the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to convey real property and improvements at an abandoned and surplus administrative site for the Carson National Forest to Rio Arriba County. The site is known as the old Coyote Ranger District Station, near the small town of Coyote, New Mexico. 
This legislation is patterned after a similar transfer that the 103rd Congress directed the Secretary of Agriculture to complete on the old Taos Ranger District Station in 1993. As with the Taos station, the Coyote Station will continue to be used for public purposes, including a community center, and a fire substation. Some of the buildings will also be available for the County to use for storage and repair of road maintenance equipment, and other County vehicles. 
Mr. President, the Forest Service has determined that this site is of no further use to them, since they have recently completed construction of a new administrative facility for the Coyote Ranger District. In an October 22 letter from the Regional Forester of the Southwest Region, I was informed that on August 7, the Forest Service reported to the General Services Administration that the improvements on the site were considered surplus, and would be available for disposal under their administrative procedures. At this particular site, however, the land on which the facilities have been built is withdrawn public domain land, under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management. 
Because of the complicating factor of the land and the facilities being under the jurisdiction of two separate Departments of the Federal government, I believe that this directed conveyance to Rio Arriba County will provide for a more efficient and expedited transfer. Under administrative processes, not only will the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture have to go through their respective procedures, but there will likely be some involvement of the General Services Administration. This legislation simply directs the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to negotiate the terms and conditions of the conveyance directly with officials from Rio Arriba County. 
Mr. President, since neither the Bureau of Land Management nor the Forest Service have any interest in maintaining Federal ownership of this land and the surplus facilities, I believe that this should be a relatively straight-forward issue for Congress to address. I hope that we will be able to act on this legislation quickly next spring.

Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to engage the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, Senator Specter, in a discussion about certain details of the fiscal year 1998 funding for the Centers for Disease Control [CDC] and Indian Health Service [IHS] regarding American Indians and diabetes.

Mr. DOMENICI. In that letter, I requested $8 million for CDC to establish a national diabetes prevention research center. It is my primary intention to see this center begin a serious and vigorous effort to control the diabetes epidemic among American Indians through greatly improved, culturally relevant diagnosis and prevention, with preliminary attention to the Navajo Tribe and the Zuni Pueblo near Gallup, New Mexico. I believe CDC is the best agency in our Government to lead this very specialized task. I also hope to find better prevention strategies that will benefit the large Hispanic population of the city of Gallup, the States of New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, and California, and minority communities nationwide. I am also hopeful that the prevention research conducted in Gallup would be a major benefit for the large population of African-Americans who have this disease.

Mr. DOMENICI. When I held a hearing about the seriousness of diabetes among Navajo and Zuni Indians, and Hispanics in the Gallup area, I was pleased to learn that there are relatively inexpensive ways--such as the monofilament device for testing circulation in the feet--to detect diabetes at an a early stage. We want to incorporate early detection into our prevention activities, so that the Indian populations most susceptible to this disease will have better diagnostic information as early as possible. 
Among the Navajo Indians, we are told that 40 percent of all Navajo Indians are diagnosed as diabetic, and this high rate is among known cases. The sad truth is that testing is very sparse in the remote areas of the Navajo Nation. Some experts fear that the rate could actually be nearly twice as high, if better outreach were performed. I view the Gallup center as the national center for finding better ways to improve outreach and diagnosis among native Americans. The earlier a person knows about the onset of diabetes, the more can be done to prevent it.

Mr. DOMENICI. I would like my colleagues to know that I met with Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala in my office about the seriousness of this epidemic among American Indians. The Secretary offered her own plan to establish this diabetes prevention research center in Gallup, NM. She recommended `a single $8 million per year, multiyear award for a large-scale, coordinated primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention effort among the Navajo, who have a large population with a high incidence of diabetes and risk factors for diabetes.' 
Her support for the Gallup research center came as welcome news. In working with the CDC, we have obtained an estimate of at least $2 million for the first year startup costs for this center. The Senate 
committee report on this bill specifically mentions the Gallup prevention research center. Would the chairman agree that the conferees intended to target at least this amount for the first year costs of establishing to Gallup center?

Mr. DOMENICI. I Thank the chairman for these important clarifications of congressional intent in this final Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. I would like to add one final comment about the Balanced Budget Act of 1998. In that act, signed by the President, we included $30 million annually for the prevention and treatment of diabetes among American Indians for the next 5 years. 
As most American Indians with serious diabetes problems live on or near the reservations, we have allocated $30 million per year for enhancing the prevention and treatment of diabetes through the Indian Health Service of the Public Health Service in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
I have written to Secretary Shalala asking her support for partial funding of the Gallup center from this Balanced Budget Act allotment. While I have not received a definitive answer yet, I remain optimistic that the Secretary will see the value of directing the IHS to coordinate its prevention efforts with the CDC through the Gallup center. Does the chairman concur with this strategy?

Mr. DOMENICI. I wish to applaud the subcommittee chairman, Senator Specter, and other members of the Appropriations subcommittee for receiving a consensus on this bill, and at the same time adhering to the important provisions of the bipartisan budget agreement. 
First, let me say this bill has a very exceptional provision in it which was not part of the budget agreement but, rather, was in the Republican budget resolution, and that was to add $5 billion for special education for the next 5 years that was for educating children with disabilities. The appropriations bill includes an additional $775 million for this program, the biggest increase in the history of the program. This is the program that many States were critical of our Government for because we started it and committed a share of the payment and we never lived up to our commitment in the shared expenses of the program but insisted that our rules and regulations be followed by the States. 
Now we are beginning to catch up. Senator Judd Gregg was the leader of this from the State of New Hampshire, and certainly he will take a great deal of pride as this bill works its way to the President for signature--$5 billion over the next 5 years for educating children with disabilities. 
Now, Mr. President, this bill has a lot of different provisions in it for different parts of the U.S. Government, but the education funding for the United States is almost all found in this bill. While we are not a big contributor nationally to education--that is, the National Government--there are some programs that are noteworthy that we agreed in our 22-page agreement, the historic agreement of the President and the Congress, to give high priority to, and I might say on all of these on education, with our bipartisan agreement, this committee lived up to those and funded them in every single instance, even though it meant much of their allocation of resources was being predetermined by this previous agreement. 
Let me give a few examples. Regarding Head Start, the budget agreement called for an additional $2.75 billion over the next 5 years; the appropriations bill provides an additional $274 million for this program. For both these programs I have just discussed, the bill provides more funding than the President's original 1998 budget request. 
Now, looking at Pell grants, which many think are very helpful in getting our young people through college--another very important bipartisan effort--the budget agreement called for an additional $8.6 billion over the next 5 years and to raise the maximum Pell grant to students from $2,700 to $3,000. True to the other measures that I have discussed, the appropriations bill provides an additional $1.4 billion for Pell grants and increased maximum grant awards from $2,700 to $3,000. 
Finally, in the area of bilingual and immigrant education, particularly difficult for our States, the budget agreement called for $446 million over the next 5 years, and the appropriations bill provided $92 million of that increase in this bill. 
Now, I realize many constraints were on this committee, and I want to again offer my words of thanks and congratulations for their fine work and especially for their serious effort to uphold the bipartisan budget agreement. I believe we can all be proud of these particular increases which have such broad bipartisan support. From the standpoint of the Republicans who were part of the bipartisan agreement with the President, I think today on education we are seeing some very positive results from that effort.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, next year, 1998, is the 400th anniversary of Don Juan de Onate's establishment of the first Hispanic colony in New Mexico. In July 1589, he and a few Spanish families settled near modern day San Juan Pueblo and the city of Espanola in northern New Mexico. 
New Mexico will be the center of many exciting events throughout the year to commemorate this extremely important historic milestone. Four hundred years ago Western civilization found itself ensconced in northern New Mexico, and since that time to the present it has been there and part of the culture and part of the value system in the State of New Mexico. 
New Mexico will be the center of many exciting events throughout the year to commemorate this important historic milestone. New Mexicans are looking forward to fiestas, balls, parades, and other stimulating events to mark this historic occasion. 
The Archbishop of Santa Fe will be opening a Jubilee year in January. Among other events, he will hold an encuentro at Santo Domingo Pueblo to mark the meeting of the missionaries with the Pueblo Peoples. 
The city of EspanAE6ola will have a fiesta in July to commemorate the actual arrival of the Spanish into the area. Santa Fe, Las Vegas, Taos, Albuquerque, and other New Mexico towns and cities will be holding such special events as fiestas, historic reenactments, a State Fair Pageant, an historic Spanish costume ball, and parades. Seminars and lectures will abound. 
State Fair pageant plans include a reenactment of De Vargas' reentry into New Mexico, a review of the Pueblo Revolt and its ramifications, life under the American flag during the middle to late 1800's, and a patriotic tribute to all Hispanics who have fought for the United States. This two and a half-hour spectacular will be performed twice before a large audience. It will also be televised. 
This resolution also asks the President to issue a proclamation declaring 1998 is a year to commemorate the arrival of Hispanics and celebrate their growth in importance in our Nation's culture and economy. An estimated 26 million Hispanics in the United States today make up about 11 percent of our population. In New Mexico, Hispanics make up 39 percent of the population, the largest percentage of any State. 
Some projections indicate that by the year 2010, Hispanics will number about 40 million, and by the year 2030, an estimated 60 million Hispanics will be living in the United States, making up about one-fifth of the total population. 
As Hispanic culture continues to grow as a major influence in the United States, the State of New Mexico is creating a major Hispanic Cultural Center in Albuquerque to celebrate and preserve Hispanic arts, literature, performing arts, music, visual arts, culinary arts and other cultural treasures. We are hoping that this Hispanic Cultural Center will become a successful economic venture to attract tourism and to bring national and international attention to Hispanic life in the American Southwest. 
The Cuartocentenario, know in English as the 400th Anniversary, is a time for America to take note of the profound influence of Hispanics in the founding of America as a New World as well as the participation of Hispanics in all walks of life. Hispanics have been noteworthy contributors and will continue to be significant contributors to our national politics, science, arts, economy, and cultural life. 
Mr. President, 1998 is a major milestone for the Spanish settlement in the Southwestern United States. I urge my colleagues to join me in commemorating this important anniversary by supporting this resolution and participating in Hispanic events to mark this important year.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Hispanics of the Southwest and New Mexico will be celebrating an important milestone next year. 1998 is the 400th anniversary of permanent Hispanic presence in New Mexico. In 1598, Juan de OnAE6ate arrived in New Mexico and founded the second city of the United States, San Gabriel de los EspanAE6oles. This was the first permanent Spanish settlement in New Mexico. From New Mexico, Juan de OnAE6ate traveled across the desert to California where he founded San Francisco in 1605. 
On the occasion of the 400th anniversary of Spanish presence, New Mexico will be beginning a new era of Spanish pride and cooperation with other cultures. In New Mexico, we are very proud of our cultural relations between the Indian, Spanish, and Anglo people. It is now time to pay special tribute to the Spanish people of New Mexico, the Southwest, and the United States. 
In preparing for the 400th anniversary celebrations, the State of New Mexico has invested over $17.7 million toward the establishment of phase I of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center. In addition, the city of Albuquerque has donated 10.9 acres and a historic 22,000-square-foot building. Twelve acres of `bosque' land near the Rio Grande have also been donated by the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District. Private contributions are also helping to meet the Hispanic Cultural Center goals. 
I am asking my colleagues to authorize funding to match these New Mexico contributions. This authorization is to build the critical Hispanic Performing Arts Center at an estimated cost of $17.8 million. I believe the people of New Mexico have done an excellent job in committing their own resources for an art gallery, museum, restaurant, ballroom, amphitheater, research center, literary arts center, and other supportive components. 
To showcase the Hispanic culture for all Americans, the Hispanic Performing Arts Center is a vital component. Phase II plans include a 700-seat theater, a stage house, a 300-seat film/video center, a 150-seat black box theater, an art studio building, a culinary art building, and a research and literary arts building. The estimated cost of all phase II components is $26 million. By agreeing to authorize the Hispanic Performing Arts Center, Congress will make a significant contribution toward the phase II plan. 
Not counting the land contributions, phase I and phase II design, construction, equipping, and furnishing is estimated to cost slightly more than $40 million. Major infrastructure components are included in both phases. These include an aqueduct, acequia, and pond from the Barelas Drain; parking; a plaza and courtyard, and landscaping. 
Phase I is now near the bidding stage. The Hispanic Performing Arts and Film Arts--the three theaters--are estimated to cost $17.8 million, with necessary equipment--construction: $15.9 million; fixed equipment: $1.9 million. The remaining components of phase II are estimated to cost $8 million. 
This multifaceted Hispanic Cultural Center is designed to showcase, share, archive, preserve, and enhance the rich Hispanic culture for local, regional, and national audiences. It is designed to be a tourist attraction as well as a great source of local pride. 
The Hispanic Cultural Center will be the southernmost facility on a cultural corridor that includes the Rio Grande Nature Center, the Albuquerque Aquarium, Botanical Gardens, and the Rio Grande Zoo. Historic Old Town Albuquerque is at the center of this cultural corridor. 
Antoine Predock of Albuquerque and Pedro Marquez of Santa Fe were the original design architects. Mr. Predock is an internationally recognized architect and his design will enhance the attractiveness of the center. To promote the Spanish and Southwestern themes, they have emphasized the inclusion of New Mexico architectural features such as adobe construction--like the existing historic building used as the administrative center--courtyards, portals, cottonwoods for shading, and the irrigation ditches known in New Mexico as `acequias'. The site is at the corner of Fourth Street and Bridge Boulevard in Southwest Albuquerque. 
Once built, the Hispanic Cultural Center will employ over 100 people. Tourism dollars are expected to increase in this part of Albuquerque, and new ancillary businesses are anticipated to complement and enhance the attractions in the historic Barelas Neighborhood of Albuquerque. 
The many forms of art, culture, research, performing arts, culinary arts, literature, and other activities are expected to add important cultural connections to the roots of the local and state Hispanic people. Completion of the Hispanic Performing Arts Center will be the major facility needed to showcase live and filmed Spanish cultural events. A whole new industry of preserving, showcasing, and enhancing pride in Spanish cultural roots is a vital anticipated benefit of this New Mexico-based Hispanic institution. 
Visitors are expected from California, New York, Florida, Texas, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and other States with large Hispanic populations. The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center and its active Hispanic Performing Arts Center are expected to become nationally known treasures of living Hispanic culture in America. 
I believe that authorizing Federal funding for the Hispanic Performing Arts Center will be a significant step toward this budding national treasure in its critical formative stages. I urge my colleagues to support the funding for the Hispanic Performing Arts Center in Albuquerque, NM, in honor of the 400th anniversary of Spanish culture, and in hopes of seeing the preservation and enhancement of this culture flourish into its 500th year.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as I work with my colleagues to increase federal support for combating the incidence of diabetes particularly among minorities such as American Indians, Hispanics, Blacks, and Asians, I would like to draw your attention to an article in Monday's Washington Times, November 3, 1997. It is by Joyce Howard Price and entitled `Surge in diabetes tied to unhealthy lifestyles.' 
Dr. Gerald Bernstein, President-elect of the American Diabetes Association, is reported to say that the national increase in diabetes was predictable, `given that the population is older, fatter, and less active.' 
Dr. Bernstein was referring to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimating that 16 million Americans currently have diabetes, but only 10 million have been diagnosed. He said, `Cancer is much more dramatic and devastating. With diabetes, you erode and rot away. It's almost like leprosy.' 
The article goes on to quote Dr. Richard C. Eastman, director of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases who said, `While we usually get an increase of 3 to 4 percent, there was an 8 percent increase this year. We fund 1 in 4 or 1 in 5 investigators.' Dr. Eastman estimates the current national research effort in diabetes at $200 million. 
Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Donna Shalala agreed with me earlier this year that a special effort is needed to create a multi-million dollar effort for a `large-scale, coordinated primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention effort among the Navajo, who have a large population with a high incidence of diabetes and risk factors for diabetes.' 
I have reached agreements in the Senate Appropriations bill for Labor-HHS to fund such a center for preventing diabetes in Gallup, New Mexico. In a colloquy with Subcommittee Chairman Arlen Specter, we will affirm the need for this center in our national approach to alleviating the acute increases in diabetes, especially among American Indians whose incidence rate is almost three times the national average. 
Among Navajo Indians over age 45, two in five have been diagnosed as diabetic, and many experts believe that almost four in five actually have diabetes, but we will not know until our outreach and testing efforts are improved on this vast Indian reservation. 
Dr. Bernstein `points out that the gene that predisposes someone to diabetes is five times more prevalent in American Indians than in whites and twice as prevalent in blacks, Hispanics and Asians than in non-Hispanic whites.' He says the disease has `failed to get priority status because it strikes minorities disproportionately.' 
He is absolutely right about the lack of attention to the problems of Navajo and Zuni Indians in New Mexico and Arizona. I would remind my colleagues that the Balanced Budget Act of 1998 has a $30 million per year program for preventing and treating diabetes among American Indians through the Indian Health Service (IHS). This commitment is for five years or a total of $150 million. 
I am currently working with HHS Secretary Shalala to coordinate the efforts of this IHS funding from the Balanced Budget Act with CDC to focus on designing more culturally relevant prevention and diagnosis approaches in a new prevention research center in Gallup, New Mexico. Even if we are slow to learn more about treating this dreaded disease, enough is known today to significantly control the negative end results of diabetes like blindness, amputation, and kidney failure. 
I hope my colleagues will continue to support my efforts to create this very specialized center for the study of improving prevention techniques for Indians and other minorities. In the case of Navajo and Zuni Indians, prevention can be difficult to incorporate into daily reservation life. Exercise programs may not be readily available, dietary changes may be contrary to local custom for preparing foods, or soft drinks may be routinely substituted for drinking water that is not plentiful or potable. 
These kinds of factors in Indian life will be studied carefully at the Gallup Diabetes Prevention Research Center. Recommendations and CDC assistance will be provided to IHS service providers throughout the Navajo Nation, the Zuni Pueblo, and other Apache and Pueblo Indians in New Mexico and Arizona. It is my hope that improved diagnostic and prevention programs will readily flow from this Gallup center to all IHS facilities around the country. 
It may surprise my colleagues as it did me, that in the 1950's the IHS officially reported negligible rates of diabetes among Navajo Indians. In less than 50 years, diabetes has gone from negligible to rampant and epidemic.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity of commending Senator Bond for his efforts in bringing this Small Business Reauthorization Act to the floor for consideration. In particular, I am grateful for his deep commitment and tireless dedication to improving the Small Business Administration's [SBA] Women's Business Centers program. As a result of his work, this program will be expanded and modified so that it targets more appropriately the thousands of women entrepreneurs who provide jobs and economic growth to their local communities. 
I also want to commend Congresswoman Nancy Johnson for her strong support of this program. My legislation, S. 888, the Women's Business Centers Act of 1997, introduced in behalf of myself, Senator Bond, Senator Kerry and 23 other cosponsors, was the companion bill to Representative Johnson's legislation. Due to the strong bipartisan support of Chairman Bond and other members of the Senate Small Business Committee, S. 888 was incorporated into this reauthorization bill. Congresswoman Johnson has been a long-time and dedicated friend of women's business efforts, and I am most appreciative that we were able to work together on this important measure. 
Many of us believe that the SBA must give renewed attention to one of its smallest but most successful business programs. This legislation, therefore, doubles the amount of funds available to Women's Business Centers, and it extends the grant period from 3 years to 5 years. It also changes the funding formula so that newly created business sites will have a more realistic Federal-to-non-Federal matching program. This latter issue is important because up to this point, women's business centers have been required to meet a much stricter matching grant requirement than have other grantees in the SBA's grant programs. I remain somewhat concerned, however, that existing business site grantees must still bear a slightly higher burden of matching fund requirements. Nevertheless, the overall changes to the Women's Business Centers Program are noteworthy and extremely positive. 
By passage of this reauthorization language, Congress recognizes the essential role of women-owned small businesses to this country's local and national economies. Congress also recognizes the necessity of added SBA administrative and programmatic support to the women's program. The SBA must ensure that the Office of Women's Business Ownership [OWBO] has adequate staffing and resources to manage this expanded program. It must also provide any supplemental assistance OWBO may need to manage its ongoing program while developing new and creative activities to enhance its present portfolio. Frankly, a program of this nature demands tangible agency commitment to its success. While OWBO and its women's business clients have an impressive and outstanding programmatic record, this small program deserves much more attention from the Agency than it has received thus far. I am hopeful that next year and in the years to come the SBA will work more closely with OWBO, as well as with Congress, to ensure that women's businesses are provided the necessary resources to continue their vital entrepreneurial endeavors. 
I believe it is also important to give credit to the many able and committed directors and staff of the Women's Business Centers throughout the country. I know these professional women, like those of Agnes Noonan and her staff in my State of New Mexico, have counseled countless thousands of potential business clients and have established equal numbers of successful small businesses. Their tasks have not been easy, but they have met their management obligations while also creating an impressive and wide-ranging network of business colleagues to address the special challenges of women-owned businesses. The techniques they've learned and the expertise they share with one another have been instrumental in the overall success of this SBA program. 
Once again, I commend Senator Bond for his attention and commitment to the Women's Business Centers Program. His able staff, particularly Ms. Suey Howe and Mr. Paul Cooksey, provided excellent professional support so that this program was reviewed and modified appropriately. I am very pleased Chairman Bond and other members of the committee have given this issue the attention it deserves. Women-owned businesses are an integral component of our Nation's business sector and are instrumental to our country's overall economic health. The efforts of the Chairman and the committee will ensure that this SBA business program continues its obligations to so many deserving and successful women entrepreneurs. Thank you for the opportunity of sharing my support of this important program.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the resolution of disapproval of the fiscal year 1998 military construction appropriations bill. In his special veto message, the President offered the following three criteria for each of the canceled items: `The project is being canceled for because: 
`First, it was not requested in the President's fiscal year 1998 budget; second, it would not substantially improve the quality of life of military service members and their families; and third, architectural engineering and design of this project has not started, making it unlikely that these funds can be used for construction during fiscal year 1998.' 
Mr. President, the Congress gave the President line-item veto authority to eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending. The Congress examined all of these projects very carefully and found them to be merit worthy and mission essential. In fact, the Appropriations Committee used stringent criteria including: 
First, whether the project was mission essential; second, whether the project will enhance readiness, safety, or working conditions for service personnel; third, whether a site has been identified for the project; fourth, whether any money has been spent on the design or the project; fifth, whether the Department can begin to execute the project during fiscal year 1998; and, sixth, whether the project was included in the Department's future year defense plan. 
Mr. President, these projects substantially meet the criteria established by the Appropriations Committee. Moreover, the Appropriations Committee worked closely with the military services in crafting its bill. In contrast, it is widely known that the President neglected to consult the military services in deciding which projects should be vetoed on this bill. 
First, I want to make clear that if the President thinks that the only good project is one that he recommends, then he will continue to meet strong opposition in the Congress. I remind the President that article I, section 8, of the Constitution gives the Congress the right to raise and support armies. That means that if the Congress believes that a particular project will support the needs and requirements of the military that is not only their right, but their responsibility, to do so. 
I am heartened by the fact that the President has used his line-item veto pen more sparingly on the various appropriations bills that have been sent to him since this military construction bill. However, Mr. President, let's be clear about his action on this particular bill. I believe it was an abuse of his authority for three reasons. First, vetoing these projects will not eliminate unnecessary or wasteful spending. Second, it is clear that none of the spending in this bill violates the budget agreement. Finally, using the President's own criteria, it is clear that the President made several errors. 
On October 6, 1997, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee conducted a hearing to review the status of the 38 vetoed projects. Throughout the hearing, Senators asked the witnesses whether particular vetoed projects met the criteria as set out by the President. Most questions centered on the issue of whether each project could be executed in fiscal year 1998 and if that project were mission essential. In every case, Mr. President, the answers were affirmative. 
Among the items the President vetoed were two New Mexico projects. The first project was $14 million for the construction of a new building for the theater air command control and simulation facility [TACCSF] at Kirtland Air Force Base [KAFB]. This project is in the Department's fiscal year 2002 budget. It is mission essential; 35 percent of the design has been completed with $1.4 million the Congress appropriated last year for this purpose. A site has been chosen for the project, and it is executable this year. Clearly, Mr. President, the President made a serious error in vetoing this project. 
The TACCSF is the only facility where fighter crews, command control personnel, and air defense teams operate together in a realistic virtual war fighting environment. TACCSF allows Air Force war fighters to train with Army and Marine personnel under one roof, often their only opportunity to rehearse shoot-don't shoot procedures in a complex friend or foe environment. 
Expanding TACCSF's simulation capabilities will support cost-effective development of Air Force systems. TACCSF has flexible simulation architecture that allows new concepts, components, or procedures to be tested in a virtual environment, giving hands-on experience years prior to first prototype--user feedback during early design results in enormous development cost savings. 
TACCSF's present building does not allow for any expansion. A new facility is needed to meet growth needs. It is impossible to expand the current facility sufficiently to accommodate the simulators, supporting infrastructure and personnel growth needed to maintain TACCSF's preeminent capabilities. Failure to provide the requested new facility seriously jeopardizes TACCSF's ability to support DOD and the Air Force's vision for modeling and simulation in support of the war fighter. 
The second project the President vetoed was $6.9 million for the launch complex revitalization program at White Sands missile range. Once again, using the President's own criteria, he made a serious error. This project will substantially improve the quality of life of military service members, 10 percent of the design has been completed, and the project is executable in fiscal year 1998. The project is mission essential and there is no question that it will enhance safety. 
Four launch complexes at WSMR are suffering from deterioration in crumbling structures, failing facility components and below-par sanitary and sewage systems. Many of the complex facilities do not meet current safety laws and regulations. Adequate fire detection and suppression systems do not exist in the buildings and explosive handling areas. WSMR spokesmen have stated, `This totally involves a safety issue. There's quite a bit of activity that is conducted at these launch complexes. It is a potential breeding ground for hantavirus if infrastructure improvements to these areas is not made.' Moreover, Mr. President, the commanding general of WSMR stated in a letter to the delegation members that he was very concerned about the safety of his people who worked in these facilities. 
Mr. President, the President made serious errors on both these projects. All of them are mission essential and can be executed in fiscal year 1998. The Presidents' arbitrary and unfair exercise of his power demands the Congress' action. I applaud the chairman and ranking member for acting timely on this matter. I strongly support it, and hope my colleagues will do the same.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, now I would like to talk to my fellow Senators. In particular I would like to talk to the Republicans on this side of the aisle. I say that because I hear some of them asking questions about why were we for line-item veto and how can we justify voting to override the President. If it fits some Senators' concerns on the other side, fine. 
Let me just say, fellow Republicans, we took the lead, once we got control of the House and Senate, to pass this new law called line-item veto. I want to make sure everybody understands that we could not have intended to say that we would never override a President's line-item veto. Obviously, when we passed that, inherent in our passage of that measure was the fact that Congress still had to have some significant say about the propriety, the validity, the appropriateness of line-item vetoes. If it means, if we supported the original line-item veto legislation, whatever the President chooses to do under line-item veto, since we voted for that law we have to concede the President's authority, then I don't think any on this side of the aisle would raise their hands and say that is what they voted for line-item veto to mean. I can assure you I did not. 
As a matter of fact, I would submit that it is quite right for the Senate of the United States to stand on its two feet and say to the President: You have line-item veto authority but it does not mean you can exercise it any old way you want. The sooner we send that signal to this President--either a Republican President or this one--the sooner you send the signal that there are certain circumstances under which, by virtue of our authority, that we would say `no' to a President, the better the President will respect the propriety of the notion that we are equal under the Constitution and that the President didn't gain superiority over appropriations when we passed the line-item veto legislation. 
So it is almost as if we have a gift of the right situation to send that signal to the President, because in this case there is no doubt of the following set of circumstances. 
No. 1, it is now acknowledged by the White House that many of the line-item vetoes, if not all, were issued and done by the President in error. Nobody will come to this floor and deny that. The problem is, they won't tell us how many are in error. We have concluded that almost every one that is on this list, in this bill of override, is in error, if we believed the statements by the White House as to why the line-item veto was used in the first place. We went through each one. We put the financial management officers for the three armed services in front of the Appropriations Committee and asked them the questions that related, not to something we dreamt up, but something the White House told us were the criteria. 
Mr. President, they were simple criteria: Is project in the 1998 budget request, or did we just dream it up? Question No. 1. Second, has the engineering and design has started? And tied into that one is that the project contracts could be issued in 1998, the year of this appropriation. And the third one, that it was something that would improve the quality of life of military men and women and their families? 
Frankly, we asked the questions of the military financial officers. In almost every one of these 38 projects, they said they were in the Defense Department 5-year plan, or they did do substantial improvement to quality of life, to family life, or third, design had been started and the project could commence during the appropriation year of 1998. 
When the White House then says, well, it may be that we in the White House made mistakes; that 18 of these vetoed projects don't fit our own criteria; it may be that 16 didn't fit our criteria--in any event, we are not going to tell you exactly which ones. I say to the Senators who are wondering whether they should vote for this, that is enough to vote for the override. If you ever want to change the power structure, then let a President get by with that. He line-item vetoes and then he says, `I made a mistake, but I am 
sticking with them and I am not going to tell you which ones I made a mistake on.' If you can't discern that, then it seems to me you have to send it back to him with a great big vote in the Senate and the House saying, `Since you won't tell us, we are giving them all back to you. And if you send them back, we are going to adopt them in law and override your veto, because you haven't squared with us.' 
I can think of some other reasons. Each Senator who voted for the line-item veto and who is worried about whether he can now vote to override, I ask just a simple question. Did you really mean you would never override? Of course you would say no. If you meant you might override sometimes, what is a more perfect case than this? You have two reasons: The projects are bona fide projects that meet any reasonable criteria; and the President will not tell us which ones are incorrectly vetoes, although he says there are some, that don't fit the criteria. 
I know there are some former Governors in the Senate who are going to speak to line-item veto. I don't know which way they are coming down on this. But I take it from many Governors that they never had such a large argument over line-item veto in many years of being Governors; that all of a sudden you get 38 projects out of one bill, $287 million, and they don't know why it was done or why others were left in. 
So, from our standpoint, this is the appropriate time to send a signal that line-item veto is not a one-way street; that Congress has a role. If it is not used reasonably and rationally as a policy instrument, then it will be overridden, and I hope we do that. I hope it is a very big bipartisan vote, because I think it is apt to be the same in the U.S. House of Representatives. We will start this process off on the right track.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending Agriculture and related agencies appropriations bill provides $49.0 billion in new budget authority [BA] and $41.5 billion in new outlays to fund most of the programs of the Department of Agriculture and other related agencies for fiscal year 1998. 
When outlays from prior year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the bill totals $48.8 billion in budget authority and $49.2 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998. 
Of the $49.2 billion in outlays, $35.2 billion fund entitlement programs like food stamps, child nutrition programs, and price support payments. The remaining $14.0 billion funds discretionary programs like rural housing and economic development, food safety inspection, activities of the Food and Drug Administration, agriculture research and the Farm Service Agency. 
The conference report falls within the current 302(b) allocation for the Agriculture and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee. I commend the distinguished Senator from Mississippi for bringing this bill to the floor within the subcommittee's allocation. 
The bill contains important increases over the 1997 level from programs like the WIC Program and the new food safety initiative, and I urge adoption of the conference report.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under Section 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for 1986. 
This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget through October 24, 1997. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of the 1998 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. Res. 84), show that current level spending is below the budget resolution by $34.9 billion in budget authority and above the budget resolution by $1.9 billion in outlays. Current level is $1.6 billion below the revenue floor in 1998 and $2.5 billion above the revenue floor over the five years 1998-2002. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $177.0 billion, $3.7 billion above the maximum deficit amount for 1998 of $173.3 billion. 
Since my last report, dated October 1, 1997, the Congress has cleared, and the President has signed, the Oklahoma City National Memorial Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-58) and the following appropriation acts: Further Continuing Appropriations (P.L. 105-64), Energy and Water Development (P.L. 105-62), Treasury and General Government (P.L. 105-61), Veterans, Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies (P.L. 105-65), and Transportation (P.L. 105-66). These actions changed the current level of budget authority, outlays and revenues.

Essentially, it does nothing more than say, for the remainder of this year, which is almost gone, the court order that could have forced some of the small ranchers to take their cattle off ranch land and set them aside while they do a new evaluation, we said that cannot happen in that manner until after this year is past, which is like a month or two.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, section 205 of House Concurrent Resolution 84, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1998, allows the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to adjust the allocation for the Appropriations Committee to reflect new budget authority and outlays provided for priority Federal land acquisitions and exchanges.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to explain the need for a reallocation in funding authority for the Appropriations Committee that is being filed today. 
I regret that this reallocation is necessary because it was avoidable. 
Section 205 of the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution provided for the allocation of $700 million in budget authority for Federal land acquisitions and to finalize priority land exchanges upon the reporting of a bill that included such funding. 
The Senate-reported Interior appropriations bill included this funding in title V. As chairman of the Budget Committee, I allocated these funds to the Appropriations Committee, which in turn provided them to the Interior Subcommittee. 
If the conferees had adopted the Senate language, I would not be here withdrawing this funding allocation. However, the conferees modified the Senate language to provide only $699 million for land acquisitions, and to expand the use of these funds for the following purposes: 
Critical maintenance activities are added as an allowable activity under this title V funding; 
Ten million dollars is provided for a payment to Humboldt County, CA, as part of the Headwaters land acquisition; and 
Twelve million dollars is provided for repair and maintenance of the Beartooth Highway as part of the Crown Butte/New World Mine land acquisition. 
The Senate Budget Committee provided clarifying language to the conferees on the Interior appropriations bill during their meeting on September 30. This language simply restated that monies provided in title V, when combined with monies provided by other titles of the bill for Federal land acquisition, shall provide at least $700 million for Federal land acquisitions and to finalize priority land exchanges. 
This language, which I urged be included throughout the past 2 weeks while final language was drafted, would have ensured that the section 205 allocation remained in place for this bill. 
The chairmen decided to include, however, language which attempts to trigger the additional $700 million by amending the budget resolution. This language causes a violation under section 306 of the Budget Act because it affects matters within the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee. 
Since this language will not become effective until the bill is signed into law, and the conferees did not clarify that $700 million is included in the bill for land acquisition and priority land exchanges, I have no choice but to withdraw the additional allocation of funding provided in section 205 of the budget resolution. 
I worked diligently as a member of the conference to complete this important bill, working with my good friend, the senior Senator from Washington, who chairs this subcommittee. 
The inclusion of a simple proviso would have avoided this problem. I regret that the chairmen of the conference chose not to do so, and that this withdrawal of funding is now necessary.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I also object to the inclusion of directed scorekeeping language in this bill. If the Senator took language amending the budget resolution into account for determining budgetary levels, the budget resolution levels and our efforts to enforce a balanced budget plan would become meaningless. 
Instead of making the choices necessary to live within the budget resolution levels, committees could simply rely on a precedent to assert, or `deem,' that they had complied with the budgetary limits, even though they hadn't. 
Such action would undermine the budget discipline of the Senate. 
Since the directed scorekeeping language will not become effective until the bill is signed into law, and the conferees did not clarify that $700 million is included in the bill for land acquisition and priority land exchanges, I have no choice but to withdraw the additional allocation of funding provided in section 205 of the budget resolution for land acquisition and exchanges.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference agreement accompanying H.R. 2169, the Department of Transportation and related agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. 
I congratulate the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Shelby, for completing his first bill as chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. I commend the chairman for bringing the Senate a balanced bill. 
As all members know, transportation spending was a priority area within the bipartisan budget agreement. With passage of this bill, we begin to increase funding for our Nation's infrastructure as we promised during negotiations on the balanced budget agreement. 
The conference agreement provides $13.1 billion budget authority [BA] and $13.5 billion in new outlays to fund the programs of the Department of Transportation, including Federal-aid highways, mass transit, aviation activities, the U.S. Coast Guard, and transportation safety agencies. 
When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other adjustments are taken into account, the bill totals $13.1 billion in budget authority and $37.9 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998. 
The reported bill is $0.1 billion in budget authority below the subcommittee's revised section 302(b) allocation, and at the subcommittee's allocation for outlays. 
The spending is less than $0.1 billion in budget authority below the President's fiscal year 1998 budget request for the subcommittee, and $0.4 billion in outlays above the President's request. 
Mr. President, it is my pleasure to serve on the subcommittee and to be a part of the Conference Committee. 
I support the conference agreement, and I urge its adoption.

Mr. DOMENICI. I was delighted to yield. First, I would like to make a part of the Record and I would like Senators to know a little history about the trust fund and whether or not there really is a surplus. At least on the Republican side I would like them to read the Republican policy statement issued on October 6, just a few days ago, that analyzes the history of this. It will be good reading. If there ever was a myth, it is the myth about the great, great trust fund buildup that is there for highways that we ought to be using, everybody says; this budget process is just building that big reserve and that big slush fund. This will tell you that is kind of a paper tiger. I would call it one of the greatest myths around. 
Having said that, let me clear up the second point. No Republican voted for the 4.3-cent-gasoline tax. So I say to Senator Warner, you can get up and say you didn't. You are in good company. None of them did. 
On the other hand, I can say to my friend from West Virginia, you did, because every Democrat voted for it. The important thing is, what was it for? I understand that in 1956 Senator Byrd's wife was buying gasoline at the pump. I was just a small guy then, but I was buying gasoline at the pump. I had a little Chevrolet, secondhand car that my dad gave me, and it was secondhand from his business. 
Let me tell you, this 4.3 cents was adopted in a balanced budget proposal by this President, voted for by Democrats. I will tell you, some of us said that it wouldn't work, and maybe it worked better than we thought, but I say to my good friend from West Virginia, there was no diversion of highway trust fund moneys. It was voted up or down in the General Treasury to reduce the deficit. We can bring that down here and talk about it. It was not a gasoline tax for highway use. It was a gasoline tax to reduce the deficit. 
I submit, since we think we have balanced the budget, Mr. President, maybe the time is to give the 4.3 cents back to the States. That might be a good idea. Its original purpose was to help balance the budget. Let's say to the American people, `We're giving it back to you because we don't need it to balance the budget.' 
I say to Senator Byrd, I know you want me to yield, but you have been down here a long time. You used the word `propaganda' about what I sent around. I want to make sure this attack on propaganda is equal, so I can attack propaganda about how great this amendment is and what it isn't going to do. 
Frankly, we are going to have a lot longer discussion about this, but it is wonderful to just visualize and think for a minute how far we have come. 
June the 5th--anybody waiting around for me to say what year--this year, June the 5th, 1997, we overwhelmingly adopted a balanced budget resolution. And everybody was praising us. And John Warner, a wonderful Senator from Virginia, you are hugging Domenici saying, `You finally got it done'--June 5th. 
Just a little while later, July 31st, this year--not 10 years ago--we adopted two bills, one by a vote of 85-15. Now, I imagine in this debate some can stand and say I did not vote for it. Maybe Phil Gramm can say that. I was not one of the 15. He did not vote for the budget resolution, anyway. 
Anyway, 85 Senators voted for the bill to implement that balanced budget. And lo and behold, on the same day, 92 Senators voted on a new tax bill for the United States of America--all part of a big plan to balance the budget. 
What actually has happened, Mr. President, and fellow Senators, is that along comes a highway bill, after all that is done, and by an accident of time it comes after the Budget Act and on to the floor comes Senators saying, `Let's spend $31 billion more on highways than we expected just on June 5th, 1997.' 
Now, is Senator Domenici saying you are breaking the budget? Well, I don't know. I am just telling you that on June the 5th you voted in a budget resolution that sets obligation authority for highways, and now before the year ends you are saying, without another budget, without another debate, without any decision about where the money is going to come from--I will talk about that in a minute--we all decide we are going to add $31 billion to the highway program. 
Anybody that thinks Senator Pete Domenici is not for highways has Senator Pete Domenici wrong. In fact, about my own State, I have to say that we are not spending enough on highways. And it is going to be very detrimental to the future of our State. Most of it is because we do not want to spend any of our own money. And in our urban areas we put in about $80 million every 2 or 3 years in a bond election. We ought to put $250 million, in my opinion. 
The point is, I am for spending more money on highways. And I will present an amendment that does justice to the votes of these Senators on June 5th and July 31st. For my amendment will say: Early next year when we do a new budget resolution and we thoroughly debate--what?--prospects for a surplus--I am hearing people running around saying there is going to be a big surplus. We are going to debate that. 
I hope there is a great national debate because, to tell you the truth, the deficits are going to be down in the year 1998, 1999, and the next year dramatically from what we predicted. And I believe, absent some catastrophe, in the short term we will balance the budget and have a lot of money left over in the year 2002. 
But before we get too excited, during that debate we will have a presentation, if not by others, by me, telling you what is going to happen in about 12 years or 14 when the baby boomers hit this. Just like one of these giant pythons when they swallow some big monster animal, they can hardly digest; it gets about that big. That is the way the budget is going to go--huge. 
Frankly, I want to tell you what I think this amendment does. I believe there is a disagreement in philosophy between the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, and his cosponsor, Senator Gramm of Texas. Senator Gramm has said--and he put it in a circular that has gone to everybody around to muster up support--and the fourth point he makes in his circular is that we will not spend any more money as a result of spending $31 billion more on highways than we expected, we will not spend any more money. 
That does not sound possible, does it? Of course, it does. Senator Gramm says we will take it out of the rest of Government. So what we had planned to spend in Government, which incidentally for those who think we were going to spend a lot of money, get ready. The appropriated accounts on the domestic side are expected to increase five-tenths of 1 percent in each of the next 4 years, I say to my friend from West Virginia. That is the number built in the law. 
Now, think with me. Senator Gramm says, $31 billion more spent on highways than contemplated, but we are not going to spend any more. Where is it going to come from? Now, the version of the Senator from Texas is to take it out of the rest of Government, except defense, I assume. Wait a minute--you shake your head--it is not right. 
It is impossible that you can spend $31 billion and not break the caps that are currently established or reduce the level of spending in the appropriated accounts other than transportation. It is arithmetically impossible. That is not philosophy; that is just plain old numbers. 
Now, Senator Byrd is saying, if I hear him right, `Now wait a minute.' 
Mr. BYRD: Be careful now. Be careful.

Mr. DOMENICI. `I want to spend this 4.2-cent gasoline tax. I want to spend it on highways. On the other hand, I'm willing, when the time comes, to increase the domestic caps so 
we don't have to cut appropriations.' 
Now, is this amendment a budget buster or is it not? I guess one could say we are not breaking the budget because somehow the money is going to come down from Heaven and come into this trust fund, or some will say we are just going to go to the NIH and we are not going to get rid of it like Senator Domenici suggested, we are just going to cut it 5 percent. And we are not going to get rid of all those items that somebody read off my letter, we are just going cut them off 5, 6 percent. Well, everybody ought to know what we are going to cut to spend $31 billion. And the problem with this process: They will not know until we have already put on the new map $31.6 billion in highway funds. 
That is the truth of it. Why do I think we should do it another way? And I urge you all to do it another way. I urge that we not spend the money, the 4.3 cents, the $31.6 billion, that we not obligate it now but, rather, we say the following in an amendment--and if Senator Byrd wants to know what my amendment is, I am explaining it right now--that we adopt an amendment that says, when the budget process is finished, and the debate has concluded on what we should do with our money next year, including surpluses, and the following years, when we have decided, if Congress decides to spend more money on highways then, put it right in the budget resolution, an automatic supplemental appropriation. An amendment to the Highway Act will occur so that you have accomplished it and everybody has had their chance to debate where the $31 billion comes from. 
And I surmise that some of you might say, including my wonderful debating friend, Senator Gramm, you might say, `Domenici, you know, they're going to put it in highways anyway.' Well, that works both ways. If you know they are going to vote to put it in highways, why don't you wait and do it when everybody can vote on the difference between spending it here and not spending it in education or spending a surplus to build highways? 
That is a fair proposal on our part. I will draw the language for you. I will let you help me. Then I will tell you, if you prevail in this debate that you want some surplus going in here, that you want to cut other programs to put more here, I will be on the floor supporting you to the best of my ability right on through. 
Frankly, I do not think--you know, I used to be, in all honesty--I will not tell you when it stopped happening, I say to Senator Byrd--but I used to really fret when I thought I had to come down here and argue with you. Because I figured I did not know enough. And by the time you got through with the process down here, you taught me a lesson. You taught me it early. The rules are made for you. If you do not use them, it is your fault. And if I use them, it is because I have a right to. 
I did not feel up to it back yonder. But I welcome this debate. And if you all win, you know, I am not going to lose any sleep. But I think I will make the point that this is not the way to run the Government of the United States 4 months after you pass a balanced budget and you put caps on what you can spend for each of the next 5 years, literally dollar numbers written in the law for all the domestic accounts, including highways. They are all in that cap. You cannot raise the cap without 60 votes saying, `Raise the cap.' 
And along comes the appropriations process, which is the other vehicle you can use, and you cannot--you cannot--mysteriously find $31 billion to spend. You put new commitments in with the same amount of money to spend for everything--not one penny less or one penny more. It does not change. There is no inflation built into those caps. They are not tied to the economy of the United States. They are flat literal numbers. 
And why are they numbers? Because we found the only thing that worked to control spending on the appropriated side was to say if you exceed the caps, the Executive must put in an automatic sequester so it is the only thing that works. And it works because twice the White House--not this one--sent us a little signal. We were $40 million-some over the cap once, and Dick Darman said, just so you will all know that it works, he sequestered every account in Government to the tune of a total of $43 million, which I think was one-tenth of one-hundredth of one-thousandth of a percent, but to prove it works. 
It was sort of a bit of the leftover of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. Probably the one notion of real consequence was the notion of a sequester, which most people never heard the word before. In fact, I had not until you introduced the bill--or until we helped you rewrite the bill or whatever. I worked on it for a long time, I say to the Senator. 
I am going to quit for now because if I am going to bore the Senate with my entire speech tonight they will not listen to me the next time. And I want to make sure that they all hear this and that they all hear my version of this. And then they can vote as they please because that is what we were 
elected for. 
I want to close by saying to all that big lobby group, believe you me, when you say `lobby groups,' don't think that the highway people are not lobbying. Man, oh, man, you would think that the only ones lobbying are the manufacturers of America. They are all out there now that you have spoken tonight. When these Senators go home on this recess, they will claw at them. They will already know how much more is going to be spent on their highway projects. It will not be the citizens. It will be the highway builders. Nothing wrong with that. There is not one Senator that said they should not, but, boy, they are going to tell you every penny is needed. And they aren't going to know one diddly about the process going on up here or what they are competing with. It is just: Build the roads. 
Someday we are going to build more roads. Maybe I will be voting for building more roads. But I tell you for now, you have not come close to convincing me that this is the way to do it. I urge that you go back and find a way to draft a contingent bill, draft a bill contingent upon the Congress of the United States in the budget process increasing the obligational authority that you think we ought to have. 
I am willing to help you draft that and say if Congress votes that in as it sets its new priorities--and, yes, I would even say decides whether it wants to spend more money--then I will be right there with you when the time comes seeing that you get it. But I just believe that, you know--I cannot yet tonight tell you, but I will be able to in a week, how this changes the system that was working. 
I do not mean by that, spending the trust fund reserves. There can be a big argument about the unified budget and taking it off budget. I just mean, to come in at this date just because a highway bill is due and add $31 billion this way without having to face up to any competing needs, and leaving that competition to another day, or as one would say, `Don't worry about the competition. We'll just increase the caps and spend more,' I think that ought to be done not in the context of a highway bill that gives everybody some goodies that they are all prone to vote for, 
I think it should be done in a framework of the U.S. Senate at its best, determining what the overall expenditures of Government ought to be, and maybe I will even say tonight how much of the surplus we want to spend and how much you want to leave, how much you want to put in the Social Security trust fund, and all kinds of nice things. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the conference agreement on H.R. 2158, the VA-HUD appropriations bill for 1998. 
This bill provides new budget authority of $90.7 billion and new outlays of $52.9 billion to finance operations of the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, and other independent agencies. 
I congratulate the distinguished subcommittee chairman and ranking member for producing a bill that is within the Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. When outlays from prior-year BA and other adjustments are taken into account, the bill totals $89.9 billion in BA and $100 billion in outlays. The total bill is exactly at the Senate subcommittee's 302(b) nondefense allocation for budget authority and outlays. The bill is under the Senate Subcommittee's defense allocation by $2 million in BA and by $1 million in outlays. 
Further, I am pleased that the conferees have produced a bill that largely is in accord with the budget agreement reached with the Administration earlier this year.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor S. 1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1997 that was introduced yesterday by Senator Gramm, Dodd, and myself. We were joined by a significant number of the Banking Committee members. 
After an extensive series of hearings which established a pattern of widespread abuse of the securities laws by class action lawyers, the Congress, in 1995, passed a major overhaul of the class action rules for frivolous securities litigation. The law is also designed to increase the flow of information to investors. 
The Act will be 2 years old at the end of the year. With benefit of these 2 years of experience there is evidence that plaintiffs' lawyers have simply moved their frivolous cases to State court to avoid the new Federal reforms. 
A study by Stanford Law School professors Joseph Grunfest and Michael Perino found that since the passage of the Federal reforms in 1995, about 26 percent of class action litigation activity has moved from Federal courts to State courts--an unprecedented shift. 
The Stanford study concluded that this shift to State court is calculated to `avoid the substantive or procedural provisions of the 1995 reform act--the very provision that deter abusive lawsuits.' 
Under State law, plaintiff's lawyers still can engage in practices that were prohibited by Congress in 1995. 
State courts still allow `boilerplate' complaints; fishing expeditions in the name of discovery even before the plaintiffs' lawyers establish that they have the barest of facts to support their case. 
State courts still allow pet plaintiffs. This is the perverse practice by which the lawyer hires the client, not the more customary arrangement under which a client hires the lawyer. 
State courts still allow lawsuits simply if the price of the stock drops. Congress decided in 1995 that stock volatility is not stock fraud. 
State courts still allow lawsuits if a prediction about the future of the company doesn't come true--even when the statement is accompanied with appropriate warnings that the prediction may not come true and that it is a prediction. 
The lack of safe harbors for predictions about the company's future muzzle CEO's and chill the flow of information. 
Corporate disclosures reduce the volatility of share prices and increase the liquidity of stock. Yet, State courts do not have safe harbors for predictions as a result, the information flow to investors is limited because State lawsuits are undermining the `safe harbors' that were crafted in the 1995 Act. 
There is a tremendous value to corporate disclosures. Forward looking corporate disclosures dramatically lower the cost of capital. Firms that voluntarily disclose information increase their pool of potential investors, and those investors have a more accurate understanding of the firms' likely future performance. There is an overwhelming consensus in the academic, business and investor communities that these factors greatly enhance a firm's ability to attract capital and therefore contribute to economic growth. 
The targets of these State-court securities class actions are the high-tech leaders of the future. These are the companies producing the exciting products, and creating excellent jobs. 
One of these lawsuits can cripple a young high-tech company. During our first round of hearings, the general counsel for Intel stated that if Intel had been hit with one of these lawsuits in its early days, there might not be an Intel today. One of these frivolous lawsuits could have put them out of business. 
These lawsuits are destructive, and the 1995 reforms were designed to protect innocent companies and to provide more information to investors. 
The purpose of this legislation is to make sure that the 1995 act works the way that Congress intended. 
The bill creates a very narrow preemption requiring that class action law suits involving nationally-traded securities be litigated in Federal court. This would ensure that remedies available to purchasers and sellers of these nationally-traded securities would be uniform and would not vary depending upon the State in which the purchaser or seller lives. 
Specifically, the bill only affects class actions in which damages are sought on behalf of more than 25 people. 
The legislation only applies to cases involving nationally traded securities. 
State regulators retain full authority to bring enforcement actions. 
Private class actions involving nationally traded securities that are filed in State court would be moved to Federal court. 
Mr. President, I urge the Senate to expeditiously consider and pass this legislation.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference agreement on H.R. 2378, the Treasury and general Government appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. 
This bill provides new budget authority of $25.4 billion and new outlays of $22.5 billion to finance operations of the Department of the Treasury, including the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Customs Service, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and the Financial Management Service; as well as the Executive Office of the President, the Office of Personnel Management, the General Services Administration, and other agencies that perform central Government functions. 
I congratulate the chairman and ranking member for producing a bill that is within the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation and generally consistent with the bipartisan balanced budget agreement. I also commend the chairman for his strong support of law enforcement, including the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. 
When outlays from prior-year BA and other adjustments are taken into account, the bill totals $25.4 billion in BA and $25.2 billion in outlays. The total bill is $2 million below the Senate subcommittee's 302(b) nondefense discretionary allocation for budget authority and outlays. The bill is at the subcommittee's violent crime trust fund allocation for BA and under its allocation for outlays by $8 million.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on September 24 and 25, Umbria, Italy, that community, was hit by twin earthquakes. 
Extensive damage was inflicted upon the towns and villages across the region. Eleven people lost their lives and thousands of homes and buildings have been damaged. 
The Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi was one of the buildings that was severely damaged. It isn't just a church or a great center of pilgrimage, or an artistic archive and yet it is all of those things. 
It is one of those special places that you visit one day, but long to return to for a lifetime if you are fortunate enough to get to Italy and to set about to see some very, very historic buildings with culture and with religion that just wreaks from the walls. 
That is why I was profoundly saddened to learn that the basilica was severely damaged by the earthquakes of September 24 and September 25, and again last week. 
It seems so ironic that the basilica, built in honor of the patron Saint of Italy who cherished the natural world, was ravaged by an act of nature. 
The basilica is one of the finest examples of Italian Gothic architecture, a building of `unparalleled importance in the evolution of Italian art.' It has been written, by those more knowledgeable about art and architecture than I am and will ever be, that `a harmonious relationship exists between the architecture and its fresco decoration.' `The strong and simple forms are repeated throughout the building both to unify and to articulate the space with so powerful an effect that the architectural members are echoed in the painted framework to the frescos.' 
The basilica is a living museum providing a home for the art of several great masters of the 13th and 14th centuries. These art treasures depict scenes from the Old and New Testaments. 
The famous fresco artist, Cimabue, began his work in the basilica, believe it or not, in 1277. Cimabue's frescos include scenes from the life of the Virgin, popes, angels, and saints, as well as scenes of the Apocalypse and the Crucifixion. 
Cimabue's pupil, Giotto, painted 28 famous, and beautiful frescos based on St. Bonaventure's version of St. Francis' life, and major accomplishments. These famous Giotto frescos painted on the sidewalls of the basilica were cracked by the earthquake but are miraculously somewhat in tact. These frescos are world treasurers. So that my colleagues understand, let me make this comparison. Giotto was to the basilica what Brumidi was to our own beautiful Capitol. 
Mobilization of Italian artists and restorers has been swift. In addition, the National Museum in London and the Louvre have offered experts to help with the restoration. 
The sense-of-the-Senate resolution calls upon the Smithsonian, the National Gallery of Art, and any of the other premier art museums in the United States that have the pertinent expertise to provide technical assistance to aid in the restoration of the Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi and the works of art that have been damaged in the earthquake. 
I want to indicate to the Senate I will send to the desk to be considered in wrapup a resolution--just by the Senate; we are not going to try to go to the House--just a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that states the facts regarding this disaster, and merely says that the Smithsonian Institution, the National Gallery of Art and any of the other premier art museums of the United States having pertinent expertise in restoration should provide technical assistance to aid in the restoration of the Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi and the works of art that have been damaged in the earthquake. That is essentially what it is.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I apologize to the Chair that this is the last speech of the evening. If I don't speak tonight, I probably won't be heard on this issue. I have been trying this afternoon, but it has been a fair assignment of speaking rights down here and I have waited my turn. 
Mr. President, before I deliver my prepared remarks, I want to comment on a few things I heard on the floor. I tried at one point to ask a question of the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, who made a lot about lack of participation in the American democracy and especially with reference to campaign contributions. If I read him right, he said because the big money is so influential and powerful, if you will, other people don't think they ought to be giving, as if other people weren't giving. 
The truth of the matter is that in every campaign, including the last time, more individuals gave small contributions and medium-size contributions than in the history of the Republic. At the pace they are on now, it looks like they are going to do that again. Now, how much is enough? I don't know. But to say that because there are big contributions, people aren't participating, you can go over and ask the Republican Party where most of its contributions come from for the regular activities of the parties, they will tell you from small contributions, and they are there by the hundreds of thousands. 
Second, a big thing was made by Senator Bumpers to the people listening that the democracy was not participatory in America because only 50 percent of the people voted, and perhaps in the State of Colorado it was 53, or in New Mexico it was 52. You know, people are really using that fact for a lot of inferences, and I am not sure many of the inferences are right. But I surely don't believe that whatever that participatory failure is--and in a moment I will say 50 percent isn't a failure--it is surely not because of contributions that we are trying to control here on the floor. There are so many reasons that Americans don't participate in politics, not the least of which is that Americans are just darn independent. They sometimes don't want to be bothered about anything. As a matter of fact, they are very busy. As a consequence, many of them just don't take time out. But I submit that for a democracy as vintage as ours to have 50 percent of the voters participating heavily and 50 percent or more, even though slightly voting, that is a pretty good track record. I submit that if the 50 percent turned into 75, we would probably get the same results. I don't want to cast any aspersions on the validity of individual votes, but our participation is sufficient to deliver the will of the people. I believe that is what we are all looking for--that the people's will would be exercised at the ballot box and get the kind of Government they want. 
I rise today to offer to those colleagues who want to listen, and a few of the American people who might be listening, some thoughts that I have on this issue before the Senate now. Should Congress alter the laws governing the way we conduct political campaigns in this country in the manner recommended in the legislation before us, the so-called McCain-Feingold reform? It seems to me that we ought to have a sense of perspective about this. 
I want to make one general statement before I talk a little bit about history. 
The risk and danger of changing the laws right now in the manner recommended in this bill is that if that change causes one major group of Americans to lose their freedom of speech because they cannot use their money and causes another group of Americans to have an increased influence on campaigns because they can use their money, then I believe we ought to be very careful about that imbalance. 
What I think might happen if these amendments are adopted to the code that we now have is that there will be a lot more opportunity for the labor unions in America, who might have nothing against it but are protected under the Constitution for their rights and freedoms of speech, but I am fearful that the balance which is there, since the unions are almost a Democratic arm today, and I don't see any reason why they will change for a while, it would seem to me we don't want to get things out of balance and then look back and say, `Oh. We also let the electorate get influenced in an unbalanced way.' 
So when I look at this democracy of ourselves, I see a very stable democracy. I see something very, very special. In other parts of the world when countries change their leaders, they often change the entire nature of their government. In the last several years governments have changed in Burma, Rwanda, Somalia and too many countries to mention. Many of these changes involved bloodshed and all kinds of revolution and riot. Obviously, for those who happen to be on the losing side, when some governments changed hands, that meant torture, imprisonment and all kinds of violations of civility and civil rights. 
In the United States we ought to be very thankful that we have the first amendment to the Constitution. It is the bedrock of this democracy. To me the Constitution and the first amendment are what set the United States apart as a mature democracy from the rest of the world. The first amendment allows us to have free and open political campaigns, and the Constitution provides for a smooth transition of that power between the competing political parties once the election has been completed. 
In the name of reform, the bill before us fundamentally alters our unique democratic electoral process just because many are dissatisfied with the way our campaigns are financed and operated. Some are disgusted by the ads. Others lament the fact that candidates no longer control their campaigns. Many believe we need to abolish soft money. Others contend if we pass this bill the public cynicism of elected leaders will somehow evaporate. 
The fact is, fellow Senators, that the debate over campaign spending is as old as this democracy itself. George Washington was roundly criticized in the early days of our country for spending three or four times the cost of a house on his first election to the House of Burgesses. Abraham Lincoln's supporters accused the Democratic opponent of bowing to `plantation and bank paper aristocracy' which could raise five times what Lincoln raised for his campaign. That is kind of reminiscent of the discussions of today. 
Let there be no doubt, the constitutionality of this legislation is dubious. I heard some of the arguments today. I just do not believe they are right. 
In my mind, you can be for McCain-Feingold, or you can be for the first amendment. I choose the first amendment. 
The modified McCain-Feingold bill creates a so-called `bright line.' That is a test 60 days out from election. 
Mr. President, am I operating under a time restraint?

Mr. DOMENICI. Let me go back. 
This bill before us, McCain-Feingold--and I notice Senator Feingold's presence here, and I commend him for the way he has conducted himself. He feels as strongly about this as I do about my views. 
But this bill creates a so-called bright-line test 60 days out from election. In effect, the bright line attempts to get through the back door what the Supreme Court in Buckley versus Valeo said you couldn't get through in the front door. In Buckley, the Supreme Court said, `The concept that government may restrict speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voices of others is wholly foreign to the first amendment.' 
With respect to independent expenditures, the Buckley decision means that individuals and groups may spend unlimited amounts on direct communication with voters to support or oppose Federal candidates as long as there is no coordination or consultation with any candidate. 
At its heart the McCain-Feingold bill does two things: 
First, it eliminates soft money. 
Second, it reduces independent expenditures, express 
advocacy, and creates the 60-day bright-line rule. Under the bright-line rule, any independent expenditure that falls within 60 days of an election could not use a candidate's name or likeness. 
Mr. President, this is where the authors of the reform bill seek to get through the back door what the Supreme Court has already ruled we may not get through the front door. 
By redefining independent expenditures and express advocacy, the McCain-Feingold bill limits political speech which the Supreme Court in Buckley said was unconstitutional. I believe they will do that again when you try to tell those protected organizations already indicated as being protected that you are protected, but for the last 60 days you are not. If they are protected by free speech to involve themselves in politics, is it more important to our constitutional democracy that they be permitted to do that 2 years before an election or 58 days before an election? I would assume they would all opt who want to use their constitutional rights to say, `I don't care about doing it 2 years before; what I care about is doing it when the people are paying attention.' I don't believe sitting members of this Supreme Court are going to find that you can do that unless they decide to throw out Buckley versus Valeo in its basic concept and principal thrust. 
So I want to move on to one other subject. Currently groups like the AFL-CIO, the Christian Coalition, the Sierra Club, the National Rifle Association may run unlimited political advertisements using soft money, in some cases in support of the opposition to a particular issue. We have all heard on the floor how many of these ads contain the likeness of a candidate. The Supreme Court in Buckley said that any attempt to limit the expenditures of these groups for these purposes was unconstitutional. McCain-Feingold would attempt to do precisely what the Supreme Court has said is unconstitutional. 
I ask fellow Senators, isn't it interesting? In this bill there is also a provision that says, even if the Court strikes down one part, the rest may be valid. I ask you, what will you have in America if they strike down the 60-day prohibition and leave the soft money and the soft money prohibition is constitutional? You will essentially have decided to turn the campaign over to issue-oriented advertising with no soft money available for party building for those who would seek to refute it. I believe it is an untenable provision. 
I have examined these provisions very carefully, and, even on the slightest chance that the Supreme Court would find these provisions constitutional, I ask my fellow Senators if this is good policy. The reason I ask this question is that in my view when you muzzle political speech of individual groups whose voices will carry the day--and I ask that question in our zeal on both sides of the aisle to address the role of certain entities in our election--you need to ask yourself what the consequence will be of restricting the free speech of unions, groups, corporations, and wealthy individuals to engage in campaigns, related speech, and activities. 
In my mind, by restricting freedom of speech for these groups, we will make the media an even more powerful player in the political process. 
During the 60 days prior to the election, when the so-called bright-line rule is in effect, the only one who will be able to speak directly about candidates will be through the news media. We all know around Washington that you should not pick a fight with someone who buys paper by the ton and ink by the barrel, because it enjoys the full protection of the first amendment and it enjoys the total discretion of those who write the news and edit the news. We call the media the fourth estate, or the unofficial fourth branch of government. The media are the big opinion makers. They write the editorials, they present the news, and they decide which issues deserve the attention of the American people on a daily basis. 
We also know that members of the media are only human, and by that I mean they are not always factual and they even pride themselves as being opinionated. Their opinion tends to lean in favor of Democrats and in particular of the liberal agenda in America. That is their privilege. That is their right. Recent surveys have shown that close to 90 percent of the media votes for liberal Democratic candidates, and to me it is clear that the media coverage of politics mimics the voting record of the media, at least in many areas. What of their independence? What about their role in the election of public officials? 
Thomas Jefferson once wrote:  
There are rights which it is useless to surrender to the Government, but which rights governments always have sought to invade. Among those are the rights of speaking and publishing our thoughts. 
This bill is a giant step toward Congress invading the rights of many to engage in political discourse. 
In a recent column, George Will noted that this debate is one of the most important in American history. He also noted that the media have failed to address the first amendment problems created by McCain-Feingold. In Will's words: 
One reason the media are complacent about such restrictions on others' political speech is that these restrictions enhance the power of the media as the filters of political speech and unregulated participants in a shrunken national debate. 
I submit to the Senate that this is precisely the result we need to avoid. When in doubt, I believe we should err on the side of more, not less, political speech. That is the essence of democracy. 
In my mind, there is at least one other issue which needs to be addressed before we decide whether to adopt the so-called reforms. We need to get to the bottom of the scandals and violations of the law which occurred in the 1996 election. How can we talk about reform when during the 1996 election individuals and party committees blatantly and repeatedly violated the letter and the spirit of clear laws we currently have on the books? How will so-called reform prevent this from happening again in the future? We should not allow the call for reform to shield those who have violated the law from being held responsible for their acts. To do that makes a mockery of the Senate and of our laws. 
I participated in the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearings the past several months. When the hearings began, I spoke of three statutes that I believed were pretty clear. Section 441 of the Federal Election Campaign Act makes it unlawful for foreign nationals to make contributions to elections. After 2 months of the hearings, I heard evidence of multiple violations of statutes by the Democratic National Committee and its agents. I do not think I need to recite for the American people all the examples of foreign money solicited by John Huang, Pauline Kanchanalak, and Maria Hsia and others associated with the DNC and the White House. The point is clear: The law prohibits foreign money. But there is a clear pattern of ignoring the laws during the last election. 
Section 441(f) of the Federal Election Campaign Act prohibits making a contribution to a Federal election in the name of another person. Plain and simple, this law prohibits money laundering. We have seen the past election replete with those, and yet we have seen nobody punished, nobody penalized. 
The final area of law implicated by the committee's investigation is section 607 of the Federal Criminal Code. It makes it a crime to solicit or receive campaign contributions on Government property. There has been much debate in the media and among members of the committee about whether the law covers the President and Vice President, whether it extends to soft money, and what Congress' original intent was when we passed this law more than a century ago. 
To me, the law means what it says. Politicians, including those in the White House, cannot use Federal facilities paid for by the taxpayer to raise money for their campaigns for national political office. That is how I always understood the law. That is the way I have conducted fundraising activities, in strict accordance with that interpretation, yet the committee's record is full of evidence that fundraising calls were made from 
the White House. 
There are other issues of illegal activity which the committee has yet to fully explore. Recently, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York obtained guilty pleas from three individuals involved in the last Teamsters election. These individuals apparently will testify that the Democratic National Committee and the AFL-CIO were used in efforts to launder money from the union's treasury into the reelection of Ron Carey, the Teamsters' president. I am not here alleging that he knew of it or that he was a party to it. I am merely reciting what I know from the reports from the guilty pleas and other things occurring in that court. 
The Democratic National Committee apparently entered into an agreement with the Teamsters to launder money in exchange for contributions to the party from members of the union. 
We have heard a lot about the union's role in the last election, and I share the concern expressed by my colleagues. But it seems to me that we need to get to the bottom of the criminal allegations, not just change the law to deal with their political activity. 
I would like to make one point about unions and their activities in the last election. We all know that unions spent at least $35 million on issue adds in 44 congressional districts during the 1996 campaign. Compared to the unions, Republican groups spent a pittance. Citizens for Reform, a group which was created to counter the unions, spent $2 million in 15 districts. The coalition, Americans Working for Real Change, spent $5 million. The unions spent $700,000 in 1 week for advertisements. This is their privilege. This is their right. I do not seek to limit them. I only seek to make sure that a balance is maintained between the exercise of that right and the exercise of rights by others. So the unions have decided, because the current law gives them an advantage, that they are able to take a portion of their money dues without consent and use these dues for political activities. 
Some want to call the Lott amendment a poison pill. I believe the vote, if we do have one on that issue, is a vote for fairness and balance. I believe that all contributions and paid political speech ought to be voluntary. 
According to some, the law related to fundraising on Federal property was designed to prevent Government officials from coercing political contributions from Federal employees. Should the same rule against political contributions being done without consent apply to everyone, businesses, unions, PAC's and all? 
On both sides of this issue I have listened as attentively as I can. I think this has been a very civilized debate, worthy of the institution of the Senate. But I have yet to hear anything that convinces me that passing this bill, which will erode free speech rights of candidates, parties and groups, is necessary to enhance our electoral process. 
Clearly, the bill takes us in the wrong direction, away from the first amendment and from our free, fair and open electoral system that is the envy of the world. 
I would like to make one last point. Everyone here recognizes the many problems we are addressing today stem from the fact that the Supreme Court struck down various provisions in the post-Watergate reforms that were passed in 1974 and upheld others. I wish to caution Senators that the McCain-Feingold bill, although earnest in its attempt to correct the errors of the past, fails to take heed of the history of reforms of the past and is destined to lead us in the wrong direction and on a course to make many of the same mistakes. 
This bill contains a severability clause that essentially means if certain provisions of this bill are held unconstitutional, the remainder of the act shall not be affected by the rest of the holding. Although I do not agree with the approach in this bill, I do believe that those who will vote for this bill believe that it will somehow level the playing field. If that is their interest, I ask them to very carefully examine the consequences of the title VI severability clause. If the Supreme Court holds that the bright-line rule created by this bill is unconstitutional, which I believe they will, we will not only have succeeded in increasing the inequities between the haves and the have-nots, but we will have also created a Pandora's box, full of new problems. 
I thank the Senate for its attention.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, the First Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for 1986. 
This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget through September 26, 1997. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of the 1997 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget, House Concurrent Resolution 178, show that current level spending is above the budget resolution by $9.5 billion in budget authority and by $12.9 billion in outlays. Current level is $20.6 billion above the revenue floor in 1997 and $36.3 billion above the revenue floor over the 5 years 1997-2001. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $219.9 billion, $7.4 billion below the maximum deficit amount for 1997 of $227.3 billion. 
Since my last report, dated September 17, 1997, there has been no action to change the current level of budget authority, outlays, or revenues. U.S. CONGRESS, 
Congressional Budget Office, Washington, DC, September 29, 1997. 
Hon. Pete V. Domenici, Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, on July 16, the Senate passed its version of the Energy and Water Development Act for fiscal year 1998 by a vote of 99 to 0. Since that time, the House has passed its version, which in some cases was quite different than the Senate version, and conferees have resolved the differences between the two bills. 
At times, those negotiations were difficult. However, the final result is a well balanced bill I believe should be supported by all my colleagues--it certainly was well received by the House which passed it a few hours ago by a vote of 404 to 17.

Mr. DOMENICI. It is the understanding and intent of the committee that the cleanup and restoration of contaminated sites falling within the purview of FUSRAP shall be managed and executed by the nearest Civil Works District of the Corps of Engineers with appropriate assistance from an approved design center for hazardous, toxic, and radioactive waste. Local communities throughout the country have been very involved in designing cleanup plans at FUSRAP sites and this strategy effectively maintains community input on the process.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending conference report accompanying H.R. 2266, the Department of Defense appropriations bill, provides $247.7 billion in new budget authority and $164.7 billion in new outlays for Department of Defense programs for fiscal year 1998. 
When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the final bill totals $247.7 billion in budget authority and $244.4 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998 
This legislation provides for military pay, procurement, research and development, operations and maintenance, and various other important activities of the Department of Defense and the U.S. military services throughout the world. This bill provides for the readiness, current, and future weapons systems, and all the other necessities of our national defenses--except for military construction and Department of Energy atomic energy defense activities--that enable our Armed Forces to protect U.S. national interests at home and abroad. It is certainly one of the most important pieces of legislation that Congress passes each year. 
The spending in this conference report falls within the revised section 302(b) allocation for the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. I commend the distinguished chairman, the Senator from Alaska, for bringing this bill to the floor within the subcommittee's revised allocation. 
The bill provides important increases over the President's request for 1998. It is fully consistent with the bipartisan budget agreement that the President and Congress concluded earlier this year. I urge the adoption of the conference report. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the conference report be placed in the Record.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise in support of S. 830, the FDA Modernization Act. This bill provides comprehensive--and long overdue reform to the FDA. 
The primary focus of S. 830 is to streamline and strengthen the FDA's review and approval of lifesaving drugs and medical devices. One important mechanism for doing this is the Prescription Drug User Fee Act [PDUFA]. PDUFA authorizes the FDA to use fees collected from prescription drug manufacturers to expedite the FDA's review of drugs. The fees collected go to hiring new employees to increase the FDA's resources for reviewing new drugs. 
With all of the advances in science and medicine, we must ensure the swift review of new drugs for life-threatening diseases. When there are backlogs and delays in drug approval, American lives can be lost. For example: 
The 7-year delay in the FDA's eventual approval of beta blocker heart medicines cost the lives of 119,000 Americans; and 
The FDA's 3 1/2 -year delay in approving the new drug Interleukin-2 (IL-2) cost 25,000 Americans to die of kidney cancer, even though the drug already had been approved for use in nine other countries. 
This bill is good because it will give Americans access to lifesaving medication, without needless delay. 
I would like to share with you the story of one man from my home State of New Mexico who would benefit from this bill. 
Leonard Alderete is 39 years old and has lived in Albuquerque, NM all of his life. In 1987, Leonard was diagnosed HIV positive. Five years later, Leonard sought medical intervention because his condition worsened and he feared his life would end. Leonard began taking the standard AZT. In 1996, Leonard's health again took a downturn. Blood tests revealed that the virus had spread at an alarming rate through his system. In order to slow the spread of the virus, Leonard needed an aggressive treatment. 
Leonard's doctor prescribed the drug regiment of 3TC, AZT, and Crixivan, which is also known as a triple cocktail. A key drug in this mixture is the protease inhibitor, Crixivan. Through PDUFA, Crixivan was made available to consumers within 3 months of its submission to the FDA. Shortly thereafter, Leonard began taking Crixivan. 
Thanks to the `triple cocktail,' the virus is now below detectable levels. Although this is not a cure, it does provide Leonard hope--a more long-term hope for the future. 
Leonard is a member of the Governor's task force on HIV/AIDS. He is the only member who has HIV. As a member of the Task Force, he advocates for the rights of those who are HIV infected--as well as those in the community who are affected. 
Leonard has written, called, and even traveled to my office in Washington, DC two times this year to urge my support for this bill. Leonard provides testimonial for the importance of FDA reform, and especially PDUFA. 
Fortunately, patients afflicted with AIDS as well as other life threatening diseases have a `Leonard' advocating for them. There are many other Leonards both silent and vocal all across the country who will benefit from this bill. It is on their behalf that I urge my colleagues to support S. 830.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending measure is S. 1156, the fiscal year 1998 District of Columbia appropriations bill. 
This appropriations bill provides Federal payments to the District of Columbia totaling $820.0 million. The bill provides $190 million for the Federal contribution to the District of Columbia, $169 million to operate the District's correctional facilities for felons, $302 million to build new correctional facilities to replace the Lorton facility, $146 million to operate the District Court System, $8 million to implement management reform initiatives, and $5 million to the National Park Service to support U.S. Park Police operations in the District. 
This appropriation is in addition to the resources allocated to the District by the Balanced Budget Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Combined, the two laws provide tax breaks and mandatory spending worth $4.5 billion over 10 years. Because the cost of taking over the District's $5.8-billion pension liability is largely delayed until after this period, the total bailout is worth substantially more to the District. 
This appropriation bill is at the subcommittee's revised 302(b) allocation for both budget authority and outlays.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise in support of the conference report on H.R. 2209, the legislative branch appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. 
The bill, as reported, provides $2.25 billion in new budget authority and $2 billion in outlays for the Congress and other legislative branch agencies, including the Library of Congress, the General Accounting Office, and the Government Printing Office, among others. 
When outlays from prior year appropriations and other adjustments are taken into account, the bill totals $2.3 billion in budget authority and outlays. The bill is under the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation by $36 million in budget authority and $86 million in outlays. 
I want to commend the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee for producing a bill that is substantially within their 302(b) allocation. I am pleased that this bill continues to hold the line on congressional spending.

</TEXT>

<DOCNO>105-domenici-nm-1-19970923</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, in 1990 Senator Nunn and I cochaired the Strengthening of America Commission which among its recommendations, called for abolishing the current income tax code, and replacing it with a progressive consumption-based income tax code that would encouraged savings and investment. 
The National Federation of Independent Business is in Independence, MO, today starting a nationwide petition drive that encourages all small business owners to sign a petition calling upon the President and Congress to abolish the IRS Code as of December 31, 2000 and to replace it with a simpler, fairer tax code which will reward work and savings. 
I intend to sign this petition and encourage all of my colleagues to do likewise. 
NFIB is launching the petition drive in Independence MO, home of President Harry Truman, who said, `The Buck stops here.' NFIB is telling the American public that `the code stops here.' 
NFIB could have started their campaign in the town of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. When dealing with the IRS, `tell the truth or pay the consequences' could be their motto. 
But things have gone wrong. Compliance has become lax or nasty. 
Despite a $7 billion in annual budget and 106,000 employees the IRS failed to collect an estimated $200 billion of taxes a year. 
Tax collection is as nasty as it is lax. 
In New Mexico, there is a sense of frustration among people trying to comply. Taxpayers receive computer generated letters. The letter is either a short, brutish demand for more money or an incomplete and unclear request for more documentation The letters usually include no phone number, and no contact person. Now, that is actually from my staff working with constituents. The letters usually include no phone numbers and no contact person. 
The letter strikes fear. The message is clear--TRUTH or PAY the consequences. But the letter usually fails to explain what truth, in the form of additional documentation, is needed to avoid the consequences. 
In New Mexico, my home State, the IRS letter could originate in Phoenix, AZ, Ogden, UT, Albuquerque, NM, or Dallas, TX. When constituents fail to figure out the point-of-origin themselves they come to my office. It takes a professional case worker at least 2 days just to track down the IRS office handling the case of a New Mexico resident. 
I know that the National Commission on Restructuring the IRS has issued its report and that Senators Grassley and Kerry have turned the recommendations into legislation that takes a top-down approach giving the IRS commissioner a longer term and more flexibility. 
But knowing what I know, I believe the legislation also needs to take a bottom-up, common sense approach. Simple things will make big differences. 
For example, letters from the IRS should have a contact person and phone number that will be answered by that one-and-the-same person. I don't mean a 1-800 number that is totally automated. You have heard about it. It is the number that is always busy, but if you persist for about an hour you can get through. Then it puts you on hold for another hour, and finally provides the following helpful choices: 
Press one for more instructions that you can't understand; 
Press 2 for more information that will frighten you; 
Press 3 for information that will confuse you further ; 
Press 4 for information that contradicts what we told you when you pressed one, two or three; 
Press 5 for information that contradicts what we told your accountant yesterday. 
I wish I were kidding. 
Part of the problem is the IRS. But part of the problem is the Congress, because we passed the tax laws that made the code too complicated. And for that we should all stand up, if we voted for those tax measures, and take our share of the blame. 
The IRS simplest return, the EZ form 1040 has 33 pages of instructions. That is the easy form. The Form 1040 has 76 pages. The Earned Income Tax credit instructions are 23 pages and the worksheet is as ambiguous as it is long. 
The National Federation of Independent Businesses estimates that America's businesses will spend 3.4 billion hours, and individuals will spend 1.7 billion hours, simply trying to comply with the tax code. That's equivalent to 3 million people working full time, year around, just on taxes. 
Another problem with IRS compliance is that there are too many steps. I was recently contacted by constituents trying to get their Earned Income check. The IRS is 6 months behind in New Mexico in reviewing the tax forms filed for Earned Income credits. The IRS is looking into about 1,600 claims and requesting additional information from the taxpayers. I don't fault the IRS for making sure that the claims are legitimate, but I do find fault with their process. 
The first letter from the IRS merely informs you that you are not going to get your EIC check until you contact IRS. 
The next step is to contact them and wait. In 6 weeks they will get back to you with information on what information they want from you to verify your claim. 
In northern New Mexico, many people speak Spanish. It is difficult for them to understand English and certainly difficult for them to understand the complexities that I have just described. It would be helpful if instructions were in Spanish as well as English. The Grassley-Kerry bill calls for the creation of taxpayer assistance centers where people can go for face-to-face assistance. I would suggest that some of these places these people be bilingual for those who have difficulty speaking English and filling out complicated forms. 
The current code is so complicated that unintended consequences are unavoidable. 
We recently passed a middle class tax cut--but what the Congress intended, the alternative minimum tax takes away. New information from the Joint Committee on Taxation estimate that individuals paying the alternative minimum tax will increase from 605,000 in 1997 to 8.4 million families by 2007 unless something is changed. Part of this increase is caused by the new $500 child credit and college tuition credits. The perversity of the alternative minimum tax is that the more credits a family is entitled to, the more likely it is that the family will have to pay the alternative minimum tax. But we just built these new credits into the code, taking much credit with middle-income Americans. Yet, the alternative minimum tax on individuals remains in effect. Put another way, the alternative minimum tax is hostile to families claiming the $500 child credit and the college tuition tax credit. Middle class families will find that their middle class tax cut is partially taken away because of the alternative minimum tax. 
The alternative minimum tax is complicated but it is also punitive. Families who thought they were in the 15 percent tax bracket find themselves in a 26 percent alternative minimum tax bracket. An 11 percent jump sounds bad but it is even worse when you remember that the alternative minimum tax base is broader than the regular income tax base. In other words, you apply the new rate, the higher rate, against a broader income than what you would have applied under the ordinary return. 
As I wrote Secretary Rubin last Friday: `The alternative minimum tax is a trap for a growing number of American families. Most people don't know that it exists and those who do, view it as a tax on the rich, and not something to bother with. But that is not the case.' 
`The passage of the Taxpayer Relief Act is going to turn more and more middle class taxpayers into alternative minimum tax payers, and at the same time deny them a signficant portion of the middle class tax cut[s we have given them].' 
We have to fix this unintended consequence, and do it quickly. 
Restructuring the IRS to be kinder and gentler will make taxpayers less frustrated, but an equally serious problem is the destructive impact that the current code has on the economy. 
The current code adds about one-third to the cost of capital, makes us less competitive because it is not border adjustable, and it penalizes savings and investment--two activities that are of tremendous value to our economy. 
I have given dozens of speeches on the Senate floor about why this is so. I am not going to do that today. 
My message today is first, to encourage every member of the Congress to sign the NFIB petition calling for a sunset to the IRS code, second, for Congress to work quickly to solve the alternative minimum tax problem which threatens to undermine the middle class tax cut that everyone worked so hard for, and, third, to move toward a new Tax Code that will foster economic growth. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as we approach National Character Counts Week, October 19-25, I want to relate another example of how character education programs are expanding across the State of New Mexico. 
In New Mexico, over 30 communities and cities have adopted partnerships with their school systems to promote the Six Pillars of Character: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. There are literally thousands of young people involved in character-related programs in their youth organizations and public or private schools. Some communities have expanded their local efforts to include Character in the Workplace programs. 
Character Counts is not just a slogan. It represents, instead, exciting and well-developed programs by citizens who believe there are important and positive benefits to be derived from good character. Because families, churches, community groups, civic leaders, and school administrators and teachers want to place more emphasis on the value of ethical behavior, Character Counts has become one of the fastest growing and localized movements in the State's history. 
As an example, in Farmington, NM, the Navajo Preparatory School is initiating an all-encompassing character education program for its students. The Navajo Preparatory School is chartered by the Navajo Nation to operate as a college preparatory school program for Navajo and other native American youth. Its mission is to educate highly motivated and talented students who have the potential and desire to achieve a college education and become leaders of their respective communities. It has 195 boarding and day students from the Navajo Nation, Jicarilla Apache, and various Pueblo Tribes. It has an excellent academic record, with 85 percent of its graduating students enrolled in college. 
Some weeks ago I was invited to visit the school to hear about its Character Counts Program. Attending were teachers, students, school administration officials, and members of the board of trustees. The briefing included an innovative audio-visual program designed to transfer the concepts of the Six Pillars of Character into traditional Navajo teachings, as well as a review of the schools's translation of the Six Pillars into the Navajo language. In addition to its Character Counts curriculum, Navajo Prep also supports the development of student activities that will maximize the messages of the Six Pillars. It wants to ensure that its students have a comprehensive and cohesive program that surrounds both their academic and social conduct. 
The board of trustees presented their resolution for `Endorsing and Implementing the Character Counts Program at the Navajo Preparatory School.' I would like to quote from this resolution so Members of Congress will know how thoroughly the school's officials have developed this character education program. 
The Navajo Preparatory School Board supports and endorses Character Counts which are based on six core ethical values: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. 
The Navajo Preparatory School Board requests its staff to examine the curriculum and integrate Navajo-specific character development teachings, strategies, methods and partnership initiatives into the overall school program as an ongoing part of school instruction. 
The Navajo Preparatory School Board empowers the school staff to join forces with the State of New Mexico Navajo Nation and other local organizations and become a leader for community action through teaching, enforcing, advocating and modeling the six pillars of character. 
The Navajo Preparatory School staff shall pursue available funding to develop Navajo curriculum materials which promote the development of good character. 
As evidenced by Navajo Prep's creative character education program and as explained well in its resolution, `* * * no single entity can instill ethical behavior in youth and adults if it is acting without the support of the other institutions and groups.' Character-building activities are for all. They can be embraced by the young and old and the public and private sectors in a way the transcends political, cultural, religious, and socioeconomic differences. 
In New Mexico, Character Counts is a statewide and communitywide effort. It is a program with unbelievable energy because everyone who hears about it believes in it and wants it to work. It works because people, like those associated with the Navajo Preparatory School, are wholeheartedly committed to making it a reality. 
I applaud the fine work of the Navajo Preparatory School, and welcome it as a new member of the ever-growing family of Character Counts enthusiasts.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, for many rural communities in my home State of New Mexico, the wonders and advantages of the telecommunications explosion--Internet, telecommuting, wireless communications--remain an unfulfilled promise. Yet, my recent 2-week trip throughout rural New Mexico showed me signs that the telecommunications revolution has begun to take hold in our State. As I continue to make rural economic development in New Mexico my top economic priority, through an innovative program that we call rural payday, full use of telecommunications will play a key role. 
Highlighting the relationship between the telecommunications revolution and rural economic development was a full-day Telecommunications Summit we organized in Albuquerque last month. Organized under the auspices of the Small Business Advocacy Council of New Mexico, which I established 3 years ago, this summit brought together more than 200 telecommunications professionals, businessmen, and scientists from throughout our State. Key to this summit was the help provided by personnel from Sandia National Laboratory, who generously gave of their time, immense talent, and expertise throughout the planning period of the summit and during the daylong event. 
What all of us learned from this summit can be summarized easily: 
First, for rural small business owners, intelligent and creative use of telecommunications can mean the difference between survival and failure; 
Second, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 will continue to play an unpredictable and major role as rural communities try to use telecommunications to solidify their economic futures; 
Third, the large telecommunications, Internet and wireless providers must do more to help rural communities try to use telecommunications to solidify their economic futures; 
Fourth, basic telecommunications infrastructure remains a serious obstacle to rural economic development in many areas; 
Fifth, potential for economic development using telecommunications is limited only by the users' imaginations; 
Sixth, the unique expertise of the national laboratories in New Mexico hold the potential to help spread economic development throughout our State and, by example, beyond the borders of our State. 
During my trip in August, I saw many examples of how telecommunications helps small businesses thrive. Let me give you two examples. 
In Socorro, NM, Don Tripp of Tripp's Incorporated has expanded his operations by establishing a virtual call center for his sales associates. By capitalizing on advances in telecommunications, Tripp was able to provide many of his employees with the option of telecommuting. This approach has worked well and Tripp's Inc. has moved forward with a happier, more productive and flexible work force. 
An example of using the talents of the national laboratories to help foster rural economic development is the recently-developed New Mexico Arts Database in Santa Fe, NM. With the aid of Los Alamos National Laboratory, many New Mexico artists and artisans will soon be able to sell their art over the Internet. No longer will these artists be limited to traditional, and very expensive, outlets or by location. Their art will become accessible via the Internet to potential customers throughout the world. 
We hope to coordinate these and other innovative approaches to rural economic development through the Rural Payday, Inc., organization I mentioned earlier. This initiative will focus on attracting and encouraging telecommunications-related businesses, and businesses that can use telecommunications tools more innovatively, to New Mexico. Such businesses as 1-800 call centers, automatic data processing satellite offices, more traditional businesses that can expand into rural New Mexico using new communications tools, and telemedicine firms, to name a few, can become realities for small and rural New Mexico. If we get the cooperation of the major telecommunications firm in infrastructure and basic communications services, a serious problem that rural America must face, we can revive smalltown America. I was glad to see that the major telecommunications providers in our State were at least willing to meet with potential customers from rural areas and try to work out new approaches. More on this front needs to be done, and I pledge that I will push these major firms at every opportunity. 
The New Mexico Telecommunications Summit, the first of its kind in our State, opened a little window on the future. With more cooperation between users and providers of telecommunications services, and with the continued good work of our small business community and our national laboratories, New Mexico has the chance to create a thriving rural economy that will expand in the 21st century. 
I would like to recognize the many companies and individuals who made this event such a tremendous success. I would like to also thank every Small Business Advocacy Council member who took the time to attend and organize this conference. In addition, I thank especially Angela Atterbury and Paul Silverman for their tireless efforts in coordinating this event on behalf of the SBAC. And, Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories deserve credit for all their work at the Summit and the accompanying Business Applications Fair. Finally, thanks to the Internet, wireless and telecommunications providers who participated in this event. We need their help greatly in the future.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as a result of the Supreme Court decision in Seminole of Florida v. State of Florida, we are in a situation that could result in tribal gambling compacts being approved by the Secretary of the Interior without the benefit of State approval. I support the Senator's interest in protecting States rights to help determine the degree of gambling that could occur on Indian reservations. 
The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act [IGRA] was carefully constructed to protect both tribal and States rights in negotiating compacts that would make casino style gambling legal. When the Supreme Court decided the Seminole case, it held that the provisions in IGRA that allowed a tribe to sue a State for failure to negotiate were unconstitutional. States are protected from suit by the 11th amendment to the Constitution. 
We now have a void that some fear could be filled with a Secretarial determination to establish an alternate procedure that completely avoids State participation in the compacting process. IGRA requires a tribal-state compact before casino type gambling is allowed to operate on Indian reservations. This compact is intended to reflect State gambling law and hence varies from State to State. 
Under IGRA, a refusal by the State to negotiate with a tribe triggers a mediation process. If the mediation process does not result in an agreement, the Secretary is given authority to issue a compact based on the mediators recommendation. 
Senator Enzi is proposing language that would prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from approving compacts that do not have State approval. His amendment does not affect existing casinos that might be negotiating with States for renewal of their compacts, but it does prohibit the Secretary from issuing compacts to legalize gambling if those compacts are without State concurrence. 
Mr. President, the first version I saw of Senator Enzi's amendment raised a strong concern in New Mexico that the Senator from Wyoming was attempting to cancel the compacts in New Mexico that were recently approved because the Secretary of the Interior chose not to approve or disapprove. According to the provisions of IGRA, the Secretary is allowed 45 days to act. If he does not act, the compacts are deemed valid. 
New Mexico is the only State affected by the original language of the Enzi amendment. New Mexico was the only State to get compact approval of its compacts in 1997 because the Secretary did not approve or disapprove the compacts. I immediately discussed this situation with Senator Enzi and he assured me that he did not intend to target the New Mexico compacts because they are the product of years of tribal and State negotiations, law suits, court decisions, and legislative action. 
Senator Enzi has changed his amendment to protect States like New Mexico that have State concurrence in the gambling compacting process. With this change, I am able to support his amendment to prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from unilaterally creating compacts for Indian gambling without State concurrence in the process. I believe his amendment is important to protect the spirit of IGRA that recognizes the competing interests of tribal and State sovereignty in determining precise Indian gambling agreements. 
I recognize the new difficulty faced by tribes that do not yet have tribal-State compacts in light of the Seminole decision. I believe a 1-year moratorium on Secretarial authority is appropriate as insurance against new compacts that avoid State participation. I am also supportive of legislative action that would clarify the process for tribes in States that refuse to negotiate, but I want to avoid a restructuring of the tribal-State balances we have struck in IGRA. 
There remain questions about the conditions and extent to which the Secretary and the tribe could initiate mediation and Secretarial compacts. We need to address these questions, but I do not believe we should leave the solution solely to the Secretary of the Interior. I am pleased that Senator Enzi has changed his amendment to recognize the New Mexico compacts and other compacts with State concurrence. They are clearly valid compacts under IGRA and we should not tamper with them in an appropriations bill. 
I am now in agreement with Senator Enzi's effort to prohibit new compacts from becoming legally binding if those compacts do not have State approval. New Mexico tribes and State government have gone through a long and hard process to reach agreement under IGRA. New Mexico voters have been well represented and tribal rights have been recognized. I believe each State should be allowed to participate as fully as New Mexico has in determining the extent of legal gambling on Indian reservations within its borders.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like my colleagues and my constituents to understand why I support the amendment of Mr. Reid regarding the classification of gambling devices by the National Indian Gaming Commission. As we have experienced in New Mexico, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act [IGRA] was difficult to apply in our state, but it does draw some important lines and legal distinctions that are now understood by New Mexico tribes and the state government. IGRA now serves as the basis for the compacts that allow Indian gambling casinos to be legal in New Mexico and in our nation. 
If we do not adopt the Reid amendment, I believe we will be implicitly supporting an effort that has the clear potential of unraveling IGRA as we now understand it, without the benefit of congressional oversight. The National Indian Gaming Commission has issued new regulations and started a public comment process that could result in the removal of slot machines from the strict regulation we envisioned for them under the system of tribal-state compacts we designed in IGRA. 
Removing slot machines from this process and placing them under the control of the National Indian Gaming Commission could ignite a renewed debate about IGRA and result in undermining the delicate balance we have struck between tribal and states' rights in regulating gambling casinos on Indian reservations. We need to avoid even the perception that the National Indian Gaming Commission proposed regulations and changes in critical definitions could create this scenario. Hence, we must take action to ensure continuation of the current distinctions between those gambling activities that are now regulated by tribal-state compacts and those that can be regulated by the National Indian Gaming Commission. These distinctions are essential to maintain if we expect continuing public and Congressional support for IGRA. 
Please allow me to explain further. Perhaps the most significant definition in IGRA is the definition of `class III gaming.' Class III games are commonly understood to be casino style gaming such as poker, blackjack, roulette, and slot machines, with some variations depending on state laws. Class II games are understood to be the original bingo games and pull tabs that are allowed without the necessity of reaching a compact agreement with state governments, but they are games that are regulated by the National Indian Gaming Commission. 
The distinctions between class II and class III games are made in IGRA and are more precisely defined by regulations promulgated by the National Indian Gaming Commission and published in the Code of Federal Regulations at 502.7 and 502.8. The final rules were published on April 9, 1992 (57 FR 12392). 
The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) has the statutory authority to regulate class II games and to distinguish between class II and class III gaming under statutory guidance. The definitions it has published have served to determine which games fall into class III and hence into the realm of compacts between tribes and states. Without these compacts, casino gaming (class III) would be illegal under IGRA. 
New Mexico tribes are well aware of these distinctions as they have gone through an arduous process of negotiating with the Governor and the State legislature. They have finally resolved this issue after two New Mexico Supreme Court decisions and Federal district and circuit court decisions which eventually led to the state legislative solution. The scope of class III casino gaming that is legal in New Mexico is now defined under the compacts which relied on current definitions of class II and class III gaming. Not once during this long and difficult process did the tribes or the state question the type of gambling that would be negotiated in the compacts. They relied on the NIGC definitions when they negotiated the compacts. 
Now comes a disturbing new scenario. In the guise of up-dating the current definitions of class II and class III gaming to take into account technological changes and computer advancements of the past few years, the National Indian Gaming Commission is now reopening the question of gambling devices to be placed into these two critical categories. 
What is disturbing is the distinct and likely possibility that this reopened process could result, after tribal consultation and public comment, in the placing of slot machines into class II rather than class III gaming, thus removing slot machines from the more strict regulation and control of the tribal-state compacts. 
There is a distinct and negative outcome if the new rule-making by the National Indian Gaming Commission results in removing slot machines or any other highly profitable gambling device from the legal protections of the required compacts and places them under the control of the National Indian Gaming Commission, and hence subject only to tribal ordinances. This result would be a clear set-back for public support of the current law and could rapidly lead to the deterioration of the carefully balanced system we now have. 
I am not accusing the National Indian Gaming Commission or the tribes of intending to reach this outcome. I am alerting both to the perception by many Senators that re-opening the definition process in the latest proposed rule-making is clearly aimed at the section of national law defining gambling devices and hence invites such tampering possibilities. I believe we have enough difficulty reaching gambling agreement, as we have seen for several years in New Mexico, under current law and regulations. Adding the new possibility of removing the most profitable gambling device from close legal scrutiny in the compacting process is a dangerous move. Once this potential is understood by the public, I believe opposition to Indian gambling will justifiably multiply. The relatively stable situation we now have under current law and regulation will become volatile. 
Thus, I cannot agree with the seemingly innocent claim that the National Indian Gaming Commission is simply doing its job by up-dating these critical definitions. The technical changes we all see in computer technology are being used as an excuse to re-open the most critical line drawn by the Congress in IGRA--the line between gambling that can be simply regulated by the National Indian Gaming Commission (headed by three commissioners appointed by the President) and gambling that must come under the close scrutiny of state law and local voters. 
Mr. President, I opt for the close scrutiny and local control by the states through our current compacting process. I would also like to remind my colleagues and my Indian friends in New Mexico that slot machines were understood to be part of the compacting negotiations, and agreements have been reached which allow the legal operation of slot machines in Indian casinos in New Mexico. While I understand that there are problems with the compacts from both the State and the tribal viewpoints, at least the ground rules were understood, and agreements are now in place. 
If we now raise the specter of allowing these most profitable gambling devices being removed from the purview of these compacts by redefining them to class II gaming, I predict we will have even more turmoil in the Indian gaming debate than we have had to date. 
I sincerely hope my New Mexico Indian friends and leaders are not in support of the new rule making by the National Indian Gaming Commission because of the possibilities this rule-making process holds for removing key elements of casino gambling from the compacts. I hope they would oppose even the perception that this was their motive. I frankly doubt that New Mexico Indian leaders have even discussed this possibility, but as their Senator and friend, I want to avoid a controversy we do not need in Indian gambling law and regulation. 
I support Senator Reid's efforts to avoid this new firestorm in Indian gambling. By adopting his amendment and withholding the funds from the regulatory process changes I have just described, we can avoid the clear potential this rule-making process has for unraveling rather than stabilizing Indian gambling in America.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Forest Service can implement changes to the grazing program in the Southwest region in an orderly fashion. 
Currently the Southwest Region of the Forest Service is working to implement amendments it has made to the land use plans on all of its 11 National Forests. 
These amendments were made in response to litigation over threatened and endangered species habitat, and were adopted in June, 1996. 
Since the amendments were adopted, the Forest Service has been taken back to court, because some groups believed that the they were not acting fast enough to implement the plans. 
The Forest Service is now under a court order to maintain the status quo. 
This has allowed them to continue working toward compliance with the forest plan amendments while the Appeals Court decides the case. 
Since late July, when the injunction was issued, the Forest Service has completed a review of over 1,300 grazing allotments in the two states. 
The review indicates that more than half do not fully comply, and over 250 have been determined to be of a `high priority.' 
Under the Forest Service's stated plan of action, they will study and determine the best way to bring these allotments into compliance with the forest plans in priority order. 
Once this is determined, the Forest Service will begin implementing changes that are needed at the beginning of the next grazing season in March. 
The plaintiffs in this case, however, have long been opposed to livestock grazing on public lands. 
This amendment does not preclude the Forest Service from taking appropriate and timely action to protect the threatened and endangered species. 
It simply provides time for the agency to implement changes in a thoughtful and orderly manner, without the pressure from further litigation. 
This time will allow the Forest Service to work with those who to date have been completely left out of this process. 
These are the same people who are most likely to be adversely affected by implementation of the amendments. 
I hope the Senate will support this amendment.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2107, the fiscal year 1998 Interior and related agencies appropriations bill. 
I congratulate my good friend, the senior Senator from Washington, for his diligence in fashioning this important appropriations measure. He has done a masterful job throughout the process. 
Mr. President, the pending bill provides $13.7 billion in new budget authority and $9.1 billion in new outlays to fund the programs of the Department of Interior, the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture, the energy conservation and fossil energy research and development programs of the Department of Energy, the Indian Health Service, and arts-related agencies. 
When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the bill provides a total of $13.8 billion in budget authority and $13.7 billion in outlays for these programs for fiscal year 1998. 
I support the bill with the adoption of the manager's amendment to bring the bill within the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for budget authority. The reported bill is $38 million in outlays under the subcommittee's allocation. 
It has been my privilege to serve on the subcommittee with the distinguished chairman. I appreciate the subcommittee's support for several priority projects in my home State of New Mexico. 
I support the bill with the exception of the provisions relating to Indian tribes, which I will speak to later in the debate.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending military construction appropriations conference agreement provides $9.183 billion in new budget authority and $3.024 billion in new outlays for military construction and family housing programs for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1998. 
When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the outlays for the 1998 program total $9.862 billion. 
This legislation provides for construction by the Department of Defense for U.S. military facilities throughout the world, and it provides for family housing for the Active Forces of each of the U.S. military services. Accordingly, it provides for important readiness and quality of life programs for our service men and women. 
The conference report falls within the current section 602(b) allocation for the Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittee. I commend the distinguished subcommittee chairman, the Senator from Montana, for bringing this bill to the floor within the subcommittee's revised allocation. 
The bill provides important increases over the President's request for 1998, and I urge the adoption of the conference report. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the conference report be placed in the Record.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to share with you and my colleagues an interesting experience from the last recess. It's a great example of the power of public-private partnerships. Improved mining tools, detection of land mines, public-private partnerships, and Cooperative Threat Reduction programs may not seem to be closely related, but I visited with a small business that is demonstrating the power of integrating several different national programs into a focused approach to some of our most challenging technical problems. And the fact that this small business is located in a remote corner of New Mexico, far from major population centers, is testimony to the ability of our nation's small business to compete in the most complex business arenas by carefully utilizing the power of well crafted partnerships. 
Larry Stolarczyk of Raton Technology Research (RTR), in Raton, NM leads this unique small business. He's built a range of products through partnerships with Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories using different approaches. And he even brought in expertise from Russia through the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention Program. 
RTR tapped into different federal programs to build their products. In some cases, they contracted directly with a national laboratory when that laboratory had a unique capability that wasn't available from U.S. industry. In that case, RTR paid the full support costs for the national laboratory personnel. RTR has also used the CRADA or Cooperative Research and Development Agreement approach, enabled by my National Competitiveness and Technology Transfer Act of 1989. A CRADA enables cost-shared research involving both industry and laboratory scientists working toward common goals. 
Where a research subject is closely related to a laboratory's mission, the CRADA is a wonderfully cost-effective way for industry to tap into national laboratory resources. Usually, industry pays only for their part in the CRADA partnership, with the national laboratory costs provided through DOE funding. Furthermore, the CRADA mechanism provides good protection to industry for jointly developed intellectual property. 
Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) is a program within the Department of Energy. The program involves 10 national laboratories, over 20 institutes in the Former Soviet Union, and well over 50 U.S. corporations. The U.S. companies form the U.S. Industry Coalition or USIC and Larry Stolarczyk was a founding member of USIC. IPP traces its origins to the Cooperative Threat Reduction program established by Senators Lugar and Nunn. 
Each of RTR's products involves transmission of radio frequency waves and detection of reflected and scattered waves. Analysis of the return signals documents characteristics of materials near the sensor. 
With the IPP program, Larry Stolarczyk built a team that couples expertise from Sandia National Laboratories with his company and with the Sedakov Institute for Measuring Systems Research of Nizhny Novgorod in Russia. 
They are developing a borehole radar system for mapping fractures within tens of meters surrounding a borehole in an oil/gas reservoir. Precise understanding of these fractures outside the borehole enables optimization of the oil recovery strategy. Halliburton Logging Services is working with Raton Technology for initial field demonstrations. 
The borehole radar tool can help reach some of the 300 billion barrels of oil remaining under U.S. soil, oil that can reduce our dependence on foreign sources. Furthermore, while the Russian institute was 100 percent supported by military missions before these programs started, it now has about 70 percent non-military support. Shifting these institutes away from military support toward commercial projects is one of the strongest objectives of the IPP Program. 
In Raton, New Mexico, coal mining has been an important industry, and that's led RTR to apply its high technology capabilities to that sector. RTR has developed a Horizon Sensor to allow coal mining equipment to follow a coal seam. In coal mining, following that seam is important! Mining into the roof can cause a collapse, leaving significant coal in the seam reduces the profitability of the mine, and mining into the floor contaminates the coal. The low-tech solution is to have a miner posted near the cutting drum, not the world's safest location. The RTR approach mounts the sensor on the cutting head and allows measurements up to 20 feet ahead. 
And now let me talk about RTR's contributions to locating land mines. I don't need to remind any of my colleagues that proliferation of land mines is a critical international problem. It's estimated that more than 100 Million land mines are buried in third world countries. Daily headlines discuss the tragic consequences of civilian encounters with these mines. The innocent victims are frequently children, who may incur life-threatening injuries or as a minimum, are forced to face life without some of their limbs. Around 27 Thousand people are killed or injured annually by land mines. Finding land mines, especially non-metallic ones, is very difficult. 
The landmine project is funded through the U.S. Army Night Vision Laboratory. Los Alamos and NASA Johnson Space Flight Center are subcontractors to Raton Research. The instrument being build by Raton Technology will detect and image mines with a hand-held device. It may be the best chance we have of ridding the world of the scourge of non-metallic land mines. 
These experiences were especially interesting to me, since I have strong personal interests in each of these national programs. I've encouraged partnerships between our national laboratories and U.S. industry. These partnerships provide benefits to the taxpayer by strengthening the laboratories for their national missions and they certainly provide benefits to U.S. business by enabling new commercial applications of lab technologies. 
In addition, I've been a strong supporter of the Cooperative Threat Reduction programs designed to reduce the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. IPP encourages interactions between our national laboratories and institutes in the Former Soviet Union, and also build opportunities for U.S. industries to work with these foreign institutes. These programs are designed to ensure that the scientists working on weapons of mass destruction in these foreign institutes stay right where they are, and are not lured to rogue states to build new weapons of mass destruction. 
I'm pleased to see that these national programs are really working and providing the benefits we intended.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, the first concurrent resolution on the budget for 1986. 
This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget through September 15, 1997. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of the 1997 concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. Res. 178), show that current level spending is above the budget resolution by $9.5 billion in budget authority and by $12.9 billion in outlays. Current level is $20.6 billion above the revenue floor in 1997 and $36.3 billion above the revenue floor over the 5 years 1997-2001. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $219.9 billion, $7.4 billion below the maximum deficit amount for 1997 of $227.3 billion. 
Since my last report, dated July 30, 1997, the Congress has cleared, and the President has signed, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-34). These actions changed the current level of budget authority, outlays and revenues.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from Colorado, Senator Campbell, and the distinguished Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton, would it be appropriate for me to speak now or would they rather proceed with something else? If they have to introduce a measure and want to get it done, it will be all right with me. 
Mr. President, I say to my fellow Senators, I think the important thing for the hundreds of thousands of Indians in the United States and Indian country and the 10 percent of the population of the State of New Mexico who are Indian people. There are 22 different Indian tribes and pueblos in my State, living in a completely different style, but all Indians nonetheless. 
The most important thing for them is we have won today. We did not lose on the issue of sovereignty as it pertains to their immunity in their court systems. We did not lose, in an appropriations bill, without adequate hearings, without adequate information on one of the most complex and historic-filled situations in our Government and our governance. We won, because those decisions to take away tribal judicial immunity, whether it be for 1 year or forever, have been withdrawn from this bill. 
I thank the distinguished Senator, Senator Slade Gorton, for withdrawing his judicial immunity provision. I think it has become absolutely and unequivocally discernible by everyone that is a very complicated issue. 
Later, I am sure, in this discussion, we are going to hear proposals about how that is going to be fleshed out and how we are going to talk about judicial immunity, the right to sue Indian tribes or not to sue them in the courts of America and the courts of the States. We are going to hear discussions perhaps on how hearings ought to be structured to get to the bottom of certain 
issues where inequity may require that some modifications be made. But essentially, for the Indian leaders and the Indian people who came here by the hundreds, at least, this year, their tremendous concern about what was going to happen to them if this occurred is gone from the scene. 
The Senator from New Mexico is fully aware that the distinguished Senator, Senator Gorton, desires to fix some things that he feels are wrong with Indian law and the distribution of money, and he feels that just as strongly as I feel that we ought to be very careful about what we do and that it is not a simple proposition. Even the two graphs that were put up that show the disparity in incomes and the disparity in the distribution of our Federal resources don't tell the complete picture. 
The picture is one of a tribal allocation system evolving over time filled with history, filled with court decisions, filled with Senators who have purposely helped certain tribes and not helped others, which causes some of these funding levels to be out of whack. 
Nonetheless, the needs in Indian country are not debatable, because for every Indian person that has an average American income and an opportunity for a job and some assets, tribal or otherwise, that are significant, my guess would be 50 that don't have these assets. For every one that does, my guess would be 50 don't, 50 are poor. Their tribes are poor. Their reservations are economically depleted. So I suggest, as I did early on when the issue of means testing arrived, that we ought to be equally concerned about the needs of the Indian people. 
Frankly, the GAO letter that my friend, Senator Gorton, proposes, is fully within his rights. Any Senator can write to the GAO, whether it is joined by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee or whether it is the most junior Member here. You can write to GAO and ask them for information. Now I intend to ask them to assess the needs of the Indian people: How poor are they, and why are they poor? I want to ask them what physical needs they have--water systems, sewers, roads--for they live, in most cases, in a pretty bad economic situation and a pretty deteriorated public environment with reference to infrastructure and the like. 
So it is mighty easy to say, let's fix this formula and have somebody in government formulate a new means test for us, but I will tell you, it is a lot more difficult to find out what our responsibility should have been over the years and how much of the Indians' plight is because of the laws we have and our failure to take care of the related trust responsibilities that we have. 
The history of Indian people versus the United States of America is as old as some of the Supreme Court opinions written by Justice Chief Marshall back in 1830's. I am sure Senator Gorton, who is an expert on the legal debates, knows about all those cases. While I am not as legally perfected, I know that there is not one simple evolution of the relationship of the Indian people to the American Government and to the States. It has evolved because of court opinions, it has evolved because Presidents have articulated American policy with reference to Indians. President Nixon articulated a policy of self-governance and self-determination, which has then been carried out by the Government of the United States. 
So the next time we debate this issue, we will not just have three exhibits here, one of which quotes from one treaty, for I am sure that more than one of us will be steeped in the history of how we got to where we are. It is not going to be as simple as devising a new means formula and distributing federal money based upon some kind of new means testing. 
It may be that treaties don't govern all of these responsibilities, but I can guarantee you, the statutes are filled with commitments to the Indian people. Before we have this next debate and during the next hearings, we ought to be talking about all of those statutes that said we are going to educate the Indian 
people, and then we never provided enough money; that says we are going to house them, and then did not provide enough money. Where does that come into the equation? 
We said we wanted economic prosperity for Indians--but until the 1980's through the highway trust funds, we hardly funded any roads for them. I can remember, when I arrived in 1973, $10 million was the level of funding for Indian roads. We were thrilled to get it up as high as $30 million. When we included Indians in our highway trust funds for the first time, the funding jumped dramatically to $80 annually, and in the most recent highway bill 6 years ago, we finally got it over the $150 million mark for all of Indian country out of the highway trust funds. In spite of them paying into the funds everytime they bought gasoline, we weren't building any roads from this fund for them until the mid 1980's. 
Just a few remarks on judicial immunity. I believe it is incumbent upon the Indian leadership of this country to work with us, those of us who are genuinely concerned about their well-being and protecting their rights to self-determination and self-governance. We ought to work on some of the troubling areas where the lack of judicial review is something that is beginning to offend many people and that many of us who are protective of our Indian people are beginning to ask questions about. 
In that regard, Senator Gorton, in conversations that are off the record and not on the Senate floor, has talked about the fact that maybe the solution isn't a total waiver of their judicial immunity. 
Maybe we need to examine these judicial areas that cry out for some kind of equity and fairness. I assume in the next year those will be looked at by various committees. 
But in the final analysis, the important thing that happened here today is that, in my humble opinion, fairness prevailed because it would have been grossly unfair to waive tribal sovereign immunity. In fact I think it would have been wrong in the appropriations process to waive judicial immunity across Indian country so that Indian tribes can be sued by almost anyone for anything in any court. I believe we would have wreaked havoc on Indian governance and we would have destroyed the tribes of our country in many cases. And this too is an evolving situation. 
For in many of the cases where we have cited that the Indian tribes cannot be sued, they have insurance, I say to Senator Inouye. We found many of them are in fact settling lawsuits because they bought liability insurance. We have even found that some of the suits that people talked about here on the floor were indeed covered by liability insurance. So those who sued tribes were not without a remedy. 
But let us say the process has worked because we have not jumped precipitously into changing that very large body of law with reference to the governance and status of a recognized Indian tribe in terms of the courts of our land and judicial review of their actions. 
And on the previous issue on means testing, in summary, I believe that justice prevailed and the right thing is done by us not acting to establish some formula or even indicate that we are setting down that path. 
All we have done today is to set in motion some questions to the Government, the GAO. As indicated, there might be a lot of other questions of them. Then, in due course, means testing will be looked at in a manner that it should be looked at by appropriate committees. 
I thank Senator Gorton. I was privy to the meetings where this resolution was finally arrived at. I was not there at every meeting, but nonetheless I was there in time. I was there in time to make sure that some ideas that were apparently gaining credence were denied their credence. And I feel very good about that. And we are now back together saying, let us work together and see what we can do. 
I say to Senator Campbell, as chairman of the committee, our new chairman, I have served on your committee for a while, never as chairman because I could not do that, but I pledge to you my support as we move through the next year or so in trying to solve some of these problems. I am firmly convinced that it will not be a simple proposition of `let's have a means testing formula,' because there will be a lot more to it before we finish as we try to understand just what we ought to be doing in fairness. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to bring an issue to the Senate's attention related to the National Park Service and it's new initiative called Vanishing Treasures. 
In a number of park units throughout the Southwest, the Park Service is responsible for maintaining and interpreting numerous ruins and historic structures, some that date back over 1,000 years. 
One example of the wonderful ruins that exist in our National Parks is the Chetro Ketl kiva found in Chaco Canyon in New Mexico; a fascinating structure demonstrating the advanced architectural skills of the ancient Anasazi culture. 
Many of these structures have become unstable and are constantly being degraded, primarily by the effects of the harsh desert climate. Furthermore, the almost artistic skill required in the stabilization methods that are necessary to preserve these structures is being lost because of the emphasis on other programs within the Park Service. 
The Vanishing Treasures initiative will provide a 10-year program to stabilize these kinds of ruins to the point where they can be preserved by routine maintenance activities. Additionally, the initiative will place an emphasis on the training of younger employees, both permanent and seasonal, in the skills needed to perform this needed work. 
In all, over 2,000 prehistoric and historic structures in 41 Park Service units, and countless numbers of future visitors will benefit from the work performed under this initiative. 
The bill before us provides $1.5 million for this program, which is $0.5 million more than provided by the House, and $2 million less than requested by the administration. 
I hope that the chairman will work with me to ensure the Senate level is at least maintained in conference, and I look forward to working with him to explore other opportunities to see that this initiative has sufficient resources to do this important work.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Intel is the epitome of a good corporate citizen. During the August recess I was able to view the exceptional good deed performed by Intel. Intel has a large semiconductor manufacturing plant located in Rio Rancho, NM. It is a big employer and it provides good paying jobs. Rio Rancho didn't have a high school so Intel decided to build the community one. Some 1,900 students will attend this beautiful new 30 million-dollar facility. This is exciting for the community because the high schoolers will no longer have to leave Rio Rancho to attend high school. It is a special kind of home coming. 
New Mexico is lucky to have Intel as a member of its community. Rio Rancho would have eventually built a high school, but Intel made it happen sooner. 
Also of significance is what will be going on inside this high school. Intel has been very active in working with voc-ed programs so that students are trained for the jobs available at Intel. It starts in the high schools and continues in the technical schools, community colleges, and universities. As job requirements change at Intel, the company has a rigorous job training program that makes a prime example of what lifelong learning is all about.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to use just a few moments this morning to talk about this appropriations bill that is pending before the Senate and two projects under the Land and Water Conservation Fund that the distinguished chairman, Senator Slade Gorton, had put into the bill but subjected them to prior authorization: The so-called Headwaters acquisition in California which could cost $250 million; is that correct, Senator Gorton?

Mr. DOMENICI. And the so-called New World Mine in Montana, which is an effort to acquire a mine before it is mined. That is in Montana. I believe it would cost $65 million. 
Now, I am not here on the floor of the Senate to tell the Senate that these projects are good, should be done, or should not be done. But I am here to tell them absolutely and unequivocally that if the administration, through whatever source, is telling Senators that the budget agreement reflected that these projects should be funded, I am here to tell the Senate that is not true. 
Now, if the administration wants to say these are their high-priority items, which they have told the distinguished chairman, they are free to do that. In fact, they are free to do anything. Let me tell you that in the ritual and integrity of the agreement, they have spoken about these projects and some others. But we did not agree how the $700 million in new money that we included in this budget agreement should be spent. So one would say, well, how should it be spent? Well, obviously, it was to be spent in a typical manner of spending money out of the land and water conservation fund. Congress and the White House have to work together to decide what they want to do. There is no priority treatment in this budget arrangement in any way, shape, or form. 
Now, what I would like to do just visually for everyone so that they will understand. I have before me and I am holding up an agreement called the bipartisan budget agreement, May 15, 1997. Now, it is historic. Nothing like this has ever been done in the history of the Senate, where the leadership from the Senate and House signed an agreement with the White House to do things in a budget. In this agreement, if you look at it, from its 1st page until its 24th page, and two attached letters relevant to taxes, you will not find the names of these two acquisitions--Headwaters Forest or the New World Mine--mentioned. It is not in this agreement. Now, one might say, does it have to be? Yes. If it is a priority item that negotiators agreed would be done, it is in this agreement. If anybody wants to look at it, they can do so.

Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, I am going to turn to that right now. It is in the agreement. Anybody who wants to look at it can look at page 19. There is a chart in here that says what this fund is about. Essentially, it says that we have decided that $700 million can be set aside, at the option of the Congress, to be used for land acquisition, and a budget flow even shows how it will be spent. And the language says the $700 million, if spent for priority Federal land acquisition, can be done in excess of the caps for discretionary spending. That is why the U.S. House did not even put it in their appropriations bill, because there is nothing in this agreement that mandates it. It says that if you include $700 million for land acquisition, then when you spend it, the budget credits it to the appropriations committee.

Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, I want to tell you one other thing. The two instruments that judge our budget responsibility, vis-a-vis the President, what have we agreed to do with our President--frankly, they are not enforceable and everybody knows that, but we have agreed to do it. Might I say that this chairman, Senator Slade Gorton, has taken the agreements that are stated and he has followed them. As a matter of fact, one found on page 24 of the agreement and is also in the budget resolution, which I will talk to in a moment, was approximately a $74 million increase for Indian tribal priority allocation funding. Senator Gorton had a meeting and asked, `Is that a priority agreement that we agreed with?' I said, `Yes.' He said, `So it will be funded.' Is that not right?

Mr. DOMENICI. Now, the only other instrument that has anything whatsoever to do with implementing this 24-page historic agreement is the budget resolution itself because what we chose to do is to put in the budget resolution the priority requirements of this agreement. So that if you look at page 23 of the budget resolution, you find a description of the $700 million for land acquisitions and exchanges, but no mention of any single project--not a single project mentioned. It merely states very precisely what I told the Senate 4 minutes ago when I said how the $700 million was to be set up. That is what it says. 
But conversely, throughout this agreement, throughout this budget resolution, when we have agreed on a specific program in this agreement, it is found in this resolution. So, Senator, if you want to look at this agreement and say, what did the Congress and the President say about Head Start, that might be a question you could put to me. I would say that we agreed in this agreement that Head Start was a priority. Lo and behold, you will find in the budget resolution that Head Start, in the function on education, is listed, and guess what? The dollar amount that we agreed upon is in the budget resolution. 
Now, frankly, I think it is absolutely patent that had we agreed to these two projects--and I repeat that I am not sure how I will vote when we really have them before us in a proper mode. I am not sure how I will vote in the committee that authorizes them. But the pure simplicity of what I have just explained would say that if we agreed to these two projects, you would find them in one of these agreements. In fact, if you found them in the 24-page agreement, you would find them in the function of the budget that funds these kinds of projects, and they would be stated there. Now, I note the chairman is on the floor with a question. I am pleased to yield.

Mr. DOMENICI. No question. But you might say, in this respect, it is contemplated that if the Congress, and thus the Senate as the initiator, at some point in time wanted to implement the $700 million fund, they would at some time have to decide what they are going to spend it on. At that point in time, however they decided, the White House and Congress would engage in a political dialog in the normal way, with each having its strengths; namely, a vote here, and namely, the President says I don't want it, do it another way; that is typical. That would be envisioned as part of how you would decide how to spend it.

Mr. DOMENICI. As a matter of fact, the budget agreement doesn't say whether he should authorize them or not authorize them. The budget agreement speaks of allocating this money to this committee. But as I said, it does not prescribe the spending of the money in this committee on these projects. That is a legislative matter to be dealt with with the executive branch in the normal relationship that we have on spending money. It seems to me that the last thing that makes this argument most rational is that if you didn't put the $700 million in at all, there could not 
be a letter sent around saying `you violated the budget agreement.' 
As a matter of fact, the letter being sent by the administration--frankly, I want everybody to know I am trying desperately to get everybody to comply with the budget agreement. We are not complying in every respect. Nobody is finding this Senator running around saying you don't have to. Maybe others are, but I am not. Frankly, when the administration, under letter of September 11, a statement of administration policy, on the first page of that communication, it says: `In addition, the committee bill contains provisions that violate the Bipartisan Budget Agreement, such as the provision to require additional unnecessary authorizing language for key land acquisition in Montana and California.' 
It urges the Senate to strike that. They can urge that we strike it, but we are not striking it because it violates the budget agreement; we may or may not do it for some other reason. So, Senator, I wanted to come down here and make sure, since many Senators have stopped me and asked me if we agreed to these two projects, my answer is no. 
Now, are we forbidden from agreeing upon them and the $700 million to be used for them? Absolutely not. You are not disagreeing with that. As a matter of fact, you spend it. But you are saying that before we spend it we want to see what the authorizing committees say about that. I believe, to assume that you cannot authorize a project for the land and water conservation fund, which would give its resources from the $700 million, is arguing an uncertainty. I mean, that can't be. We never said anything about that. Congress retained that right. Anything we didn't agree upon, the Congress can do. It is just that they can't do anything inconsistent with it. 
I could go on, Senator, but I think the Senate will take my word that if you look at the agreement and find specifics that are priorities, you will find them in the budget resolution, which this Senate passed overwhelmingly. Theres a lot of things in it that Senators said they didn't know were in it. That is not my fault. I will tell you that specifics like Head Start and specifics like a new program for literacy are found in the agreement as priorities, and they are found in the resolution--resolved that--priorities such as these shall be funded to the extent of so many million dollars.

The Senator from New Mexico feels that if we don't follow those, that a letter like this one from the administration, under cover of September 11, could clearly say this bill does not fund a priority item that was agreed upon.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in 1989, I stood on the Senate floor and urged the Senate to enact tax incentives for enhanced oil recovery techniques. 
At that time, I told my colleagues that traditional drilling techniques were leaving behind 70 percent of the resource when traditional drilling and pumping was completed. To me, this was wasteful, foolish, and unnecessary. 
It is wasteful to leave the oil behind. 
It is foolish because the United States has a growing appetite for energy. We are currently importing close to half of the energy we use from an area of the world renowned for political instability. 
It is unnecessary because we have the technology to recover the resource if we would use enhanced oil recovery techniques. 
In 1989, I also told the Senate that it would be possible to recover another 20 billion barrels of oil from our same oil fields of existing wells if enhanced oil recovery techniques were used. Since our known recoverable reserves at that time were in the neighborhood of 28 billion barrels, the potential was, and still is, significant. 
At that time, the Department of Energy conducted extensive studies showing that if a 15-percent investment tax credits were enacted, it could result in the recovery of additional reserves for as little cost to the Treasury as $1 per additional barrel recovered--assuming $20 per barrel oil. 
For each and every dollar of Federal revenue invested in EOR incentives, the trade deficit would be reduced by $24 to $76 dollars according to the same DOE studies. 
States with significant EOR potential include California, Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. Other States with reserves include Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. 
In 1990, the Congress enacted tax incentives to encourage enhanced oil recovery so that more of this vast resource could be recovered and put to good use. I am proud to have been the primary sponsor of that legislation. 
As a Senator, one of the greatest rewards is seeing a new law make the world a better place. During the August recess I had this rewarding experience. I also saw the predictions of the theoretical studies proven up in the real world. 
I toured the Texaco enhanced oil recovery project located in Buckeye, NM. The technical name of the project is the `Central Vacuum Unit CO2 project.' 
This particular oil field was discovered in 1929. Primary oil recovery techniques were used until 1977. Beginning in 1977, the field was transformed into a waterflood operation. Waterflood is a secondary oil recovery technique. The waterflood technology sustained and enhanced production for awhile, but it was evident that either the oil wells in the field would be shut-in and the field-shut down leaving behind a significant amount of oil, or enhanced oil recovery methods could prolong economic levels of production. One very promising enhanced oil recovery technique involves injecting the wells with CO2. 
CO2 injection is an enhanced oil recovery technique eligible for a 15-percent Federal investment tax credit. Using CO2 is going to significantly extend the life of this mature field by more than 20 years. The project will recover an additional 20 million barrels of oil and 23 billion cubic feet of gas that otherwise would have been left behind. 
Texaco is the operator of this project. Marathon Oil, Phillips Petroleum, Mobil Exploration and Production U.S. Inc., and 15 others are interest owners in the project. 
New Mexico is blessed with magnificent oil and gas reserves. It is doubly blessed because it is also the home to the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology Petroleum Recovery Research Center. The center has served as a focal point for development and application of improved oil and gas recovery processes. They have a world-renowned reputation as one of the leading petroleum research centers. They were very helpful in developing the original legislation. 
In every oil- and gas-producing State, there are aging oil and gas fields with declining production, that could be made more productive using enhanced oil recovery techniques. I am pleased that there is a fine example in New Mexico. It is providing 100 jobs in addition to adding to our energy security.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to engage the distinguished chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee in a dialog about an item in the House version of the fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill. 
Mr. President, the House Appropriations Committee has approved $3 million within the Employment and Training Administration to support a telephone-access job search system. These funds are provided as part of the $71.8 million approved in the House bill for other federally administered programs. Through the labor market information activity, $3 million would be used to support the installation of a telephone access labor market exchange network for searching America's Job Bank by telephone. This service has the potential of providing access to job information to persons with disabilities, including individuals who are blind. 
I would ask the chairman if he would review the House proposal and give it serious consideration for inclusion in the final version of the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill. I understand that the $3 million would most appropriately go to assist states in meeting the first-year costs of joining a labor market exchange network for providing job seekers with access to America's Job Bank by telephone. With the innovative use of computer technology, this proposal could be of significant assistance to those who are disabled and in search of employment opportunities.

<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. I surely will not use the entire time, and whatever time I do not use I will yield back. 
In a couple minutes I will make a point of order against the pending amendment. It is a clear violation of section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act. I understand the sponsor of the amendment will move to waive the point of order, and I in no way want to infringe upon that privilege. 
Let me just say this is a very simple proposition. Everybody should understand that in the budget agreement there were a lot of priority items. That meant, literally, that the Congress and the President agreed that certain programs would be funded at the President's request. 
Anyway, it is pretty interesting because we indeed funded Head Start at the exact amount the President asked for in his budget. Head Start funding is increased substantially in this bill, $324 million above the 1997 level for total funding of $4.3 billion. 
It just seems like enough is never enough, despite the fact that we adopted the President's request and increased funding for Head Start $324 million over last year. 
My good friend, Senator Wellstone, wants to add an additional $525 million. Now, you understand I am not that quick with arithmetic, but $525 million versus an already existing increase of $324 does permit one to wonder what is the reason for this vote. It seems like it is a vote to vote, because we have already increased Head Start dramatically and in fact provided for this program exactly what the President requested. 
Having said that, for those who are concerned about military spending, and there are many, we are struggling mightily on various defense measures that we are hoping the President will sign, and the arguments are essentially over money. What we have agreed on with the President in the bipartisan budget agreement is that we will provide a certain amount of money for all of defense. Then we say for the next 2 years you cannot spend any defense money for domestic programs. That is called a wall between defense and domestic spending. 
When we did not have this wall between defense and domestic spending, defense never knew how much money they would receive because they had to wait for the completion of all the appropriations bills to see if money would be transferred from defense to domestic spending. 
Again, Senator Wellstone did not want to confront the wall and tear it down so he went around it. He just established his amendment and then he said the amount appropriated for the Department of Defense shall be reduced by $525 million and the Head Start Act would be increased by the same amount. However, his amendment would direct the Budget Committee not to show an increase in domestic spending so as not to bump up against the overall nondefense discretionary spending cap nor would it count against the committee and subcommittee allocations. 
Therein lies the Budget Act point of order. By directing the Budget Committee not to follow the scoring rules established by the Congressional Budget Act, the Wellstone amendment is subject to a 60 vote point of order pursuant to section 306 of the Budget Act. 
Madam President, the pending amendment contains matter within the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget in that it provides that the spending associated with this amendment will not be counted against nondefense discretionary spending caps. I therefore raise a point of order against the amendment pursuant to section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act. 
Now, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I, prior to reading that and making that point of order, be deemed to have yielded back any time I have remaining.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, I made a point of order because the Wellstone amendment seeks to add $535 million to the Head Start Program. We have already added $325 million in agreement with the President of the United States. This is a priority item. We filled every priority the President sought. And we have increased it by a total of $325 million. That is one point. 
Second, Senator Wellstone would like to take the wall that separates defense and domestic, and he would say the appropriators can appropriate $535 million less in defense by virtue of this amendment, which essentially takes the wall and spends $535 million of defense money for Head Start, which we have already fully funded as requested by the President.

<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. I am wondering if he would like to speak. 
That is the reason I raised this, I say to the Senator, but they are going to send for him. 
He spoke earlier in the day. 
Mr. President, I do not need but just a few moments. I was not privileged to hear Senator McCain and those who proffered this amendment. But let me first say that whatever they said about the status of the way we through the Federal Government are funding medical doctors' education, both straight medical school and for specialties, whatever they said about how egregious it is, they are probably right. 
The point is that what they seek to do is not going to help a bit because what has actually happened is that we are paying for medical education out of the Medicare fund, and we have been doing it for a long time. That is sort of a way for you to fund medical education, and if nobody knows about it, it doesn't count very much because it is coming out of what was always a very big trust fund. As a consequence, medical education is costing a huge amount of money and the biggest player--so everybody will understand this issue of who is going to decide how many doctors we have, right now the biggest player is the Federal Government. We are the ones putting huge amounts of money into the teaching hospitals that permit them to teach as many doctors either general medicine, their first years through, or their specialties. 
Obviously, we are proud that that system has yielded the best doctors in the world, I do not think there is any doubt about that, including the best specialists in the world. But the cost is enormous, something like $100,000 a doctor. And let me repeat, we, the taxpayers, through this mechanism are paying for that. So in a sense we already are the switch that is going to determine how many doctors we have and how many we do not have. And now all of a sudden in the budget debates there is a recognition that we cannot afford to spend as much as we have been spending. 
So the experts from the various committees and staffers--and I only regret to say I am not on the committee with jurisdiction. I was there negotiating with our distinguished leader, but the conclusion was we have to save some money on this Federal expenditure producing these doctors in particular since there are too many being produced, at least more than we ought to be paying for. Maybe that is the way I ought to say it. If they want to produce more and somebody wants to pay more money, that is the marketplace, good luck. But we are the marketplace substantially now, the taxpayers. 
So nobody wants to cut the subsidy. The AMA does not want us to cut the subsidy. The schools that are great schools do not want us to cut the subsidy. So to save money somebody came up with an idea to start a pilot project and see if in New York you said to the schools produce less doctors, we give you less money, and of the money saved, you get half and we get half. 
As this budget worked its way through the Congress, through the conference and debates, somebody said if you are going to try the pilot in New York, try it all over the country. So what we have is language in a budget deal that has already been voted in that says try this everywhere in the country and see what we 
get out of it. 
The end product, Mr. President and fellow Senators, is that the Congressional Budget Office estimates we will spend $230 million less this way than if we did not do it this way. So essentially, whether one likes the idea or not, the alternatives are very simple. One, if you take it out, as Senator McCain is recommending, you spend more money. 
Could I have an additional minute, 2 minutes? 
You do what Senator McCain is asking us to do and you spend $230 million more according to the Congressional Budget Office. I have no reason to discount that information.

<DOCNO>105-domenici-nm-8-19970909</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. 
So one option is to take it out and lose $230 million which the budget process has not found anywhere, and Senator McCain and his supporters are not finding anywhere. So it is essentially breaking the budget by $230 million, which means when the time has all expired, I will make a point of order that it violates the Budget Act and the Senators can vote up or down do they want to violate the Budget Act or not. If they do, we would lose $230 million, and that is their call collectively, and we need 60 votes to do it. 
One should ask, if the McCain amendment succeeds, where are we? The interesting thing is if the McCain amendment passes, we are right back to where we were before with the Federal subsidy program in place. We haven't reduced it significantly--a little bit, but we are still in there subsidizing just as we have been with a little bit less money. 
What we really ought to do is decide how we are going to change this. If we are putting too much money into the education of doctors at every level including specialists, we ought to put less in, and that is what we do not have the intestinal fortitude to do. And I guarantee you if a committee that has jurisdiction came to the floor with a proposal that said we are going to reduce the subsidy significantly so we don't spend as much money, thus you teaching hospitals get less, there would be a huge uproar and every Senator who has a major medical hospital and educational institution that produces medical doctors will be here talking--I see my friend from New York. He would be here certainly, and so would Senator Moynihan--saying it is the end of the world, it is the end of medicine as we know it. We did not do this. 
I frankly believe in the long run we have to do it. We cannot have so much capacity paid for by the Government. In the long run the private sector can pay anything they want and families can pay if they want. But the Federal Government to be the catalyst for producing more doctors than anybody thinks we need is just kind of absurd. 
So on the one hand I thank Senator McCain and his supporters for bringing this issue to the Senate. And maybe, win or lose, he will have prompted us to do something we ought to really do about this program, and I submit it is not to do what we have done in the budget. I do not have any alternative but to support it today and say, if we take that out, we lose a substantial amount of money. Nonetheless, Senator McCain and those supporting him will have had an educational exercise here and I think I have contributed to it.

Mr. DOMENICI. I made a mistake, Mr. President, in giving you the estimate of what this will cost the budget. I gave you $230 million. The Congressional Budget Office has now looked at the whole country, because this applies to the whole country, and their estimate now is, so everyone will know, if the McCain amendment is adopted, the budget will be, in the first 5 years, $390 million short. That is, that much will be added to the deficit and, over 10 years, believe it or not, it is $1.9 billion. I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, can I have 10 seconds before I make my motion? I, too, hope all the hospitals do that. If they do, we will save $390 million and over 10 years we will save $1.9 billion. I think that would be an exciting end product. 
Mr. President, the McCain amendment increases mandatory spending and is scored against the subcommittee's allocation. This additional spending would cause the underlying bill to exceed the subcommittee's allocation. Therefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment pursuant to section 302(f) of the Budget Act.

The report of the Committee on Small Business states that the committee does not agree with the CBO estimate and therefore the committee did not include the CBO estimate in its report. The Congress and the Budget Committees must rely on independent cost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office for reported legislation. From time to time, I too have disagreed with CBO cost estimates. I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the official CBO estimate for S. 1139.

Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I had thought that sometime today or tomorrow I would sit down and write a series of remarks and reflections and thoughts about Mother Teresa. But I think it would be more appropriate that I not delay that and that I say a few words now so that it is incorporated into this Record as reference to this wonderful and quite appropriate resolution. 
Let me first say I am not one of the privileged Senators who has met Mother Teresa and been with her for any length of time, although I have met her once. But I believe it is fair to say that even while I have not met her, I have probably never, in my years of life and certainly my years in the Senate, observed from a distance such a remarkable person. That is what makes it difficult, because she is so remarkable, because she is so different from what the world talks about today and what the world espouses as success, as the way we ought to live our lives so we can be successful. She is so far removed from that and is yet great without any question, that sometimes it is hard to find words in our kind of world to talk about her. 
But I was thinking, from my own standpoint, over the weekend I was privileged as a member of my own family in Albuquerque, NM, to be present with our entire family and many hundreds of friends at the 50th jubilee of one of my own sisters being a Sister of Charity. She is a couple years older than I and has been a Sister of Charity for 50 years and has taught kids all across this country. She assumes she has touched and taught no less than 10,500. So I feel I could talk about her for a minute while we talk about the great sacrifices of Mother Teresa. 
But obviously, it was an interesting weekend in that regard, for while we are all grieving the death of this saint, I was privileged to be part of a family event where I think we have somebody very close to that title who is our own blood. 
Then, as I thought about what we ought to say here today, I hearkened back to a long, long time ago when we were taught a little bit about the Old Testament and the New Testament. What I was thinking about is that this is a pretty muddled up world. Things aren't going so well. There are a lot of people terribly worried about our value system and where are we going versus our Maker, where is this world apt to end up with what appears to be such an absence of what we understand is the right thing to do and the right way to go and right and wrong on a daily basis. I was thinking back to the Old Testament of Sodom and Gomorrah and Abraham negotiating with God. They had a very interesting negotiation. It shows that Abraham was a wonderful negotiator even in working things out with the Maker, for as you recall he talked about how many good people you have to find in Sodom and Gomorrah to save it. The negotiations started very high and ended up I believe at 10--10. I don't think they could find 10, so Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed. 
What does this have to do with Mother Teresa? Well, I guess I would say that it is pretty clear to me that the kind of relationship we were talking about back in the Old Testament is still a relationship with the Maker, with the God Almighty, and I believe it is imperative that the world give great confirmation and credence to someone whom we know is the kind of person that is so good and so much in touch with what the Almighty thinks and wants that they are clearly capable of intervening and saving us. So I don't think we should just praise her for the marvelous acts of love, but I think we should thank her, we should thank her from the bottom of our hearts for contributing in a very big way toward a more positive relationship between the Almighty and humankind. 
Now, having said that, I want to make just a couple of other points. I know it is very easy for people to talk about Mother Teresa and not want to talk about her faith, but I do not think you can do that. I do not think you can say she is a great humanitarian. In fact, I do not believe she would want to be called a humanitarian. Her faith is very simple, profound, and real. She believes what her faith tells her, and that is that the poor and the downtrodden, the sick, and those who are on their death beds with all kinds of infirmities present in their bodies and minds, that they are Jesus Christ. 
Now, I am not offended, nor am I concerned, about saying that right here on the Senate floor because that is true. So we must talk about her in that context, for to do otherwise is to deny her existence and why she did what she did. 
Now, having said that, it is very hard for most mortals to live their faith that way--very hard. Nonetheless, I think what I choose to honor today and to thank her for is that she did, as a matter of fact, live her faith, totally to the core. Every bit of her being was living that New Testament admonition, for we recall that Jesus Christ said, `If you are taking care of somebody who is desperately hungry, you are taking care of me; if you are taking care of those who are suffering, you are taking care of me.' 
Now, most of us are not able to bridge that gap of faith that she bridged every day, every moment, for she literally lived her life fully aware of and practicing that admonition. So it seems to this Senator that it is most befitting, and in particular in the kind of world we live, in which just 2 weeks ago we had a poll of the American people and with the economy humming and with all the material things seeming to go well, huge numbers of Americans said we are on the wrong path. I think the wrong path did not have much to do with material wealth. I think they are frightened about the way we behave, and they are worried about what that is going to end up doing to us. 
So I think it is fair that we step back and say, well, here is one, the lady from Calcutta, here is one who sees it completely different than we do, and yet look how many lives she affected, look how many people came within the yoke of this little, tiny, frail body, which probably at her death was not bigger than 75 to 80 pounds at the most. 
So I thank Senator Nickles and others, and I join as a cosponsor of this resolution, but it is again as you look at things really inadequate. As I look at the occupant of the chair and I think what do we really feel about this lady and we can't quite write it down, we can say with absolute assurance that she is the right kind of person to respect, that she is the right kind of person and personage for the U.S. Senate to pay tribute to.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have an amendment with reference to the appropriations bill on the Departments of Labor-Health and Human Services, and Education. I want to make sure that everybody understands this is Senator Gorton's amendment. I am offering it on his behalf. I would just like to make a couple statements before I send the amendment to the desk to become part of the itinerary of the Senate. 
First, this amendment takes most of the education funds for kindergarten through 12th grade and creates a block grant to the local schools based on the number of school-aged children and the relative wealth of the States. 
My purpose in doing this is to make sure that every child in the United States will graduate from high school with basic skills in reading and writing, mathematics, and the kind of skills that everybody knows we should have by the time we complete 12th grade. 
I am firmly of the opinion that we have to try something new and different. Our schools need to do things differently. We keep adding to the inventory of programs, and we keep adding money to various programs. 
I join Senator Gorton in this amendment because I believe when the numbers are all figured out, the schools will find out that they will receive a very significant increase in money. This is not just an efficiency move, but it is to see if we can't give the States an opportunity to do things differently. Essentially, this is a way to help our schools, instead of having a one-shoe-fits-all approach. 
We need to attempt to give the schools an opportunity to improve the quality of education by using this money to move decisionmakers closer to the schools. Schools need to come up with a master plan for improving the basic skills that we require if we are going to be graduating children from our high schools who can make it in this economic environment. 
This amendment provides a mechanism of giving slightly more money to the poorer States which, in turn, would mean slightly less money to the more wealthy States. However, everybody would get more money because you would be eliminating all of the categorical bureaucracies that exist which are enormously expensive, both at the national level and to the school districts who have to administer them. Local school districts across America, and our superintendents and our principals would say, Let's see if we couldn't do better 
The amendment would not affect Title VIII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; Individuals with Disabilities Education Act funds; Adult Education Act funds; Museum and Library Services Act funds; Departmental management expenses; Educational Research Development, Dissemination, and Improvement Act funds; or funds to carry out the National Education Statistics Act; to carry out section 10501--funds for civic education--or 2102--Eisenhower Professional Grants--and Park K--National Writing project--of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; 
By eliminating the Federal strings attached to the money, the Federal Government would be recognizing that one size does not fit all. 
The amendment would allow State and local governments to design programs that best meet the needs of the local schools. 
The reason for this amendment is simple. 
Our schools need to do things differently. 
Too many kids are merely getting social promotions to keep them in a class with their age group regardless of whether they have learned their lessons. It is a sad state when many of our graduates can't read the diplomas they receive at graduation. 
Too many schools don't teach the basics any more. 
In `Teaching the New Basic Skills' by economists Frank Levy of MIT and Richard Murnane of Harvard, the authors argue that employers hire college graduates because they have little confidence that high school graduates have mastered ninth grade level math; that is, the ability to manipulate fractions and decimals and to interpret line and bar graphs. 
They contend one of the reasons we are paying so much more for college graduates than we ever did before is because we are doing such a poor job at the high school level. 
The central educational task today is to do better teaching high school students. That can't be done from Washington. To keep up, calls for local decision making, not cumbersome programs developed in Washington. 
Robert W. Galvin and Edward W. Bales of Motorola have written, `The major issue . . . is that the education system is undergoing incremental change in an environment of exponential change.' 
Americans spend a lot on education. Last year $550 billion a year in total private and public money was spent on education. This is more than what was spent on defense and second only to health care in tapping American's pocketbook. Yet as defense firms have restructured, and health care providers have turned themselves upside down moving to HMO's, education experts start another school year excusing failure and demanding more money. 
Effective reform involves parents, teachers, and local businesses. 
In New Mexico we need to train kids to work at Intel and other high tech firms. In Detroit, the schools need to prepare kids to work in auto plants. In recent studies it was found that only half of the kids had the basic reading and math skills to get a job in an auto plant. 
This amendment will give the control back to the local schools so that they can use their Federal education funds to meet the local job market and better educate our kids. Local school districts are proving it can be done and this amendment will help others following in those successful footsteps. 
I hope my colleagues will support Senator Gorton's amendment. 
I want everybody to understand that Senator Gorton did not include every single kindergarten through twelth grade programs in this new approach to give our schools an opportunity to do things differently. The amendment will not affect title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; Individuals with Disabilities Education Act funds; the Adult Education Act funds; the Museum and Library Services Act funds; departmental management expenses; Educational Research Development, Dissemination, and Improvement Act funds; funds to carry out the National Education Statistics Act, to carry out section 10501; funds for civic education; 2102 Eisenhower professional grants; or the Park K, the national writing project, of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
I send the amendment to the desk.

Mr. DOMENICI. I reviewed this in an effort to make a statement of introduction today because you asked me to because you did not think you could be here. I am very pleased you are. I think we ought to talk about this exciting proposal from the standpoint of reality. The reality, to me, is that our schools need to do things differently, and we are not doing things any differently here with our programs except from time to time adding a little money here and there. For the most part, we are stuck. 
If there is a growing mediocrity--and I assume that is putting it mildly--we are probably part of it. We should not be talking just about saving money or about giving schools more money without strings, but about educating children better. I almost would call our approach giving the schools an opportunity to get the basics done again. 
I was part of the budget negotiations, and I am not changing that here because I realize a certain amount of money has to go to education, and I believe this bill honors that. That was one of the categories where the President received his preference. This amendment's approach to current education monies gives the schools the flexibility to try to do things differently. We are saying, let's look at our education situation because we are kind of stuck, and we want to get out of that rut. 
Is that how you see our bill?

Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, I want to make this last point and see if you concur. This is different from other efforts to encapsulate our Federal programs into some kind of block grant, and for the most part that was always to cut education. There is no effort to cut education here. 
The major increases that are in this bill that are in response to the budget agreement are all used in this fund--not a penny less--and it may be much bigger when it reaches the districts. 
That money will increase the level so nobody should think that Senators Gorton and Domenici are for reducing the expenditure. 
If we save administrative money, we want to spend it on the kids, and it ought to be a rather substantial amount of money.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill, S. 1061, the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and related agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. 
The bill provides $236.4 billion in new budget authority and $188.6 billion in new outlays for programs of the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and related agencies. 
When adjustments are made for prior-year outlays and other completed actions, the bill as adjusted totals $286.3 billion in budget authority and $285.2 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998. 
The committee-reported bill is within the subcommittee's revised 602(b) allocation just filed with the Congress' return. 
There are several items for which the Senator from New Mexico would like to express appreciation. One item is continued funding for Hispanic Serving Institutions. With a slight increase over the 1997 level, the bill retains this program as separate from the Strengthening Institutions program. In addition, I appreciate the committee's willingness to continue funding PATH grants for the homeless. 
I continue to be concerned about the practice of providing a $300 million contingency fund for LIHEAP that must be designated as emergency spending to be released. These expenses, in most cases, can be anticipated and should be addressed through the regular appropriations process. 
I am especially pleased, that within the funding for the Centers for Disease Control, the committee has provided an $18 million increase for diabetes, including the establishment of a `community-based intervention project in Gallup, New Mexico.' 
As you know, this is an historic year in which we have set forth a plan to balance the budget in 7 years. The authorizing committees have completed a very difficult task in implementing this historic bipartisan budget agreement. I am pleased that the Appropriations Committee is attempting to live within funding and priority proposed in this agreement. 
A concern I continually have, is the reduction of mandatory spending within appropriation bills. When mandatory savings are included in appropriations bills, it is generally to offset discretionary spending, instead of deficit reduction. In particular, the subcommittee has reduced the cap on the Social Services block grant by $255 million for fiscal year 1998. 
Overall, I am supportive of the work of the committee and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the bill be placed in the Record.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Mr. Harkin's amendment uses a budgetary gimmick to offset increased spending in 1998. 
The amendment merely delays $29 million in mandatory Commodity Credit Corporation [CCC] spending for USDA computers and related items until 1999 to offset increased spending in 1998. 
The 1996 farm bill included $275 million for computer and related expenses over the 1997 through 2002 fiscal years. Based upon the language in the farm bill CBO had to estimate the flow of funds over the 6-year period. 
The CBO estimated that approximately $66 million will be spent on computers and related expenses in 1998. The Harkin amendment merely delays the expenditure of $29 million into 1999 thus increasing spending in 1999. 
Under our scoring rules if the appropriations bill changes a mandatory program the Appropriations Committee will get scored with the change. If this amendment becomes law, the discretionary spending caps will be adjusted downward in 1999. 
This amendment will therefore make it more difficult for Congress to fund agriculture research and extension, education, and environment programs in next year's appropriation bills as less money is available to spend.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I will make the following statement. 
This morning the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the conference report to accompany the Balanced Budget Act, with 1 hour equally divided between the chairman and the ranking member of the Budget Committee. Following the conclusion of debate on the conference report, at approximately 10:15 a.m., the Senate will proceed to vote on the adoption of the conference report. 
Following that vote, it is the intention of the majority leader that the Senate begin debate on the conference report to the Taxpayer Fairness Act. As Members are aware, there are also 10 hours of statutory debate time in order for this conference report. Therefore, Members can anticipate additional rollcall votes following the 10:15 a.m. vote. As always, Members will be notified as to when those rollcall votes will be ordered.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will save a few remarks until just before the vote. Certainly, if anybody else on our side wants to speak, they are welcome. Nobody is bound to speak, but if they would like to, we have 15, 20 minutes on our side. 
I would like to make just a few comments about some of the processes we have been involved in and thank a few people. 
Mr. President, I do not believe 15 years ago that anybody assumed the Budget Act could be used to balance a budget as we are doing it here today. The reconciliation instruction and then the reconciliation bill are strange-sounding words and a strange-sounding name for a bill. But essentially we have, by evolution and development and some changes in the law, permitted a budget resolution which does not involve the President; it involves just a majority vote in both Houses. We permitted it to be used to force the passage of reform legislation or tax bills such as the one we have before us. 
I think everybody should recognize a couple of very interesting historic evolutions as this process developed. One is the adoption of the Byrd rule by the U.S. Congress as part of the law that applies to the Senate of the United States. And, obviously, one need not search as to where that came from. It came from Senator Robert Byrd. 
Essentially, one of the Parliamentarians has praised it this way, that the Byrd rule limits our ability to ride the budget horse into passing all kinds of legislation that have little to do with the budget. 
I am very pleased to say, and I was able to say to the distinguished Senator Byrd yesterday, that when you put a bill together as large as this, with as many committees and as many innovative minds, you cannot help but try to ride the budget horse beyond what it ought to be used for. There were many, many, I would say scores of legislative language that violated this rule as this process was evolving and these bills were getting developed, because the rule is a tough rule and it has great, great impact in that those provisions are stripped from the bill if they are subject to a Byrd rule. Then we were able to bring down the scope and numbers to a very, very small number that remained as of yesterday, and I am very pleased, working together, everybody has come up with the conclusion, from what I can tell, that whatever Byrd rule language or violation of Byrd rule language is in this bill has been thought by almost everyone to be necessary and something that we can leave in the bill. I am very pleased with that. I must make sure everybody knows that there were many, many more before we exerted the power and pressure of the Byrd rule. And I think that bodes well in terms of not abusing the process. 
Having said that, Mr. President, again, I yield the floor. If anyone else on our side would like to speak, time is available to them. I suggest that if no one is speaking, the time be charged equally, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as required by the Line-Item Veto Act, the Joint Committee on Taxation has informed the conferees that the conference report on H.R. 2015, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, contains one limited tax benefit. It can be found in section 5406 and concerns the treatment of services performed by certain inmates. As required by the Line-Item Veto Act, section 9304 of the conference report specifically designates section 5406 as a limited tax benefit and as such, it is therefore subject to the President's cancellation authority under the Line-Item Veto Act.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to discuss an issue that relates to Medicare's diabetes self-management benefit. 
As my colleagues know, the reforms we have under consideration include a provision which would extend Medicare coverage of blood glucose monitors and testing strips to type II diabetics. This seems to make abundant good sense. 
The provision would also reduce the national payment limit for testing strips used by diabetics by 10 percent beginning in 1998. 
I have some concern about these policies especially since the incidence of diabetes is growing and people are being afflicted at earlier ages. For example, it is an epidemic among Indians. 
It could also impact diabetic patients. This 10 percent reduction in payment for diabetes test strips could prove harmful to many durable medical equipment [DME] suppliers. 
I call to my colleagues attention, a study that is currently being conducted for the Health Care Financing Administration by AFYA to consider the reasonableness of Medicare payments for approximately 100 specific DME items, including diabetic test strips. 
Once that study is completed, Congress may want to revisit this issue. 
By itself, the 10 percent reduction may cause some DME suppliers, particularly the smaller operations, to sustain financial losses such that they no longer supply test strips. Also, some suppliers may stop taking assignment of diabetic test strips because they cannot afford to furnish Medicare products under the reduced pricing scheme. This could, in turn, lead to a situation whereby the Medicare diabetic patient will pay the difference and may have to pay the full amount up front and wait for Medicare to reimburse the reduced share. 
Finally, another issue which I think is worth mentioning relates to home oxygen. I have received many calls and letters from constituents who oppose a reduction in the monthly payment amount for home oxygen. This bill reduces reimbursements for home oxygen by 25 percent in 1998 and then an additional 5 percent in 1999. 
I would hope that my colleagues would take these matters under consideration, and that they join me at some future point in giving these matters further consideration.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are on the threshold of passing the largest tax cut in 16 years. It's a package that benefits Americans of all ages and in all tax brackets. Mr. President, 82 percent of the benefits in this bill go to families earning less than $110,000, during the first 5 years. 
I commend the chairman once again, and the entire Finance Committee and certainly the ranking member, Senator Moynihan, for their fine bipartisan work. The hard-working parents of 45 million children will pay $500 less per child in taxes as a result of this tax credit for children--45 million children. At least 5 million parents with kids in college and taxpaying students will have $1,500 per student more to spend at college, as a result of the tuition credit, and 7.2 million recent entrants into the job market will be able to deduct their student loan interest. This package will mean that the American families will get to keep more of their hard-earned money, instead of sending it to Washington. 
This is a very large number of American families. I have just given you the numbers in millions, and they are very, very significant in all our towns, all our cities in all areas of our respective States, be it yours, Mr. President, or mine. 
Let me quickly outline the major components of this package, because I think they are very exciting. Some have said it is a very small tax cut and, yes, in terms of our gross domestic product, or even our total tax, it is not a very big tax cut. But I believe we prove here that we can help many, many Americans, especially those most entitled to help in areas where we most want to encourage achievement. 
The $500 child credit to help the working poor and middle class, the value of the personal exemption has been eroded over time, and the cost of raising a family has become more expensive. We all know in our youth that the deduction that our parents got to take because they had a child they were raising was a very, very significant economic advance to that family. We let it erode. The credit in this bill will totally eliminate the Federal income tax burden for more than 30,000 families in New Mexico and 300,000 New Mexican children's families will be able to take credit to reduce their taxes. I am particularly pleased that the Finance Committee decided to design the credit so that the working poor would also see the benefit of the $500 credit. 
In New Mexico, there are 175,087 claimants of the earned-income tax credit. I applaud the final bill's approach. It is a logical sequel to the new welfare reform laws we have passed, because it, too, emphasizes moving from welfare to work. 
The $500 child credit will save New Mexico families $461 million over the next 5 years. For a small State and a poor State, that is a lot of money that will stay home in the pockets of people and stay in our States. This is money that they can choose to spend, or they can save it to meet their needs. A family with two children eligible for two $500 credits would have an extra $1,000 a year in the family budget. 
Some think that is not much, but this would pay the mortgage for 1 1/2 months, or pay half of a year's worth of car payments, or buy gas for the family car for 8 months or groceries for 3 months. 
In New Mexico, while 78 babies are born each day, Congress is passing this bill so that these children and their families will have a brighter future, more opportunity and keep more of their money. 
This tax cut is overdue. Let me repeat, in 1948, the typical American family sent 3 percent of its income to Washington in the form of taxes--3 percent. Today, the number is closer to 25 percent with the Federal tax. Prior to the passage of this bill, most working mothers were working to pay taxes instead of improving the standard of living for their families, and that isn't right. Lowering the tax burden will let moms' paychecks go toward family expenses instead. It is not as much as everyone would like, but certainly better than doing nothing. As I see it, the entire package is a giant step in the right direction. 
Most people's vision of America and the American dream includes a college education for their children. This bill helps fund that dream. It is a big expense and tuition costs have risen far more than inflation. Parents have told me that they have nightmares about financing college for their children. In New Mexico, tuition ranges from $18,700 at St. John's College, to $2,080 at the University of New Mexico or New Mexico State. Community and technical college tuition is about half that. 
This bill provides a number of separate provisions that help finance college, but the most significant of them is a $1,500 tax credit that reduces taxes dollar per dollar for the first $1,000 worth of tuition paid and 50 percent for the next $1,000 of tuition paid for the first 2 years of college, community college or technical school. A good idea. 
During the junior and senior years of college, the tax credit is 20 percent of the first $5,000 in tuition paid. Over time, these tax credits get bigger so that by the year 2002, the tuition tax credit is $10,000. 
I am pleased that the technical colleges and community colleges qualify. They are needed. They are filling an ever-more important role in our changing educational needs. 
Student loans are one of the broadest based forms of financial aid for graduate students. They are instrumental in financing undergraduate study as well. 
The deductibility of student loan interest automatically shifts the benefit of the provision toward children of low- and middle-income families. The deduction of student loan interest is well designed to provide annual tax relief, and can provide a powerful incentive for more citizens to pursue and push hard for graduate and advanced degrees. 
The deduction is phased in: $1,000 in 1998; $1,500 in 1999; $2,000 in 2000, and $2,500 in 2001. 
Mr. President, this bill has a number of IRA's that our distinguished chairman has been the advocate of. He has adequately explained them and I won't go into them in detail. 
This bill also allows penalty-free withdrawals from all IRA's for undergraduate, post-secondary vocational and graduate education expenses. 
The bill also makes the exclusion of $5,525 worth of education assistance paid for by employers permanent. This provision has helped millions of workers maintain their state-of-the-art skills. As we move into the 21st century life-long learning will be a way of life. 
The great educator Horace Mann said, `Education is the great equalizer.' 
In our technological society the reverse is also true, lack of education can leave people behind. For example, while in 1980, a student graduating from college could expect to earn about 45 percent more than a high school graduate, today the differential has almost doubled. 
This bill provides $207 million in tax relief over the next 5 years for New Mexicans to better educate themselves and their families. 
Actions have consequences and tax policy has mammoth consequences. The United States has one of the highest capital gains tax rates and one of the lowest savings rates among the seventh wealthiest countries in the world. If we cut the capital gains rate, our economy could create 150,000, as much as 280,000, new jobs next year. Besides being good for the economy, this capital gains tax will benefit everyone. Over a 10-year period, about one-third of all taxpayers sell at least one capital gains asset. Over a 10-year period, one-third of our population can take advantage of capital gains. It is not for one small group; it is for one-third of Americans. 
We need to update our image of who benefits from a capital gains tax cut. In 1990, the typical mutual fund owner is someone in the $35,000 to $75,000 income bracket. The average portfolio is $14,000. Half of these investors do not have a college degree. This is a very different image from the wealthy widow toting a pampered poodle down Fifth Avenue in New York and being the one who can take advantage of capital gains. But I don't know anyone in New Mexico who has a numeral after his last name. I do know that New Mexicans pay $638 million in capital gains in 1995. Under this bill, that tax would be considerably reduced. 
When the investor invests in companies, the result is capital formation. Dale Jorgenson of Harvard has noted that almost half of the economic growth between 1948 and 1980 was due to increased capital formation and influx into American businesses. Greater economic growth results as more and better paying jobs arrive on the scene. 
I am also pleased that the bill expands IRA's and allows penalty-free withdrawals for the first-time home buyer and, obviously, we have other provisions that help homeowners because they, too, get a very significant capital gains differential when they sell their homes. 
As baby boomers age it is very important that they save more for retirement. The IRA provisions encourages everyone to save more. I see this as a step toward enacting the U.S.A. tax reform plan that I have been working on the last few years. Under that plan families would be given an unlimited savings allowance so that the tax rate on any amounts saved or invested would be zero until the funds are consumed. 
The other major provision in this bill provides death tax relief. The estate tax is often referred to as the most confiscatory tax of all. Some call it a tax on success. A recent Tax Foundation study found that today's estate tax rates--ranging from 18 to 55 percent--have the same disincentive effect on entrepreneurs as doubling the current income tax rates. 
The unified credit has not been increased since 1987. This bill slowly increases it to $1 million by the year 2007. 
The philosophy behind the estate tax was imported from Europe, for example, that the accumulation of too much wealth in too few families is bad. Today, however, that estate tax philosophy is fundamentally flawed. When applied to closely held business assets, ironically, the tax produces just the opposite result--often forcing family owned businesses to sell off to larger public corporations. It raises roughly 1 percent of annual revenues. At that rate, it is hardly worth the devastation it causes to family businesses and farms, and entrepreneurship. 
Starting a small business is part of the American dream that allows any American with a good idea to follow it to prosperity and independence. In my State I have seen a number of welfare mothers start successful businesses. The ultimate American dream is to be able to leave that successful family business to one's children. Too often current estate taxes force heirs to liquidate the business or family farm to pay the estate taxes. 
The death tax takes its toll. Only 13 percent of family businesses are passed on to a third generation. The National Federation of Independent Business testified before the Ways and Means Committee that `the Federal estate tax represents perhaps the greatest burden today on our Nation's most successful small businesses.' This bill helps lighten that burden. 
The death tax changes are timely changes for ranchers. The average age of America's cattlemen is 55 years old. Some 80 percent of the beef cattle operations have remained in one family for 25 years or more with 42 percent in the family for over 50 years. Interestingly, 12 percent of the ranches have been in the same family for 100 years. This bill will contribute to preserving the great American legacy by helping keep ranches in the family by providing $25 million in tax relief to New Mexicans over the next 5 years. 
The bill also allows people to sell a house tax free. This is a good real estate provision. One provision I am not totally satisfied with is the treatment of investment real estate. The conference report sets the capital gains rate at 25 percent, I truly believe that equity demands that the capital gains rate on investment real estate be the same as the capital gains rate. I hope the Congress will revisit this issue in the near future. 
I am pleased that the bill makes it easier for small business entrepreneurs to claim the home office deduction. I am also glad that this bill accelerates the phase-in of the self-employed health insurance deduction. 
The biggest winners under this tax bill are middle-income families with children, particularly those families earning between $20,000 and $50,000 per year. Families earning between $50,000 and $100,000 are given tax relief too, provided they have children or kids in college. 
A married couple with household income of $35,000 and two children under age 17 would see their tax bill fall by $2,000, a 38-percent decline from what they'd owe under current law. 
The education incentive mean that families with children in college are helped even more. A married couple with income of $35,000 and two children, one in college and one still at home, would see their tax bill fall by $2,000, a 76-percent decline from what they'd owe under current law. 
What these families save on taxes represents cash in your pocket; it represents how much of their own money they get to keep. Think about how much of a raise a taxpayer would have to get from their boss in order to be able to increase their take-home pay by that much. 
Mr. President, today is a banner day. We finished a bill that balanced the budget yesterday, and within that framework, today, we are passing a net tax reduction of $96 billion over 5 years. This makes it the largest tax reduction bill since President Reagan's tax reduction in 1981, and the first tax relief bill since President Reagan signed the 1986 tax reform. 
Let me say, for those who are disappointed, I am not the least bit disappointed. We can always look at this as half-full or half-empty. I believe, when you look at Congress and the Presidency and the different philosophies, to be here today with the second of two major bills of this proportion, moving toward balance and a significant and very well tailored tax cut, I believe it is a real achievement, and for those who want more and think we should do more, let me suggest, we have been trying for a long time to do just this much and have been unable to do it. So I am very pleased and think the American people will be, too, when they start to feel its impact in their communities, in what they pay for taxes and what they keep. 
I thank the Senate, and I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 of our 10 minutes. 
First, Mr. President, usually we thank a lot of people. There are so many staff people that I am not going to thank them all, but I will put all of their names in the Record. There are so many heroes. 
But I do want to pay tribute to a staff member from the House. His name is Rick May. He has been staff director of the Budget Committee in the House. He is a graduate of Ohio State. He works for Representative John Kasich. He has been their budget overseer for 10 years, working on budget issues since 1983. He helped put together the alternative that John Kasich offered in 1989. It started with just 30 votes. John Kasich's leadership has grown. And right at his right hand has been Rick May. He is going to join a firm here in town, and I wish him well, and want the Senate Record to reflect that we appreciate what he has done. 
Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, I would like to take a moment to thank all of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, who have seen me stand in this well time and time again, and have listened to me speak about a balanced Federal budget. I want to thank you all--from the bottom of my heart--for your patience and your support. 
Mr. President, I would like to thank the ranking member of the Budget Committee, Senator Lautenberg. I turn to him and just say thank you. 
You have been an active member of the Senate Budget Committee for many years, but in your first year as ranking member you have represented the interests of your party and your constituents in an honest and forthright manner. I have enjoyed working with you. 
I would like to thank the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth. Few have worked harder or longer to ease the tax burden on American families. But the package that you helped fashion, Senator Roth, of lowering taxes is a significant step forward. It addressed a need that has been there for almost 16 years as far as middle-income America is concerned. 
The package that you helped fashion in the Finance Committee was not only a significant step in support of lower taxes, but also boldly addressed the need to reform Medicare and protect it for those who depend upon it today, and those who will need it in the future. Unfortunately, we were not able to hold those reforms in our conference but I believe your action has put us on the road to reform. Thank you and your staff for your support. 
In addition to that, we praise the Finance Committee and its leader Senator Roth for reforms in Medicare. The protection of that will depend upon whether these reforms work and whether we are successful in the future in a major reform package for Medicare. 
Finally, to our leader, Senator Trent Lott. In short, Mr. President, we would not be standing here today, about to pass this historic balanced budget package, if not for the leadership, the support, and the efforts of Trent Lott. As majority leader I don't believe a day has gone by when he didn't take some action aimed at producing a balanced budget for the American people. He has been direct, he has been focused, and he has done everything you could ask a leader to do to get us to this point. The American people should know, that this bipartisan budget and tax relief package is due, in no small part, to his determination, his drive, and his commitment. Mr. Leader, I thank you for your leadership and your support. 
I thank him for the support he has given me. I hope that I have been of support and help to him as we move down this course of very complicated negotiations as evidenced by the size of the bills we have and the scope of what we are accomplishing. 
Mr. President, I began this debate by quoting from a newspaper that this agreement is a big deal. And, I believe it is. Because while it has taken us 7 months to put this specific balanced budget and tax relief package together, the pathway to this point has been years in the making. 
This legislation is a big deal because we have followed through on our bipartisan commitment to implement the bipartisan budget agreement reached in May. It is a big deal because it will balance the Federal budget for the first time in 30 years. It is, in short, a great victory for the American people who are entitled to expect of their adult leaders that they work together in the best interests of our country. 
For the past 2 years, many of my colleagues and I have insisted that any budget passed through Congress be a balanced budget, one which is fiscally responsible, reduces the deficit, protects our children, provides much-needed tax relief for working American families, while preserving and strengthening Medicare and encouraging economic growth. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 does just that. 
It covers hundreds of Government programs; it has taken thousands of man-hours to put together; it will help millions of our citizens; and save billions and billions of dollars. 
The budget we will vote on today is a big deal because it offers America hope. But not only is this package a big deal it is also a good deal. 
It is a good deal because it is a budget designed to help American families, to make them more secure--in their homes, in their communities, in their jobs. 
It offers them a more efficient government--one dedicated to economic growth and security, support for our children, and lower taxes on America's workers. 
This budget is a good deal because it recognizes the simple notion that our Government cannot simply go on borrowing and spending our children's money. It will finally drive a stake through the heart of the Deficit Dragon, and put an end to mounting Federal debt, a Medicare system that will go bankrupt and a crushing tax burden on those just starting out in life. 
The budget is a good deal because it will strengthen America. It will change the way our Government works--to make it more efficient, more responsive, and less expensive. And, most importantly, it will ensure a better future for our children and our Nation. 
This budget is a good deal because it reflects our commitment to fiscal responsibility, generating economic growth, creating good jobs with a future, and protecting the American dream for all our citizens--young and old alike. 
This budget is a good deal because it will restore America's fiscal equilibrium. It will reverse the tide of 50 years of power flowing for the rest of the country to Washington. We want to provide more freedom and opportunity to people at the local level so they might have more control over the decisions on programs that effect their lives, their children, and their communities. 
This budget is a good deal because it recognizes the need to ease the tax burden on America's middle-class working parents, to give them a $500-per-child tax credit. This credit will help more than 50 million American children in nearly 30 million families. Under this plan a family with two children under age 17 would receive $1,000 in permanent tax relief. 
It's also a good deal for family farmers and small business men and women; for homeowners who will someday sell their home; and for all those who want to create incentives for economic growth and job creation. 
And, this budget is a good deal because while we are working toward 
 balance and tax relief, we continue to support programs which provide needed services to our citizens and we have been painstakingly careful to preserve a safety net for those in need. 
To provide health care for poor children who have none. To strengthen Medicare and provide more health care options for our seniors. To improve access to higher education and help parents and our young people pay for college. 
We support programs aimed at keeping Americans safe--in their home, schools, and neighborhoods--by funding needed crime programs.  
The question whether one generation has the right to bind another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts and morally bound to pay them ourselves. 
Mr. President, we might wonder where that came from. Was that just a statement here lately when our deficit and debt grew? No, it wasn't. It was made by Thomas Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson was a wise man. He wrote the Constitution. And he understood that if you pass on to the next generation, and the next generation--as he calls it, posterity--the debts of your generation, you take the chance that their life being reasonable, good, prosperous, and successful is limited. It limits their freedom. That is why we have been so worried about the debt, and the annual deficit that contributes to it. 
Today we will cast a vote of great significance to the future of America. It is the vote so many of us have said we wanted--a vote to finally balance the Federal budget. 
One of freedoms great leaders Winston Churchill told us the `price of greatness is responsibility.' We in government shoulder that responsibility. We actively seek it by running for public office. I believe the time has come to shoulder our responsibility and enact a balanced Federal budget. 
In doing so, we are casting a vote in support of America's future. You may serve here for years and never cast a more important vote. Because you now have a chance to vote to protect America, to strengthen it, and improve it. 
Today we can begin writing a new chapter in American history. That is why this is a big deal and that is why it is a good deal.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, tonight we are passing the Kennedy Center garage bill with an amendment authorizing the the Hispanic Cultural Center's Performing Arts Center. On a day when we pass the monumental spending bill and a tax cut I am pleased that we are also authorizing this cultural center. 
We could not be here today passing the cultural center bill if it were not that Senator Chafee was willing to be so helpful to me. He let me attach this amendment to the urgently needed legislation for the Kennedy Center. I want to thank Senator Chafee for his tremendous cooperation and legislative skills. I want to thank him for helping accomplish a very important project for the State of New Mexico. Next year marks the 400th anniversary of the first Hispanic settlement in the United States and it happened to be located in New Mexico. 
Many celebrations are planned around the State, but this cultural center will be a permanent addition and showcase. 
Mr. President, I am eager to present my colleagues with a wonderful plan to honor and perpetuate the Hispanic culture of America. Next year, 1998, is the 400th anniversary of Hispanic presence in New Mexico. In 1598, Juan de OnAE6ate conquered New Mexico and founded the second city of the United States, San Gabriel de los EspanAE6oles. This was the first permanent Spanish settlement in New Mexico. From New Mexico, Juan de OnAE6ate traveled across the desert to California where he founded San Francisco in 1605. 
On the occasion of the 400th anniversary of Spanish presence, New Mexico will be beginning a new era of Spanish pride and cooperation with other cultures. In New Mexico, we are very proud of our cultural relations between the Indian, Spanish, and Anglo people. It is now time to pay special tribute to the Spanish people of New Mexico and the United States. 
In preparing for the 400th anniversary celebrations, the State of New Mexico has invested over $17.7 million toward the establishment of phase I of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center. In addition, the city of Albuquerque has donated 10.9 acres and an historic 22,000 square foot building. Twelve acres of `bosque' land near the Rio Grande have also been donated by the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District. Private contributions are also helping to meet the Hispanic Cultural Center goals. 
I am asking my colleagues to match these New Mexico contributions with the funds to build the critical Hispanic Performing Arts Center at an estimated cost of $17.8 million. I believe the people of New Mexico have done a stellar job in committing their own resources for an art gallery, museum, restaurant, ballroom, amphitheater, research center, literary arts center, and other supportive components. 
To showcase the Hispanic culture in New Mexico for all Americans, the Hispanic Performing Arts Center is a vital component. Phase II plans include a 700-seat theater, a stage house, a 300-seat film/video center, a 150-seat black box theater, an art studio building, a culinary art building, and a research and literary arts building. The estimated cost of all phase II components is $26 million. By agreeing to fund the Hispanic Performing Arts Center, Congress will make a significant contribution toward the phase II plan. 
Not counting the land contributions, phase I and phase II design, construction, equipping, and furnishing is estimated to cost slightly more than $40 million. Major infrastructure components are included in both phases. These include an aqueduct, acequia, and pond from the Barelas Drain; parking; a plaza and courtyard, and landscaping. 
Phase I is now near the bidding stage. The Hispanic Performing Arts and Film Arts--the three theaters--are estimated to cost $17.8 million, with necessary equipment--construction: $15.9 million; fixed equipment: $1.9 million. The remaining components of phase II are estimated to cost $8 million. 
This multifaceted Hispanic Cultural Center is designed to showcase, share, archive, preserve, and enhance the rich Hispanic culture for local, regional, and national audiences. It is designed to be a tourist attraction as well as a great source of local pride. 
The Hispanic Cultural Center will be the southernmost facility on a cultural corridor that includes the Rio Grande Nature Center, the Albuquerque Aquarium, Botanical Gardens, and the Rio Grande Zoo. Historic Old Town Albuquerque is at the center of this cultural corridor. 
Antoine Predock of Albuquerque and Pedro Marquez of Santa Fe are the project architects. They have emphasized the inclusion of New Mexico architectural features such as adobe construction--like the existing historic building used as the administrative center--courtyards, portals, cottonwoods for shading, and the irrigation ditches known in New Mexico as `acequias'. The site is at the corner of Fourth Street and Bridge Boulevard in Southwest Albuquerque. 
Once built, the Hispanic Cultural Center will employ over 100 people. Tourism dollars are expected to increase in this part of Albuquerque, and new ancillary businesses are anticipated to complement and enhance the attractions in the historic Barelas Neighborhood of Albuquerque. 
The many forms of art, culture, research, performing arts, culinary arts, literature, and other activities are expected to add important cultural connections to the roots of the local and State Hispanic people. Completion of the Hispanic Performing Arts Center will be the major facility needed to showcase live and filmed Spanish cultural events. A whole new industry of preserving, showcasing, and enhancing pride in Spanish cultural roots is a vital anticipated benefit of this New Mexico-based Hispanic institution. 
Visitors are expected from California, New York, Florida, Texas, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and other States with large Hispanic populations. The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center and its active Hispanic Performing Arts Center are expected to become nationally known treasures of living Hispanic culture in America. 
I believe that the Federal funding for the Hispanic Performing Arts Center will be just the perfect contribution to a budding national treasure in its critical formative stages. I urge my colleagues to support the funding for the Hispanic Performing Arts Center in Albuquerque, NM, in honor of the 400th anniversary of Spanish culture, and in hopes of seeing the preservation and enhancement of this culture flourish into its 500th year.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, while we all mention many people who had a lot to do with our success, I believe if you were to ask the White House staff, all the way to the Chief of Staff, and ask all the staff that work for us here on both sides, who was most responsible for getting this job done, they would not say the Senator from New Mexico or the Senator from New Jersey or the distinguished Senator from Delaware. I think they would all say, `Let's be honest about it. Bill Hoagland, staff director for the Senate Budget Committee'--the man without whom we could not have done this. 
I just want the Record to reflect that. I am sure they would agree with me--those whom I have mentioned. It is just an obvious fact.

<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, thank you for recognizing me. 
I want to make an announcement for Senators. The bill--the very large bill that you have seen kind of appear on the desk--is available to those who have access to the Internet. You can view the bill through a link in the Budget Committee office. You can do it in your own offices on the Budget Committee home page, and the bill will be here no longer than a half-hour from now in sufficient numbers for those who want to view it in its entirety. 
As you know, the House is voting on the bill now--debating and voting on it. Then it will officially be transmitted to us. We have decided to start debating this so that we could all use this time during the day and not have to be here all night to get this done in a timely manner. 
Mr. President, I want to make a few observations. Obviously, Senator Lautenberg will have his, and then I would like very much to say to Senators that we are using time out of the 10 hours allowed. 
I understand from our majority leader that we intend to get this bill done, if possible, tonight; if not, clearly tomorrow morning. So that means we are going to spend a lot of time here on the floor between now and the time we quit tonight. 
So, if Senators have comments they would like to make, or if they have questions, I would particularly suggest if you have questions with reference to the Byrd rule--one of the rules that apply to these bills that do not apply anywhere else because it has to do with a special test for extraneousness--I wish they would talk with us, or talk with Senator Lautenberg's staff or our respective leadership offices about the Byrd rule violations that we are aware of and kind of documented now. We would all like to have a chance to work together on them. When it comes to that issue, I would like to make the following statement so that everybody understands. I am sure my friend, Senator Lautenberg, will concur. 
The White House has been involved from the very beginning in the preparation of this legislation. And from time to time both the Republicans and the White House have been involved with Democratic legislators. But let me make it very clear. This is a historic document in another procedural context because last evening the White House staff stayed until late in the evening--in fact, until the early morning hours--before they would sign off on this. They read every single word of legislative language. And, indeed, they read every word in the accompanying report language. Frankly, I have been around here a long time and working with administrations and the White House with legislation up here, and I think this may be the first time that has ever happened. 
I only say that because, obviously, it was hard to put this package together. In the process there are many wordsmiths, and there are many things that have to be put together in terms of language. But every bit of it, including those few instances where there are Byrd rule violations--and that sounds rather ominous, but it really means that we have a technical rule that says you ought not be legislating in this bill. You ought to be doing deficit reduction. And on some occasions it is hard to keep that altogether and not fall into something that is legislative in a 1,000-page document. 
So let me stop the process part, and just remind Senators who would like to speak today if you have some thoughts and things that you want the public to hear from the floor of the Senate, as soon as you can start calling us for time, we would be very, very glad to accommodate. And I think we can accommodate most people on a rather short notice because from my standpoint I have said an awful lot. I don't intend to be here on the floor saying a lot more. I am just trying to get this bill completed. 
But let me start by saying this morning that the headline in the Washington Post, which has not been very supportive of this, used five very nice words. They said, `This is a Big Deal.' Maybe they don't like the `big deal,' but it is nice that they recognize what all of us know--that this is a big deal for the American people. It carries out a bipartisan budget agreement that in itself was historic between the President and the leadership of Congress back in May. It is a big deal in this town when we could do what the American people asked us to do, and that is to work together to live by our commitments, to reduce spending and reduce taxes, and get our work done. 
So it is pretty obvious that this is a big deal. It balances the budget for the first time in 30 years. And I know there are many who will continue to be skeptical until that day arrives. Frankly, I am here saying I am a pretty good 
budgeteer. I understand all of these nuances about budgeting, and how the economy impacts on it--how inflation impacts, how the growth in the economy impacts. But absent a real major catastrophe, which nobody can plan for, this budget will be balanced. Frankly, it is because of a number of things. The economy is doing splendidly. That could change. But it looks like things are in place like they haven't been for a long, long time in terms of those things that make an economy go into recession or into an inflationary cycle. And we are not growing out of control. It is kind of a measure of good solid growth. 
So I think we are entitled to use conservative estimates for the next 5 years, which we have done, Mr. President. The economics in this bill's projections for the future are not overly optimistic. So when you add it up, for those who say we have some new programs and we spend some money, that is correct. For some there isn't enough by way of cutting the budget in this--cutting the expenditures. But I will get to that in a minute. 
Just remember, it is a Democratic President elected by the people and a Republican-controlled Congress with Democrats in the minority who had to put a package together that did something significant, or spend the next 3 1/2 years, in my opinion, doing nothing. We would have been around here fighting. We would have at every juncture on every bill have had stalemates. We might have even closed down Government again. 
So from my standpoint, if you look at 10 years--and I am not saying everything in these 10 years is locked in stone, but 5 years of it is--we reduce what we would have otherwise spent by about $1 trillion. This time we have not included in that estimate the savings that will come from debt service because as you reduce the amount that you borrow you take off of that baseline that had calculated in it interest. 
Yes, this balanced budget is a bipartisan budget agreement. We followed it as well as any differing groups could follow it. We put it together with a different group than had to implement it. So that is not easy, for they always second-guess us and claim they should have been in. I wish everybody in the Senate could have been in on the negotiating. I wish every chairman could have been. I guess as I wish it I speak the truth--that had they we wouldn't be here. That is the reality of trying to do this kind of thing. 
But we said in that agreement that we were going to spend $24 billion. We did agree to provide $24 billion in new spending for children's health programs for insurance. We also agreed to make changes in last year's welfare reform, which results in some additional national spending. 
I want to correct myself. The bipartisan agreement said $16 billion in new spending for child health care coverage. The U.S. Senate voted in $24 billion, and the Senate version prevailed in the final outcome of negotiations. 
I note on the floor of the Senate now, along with Senator Lautenberg, is the distinguished Senator from Delaware, Senator Bill Roth. 
Let me make sure that everybody understands that his chairmanship and his committee made this the big deal that it is. I say to the Senator, I just commented that finally the Washington Post, after being against this budget, at least recognized one thing. They said, `It Is a Big Deal.' And I am saying there would have been no big deal without the Senator from Delaware and the marvelous bipartisan committee that he has. I thank him right here publicly for that. 
Let me just go on through. After Senator Lautenberg speaks, our distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, which had jurisdiction over about 85 percent of this bill, wants to speak. I want to yield quickly. 
I want to say, however, that Republicans for a long time said we ought to balance the budget. It has now become everybody's cry. The President wants it. Many Democrats want it. But I take a great deal of pride in behalf of Republicans in my capacity as chairman and ranking member of this Budget Committee. 
I have been trying to get there for a long time. And I think we have done a great job as Republican leaders in pushing this. That is not trying to detract from those who have joined us, including the President of late. We also wanted some tax cuts. 
Many of us thought American families were in desperate need of some help--especially middle-income American families with kids. We have done that. Again, even though most of that originally started on our side of the aisle, I don't tend to, nor do I want to, denigrate the fact that it has broad support on the other side, and the President of the United States is supportive of it. 
The capital gains differential has been part of what Republicans thought we should have in this Tax Code for decades. As a matter of fact, it is very interesting that we got a capital gains differential in this bill. 
We joined the industrial nations of the world with capitalistic societies that have moved that way already, and I think that bodes well for the future. 
Everybody knows the other provisions that my friend, the chairman, will speak to. But I just wanted to make the point, for those who seem from time to time to give up on causes and to be for them for a few years and say we can't get them done, I believe Republicans ought to be proud of the fact that we have stood pretty fast for those issues, the ones I just described, and some others, and most of them are coming true here. 
That is not to say some issues that the Democratic Party and this President have pushed very hard for are not in this bill, also. I am sure, knowing my friend, Senator Lautenberg, he will remind us--and that is what he ought to do. And those are some things I want, too. I am not running around apologetic about trying to cover children that do not have health insurance. I am not sure we know how to do it quite right yet, I say to the occupant of the chair, who shares that concern with me, but I think we have to get started, and we have done that. 
One last thing is we all know the Medicare Program for the seniors of America--39 million of them almost right now--we know that program is, for many of them, something they build their confidence on as they get older and as some of them get sick, and as they get sick, they know they have this great hospitalization program. Now, there is no one who ought to be anything but proud of the fact that we have taken a system that is falling apart financially, and we fixed it for 10 years. It probably would have gone bankrupt in 2, maybe 2 1/2 years, so we fixed it for 10 years. 
Now, I am kind of tempted to say that is a big deal. But I think it is. Now, it is not fixed permanently. It still continues to have big problems out there in 15 years, 20 years, but, frankly, I am not apologizing that a budget resolution and essentially this plan did not solve that. Actually, I do not believe it could have. I believe it is such a big issue in and of itself that it will be solved only when a bipartisan national commission, which is provided for in this bill, goes out into America and tells everybody the problems and comes up with some solutions that are bipartisan that Presidents and Congress will support. We started that here. 
But I believe in the meantime we had to make that program more efficient. We have done that. In fact, we made it $115 billion more efficient by changing the rules of the game. In the meantime, we are trying to give seniors the best of health care at the most reasonable prices, putting some competition into the program, and that is there, alive and kicking and strongly voicing itself in this bill--competition. 
So there are HMO's, there are professional provider organizations, there are private fee-for-service programs, and there are PSO's. It also has a demonstration program, a medical savings account of 390,000 beneficiaries. 
Now, when you put all that together, along with a new $4 billion preventive program that I am not going to discuss in detail, we have done fairly well by the people who pay for Medicare, the working people, and pretty well by the seniors. You package this all together--a balanced budget, which means we are not going to have our children paying our bills too much longer. That is what a deficit and a debt are. It is asking our kids and our grandkids to pay our bills. A balance says we are not going to do that anymore. 
Now, it is a long time coming, and we owe a lot of money, so we cannot stand up and say to our kids they are not going to pay some of our bills, because the debt is so big we cannot get rid of it. But at least we can stop it. So that was No. 1. 
No. 2 was fix Medicare, and I have described it. 
No. 3 was to make sure that we had a tax bill that was fair to the American people. Frankly, after all the bickering on the edges--and that is what it all was, on the edges. All this argument about how many children are covered and how far down do you go were really on the edges, small, small things, small numbers. The people that need tax cuts and tax breaks are the American people earning between $25,000 and $30,000 and $110,000. They are the middle-income Americans, two jobholders, two professionals, two people working, and they are paying the taxes, they are following the rules, and they haven't had anything from their Government saying we would like to make it a little easier for you--until this bill. 
Now, they have three very significant new things they can look to. It isn't like we are giving them a present. It is saying to them, keep some of your own money and let Government grow less and let you make your decisions on what you do for your children rather than have us build a bigger and bigger Department of Education. Those are the kinds of tradeoffs that are going to occur and are starting to occur, although, when it comes to education, this bill is strong on college education, strong as anything you can have. When it comes to the new programs appropriations, we have been very generous. We have been very generous to the education programs that our country has. 
I am not sure before we vote on this that I will have 
another chance to thank everyone, so I just wish to thank Senator Lautenberg, and I thank our distinguished Republican leader--he did a great job--Senator Roth, and all the other chairmen, our House counterparts, including Representative Kasich. 
But I want to make one statement on the floor. It might seem it ought to be done on the House floor, but I want to make it here, and I think my friend, Senator Roth, would concur. The Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, in negotiations from the beginning until the end, was absolutely a fantastic leader. I have to say to those who doubt, because he was under a lot of pressures, I did not notice for a minute that had anything to do with his single-mindedness, his tremendous intellect and the way he could put things back together and get us moving in the direction of getting things done. So my compliments to the Republican leadership in both Houses from my side, and obviously we had great support from Democrats. 
At this point I am going to yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. I note the presence of Senator Moynihan, and I had not said anything about him in his absence. I would like now to say there are many points, as you look at the last 7 1/2 months, when you would say this is critical, this is where it might end. And I believe the thing that gave us momentum to get it done was the Finance Committee's bipartisan addressing of most of the issues in this bill. 
Now, I am sure the Senator from New York didn't get everything he wants, but I believe it was one of the big turning points when the Senator joined with Senator Roth and between the two of them had such a large cadre of Senators from both sides supporting some very, very powerful things, and I thank the Senator personally for that.

Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, first let me make an observation, perhaps not as eloquently. I believe the Senator from New Mexico could, someplace or another in the United States, make a very similar speech. I think most of what you talked about I agree with. But I would like to make sure that everybody knows just how much you can do in a budget resolution and in a bill that is forced by a budget resolution and how difficult it is to try to do more than fits the bill. I want to say to the American people that while I agree with your statement wholeheartedly that we have to do much more with the entitlements--and let's be very precise, the one that is really, really in need of a long-term fix is Medicare--not because anybody wants to deny anyone anything, but the stark fact is that it, by itself, can break this country in another 15, 20 years all by itself. 
Frankly, I never believed that we could fix Medicare in its totality in a budget resolution and a bill that was thrust by a budget resolution. Senator Gramm is chairman of the Subcommittee on Health. I think he would agree with me that, while we probably could have done better, and should have, on the three items that would have helped, we can't force the total change of Medicare in a bill like this under a budget resolution format. First of all, a budget resolution is only applicable for 5 years. You are permitted to project for 10. I assume when Senator Gramm starts that reform, he is going to start beyond 10 in terms of the real dollar impact, because that is when it is in trouble. It is not in trouble in the next 5 years. One might have a different mix as to how you get it to a state of solvency. 
Senator, I would like you to know I never thought that we could do much more in Medicare. But I think the three changes you made in the Finance Committee, with your support, if we could have held them, it would have been a good first step. I still believe the spirit of getting this done may get us, within the next 2 or 3 years, to facing the issues for major, permanent reform of the entitlement programs. I am hopeful you are not giving up because we can't do it in this budget bill, because it is a very, very big issue that requires much debate in the 
Senate. I don't know exactly how that debate is going to be framed, but I don't think it is going to be framed in a reconciliation bill with no debate to speak of and no amendments to speak of. That is just the U.S. Senate's way of doing things. I thank you for yielding. Maybe you can comment on that.

Mr. DOMENICI. I must leave the floor. I will tell the Senator that I look forward to reading the Senator's remarks. I think the Senator knows that I mean that. I believe what he has outlined is so typical. I mean the Senator is going to state the good things, things that are not as good as they could be, and he is going to lay them out with clarity. I say thank you for the generous remarks which the Senator made about me. But I also want to say I reciprocate. 
It doesn't matter in the U.S. Senate whether you agree with another Senator half the time, all the time, or none of the time. What is important is that you respect them. That is all we can get in this place--is that somebody respects what we are doing. I want to tell the Senator from Texas, whether it is his way and I am not right enough, or whether it is my way and he is wrong too often, it doesn't matter. You can't be in the Senate and serve with Phil Gramm of Texas without respecting him. The Senator has a great mind, and he has learned to apply it to our problems in a way that really means something to a lot of us. It strikes our minds, and makes us think. I don't think the Senator from Texas can expect to do more, and he wins plenty of them because of the clarity and the philosophy, and the way he digs into the issues. 
There are many things that we are experimenting with in this bill that may not work, and the Senator is going to certainly find them and tell us why. And they have an awful lot to do with the child health care package. The Senator is going to say something about that. And I am not trying to preempt him because I know there are problems there. I don't believe the people who say if it had gone straight under Medicaid that it would have covered many, many more. I don't believe that at all. The Medicaid Program that has not worked well in the past that we have been struggling to fix ought not be mimicked. It ought to be changed. And if you can, you ought to do the same thing in a different way. That is the theory of the Senator from Texas, and he has said that from the beginning. We are trying. But we are not there yet, and many other things. 
I want to tell you, we struggled mightily on the welfare side, on the Fair Employment Labor Standards Act, and whether the myriad of laws should apply to trainees. And the Senator is going to speak about that. But I want to tell him, I couldn't win. I couldn't get it done. That is all there is to it. Everyone now knows, including the White House--and they will admit it--that the welfare program will not work in terms of the people that most need the training without some relief from some of the laws that apply across the board to people permanently employed in companies that make enough money to get by and have to pay them. And there is no doubt that the issue has been framed in a false way. 
It is not a minimum wage issue. We have already agreed to the minimum wage. I heard the President yesterday speak of minimum wage again. That is not the issue. The issue is the rules that are going to govern a nonprofit organization that we asked to train 10 people. Isn't that right? They are going to say, `Why should we do that?' Every law on the books governs these trainees, and we didn't even pick them. You picked them for us. 
So I am aware of those and many others. But I think the Senator is going to also say that there are some good things in this bill. 
I thank the Senator very much for yielding.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Kennedy has been waiting. I am only going to take a minute, Senator. 
I did not get to hear Senator Gramm's entire remarks. I pledged to him before that I would read them in their entirety, and I will. But let me make just a couple of quick observations. 
I think everybody knows--my good friend from Texas said--you can't get a balanced budget overnight. You do buy it on the installment plan. When you buy it on an installment plan that is 3 years, 5 years, or 10 years, you have to make some assumptions. I think, distinguished economist that he is, he would know that. 
The Senate should know we did not use optimistic economic assumptions. In fact, we used CBO's very modest economic assumptions. There is no way we could provide an assumption, outright, that, if we have a serious recession, that we provided for it. But CBO's economic assumptions versus others, more optimistic, at least build into their model that, indeed, there could be a slowdown and, thus, they take something off the growth edge. So I don't think we have an unduly high one. 
Senator, I am agreeing with you that unless we seek to look 
at the new programs we created, in terms of are they performing as we expected, we won't make it. And, second, I am not terribly interested in being the enforcer on appropriations caps--which are very strenuous after 1998. In fact, I will give you the number. The baseline for discretionary, if we did nothing, is $2.943 trillion. Under this bill it is $139 billion less, which means for a period of time it is going to grow very little, in fact five-tenths of 1 percent. 
But I am not going to run around being the enforcer if entitlements are going wild again. You might, and I would respect you for it. But, essentially, we cannot balance the budget on the appropriations accounts. We have to make sure we control the entitlements and I think you agree with that. You are not agreeing with me that we should not worry about appropriations. I would worry less than you about correct appropriations. But what the Senator has said about making sure we get there, and making sure we do some things to assure that this commitment and this path is, indeed, realized--which is what you are saying, I believe--I think that's correct. 
I think--so long as everybody leaves knowing that, in terms of making sure we don't let things within this slip and say, `Oh, well, $10 billion didn't matter, we thought it was that but we are wrong,' and just pass those tens of billions by--we will get there. And that's not an exceptional thing to expect of a group which is out claiming a balancing budget. Would you agree? We are out there claiming it. We ought to be willing to say we will do what's necessary. And I think if we do what's here that's enough. We don't have to do a lot more over the next 5 years, but if we are going to do less, it is not going to be enough and we are all going to be ashamed. 
I thank the Senator for those observations which prompted me to say this because I believe that's absolutely true. I yield the floor and I yield to Senator Kennedy.

Mr. DOMENICI. I surmise the distinguished Senator from West Virginia is going to stand up and agree with what has been said. I just ask him if he would consider seriously, with me, what the miner protection fund looks like. It is exactly like this, and it is on budget. The Federal Government orders mining companies to pay into a fund, but the Federal Government does not disburse the money. That is your bill. You are famous for it, Senator. That is on budget. It has been on budget from the beginning. 
Now, let's look at this. It's exactly the same. We order companies to pay into this fund so that we can get universal service out of the fund. Who disburses the fund? The companies; not the Government. That resonates very well with a mining bill, miners' protection, the same way it has been on budget for 4 years. Frankly, it doesn't matter to this Senator. 
But the point of it is, we are bound by an interpretation that essentially was this. The reason I didn't cite this is because it never became law. But you might recall, I say to the Senator, when we had the universal health plan from the White House, noted by some as the Hillary health plan, the distinguished chairman, then, of the Congressional Budget Office--not this one; one that you-all had appointed from the other side--ruled one morning, to the amazement of everyone, that the bill had a tax in it because the procedure was that we were ordering money to be paid by somebody, and then, in the various States, we would disburse the money. The Federal Government was not disbursing the money. 
So the White House thought they would have a bill that was without taxation in it. And what did he rule? He ruled that if the Government orders payment of money into a fund, then the 
fund is on budget, even if the Government doesn't control the fund. 
I know my friend in the chair does not agree. I might not agree. But I am merely explaining what the facts are. I understand that you would like to make a point of order. I will be here and we can talk a little more about it, Senator. I do believe we have just reason to ask the Senate not to impose that point of order under the circumstances surrounding it, but I understand you, and I will speak to that later. 
I yield the floor at this point.

Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, when we first proposed this, we could find no way to do this without doing exactly what you said. But the White House came along, and they are a little more ingenious than are we. They offered us a proposal that is now in this bill. It does not change universal service, nor does it use that fund in any way other than what it was originally intended to do. All we have is, those who were paying into it get a 1-year reprieve, to the tune of $3 billion. Then they pay it in the next year. I think they are delighted. They get a reprieve because we lend them the money for the year and everything is exactly as you want it, and in the following year the companies that would have been paying it pay into it the next year. That happens to give us the $3 billion credit on the budget. That was dreamed up by the White House. We said, `It's extremely ingenious and it fits all the tests,' and that is why we are here. 
Thank you for yielding.

Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to ask the Senators, we have now been on this bill since 12 o'clock, which has been for 5 hours, 25 minutes, all of which I believe is counted against the 10 hours. I very much wonder what Senators would like to do with reference to the bill. 
Are there more Senators who would like to speak? The bill is not subject to amendment. There is a list of Byrd rule violations that is around. It is not hidden. I just am wondering what the pleasure of the Members is. I think that most of the Byrd rule violations have been clearly worked by Democrats and Republicans and are consistent with the bill and should be waived. But we cannot do that without conferring with a number of Senators, including the distinguished Senator Byrd, in due course. 
There is a conference going on, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.

First, while Senator Stevens is on the floor, he has made some very good points, and, certainly, the distinguish Senators on the Democrat side have made some good points. The Senator from New Mexico wants to do nothing in this budget bill that will adversely affect our movement toward universal service. There is no intention in this budget reconciliation bill, which I ended up agreeing to--and I have already explained why--but there is nothing in it that is going to deny the march toward universal service that is prescribed and was your thoughtful, visionary idea, Senator Stevens. I just ask you, so we have the record straight, is that your interpretation, also?

Frankly, there are no amendments in order, and, clearly, the Senator from New Mexico will stay here if there are other speeches or other comments that people want to make.

I want to tell the Senate, and anybody interested, if not for Charles Grassley, the Senator who has been speaking, we would not have gotten that provision. That is a fair provision because those parts of America--your State, my State, and others--that have done a good job of keeping costs way down, can't make it if we build the program on keeping them down while the very expensive States do not come down. And this is a formula we did not get exactly what we wanted, but thanks to your efforts we came very close to something that you can say is fair and much better for your people.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say to my friend, Senator Craig, perhaps if we had adopted what he has been recommending for many years--a constitutional amendment to balance the budget--we wouldn't be here with the kind of circumstances that confront us. 
I don't think the Senator from Idaho has to stand up here, or with his people, and talk about where he stands in terms of overspending by our National Government because his record is excellent in that regard. I think his remarks today indicate that, when you have a Democrat President, a Republican Congress, and a strong Democratic minority in both Houses, you can't get everything that you want. As a matter of fact, the Democrats differ from their President, and the President differs from us. 
What we have done, I think, is borderline on being a miracle. The only thing that keeps me from saying that is that I don't know whether the product deserves being labeled a miracle. But in terms of getting it put together, coming here today and getting it finished and voted on tomorrow--I am sure we are going to get in excess of 75 votes tomorrow--that is pretty good. 
As I said this morning when I opened up, even the Washington Post finally said, `That Is a Big Deal.' I think it is. 
I am very glad that the Senator from Idaho is going to support it and that he has been helping us as much as he has. I thank him for that.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for 1986. 
This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget through July 28, 1997. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of the 1997 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. Res. 178), show that current level spending is above the budget resolution by $9.5 billion in budget authority and by $12.9 billion in outlays. Current level is $20.5 billion above the revenue floor in 1997 and $101.9 billion above the revenue floor over the 5 years 1997-2001. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $219.9 billion, $7.4 billion below the maximum deficit amount for 1997 of $227.3 billion. 
Since my last report, dated June 23, 1997, there has been no action that has changed the current level of budget authority, outlays, or revenues.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. 
I congratulate the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Shelby, for bringing his first transportation appropriations bill to the full Senate. I commend the chairman for bringing the Senate a balanced bill. 
As all Members know, transportation spending was a priority area within the bipartisan budget agreement. With passage of this bill, we begin to increase funding for our Nation's infrastructure as we promised during negotiations on the balanced budget agreement. 
The Senate-reported bill provides $12.6 billion budget authority [BA] and $13.2 billion in new outlays to fund the programs of the Department of Transportation, including Federal-aid highways, mass transit, aviation activities, the U.S. Coast Guard, and transportation safety agencies. 
When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other adjustments are taken into account, the bill totals $12.7 billion in budget authority and $37.6 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998. 
The reported bill is $0.2 billion in budget authority and $3 million in outlays below the subcommittee's section 602(b) allocation. 
This spending is $0.5 billion in budget authority below the President's fiscal year 1998 budget request for the subcommittee, and $0.15 billion in outlays above the president's request. 
The Senate-reported bill is $0.6 billion in discretionary BA and $0.2 billion in outlays below the House version of the bill. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the Budget Committee scoring on this bill be inserted in to the Record. 
I support the bill and urge its adoption.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am not sure, if I were to ask every Senator to take a guess, anyone would come anywhere close to answering this question correctly. 
I ask, how many dollars do you think we spent last year paying for defense lawyers for criminals in the Federal court who claim they don't have enough money to defend themselves? 
We have an obligation. The court has interpreted our Constitution to say they must have counsel, so I am not here complaining. But I don't think anyone--I see my friend from Iowa looking at me--would guess $308 million, and growing tremendously, taxpayers' dollars to defend criminals in the Federal court system. 
I am not asking in this amendment that we review that process, although I kind of cry out to any committee that has jurisdiction and ask them to take a look. All I am doing in this amendment is changing the law slightly with reference to letting the taxpayer know how much we are paying criminal defense lawyers. All this amendment does is say when a payment is made to a criminal defense lawyer, a form has to be filed that indicates that payment. There is no violation of the sixth amendment because there are no details. We are not going to, in this statement, reveal the secret strategy of the defense counsel or their latest deposition theory. We are just saying, reveal the dollar amount so the American people know, through public sources, how much we are paying. 
Frankly, if I had a little more time, I would state some of the fees that we finally have ascertained, and I think many would say, `Are you kidding?' I will just give you three that we know of. 
Mr. President, what would you say if I told you that from the beginning of fiscal year 1996 through January 1997, $472,841 was paid to a lawyer to defend a person accused of a crime so heinous that the United States Attorney in the Northern District of New York is pursuing the death penalty? Who paid for this lawyer--the American taxpayer. 
What would you say if I told you that $470,968 was paid to a lawyer to defend a person accused of a crime so reprehensible that, there too, the United States Attorney in the Southern District of Florida is also pursuing the death penalty? Who paid for this lawyer--the American taxpayer. 
What would you say if I told you that during the same period, for the same purpose, $443,683 was paid to another attorney to defend a person accused of a crime so villainous that the United States Attorney in the Northern District of New York is pursuing the death penalty? Who paid for this lawyer--the American taxpayer. 
Now, Mr. President, what would you say if I told you that some of these cases have been ongoing for three or more years and that total fees in some instances will be more than $1 million in an individual case? That's $1 million to pay criminal lawyers to defend people accused of the most vicious types of murders often which are of the greatest interest to the communities in which they were committed. 
At minimum, Mr. President, this Senator would say that we are spending a great deal of money on criminal defense lawyers and the American taxpayer ought to have timely access to the information that will tell them who is spending their money, and how it is being spent. That is why today I am introducing the `Disclosure of Court Appointed Attorney's Fees and Taxpayer Right to Know Act of 1997'. 
Under current law, the maximum amount payable for representation before the United States Magistrate or the District Court, or both, is limited to $3,500 for each lawyer in a case in which one or more felonies are charged and $125 per hour per lawyer in death penalty cases. Many Senators might ask, if that is so, why are these exorbitant amounts being paid in the particular cases you mention? I say to my colleagues the reason this happens is because under current law the maximum amounts established by statute may be waived whenever the judge certifies that the amount of the excess payment is necessary to provide `fair compensation' and the payment is approved by the Chief Judge on the circuit. In addition, whatever is considered `fair compensation' at the $125 per hour per lawyer rate may also be approved at the Judge's discretion. 
Mr. President, the American taxpayer has a legitimate interest in knowing what is being provided as `fair compensation' to defend individuals charged with these dastardly crimes in our federal court system. Especially when certain persons the American taxpayer is paying for mock the American Justice System. A recent Nightline episode reported that one of the people the American taxpayer is shelling out their hard earned money to defend urinated in open court, in front of the Judge, to demonstrate his feelings about the judge and the American judicial system. 
I want to be very clear about what exactly my bill would accomplish. The question of whether these enormous fees should be paid for these criminal lawyers is not, I repeat, is not a focus of my bill. In keeping with my strongly held belief that the American taxpayer has a legitimate interest in having timely access to this information, my bill simply requires that at the time the court approves the payments for these services, that the payments be publicly disclosed. Many Senators are probably saying right now that this sounds like a very reasonable request, and I think it is, but the problem is that often times these payments are not disclosed until long after the trial has been completed, and in some cases they may not be disclosed at all if the remains are sealed by the Judge. How much criminal defense lawyers are being paid should not be a secret. There is a way in which we can protect the alleged criminal's sixth amendment rights and still honor the American taxpayer's right to know. Mr. President, that is what my bill does. 
Current law basically leaves the question of when and whether court appointed attorneys' fees should be disclosed at the discretion of the Judge in which the particular case is being tried. My bill would take some of that discretion away and require that disclosure occur once the payment has been approved. 
My bill continues to protect the defendant's sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel, the defendant's attorney client privilege, the work product immunity of defendant's counsel, the safety of any witness, and any other interest that justice may require by providing notice to defense counsel that this information will be released, and allowing defense counsel, or the court on its own, to redact any information contained on the payment voucher that might compromise any of the aforementioned interests. That means that the criminal lawyer can ask the Judge to take his big black marker and black-out any information that might compromise these precious Sixth Amendment rights, or the Judge can make this decision on his own. In any case, the Judge will let the criminal lawyer know that this information will be released and the criminal lawyer will have the opportunity to request the Judge black-out any compromising information from the payment voucher. 
How would this occur? Under current law, criminal lawyers must fill out Criminal Justice Act payment vouchers in order to receive payment for services rendered. Mr. President, I have brought two charts to the floor to provide Senators with an example of what these payment vouchers look like so that they can get an understanding of what my bill would accomplish. These two payment vouchers are the standard vouchers used in the typical felony and death penalty cases prosecuted in the federal district courts. As you can see Mr. President, the information on these payment vouchers describes in barebones fashion the nature of the work performed and the amount that is paid for each category of service. 
My bill says that once the Judge approves these payment vouchers that they be publicly disclosed. That means that anyone can walk down to the federal district court where the case is being tried and ask the clerk of the court for copies of the relevant CJA payment vouchers. It's that simple. Nothing more. Nothing less. 
Before the court releases this information it will provide notice to defense counsel that the information will be released, and either the criminal lawyer, or the Judge on his/her own, may black-out any of the barebones information on the payment voucher that might compromise the alleged criminal's precious sixth amendment rights. 
Mr. President, I believe that my bill is a modest step toward assuring that the American taxpayer have timely access to this information. In addition to these CJA payment vouchers, criminal lawyers must also supply the court with detailed time sheets that recount with extreme particularity the nature of the work performed. These detailed time sheets break down the work performed by the criminal lawyer to the minute. They name each and every person that was interviewed, each and every phone call that was made, the subjects that were discussed and the days and the times they took place. They go into intimate detail about what was done to prepare briefs, conduct investigations, and prepare for trial. 
Mr. President, clearly if this information were subject to public disclosure the alleged criminal's sixth amendment rights might be compromised. My bill does not seek to make this sensitive information subject to public disclosure, but rather continues to leave it to the Judge to determine if and when it should be released. In this way, my bill recognizes and preserves the delicate balance between the American taxpayers' right to know how their money is being spent, and the alleged criminal's right to a fair trial. 
I believe we should take every reasonable step to protect any disclosure that might compromise the alleged criminal's sixth amendment rights. My bill does this by providing notice to defense counsel of the release of the information, and providing the Judge with the authority to black-out any of the barebones information contained on the payment voucher if it might compromise any of the aforementioned interests. I believe it is reasonable and fair, and I hope I will have my colleagues' support. 
I am very pleased the Senate will accept this. I hope the House does. I believe they will. Because I think the public has a right to know. As a matter of fact, I think we have a right to know, case by case, payment by payment, how much is being paid by the taxpayer to defend criminals in the Federal court. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1022, the Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. The Senate bill provides $31.6 billion in budget authority and $21.2 billion in new outlays to operate the programs of the Department of Commerce, Department of Justice, Department of State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies for fiscal year 1998. When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the bill totals $31.6 billion in budget authority and $29.4 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998. The subcommittee is within its revised section 602(b) allocation for budget authority and outlays. 
Mr. President, I commend the distinguished subcommittee chairman, Senator Gregg, for bringing this bill to the floor. It is not easy to balance the competing program requirements that are funded in this bill. I thank the chairman for the consideration he gave to issues I brought before the subcommittee, and his extra effort to address the items in the bipartisan balanced budget agreement. It has been a pleasure to serve on the subcommittee.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President. On June 12, I introduced in behalf of myself and Senator Bond, along with 24 other cosponsors, a bill to strengthen the Small Business Administration's [SBA] women's business centers program. This bill, S. 888, the `Women's Business Centers Act of 1997,' reflects our commitment for a stronger and more dynamic program for women-owned businesses. 
I am pleased that the Small Business Committee has included the text of this bill into its 3-year reauthorization of the Small Business Act. It is anticipated that this reauthorization bill will be considered by the Senate within the next few months. The language in the reauthorization bill, as stated in the `Women's Business Centers Act of 1997,' increases the annual funding authorization for the women's business centers to $8 million from the present level of $4 million, authorizes the centers to receive funding for 5 years rather than the present 3 years, changes the matching Federal to non-Federal funding formula, and enables organizations receiving funds at the date of enactment to extend their program from 3 to 5 years. 
Since the Small Business Committee's reauthorization bill has not yet been considered by the Senate, the additional funds for the women's business centers' program are not included in S. 1022. I do want, however, to thank Senator Gregg, Chairman of the Commerce, State, Justice, and Judiciary Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, for providing full funding of the authorized $4 million for 1998. This is most appreciated by all of us who support the women's business centers' activities, and it is especially important since the House has requested $1 million less for this program. 
It will be most beneficial if the Small Business reauthorization bill is considered and passed in the Senate and House prior to conference on this appropriations measure. I draw my colleagues' attention to this issue because absent the higher authorized funds of $8 million for the women's centers' program, it means in 1998 we may not be able to achieve the expansion of this program as we intended. There will be insufficient funds to expand the program into States who presently do not have women's centers and existing 
programs cannot extend their programs from 3 to 5 years. This is a serious problem because we are well aware of the positive benefits of the women's business centers in helping women entrepreneurs, the fastest growing group of new small businesses in the United States. These business centers are able to leverage public and private resources to help their clients develop new businesses or expand existing ones, and their services are absolutely essential for the successful and continued growth of this sector of our economy. 
I am also concerned that because there are insufficient funds to expand the women's business centers' program, existing centers will not be able to extend their activities from the present 3-year grant program to a 5-year schedule. These existing centers in approximately 29 States have proven track records of support to women entrepreneurs. The Office of Women's Business Ownership within the SBA will continue its administration of the overall program and will be able to develop a few new sites in States that do not have centers; however, the office is not yet authorized to extend funding an additional 2 years for existing sites. This is most regrettable because these successful existing centers desperately need these small amounts of funds to continue their professional assistance to their women-owned business clients. 
Mr. President, I want to once again go on record that I am dissatisfied that the SBA has not given appropriate attention to the women's business program. It has failed to provide sufficient professional personnel to the Office of Women's Business Ownership in order to carry out its important tasks. It has repeatedly requested less funding than authorized for the program despite the fact that this is one of the most successful of all SBA programs. To my knowledge, it has never come to Congress and requested additional monies for the program; instead, it has expected Congress to do SBA's work in trumpeting the successes of this small but vital program. I find it most discouraging that while we in Congress are well aware of the outstanding work of the women's business centers--and the administration's repeatedly publicized the success stories last year--there appears to be minimal support within SBA for expanding the work of this very small program. This is a loss to the agency, and it is most assuredly a loss to countless thousands of women entrepreneurs, let alone a loss to our overall national economy. 
We must keep in mind that the funds in this bill for the women's business centers reflect those appropriated in 1997, and, therefore, the expansion of this program as envisioned in S. 888, the `Women's Business Centers Act of 1997' and the reauthorization of the Small Business Act, may be delayed. As evidenced by cosponsorship of S. 888, a fourth of the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, supports expansion of the women's business centers' program. We need to be aware of the consequences of this and do everything we possibly can to provide the support this critical and highly successful program needs in the future. Thank you.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Department of Agriculture and Related Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. 
The Senate-reported bill provides $50.0 billion in new budget authority [BA] and $41.6 billion in new outlays to fund most of the programs of the Department of Agriculture and other related agencies. All of the funding in this bill is nondefense spending. This subcommittee received no allocation under the Crime Reduction Trust Fund. 
When outlays for prior-year appropriations and other adjustments are taken into account, the Senate-reported bill totals $48.8 billion in BA and $49.2 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998. Including mandatory savings, the subcommittee is at its 602(b) allocation in BA and slightly below its 602(b) allocation in outlays. 
The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee 602(b) allocation totals $48.8 billion in budget authority [BA] and $49.4 billion in outlays. Within this amount, $13.8 billion in BA and $14.2 billion in outlays is for nondefense discretionary spending. 
For discretionary spending in the bill, and counting--scoring--all the mandatory savings in the bill, the Senate-reported bill is at the subcommittee's 602(b) allocation in BA and $128 million below the allocation in outlays. It is $281 million in BA and $324 million in outlays below the President's budget request for these programs. 
I recognize the difficulty of bringing this bill to the floor under its 602(b) allocation. I appreciate the committee's support for a number of ongoing projects and programs important to my home State of New Mexico as it has worked to keep this bill within its budget allocation.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending military construction appropriations bill provides $9.183 billion in new budget authority and $3.064 in new outlays for military construction and family housing programs for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1998. 
When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the outlays for the 1998 program total $9.902 billion. 
This legislation provides for construction by the Department of Defense for U.S. military facilities throughout the world, and it provides for family housing for the active forces of each of the U.S. military services. Accordingly, it provides for important readiness and quality of life programs for our service men and women. 
The bill falls within the revised section 602(b) allocation for the Military Construction Subcommittee. I commend the distinguished subcommittee chairman, the Senator from Montana, for bringing this bill to the floor within the subcommittee's revised allocation. 
The bill provides important increases over the President's request for 1998, and I urge the adoption of the conference report.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1034, the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and independent agencies appropriations bill for 1998. 
This bill provides new budget authority of $91.5 billion and new outlays of $52.6 billion to finance the programs of the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, and other independent agencies. 
I congratulate the chairman and ranking member for producing a bill that, with adoption of the manager's amendment, is within the subcommittee's revised 602(b) allocation. This is one of the most difficult bills to manage with its varied programs and challenging allocation, but I think the bill meets most of the demands made of it while staying under budget and is a strong candidate for enactment, so I commend my friend the chairman for his efforts and leadership. 
When outlays from prior-year budget authority [BA] and other adjustments are taken into account, the bill totals $90.7 billion in BA and $99.8 billion in outlays. The total bill is at the Senate subcommittee's 602(b) nondefense allocation for budget authority and outlays. The subcommittee is also under its defense allocation by $1 million in BA.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the New Mexico Commercial Zone Act of 1997. This legislation will establish a much needed zone in New Mexico to facilitate the trade and transportation of raw materials and merchandise across our border with Mexico. 
Mr. President, now that America is witnessing the economic benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] and trade with Mexico is growing at a record pace, it has become clear to New Mexico that we must establish a commercial zone to take full advantage of the economic possibilities available to border States. 
Mr. President, this legislation has the support of New Mexico's Governor, Gary Johnson, the State Economic Development Department, the New Mexico Border Authority, the United States-Mexico Chamber of Commerce, the New Mexico food processing industry, the New Mexico Motor Carriers Association, and the Cities of Las Cruces and Deming. 
In the past, commercial zones were created by the Interstate Commerce Commission in numerous States to facilitate local border trade and transportation activities. They also serve to control movement and uphold American vehicle safety requirements for foreign vehicles operating within the United States. 
It is within the limits of these zones that commercial vehicles of either Mexican or Canadian registry are authorized to deliver products from their country to a United States distribution point or warehousing facility. In addition to permitting these vehicles to pick up loads of products which are destined for export into their respective countries. 
Mr. President, commercial zones similar to the one I propose today have been established in the States of: New York, South Carolina, West Virginia, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Washington, Illinois, Colorado, Kentucky, Minnesota, California, Texas, Arizona, and the District of Columbia. 
Since the passage of NAFTA, these zones have been very important to border States because they are serving as the transition boundaries for all Mexican commercial traffic. 
Mr. President, it is clear that if we do not establish a commercial zone in New Mexico, my State will remain at a tremendous disadvantage to other border States. We will continue to be one step behind in attracting NAFTA-related businesses and building upon our current trade relationship with Mexico. 
Despite the fact that New Mexico does not yet have a commercial zone, we are taking steps to increase trade with our neighbors. We have began to put the necessary border infrastructure in place and are laying the foundation for a winning partnership with Mexico. 
We have moved to develop a state-of-the-art Port of Entry at Santa Teresa which will facilitate efficient border crossings and will soon begin construction on a intermodal transportation center. This center will help expedite international cargo transfers not only for New Mexico, but for the rest of the country once its construction has been completed. 
Since the passage of NAFTA, New Mexico has witnessed its exports to Mexico increase by over 1,000 percent--a percentage which represents one of the largest explosions in exports by any State in the Nation. 
Unfortunately, New Mexico still lags behind 35 other States in the amount of exports being sent to Mexico. It is becoming increasingly 
clear to the people of New Mexico that one component is still missing. The establishment of a New Mexico commercial zone. 
Mr. President, this dilemma will not be more apparent than late this summer when the Mexican chili crops are ready for harvest. Because without a commercial zone, these farmers will not be able to process their chili crops in the many food processors located in southern New Mexico. 
For a Mexican farmer to sell chili to our food processors, that farmer must transport the chili crop to the border station, unload the cargo, and then reload it onto an American carrier to travel the remaining 30 miles to the processing plant. 
Mr. President, this is clearly not an economic incentive for conducting business with New Mexico food processors. 
Mr. President, we passed NAFTA to begin creating new jobs and business opportunities for American businesses. 
Unfortunately, what we are seeing in New Mexico, is one of the first opportunities for new business, just slip through our finger tips--because we do not have a commercial zone. 
Mr. President, this issue will not only affect the owners of these processors, but also the 3,000 New Mexicans who work at these plants and rely on that income to survive. 
The apprehension among these workers is growing everyday because if Congress does not resolve this issue, there will not be enough work to go around this summer in southern New Mexico. 
Mr. President, I believe that by establishing this commercial zone we will not only be helping New Mexico but also the American consumer. Because as trade with Mexico continues to increase, so will the demand for more efficient border crossings. And if you have ever traveled to any of the busier border crossings, you would quickly notice the long lines of commercial trucks sitting idle and waiting for hours to cross into the United States. 
By establishing this commercial zone in New Mexico, we can help alleviate some of this traffic and make the process more efficient. 
Mr. President, this is the economic reality we are facing in New Mexico unless this legislation is passed. I believe New Mexico has laid the foundation for developing a winning trade partnership with Mexico. 
Simply put, this legislation puts New Mexico on a level playing field with other border States so that we can continue our efforts to make a brighter future for New Mexico residents.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor Senator Dodd's amendment. The drug certification process is fatally flawed. 
Mexico was fully certified even though 7 percent of the cocaine and 50 percent of the marijuana sold in the United States comes in through Mexico. 
Colombia wasn't certified, neither were other rogue states even though their contribution to the drug supply is not prominent. Under this process, our diplomatic friends get certified as `fully cooperating,' and rogue nations do not regardless of whether a country is a major contributor to the supply of drugs in the United States or not. 
I view the determination of which countries are cooperating as a law enforcement function, yet the State Department has prominent role in advising the President. 
This sense of the Senate amendment calls for the suspension of the drug certification procedures for two years. It calls for high-level task force to develop a comprehensive program for addressing domestic and international drug trafficking and fashioning a multilateral framework for improving international cooperation. 
It would put the Director of the National Drug Policy in charge of the task force. 
The amendment calls for the President to persuade other heads of state from drug producing countries and major drug transporting countries to establish similar task forces. 
Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment, the amendment calls for the President to convene an international summit. 
We need a better tool than the certification process. 
The new strategy has to focus on bringing the known traffickers to justice. 
Last year, I offered an amendment to withhold foreign aid to Mexico until Mexico either brought to trial themselves or extradited the ten most wanted drug lords living in Mexico. 
Two of the top ten are no longer heading up the big drug cartels. 
Juan Garcia Abrego was convicted in Houston and sentenced to 11 life sentences. 
Amador Carillo Fuentes, considered the wealthiest and most powerful drug baron died earlier this month. He was known as the `lord of the skies' because he owned a fleet of 727's which allowed him to transport drugs from Colombia to Mexico. 
His headquarters were in Juarez, a little more than an hour away from New Mexico. 
He died earlier this month, but this will not be the end of this cartel's influence and drug dealing. 
We have to do something more effective in this area. 
The new policy has to be primarily a law enforcement function. 
Enhanced extradition has to be an important part of the new policy. 
Comprehensive money laundering laws must be passed in all countries and officials must be trained to identify money laundering schemes and to enforce the laws. 
Young people need to be educated about the dangers of drugs. 
We can't solve this drug problem alone. We need international cooperation. 
This amendment provides a framework for a better, more aggressive policy.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment to the foreign operations appropriations bill asks that $5 million of the funding appropriated for international narcotics control be allocated out of existing funds for the establishment of an international law enforcement training academy [ILEA] for the Western Hemisphere. 
The State Department set up the International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest, Hungary, in 1995 and has since trained 300 law enforcement officials. 
This amendment would establish a similar international law enforcement training academy but for the Western Hemisphere and for which the President requested in his 1998 budget. 
Mr. President, the allocated funds would be for operations of such an academy and a facility would need to be found. I understand that the State Department has been trying to find such a facility for the past year, but we have not reached an agreement among Latin American countries. 
My amendment would allow the academy to be established in consultation with the Organization of American States, representing our Central and Latin American neighbors. 
Mr. President, I do not have to explain the terrorist and narcotic threats in this hemisphere. The ILEA is a way for the United States to establish law enforcement networks that lead to a more effective approach to fighting international organized crime and drug trafficking. 
Such an academy would help us create closer working relationships and networks with foreign police that are needed to find fugitives and combat financial corruption. 
I urge Senators to vote in support of a Western Hemisphere international law enforcement academy.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, obviously, with the distinguished chairman of the full committee, Senator Stevens, taking care of the defense of our Nation in 1 day in the Chamber, I am challenged and challenge the Senate to do likewise in this very important bill. I hope we can finish tonight. Senators who are within earshot or their staffs, clearly we intend to move right ahead. We know of only two amendments--there may be many, many more, but we know of only two, and we expect Senators who have those amendments to come down here as soon as possible. It is not beyond reason that we can finish this this evening. 
I have some brief opening remarks, Mr. President, that I will make at this point. And, again, I ask that Senators who have amendments, whether they be add-ons or deletions, come to the floor and we can accommodate them almost forthwith. 
I wonder whether Senator Reid would not agree with that statement with reference to anyone on that side who has an amendment. We are ready.

Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. 
Mr. President, S. 1004 was reported by a vote of 28 to zero from the Senate Committee on Appropriations on Thursday, July 10, was filed that evening, and it has been available for Members since Friday, July 11. 
Senator Reid, who this year became the ranking member of the subcommittee, and I have worked closely together to craft a balanced bill. We believe it addresses the concerns of the Members of the Senate and the concerns of the President of the United States. 
The recommendation before the Senate provides $20.7 billion in new budget authority, $11.7 billion within the defense function, and $8.9 billion of that is within the domestic discretionary program. In this appropriations bill, in essence, a little over half of its total money is for defense purposes, and most of that, not all of it but most of it, has to do with the preservation and retaining the fidelity of the nuclear arsenal that the United States has in these very difficult times when we are building down and we are no longer doing underground testing. 
The recommendation is $1.9 billion in budget authority below the request of the President. That reduction results from the subcommittee's recommendation that we not provide for full asset acquisition, which saved about $800 million in budget authority, and provide only $300 million of a requested $1 billion for an initiative to privatize a portion of the Department of Energy's cleanup work. 
Now, Mr. President, I might explain, in no way are we doing less in cleanup. There is an effort to go at this waste cleanup program--which is very, very difficult, very cumbersome, very bureaucratic and costing a lot of money--there is an effort of the administration to move in another direction and to try to come in with privatization, which would permit somebody powerful of resources and of talent to bid a total cleanup project for a certain amount of money and then the Federal Government, when they are finished, would pay them for that. 
The Department knows that this is a very big venture requiring some very new management skills, and we in our bill are saying let us take one-third of this new effort, not the whole thing. It was all budget authority with no outlay request attendant to it to speak of. And we said let us go with $300 million instead of $1 billion to see how the program works. 
It has been modified and language has been supplied in this bill so that the major one that they wanted to go out to privatization bid probably on the west coast will probably fit. 
Now, it is interesting that while much time is spent on the defense nuclear aspects, and we could spend this afternoon in debate on the floor on that aspect, there is a large portion of this bill that has to do with funding that is not defense. The discretionary function is $103 million less than the request. 
However, within the lower amount, the subcommittee has increased spending for water projects by $229.5 million above requests. The offsetting savings were derived principally from the Department of Energy's nondefense functions. 
I must tell Senators that of all the subcommittees I have been on that garner comments and letters and requests from fellow members, this small portion of the bill, the water projects of America, brings us more requests than any subcommittee I have served on, because all the water projects in America, the flood protection projects that have the Federal Government involved, the Bureau of Reclamation, and all the Corps of Engineers projects across this land are all in this section--the dredging, the ports that we maintain, and so it is not easy to make ends meet here. Senators are not going to get everything they think their projects need because we cannot afford them anymore, and two very large projects that are ready to go through the Corps of Engineers, one in West Virginia and one in the State of Kentucky, we cannot start them because of all of the programs that are still backed up in terms of available resources. 
The time might come when perhaps a large bipartisan group might want to tell the executive branch, in its next budget, that they better do a little better in this field because we are going to have to take money away from something else in Government to satisfy these needs because so many Senators feel so strongly about them. 
The savings that we have put in our bill with reference to the domestic part are $43 million from solar and renewable energy. The committee recommends $301 million, a $35 million increase over last year. That is a $35 million increase. Mr. President, $67 million was saved from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, where it recommends $243 million, a $24 million increase over the current year; $20 million saved from the nondefense cleanup, but we provide $437.6 million, a $109 million increase over current year; $25 million is saved from science by not providing for the next generation of Internet programs--we believe that can wait a year--and $30 million for the Yucca Mountain program; leaving $160 million on the nondefense side and $190 million in the defense function. 
We believe this is adequate to move ahead in a steady, go-as-you-can approach that has been taking place for at least the last 3 years. Mr. President, $18 million was saved from uranium decommissioning and decontamination programs. The committee has protected science funding. And, while it was unable to provide an increase, as many Members requested, it did provide $2.2 billion of the $2.3 billion requested in this field. Within the atomic energy defense activities budget, this committee included $4.3 billion for weapons activities and $5.3 billion for environmental restoration and waste management. 
I think it is noteworthy that we are now beginning to spend more, and this is in billions of dollars, on the environmental restoration and waste management in this country, the result of our nuclear programs with reference to our defense and the use of the various facilities for atomic and hydrogen bombs--we are spending more than we are in the actual weapons activities. And we are moving in a brand new direction in terms of weapons activities, in that we no longer test our nuclear weapons underground. Since we do not, because Congress has said let us not do that, obviously we have to assure the fidelity, trustworthiness, and safety of these weapons another way. And we are busy doing that under the title of `science-based stockpile stewardship,' something new. We hope in the next 4 or 5 years we can display to everyone that indeed we can continue to certify the well-being of this weapons system without underground testing through the use of new devices and new science at the three major nuclear Laboratories, Livermore, Los Alamos, and Sandia. 
The committee reduced the Department of Energy's privatization proposal. I have expressed that in my opening remarks. We continue to maintain the ability to manage a technically challenged fixed-priced contract. As a result, the House and Senate committee proposed significant reductions for the $1 billion requested. That is because there is general concern about whether the Department has the ability to manage the technical part. The Committee on Appropriations recommends $343 million, to be exact, with reference to this work. 
The leadership has expressed its intent that the Senate this week complete consideration of three appropriations bills: defense, which we just completed; energy and water, a small bill compared to the defense bill but a very important one from the standpoint of our defenses; science, and our water resources. 
I understand we want to go ahead and do foreign operations also. We would like very much to finish tonight so we can move right along on this schedule. 
So, I want to say to everyone, I am very hopeful we can handle this bill in the manner that the chairman and Senator Inouye, the ranking member, handled the previous bill. 
My remarks are completed. I understand my good friend, the ranking member from Nevada, wants to make opening remarks, and then we will be ready for any other Senators. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. REID addressed the Chair.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are in the process of clearing a number of amendments. I, once again, ask Senators who have any amendments that they are certain have to be offered if they would get down here as soon as possible. If they are the only two amendments, it would seem to me it would be reasonable for us to be telling the Senators and our leadership that we could finish tonight, provided we don't have to just wait here with nothing to do. I understand the schedules and other subcommittee hearings and the like. But I, once again, urge either of the two Senators who have an amendment that we understand might be offered that they get down here as soon as possible. 
Mr. President, I say to fellow Senators, I thought I would discuss a little bit about this bill I think is interesting and might make it easier for those who are wondering, as you look at the Department of Energy's role--and it has a lot of roles, a lot of missions, it might be a little easier to identify what we are doing as a Nation in various areas. 
So what we have done is we have kind of reorganized the way the bill shows the functions at the Department of Energy. I call to anyone's attention who is interested the report accompanying this bill at page 88, title III, the Department of Energy, because we have broken it down into the energy research, we have broken it down into what we call science. 
I would just like to talk about science for a minute, because across this country--incidentally, the science portion of this bill costs $2.2 billion. We hear, and I am sure the 
occupant in the Chair in his capacity from his State with INL there and a lot of science going on, our academic and business leaders say, if you are going to reduce spending, don't reduce what we are spending on basic science. We are all hearing that. We funded the President's request in basic science. If you look in this reorganization effort, science is made up of high-energy physics, nuclear physics, biological and environmental research, basic energy sciences, and other energy research. 
It is very, very important that everybody understand that this is not just a Department of Energy bill that has to do with petroleum and natural gas. It has to do with subjects I spoke about, some of the most profound and deep science that America is doing anywhere with reference to physics, with reference to biological and environmental research. 
For instance, this Department has one-third of the budget, Mr. President, of the human genome research project. The human genome research project is about 7 years old, maybe 8, and two-thirds of it is run by the National Institutes of Health and one-third by the Department of Energy. Many scientists have said it is mankind's most serious and potentially effective research project for wellness. For what we have been doing with the genome project is to map all of the chromosomes of the human body and to discern from within those chromosomes where the dread diseases are located. It doesn't mean we know how to cure them because we know how to locate them, but for most of our adult life, we heard every 3 or 4 or 5 years a group of great scientists would announce they had located the genes for multiple sclerosis. They were in an effort that might have taken 20 years to locate that, because they had to do it without regard to the relevancy of doing all of the chromosomes of the human body. 
Because of computers and other things, we are well on the way to handing to the scientists of the future the chromosome locations inside us for all of the dread diseases, and then it will be up to pharmaceutical researchers and basic researchers to find if there is some way that we can effect cures. That is why it is seen as the biggest wellness effort, and one-third of that lies within the Department of Energy. It is interesting, it is there for a number of reasons. I won't talk about the parochial interests which I had something to do with. But essentially, this Department was doing a great deal of genetic work, as the occupant of the Chair knows. Because of Hiroshima, Nagasaki, some of the most indepth preservation of radioactive impacts on the human genetic system and research on that, instruments to do the research were within this Department. So when Senators wonder what the Department of Energy does, that is one. That is $1.2 billion.

Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, you know, everybody around would say you asked the right person, because I am absolutely convinced that the national laboratories--and there are more than the big three we have just alluded to that are part of this, the Department of Energy--while they may not have been created in their inception to do the kind of research they are doing today, or the three we speak to, they were created and started up because of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs and nuclear energy. And everybody related to that, the design, the making, the disarming, huge assemblages of the greatest physicists and scientists that America has ever brought up, ended up in these laboratories doing this kind of work. 
The result of that is they are doing all kinds of basic research because they are there and they have big equipment to do their jobs. I would surmise that as many breakthroughs in science have come about because of the national laboratory system as any other single institution or entity in America's modern history.

<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. That is right. 
I want to, again, if there is a little bit of time, to remind fellow Senators of another thing. 
You know, a very large group of Senators, just speaking of our body, our Senate, are always very concerned about the adequacy of defense spending. And I think we see that in the bill that just passed with very large support. We see it in the willingness of the U.S. Senate to set up a wall and say the appropriations for defense are separate from the domestic appropriations, and you cannot take from defense to spend in domestic. You need a supermajority to do that because we think it is so important that we do right by defense. 
But I think what happens is that sometimes many of the Senators do not realize, and maybe it is because we have not done a very good job of telling them, that a portion of the defense of our Nation is done not in the defense budget but in this budget, by the Department of Energy in its nuclear weapons work. All of the money for that comes out of this defense pot of money that I just talked about, with a wall saying this money cannot be used for anything else; it is transferred for that part of Government to this subcommittee and to the Department of Energy to do the nuclear deterrent work in the broadest sense of the word. 
Now we have decided to engage in a big, vast experiment regarding the preservation of these nuclear weapons in terms of their safety, reliability, and trustworthiness. We have said no more underground testing, which my friend from Nevada had a very major parochial interest in and which went on in his State for many, many decades, that offered direct objective proof of the reliability and the qualitative capability and quantitative capability of the weapons. We decided as a Congress, and the President agreed, that we would not do that anymore. 
Now, it is obvious that we have not gotten rid of our nuclear weapons, and we will not for a long time, even though we are hopeful that with the various treaties we will get this number down, and hopefully there may be even a giant effort to get it down even more. But in the meantime, what nobody seems to understand--or, I should say, few understand--is that we have to spend money on some new techniques to make sure the weaponry is safe and trustworthy and that it will be faithful to its mission because we cannot test it anymore. 
So we are engaged in a major transition. I have alluded to it, my ranking member has. It is called science-based stockpile stewardship. The greatest scientists and physicists and others have joined together with the Department of Energy saying, `Since we can't test, we have got to find some other ways based on science.' And, Mr. President, we are engaged in very large computer experiments. In fact, we are pushing the threshold of computer capability more by this requirement than any other requirement in America. The push for bigger and faster computers is being done by our response to the science-based stockpile stewardship. 
In addition, each of the major laboratories, since we will 
no longer make new bombs, no longer design new bombs, are engaged in their part of trying to make sure that the weapons are reliable. If, indeed, there is a dispute today on the floor on whether we are spending too much for this, I am prepared to go into a lot of detail, none of which is secret, about the certification process as to the well-being of the weapons. 
These three laboratories, headed by civilians, have essentially maintained our nuclear deterrent position for all these decades because they surround themselves with the best; we fund the best equipment, and they have always kept us from having a war. They have kept us highly, highly competitive so that nobody, including the Soviet Union, dared venture anything in the field of nuclear weapons. 
These same laboratories must continue to certify the reliability of these weapons. It is not just some figment of someone's imagination that they are important. The truth of the matter is, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in agreeing to no more underground testing, studied it and worked with the best scientists around and concluded that they would go along if, in fact, the national laboratories were given sufficient resources and the lab directors could certify to them and the President regularly that we were able to verify the effectiveness, the safety of these weapons systems in ways that did not need underground testing as a quantifier or objective determinator. 
That makes the work of this Department in this regard as important, in my opinion, as anything within the defense budget of the United States. I do not believe, properly presented to any legislator and any policymaker, they could disagree. 
In this bill, there is about $4.3 billion--and remember, we just passed a defense budget an hour ago, about $250 billion. So let us put it in perspective. The science-based stockpile stewardship, the maintenance of and attesting to the reliability of the nuclear weapons, is being done for about $4.3 billion by essentially three national laboratories who work for us. 
It seems to me that when it comes to these budgets, we ought to not fail to understand that it is part of the defense of our Nation. When it comes to maintaining these science-based efforts, some of them are new and very major. A whole new device and system will be established at Lawrence Livermore. A lesser facility is almost completed to do an x-ray type activity at Los Alamos. And all three laboratories are beginning to do, with early completion dates, major, major computer programs so that many of the tests can be done by simulation that were done before by actual tests. 
So I hope, when it comes to where does the money go from the Defense Department, that everyone will understand it is very, very important that we adequately fund defense, but it is probably even more important that we properly allocate money to the laboratories of this Nation which are doing the deterrent work with reference to our nuclear arsenal. 
Now, there are many other great laboratories--one is in the State of the occupant of the chair--that do great science work for the Department of Energy. One could stand here and go through each one and say how important it is, and much of it is not discernible easily as being directly related to energy because it is science of some very special quality that can be done by the people and the other things that are present in these various facilities. 
So the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which I have not yet mentioned, is the natural next episode that follows on the American Government's agreement not to do any more nuclear underground testing. And the next thing will be, can the world agree to it? That treaty is going to be called the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Obviously, it is ready. It is in the possession of the executive branch. And soon--I do not know when, but it cannot be a long way off--it will be submitted to the Senate for its approval and ratification and/or amendment, I assume. 
I think it is important that everyone know that the questions that are going to be asked have to do with this appropriations bill, questions like, are we adequately funding what is required by the laboratory directors of the laboratories that are nuclear weapons laboratories? Are we funding the program properly for the next 5-year interval so that we can say with confidence that the international test ban treaty can be entered into? 
Obviously, I am putting the Senate on notice, in a way, that some work has to be done clearly to make sure that the Joint Chiefs and the lab directors, the three laboratory directors, can be assured there will be adequate funding. We are working on that now with the administration and the Departments of Defense and Energy so we are able to come to the floor and say with as much certainty as we can, considering our democratic processes, that we are funding the basic institutional thrusts required to make an international treaty a valid and good thing for America set up alongside of the test ban that we have passed. 
There will be many other ramifications to that test ban treaty, and I think one is obvious. If we find out that we absolutely cannot get along without it, what happens? I think that will be addressed, too. These scientists will tell us whether this science-based stewardship is working or not. And if they end up saying it cannot work, it cannot do the job, then what happens if we are bound in a treaty? And I think that will be addressed in due course. 
I still do not see any Senators present who want to offer amendments, so I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

I know we have to protect Senators and we have rules, but it would not be too farfetched for third reading to occur here any time if no amendments are in order. And I do not want to pursue that very vigorously even under regular order or the rules, but I do think there are a number of Senators and a lot of people waiting on the floor for what may be one or two amendments. 
I certainly once again urge and beg my fellow Senators to get them down here so we can finish this work. All of us have many things to do, and we are very cognizant of your responsibilities, I say that to those Senators who have amendments, but we ought to try to keep the Senate busy when we are open and this would help us very much.

Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, only in this respect. The money for the DOE defense work comes out of the total amount available for defense under the budget, and that total amount is subject to a firewall. Whatever you take out of it, like the money you are describing, the firewall carries with it, so that in this bill you could not move defense money to water projects because there is a firewall around the subdefense money, which is exactly the same as the big defense 050 function called defense.

Mr. DOMENICI. Let me first say to you, I believe that this discussion and what you have done in the past in an effort to make sure that we can answer and respond to inquiries about the sufficiency or whether we appropriated too much are good for the Senate and good for the American people. So from my standpoint, I am glad you are here on the floor. And I am glad you in the past have challenged us. 
I have tried very hard to answer up to a responsibility that almost no one understands, and that is that the entire safety of the nuclear arsenal is funded in this bill. Most people think it is in that big defense bill. It is in this bill. 
Let me move on to a couple of other things. The overall expenditures in this bill, compared to the present, the overall amount in budget authority is $1.9 billion less between defense, nondefense, water and everything else. But we had increased water projects, which you alluded to, on their own by $229 million. You have been an advocate, and we worked with you, on many of those. They are tough to fund. But they did not come out of the defense money anyway. You quite appropriately asked, are they walled off? They are. That is a big part of this bill, and growing in difficulty. 
If you would have come down and said, `I would like to engage you, Senator, in about an hour discussion on whether we're going to be able to pay for water projects,' I would be a little more concerned, because I am not sure we can, because we are not putting any more money in this domestic part of this bill, and we are asking for more and more water projects. 
One part of our Government says, we do not want to do any more, we want to increase the ratio of support locally. And we keep saying we have to keep doing them because they are needed. 
So I want to establish those fundamental issues. 
Now, let me move on. If I were the only one, singularly, who thought we had to have an increase of about $300 million in the defense part of this bill for nuclear weapons safety, I would probably be a little frightened here on the floor because you are very persuasive. 
But I worked with the ranking member, who is a diligent Senator. He started saying, `I want to learn everything I can. I want to meet with everybody you meet with. When you bring the Secretary of Defense in, I want to be there. When you bring in the DOE, I want to be there. When you bring in the security people out at Berger's office, I want to be there.' 
We have both concluded that there have been some things that have occurred since the President submitted his idea of about $4 billion a year for the safety, well-being, and fidelity of the nuclear arsenal. We are going to discuss those with you here in a minute. 
But let me first say, that $4.3 billion is not to manufacture a single new weapon. I think everybody should know that. People keep saying we are making nuclear weapons. You know we are not--no nuclear weapons and no nuclear weapons designs. But what we have, Senator--and this is not a secret number, and it is not subject to my call--is we have a minimum of 6,500 nuclear weapons. That is the allowable under START II. 
Now, I am not, in this bill, permitted to challenge whether we need them or not. I am only permitted to respond to lab directors and the national security advisers on how much do we need to make sure they are safe, and some of them are running out of their durability. A number of them will be old in 5 years, sufficient for us to wonder what we should do with them. 
Now, what we used to do, Senator, is perform some rather objective tests in Nevada. On this floor, the three of us probably have discussed that as much as anyone else, and the Senator from Nevada knows about all that testing. That used to be an objective way of measuring certain things. Now, before we entered into that agreement, before the President said let's cut off underground testing and sent up his proposal and started lobbying for it, and before Congress would approve it, the Joint Chiefs of Staff had a lot of questions. Essentially, believe it or not, they literally had to do with, how do we maintain the arsenal without the tests? 
Frankly, Senator, I didn't make that deal either, although I am glad to live with it. I will say what you have said. I hope the whole world joins us now. In fact, I am leaning strongly in support of the international treaty banning it. But I guarantee you that it has no chance of passing, if Senators can come to the floor and have credible information that those who are in charge of making sure those weapons are safe, the parts are replaceable, if they are broken down. If anybody in the security department of our country can say we don't have enough money in there to do that, that treaty will go down in flames. And I can tell you there will be Senators who are going to say that, regardless of what we put in this bill. 
But I am not convinced that $4 billion, which was in the President's budget, and $4 billion for the next 5 years, will do that. Now, it seems simple, Mr. President, that we ought to just go from underground testing, get a few scientists and a few machines ordered, and we ought to test these weapons. But I tell you, if you want me to, I will read you the definition of safety that has been in existence regarding nuclear weapons since 1968.

Mr. DOMENICI. They are incredible. America wants them safe. In 1968, the then President of the United States entered into the following understanding, and the criteria are summarized as follows: 
One, in the event of a detonation, initiated at any one point in the high-explosive system---- 
That is not the bomb---- the probability of achieving nuclear yield of greater than 4 pounds of TNT shall not exceed 1 in a million. 
Not that it will cause a bomb. Just 4 pounds of TNT, a chance of 1 in a million. 
The probability of premature nuclear detonation of a bomb due to bomb component malfunction shall not exceed one in a billion in any environment the bomb is designed to experience, or one in a million for accident when the weapon is exposed to an environment outside its designed parameters. Quantitative criteria are also used to certify weapon reliability. 
Now, Senator Bumpers, the answer to your question is that the scientists who developed them, the scientists who designed them, the scientists who supervised their building and their destruction are now asked to try a whole new approach and come up with a science-based stockpile stewardship initiative. And they are not going to be absolutely certain that it is going to work. But we have to give them what is necessary for them to say we are moving toward making sure that it will work. 
Now, I am not going to go into any more detail about the Nevada Test Site or anything else. I am merely going to say that we have concluded that a number of things must be done in order to achieve this stockpile stewardship relationship. One--and you will understand this in a minute--massive new supercomputer capability to model, in three dimensions, the workings of the nuclear weapon is required in these laboratories. Massive. In fact, it will be the driving force 
for supercomputing in the future, because you need so much computer capability. Facilities that improve our understanding of how material behaves at very high temperatures and pressures found within nuclear weapons, and the enhanced diagnostic capability. 
See, now we have to have some diagnostic capability to look into the bombs and into the explosives and see how things are working. We didn't have those like we now are going to have in the next 5-year program. 
And then I add, Senator, five things that have happened since the President and many of us--in fact, I will confess to you that I worked with the administration on this $4 billion idea, which was $4 billion a year. Let's see if it will make that stockpile stewardship solid. But there are five things that haven't come to fruition that cost more money. 
One--and you know this--START II has not been ratified. So the laboratories are having to maintain a larger number of weapons of more designs than they anticipated. 
Second, the plants that we have to produce more spare parts and replacements are not being built down because we haven't built down the stockpile. And the delay in reducing the stockpile has increased the need and the schedule for tritium production. All of these were discussed, incidentally, in your absence, not only by me, but by Senator Reid when we explained what was in our bill during the introduction of it today. 
And then there have been some very expensive, unexpected maintenance costs. I trust we will leave it at that. DOE's administrative costs have not declined as were envisioned in 1992. 
I would like, if the Senator would agree, to let Senator 
Reid take a few moments to also address your inquiry. Before I do that, I wonder, on the Democrat side, if the Senator knows of any additional amendments besides the amendment that is expected to be voted on. We are not ready yet. We would like to make a list so we know there are no further amendments. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think maybe if the Senator from Arkansas ever thought that bringing down an amendment or discussion like this was futile, I believe this is the best explanation of what we are doing in the Department of Energy 
with reference to nuclear weapons. Maybe I have not been here for every discussion. But I think he has pushed us to discuss things that should have been discussed regularly, and more people should understand it. I can tell you that everybody knows that I have a lot of this activity in my State. But I am firmly convinced that we had better not come in on the short side of dollar expenditures on this process which is going to end up --and this ought to be dear to the Senator from Arkansas because he is one of the leaders in trying to stop the testing. But if we are going to keep these people who are in charge of these laboratories able to certify that these weapons aren't going to go awry, or become unsafe, or deteriorate, then we had better not come on the short side of appropriating for their core staffers, and for the equipment and science research that they need. 
Frankly, I laud those experts within the Department of Defense, Energy, and outsiders who came up with the substitute transition approach to move from testing to this science-based stockpile stewardship. But I can tell you from visiting the laboratories, talking to the directors, and talking to the people in charge of the divisions that are most contentious regarding having the right staff to do this new job, I am convinced that they have one tough job. 
Like I said to the Senator from Arkansas. I wish we could say we don't have this arsenal to maintain. And the Senator knows we had more than we needed. I think we have to say about our laboratories and their responsibilities that they kept us in a state of readiness when nobody dared to do anything. And I think we all agree with that. Thus, the world has not had a nuclear device exploded intentionally to harm people or things since the ones that happened in Japan. That is because we had great laboratories with the greatest scientists we could put together keeping us out there. 
I think we must do the same on this transition in 5 to 10 years. I worked very hard at this. I want to tell you that I don't believe that we know yet whether this 4.32 is the right number. 
And, in answer to the last inquiry, we are not finished. We have to go through a House that has less. In answer to the question about the defense authorization versus appropriations, they are not finished yet. The House has different approaches. In fact, the Senator might have asked why they appropriated less than was authorized in the previous bill. That is because we are not through yet. There are disagreements. 
But I thank the Senator for the dialog today. And I am very pleased that I was able to contribute to it. I hope I was, and I thank the Senator for his questions.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, for all Senators, I don't know what their evening schedule is, but I have not been told to create any window. We are going to vote in about 10 minutes on the motion to table the Animas-La Plata amendment offered by Senator Feingold. 
Mr. President, if I thought this amendment offered by Senator Feingold and the distinguished occupant of the chair would, in fact, keep alive the Animas-La Plata project in a manner that had a reasonable chance of succeeding, I would be over here asking my friend from Arizona to go find our Indian leaders and let's go out in the hall and agree to it. 
I am not talking about anybody's intent, but I am telling the Senate that if this amendment becomes law, I do not believe the project has a chance of going anywhere. 
The Secretary of the Interior is given broad latitude by this amendment to make decisions about the project which I don't believe the U.S. Congress should give him for a project as controversial and subject to pressure as this one. I make no reference to him personally or his abilities as Secretary, but I just don't believe that we can tell the Indian people that allowing Secretary Babbitt to decide what will be a cost-effective way of completing the project--that is one item in the amendment--will ever work. 
The amendment states that the Secretary shall come up with a project that limits the diversion of Animas-La Plata as recommended by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; let me say that number is about 57,000 acre-feet annually. That is what the number ought to be; not a new number proposed by U.S. Fish and Wildlife, because they have already agreed to 57,000 acre-feet. I don't want Fish and Wildlife in 2 or 3 years taking yet another look and then changing what they think ought to be diverted. 
This project is controversial because it costs money and it is giving water to Indian people who have been denied their legitimate water rights. I believe Ute tribes have a very good case to make that the U.S. Government has denied them promised water rights, and this project is a solution to getting the Utes wet water and avoiding costly litigation. 
I do not believe we ought to allow this amendment which permits the Secretary of the Interior or anyone other than Congress to decide the fate of the project. That is my feeling, I say to Senator Campbell, and I believe what we have done--so the Senate will understand, the Senate Appropriations Committee put in this bill precisely the amount of money that the President of the United States asked for. No more, no less. 
With this appropriation, development of this project, I believe rightly so, will be able to proceed in an orderly manner. This amendment allows the Secretary of the Interior to define this project. Nobody else has mentioned the Secretary of the Interior's role in this amendment, but I think if you read it carefully, it gives him all kinds of authority to decide the fate of this project. The Secretary already has delegated much of that authority to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Colorado to have meetings with the interested parties to see if they can resolve the issue. 
I just do not believe this amendment furthers the goal of getting the Indians their water.

Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, I do not want to go back over all the problems that we have had with eight or nine departments of the Government fighting against each other with regard to this project, but the Senator is correct. 
But I do want to say, for anybody who is listening, the Senator from Colorado--who occupies my seat; he just said that a while ago while I am here in this one--has said it right. 
We ought to solve this problem and give to these two Indian tribes what they deserve; promised water. They have been most patient, most willing to compromise in a realistic way. 
I add just parenthetically that my little State has been waiting forever for about 20,000 acre feet of water that they are entitled to under the project. That is a lot for that part of New Mexico. 
I do not want to sit by and watch those rights be subject to anyone other than the U.S. Congress' determination on how we ought to proceed in getting this project completed. I believe in due course we can satisfy our obligations to the Utes and other water users because a lot of new ground has been turned; new agreements are being worked out between many water users in that four-corners region. 
The opponents to the project have attended these meetings in the negotiation process; I hope a number of you who are proposing this amendment do not necessarily agree with all of those who oppose this project. Some opponents find reason to oppose it once a month, maybe. Maybe in some cases they have found three or four reasons a month, and they rest a while and then they found six or eight more reasons to oppose this project in 6 months' time. There are those who will oppose any project, no matter how worthy. 
In any event, I yield back the remainder of my time. 
I understand the yeas and nays have been ordered on the motion to table. Is that correct?

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Energy and Water Appropriations Act for the current year imposed a 9-percent reduction of the Department of Energy's Departmental Administration Account. That account funds the office of the Secretary, Human Resources, and general counsel among other things. 
However, in imposing that reduction, the Department did not impose any reductions in the Office of General Counsel. As a matter of fact, while other offices lost 40 or more people, the Office of General Counsel lost only 1 position. 
In drafting its recommendation for departmental administration, the committee directed that the Office of General Counsel assume a reduction to bring its staffing levels back into balance with the rest of those in departmental administration. 
The committee's recommendation did not take into consideration the fact that the Department has proposed to shift 19 lawyers, previously funded out of the Interior appropriations bill, into the account funded by this bill. 
I have committed to the Secretary of Energy that, in the statement of managers accompanying the conference report, I will work to include language that clarifies our intent. I do believe that the Office of General Counsel should not be insulated from the reductions Congress wisely imposed last year. However, it was not our intent to impose overly harsh reductions.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me thank all of my colleagues who have expressed their views on this important issue and let me add a final thought. As the Congress continues its consideration of de-regulation or restructuring of the electric power industry, and the legislation already introduced in both bodies on that subject, I ask my colleagues to consider the contribution of nuclear energy, both as a safe and reliable source of power--part of our energy security--and its contribution in lowering emissions of greenhouse gases. If this country's nuclear plants are rendered uneconomic by the advent of competition in the electric industry, as some claim, we need to ask ourselves what will replace these plants. As cost estimates for decommissioning balloon out of control, we should be asking what technology investments DOE could be making to bring these estimates back in line with reality. A strong nuclear energy program is part of the answer.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in last year's Energy and Water Development Act, a provision was included that directed the Department of Energy to determine if it has any legal obligation regarding the Southwest experimental fast oxide reactor [SEFOR] or any similar nuclear facilities that have been transferred from Federal to non-Federal ownership. The Department has completed a draft memorandum that indicates that the Department has no legal obligation regarding SEFOR. 
However, the senior Senator from Arkansas' interest in SEFOR continues. Early today, an amendment to S. 1004 was accepted on behalf of the senior Senator from Arkansas that would provide for an assessment of the cost of decommissioning the Southwest experimental fast oxide reactor. 
It is important to note that the acceptance of this amendment does not indicate that the Senate disagrees with the initial findings of the Department of Energy that the Department has no legal obligations with regard to the SEFOR. The interest of the Senate is simply to understand what the decommissioning costs of a reactor such as the SEFOR might be.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I say to the distinguished senior Senator from Mississippi, during the day, in your absence when you were busy attending that very difficult 
hearing that you are part of, I commented on the fact that one of the growing difficulties in this bill is the water project section, because every year more projects that are good and that are necessary--and many that we haven't completed--are showing up and we are not getting an allocation of resources sufficient to do them. What we have been doing is putting little pieces of money in. That is what you just called--that means, for instance, this year there are two major flood projects that we cannot start, that have been years in the design, that are ready to go. We just don't have the money to do it. 
I was predicting today that in 3 or 4 years, if we don't find more resources for the water projects--because many people don't think they are very important, and we don't get much support from the White House on them, frankly. They are trying to change the formula right in the middle of the stream on who pays for what. If we don't get more resources, the situation you predict will become reality. I am going to do my best, but there isn't enough money to complete the projects we have been committed to with the kind of allocation we get. I thank the Senator for his kind comments.

Having said that, I compliment the Senator on his diligence, Senator McCain, and for his continued hard work in this area. All of us are learning and being pushed by him to do a better job each time we appropriate the money that the taxpayers send up here for us to use. 
Mr. President, we very soon will have a tender of seven amendments en bloc.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, S. 1004, the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1998, is within its allocation of budget authority and outlays. 
The reported bill provides $20.8 billion in budget authority and $13.5 billion in new outlays to fund the civil programs of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, certain independent agencies, and most of the activities of the Department of Energy. When outlays from prior year budget authority and other actions are taken into account, this bill provides a total of $20.9 billion in outlays. 
For defense discretionary programs, the Senate-reported bill meets its allocation in budget authority and is $2 million below in outlays. The bill also is below its nondefense discretionary allocation by $46 million in budget authority and $1 million in outlays.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1005, the Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. The pending bill provides $247.2 billion in total budget authority and $244.4 billion in total outlays for the Department of Defense. There are some major elements to this bill that are important programs for the Senate to review. 
According to preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, the bill, as reported, is within the Defense Subcommittee's section 602(b) allocation and, thus, complies with the requirements of the Budget Act. 
The bill is fully consistent with the bipartisan balanced budget agreement. Senators may have heard or read statements to the contrary, but I can assure them that the bill in no way transgresses the agreement. I can also assure Senators that any misunderstanding in the administration about this matter is in the process of being clarified. 
The bill fully funds certain important initiatives that were requested by the President, including a 2.8 percent pay raise for all military personnel and the end strengths for all of the active and reserve military services. The bill also funds needed increases in each of the major accounts of the defense budget. 
The Chairman of the Defense Subcommittee, Senator Stevens, and the Subcommittee staff deserve the thanks of the Senate for their extremely skillful crafting of this bill. It makes the best possible use of the defense funds available and sustains our national defense posture consistent with the Defense Department's new roadmap, the Quadrennial Defense Review. 
I strongly support this bill, and I urge its adoption. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Senate Budget Committee table displaying the budget impact of this bill be placed in the Record.

Mr. DOMENICI. For the information of all Senators, in behalf of the leader, I state the following. Tomorrow, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until the hour of 11 a.m. By previous consent, at 11 a.m. the Senate will begin consideration of S. 955, the foreign operations appropriations bill. By previous consent, a vote on final passage of S. 1004, the energy and water appropriations bill, will occur following the first vote relative to the foreign operations bill. 
Thus far, we have been able to make considerable progress on four appropriations bills cleared for floor action. It is the leader's hope that this progress with respect to the foreign operations appropriations bill and the legislative branch appropriations bill will continue. 
Senators are reminded that the Senate hopes to complete action on two more appropriations bills this week, so the cooperation of Members in the scheduling of floor action is appreciated. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, since the 1950's, the Department of Energy and its predecessors have made assistance payments to the county of Los Alamos, NM. Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1955, this was accomplished in recognition of the dependence of the community on the Atomic Energy Commission's, and later the DOE's, facilities. Their facilities, worth in the hundreds of millions of dollars, paid no taxes to this community. Now only Los Alamos County and schools receive any assistance, and all other communities are off assistance, many via buyouts. 
It is very difficult for Los Alamos to reach self-sufficiency and to continue into the next century as a viable community unless something is done about the fact that there is no longer any land within the city and county of Los Alamos that can be developed, for the excess land is all in the hands of the Department of Energy. 
Last year, we agreed to end assistance to Los Alamos County through an agreement that coupled a very moderate buyout amount with transfer of excess land to the city. The land considered for transfer now is under the control of the DOE and cannot be used by the city until ownership is transferred. 
This amendment will eventually return land to the county that can be used for normal county growth and to the Pueblo of San Ildefonso that has strong historic claims to portions of the land. The amendment also carefully prescribes a study of other claims for these lands that are now largely part of this county but still under the control of the Department of Energy. The Secretary of Energy is chartered to conduct a record search of all legal claims and to use every reasonable effort to determine whether there are any claims to these pieces of property considered for transfer. 
It ends assistance payments to Los Alamos and provides for the future growth of Los Alamos by enabling opportunities for economic diversity. Ultimately, we believe this is in the best interests of the Federal Government and the many thousands of people that live in northern New Mexico. Without this amendment, we continue to have a land-locked city, without opportunity for economic development. And in that environment, there is also no room for housing projects, which leads to some of the highest housing costs in America. Without this amendment, assistance payments would have to continue. This amendment starts the forces of change that allow us to stop the assistance payments. 
In summary, Madam President, this amendment is critical to complete the mandate of the last Congress to stop assistance payments to the county of Los Alamos, NM, under the auspices of the Atomic Energy Community Act of 1955. 
The Atomic Energy Community Act of 1955 enabled assistance payments for communities impacted by the presence of major atomic energy facilities. These facilities were primarily located in remote areas, to address the security concerns accompanying their missions and none were more remote than the site at Los Alamos. Assistance payments to maintain community services were required in recognition of the nearly complete dependence of these cities on the then-AEC facilities that did not pay local taxes. 
Over the ensuing years, most of these communities moved to either attain economic self-sufficiency or were close enough to self-sufficiency that they could accept various buyout provisions to enable their self-sufficiency. As they attained economic self-sufficiency, their assistance payments could stop. But, Los Alamos remained the exception, partly because it had virtually no land suitable for development for any commercial opportunities--virtually all usable land in the county was under the control of the Department of Energy. 
Last year, we developed an agreement to end the assistance payments to Los Alamos County. That agreement coupled a buyout payment of $22.6 million that we appropriated last year along with provision of land to the county to enable commercial and residential development. It was essential to couple both the payment and the land together. Without the land with its potential for economic and housing development, a far larger payout amount 
would have been essential for the County to achieve self-sufficiency. 
This amendment directs the Department of Energy to evaluate the land under its control to determine what can be released without impacting the national security mission of the Laboratory. Now, some of that land will not be appropriate for economic or housing development, but does represent lands that were part of the San Ildefonso Pueblo at the time of the Manhattan Project. Many sacred sites of the San Ildefonso Pueblo are located on that property. During the Manhattan Project, those San Ildefonso lands became part of Los Alamos County, but no compensation was ever provided to San Ildefonso Pueblo. This current evaluation of DOE's land requirements provides an ideal opportunity to return to the Pueblo some of that land that they previously used. 
Our amendment recognizes that other parties have raised claims to some of these lands. Most of these claims result from homesteaded lands that were condemned when the Manhattan Project began, and compensation to the owners should have been provided at that time--but that must be carefully researched. The Department of Energy and the Corps of Engineers have been evaluating the legal basis for these claims over the past months, but this amendment asks that they go still further to provide every reasonable opportunity for these claimants to substantiate their claims. And the amendment precludes transfer of any land for which the U.S. Government does not hold clear title. 
This amendment then enables Congress to finish the agreement with Los Alamos County, by coupling land for commercial and residential development to the payout funds. It provides for return of lands to San Ildefonso Pueblo for which no compensation was provided. It further provides for a careful process to evaluate the legality of any outstanding claims on this land. And finally, through this amendment, Congress no longer will be asked to provide assistance payments to the county of Los Alamos. 
Madam President, I conclude by saying that there are many people in and around New Mexico that had previously owned lands in Los Alamos that were purchased during the Manhattan Project's location there. 
This amendment says, as to the land that may be conveyed, that if there are claimants, their claims will be evaluated and perhaps in some way resolved. 
I am delighted to have worked on that. I think it is very important to everybody in our State to know that will occur. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment is critical to recognize the mandate of the last Congress to stop assistance payments to the School District of Los Alamos, NM. under the auspices of the Atomic Energy Community Act of 1955. It enables the high quality of education in northern New Mexico required to attract the staff of the Los Alamos National Laboratory--the staff that enables the laboratory to fulfill its Federal missions. And it recognizes that many school districts in the vicinity of the laboratory are now contributing to the educational programs required by the laboratory's staff and that these districts must offer suitably challenging educational programs. 
The Atomic Energy Community Act of 1955 enabled assistance payments for communities and school districts impacted by the presence of major atomic energy facilities. These facilities were primarily located in remote areas, to address the security concerns accompanying their missions. Assistance payments were required in recognition of the nearly complete dependence of these cities on AEC facilities that did not pay local taxes. It was also in recognition that the quality of the schools available in these communities played a critical role in the recruitment and retention of personnel at these remote sites. And in those early days, most of the laboratory staff lived in Los Alamos. 
Over the years, most of these atomic energy communities moved to either attain economic self-sufficiency or were close enough to self-sufficiency that they could accept buyout provisions to enable their self-sufficiency. 
Of school districts, only Los Alamos still needed these payments. In last year's Energy and Water Appropriations Act, we noted that fiscal year 
1997 would be the last payment to the Los Alamos schools under the Atomic Energy Community Act of 1955. The Department was directed to develop other approaches for continued funding needs. 
The amendment we consider here today represents a critical step in providing required resources for the Los Alamos schools. It implements the plan developed by the Department to fulfill the congressional mandate. It recognizes that the personnel required at Los Alamos are now resident in many communities, not only Los Alamos, in the remote areas of northern New Mexico. The requirement to provide educational programs that will aid in recruitment and retention for the staff of Los Alamos National Laboratory is still present, but many school districts now house the workers for the laboratory--not only Los Alamos. Those districts also need enriched programs to accomplish their contribution to the laboratory's Federal mission. In response to the congressional mandate, the Department developed the concept of an educational foundation in northern New Mexico, that can supply educational enrichment funding to these school districts. 
This amendment authorizes funding to start this foundation and specifies that only interest from the initial Federal investment will be used for educational enrichment programs. The Department intends to fund this foundation, pending appropriations, over a period of about 5 years, during which time it will build the foundation's funding to a level to supply appropriate levels of enrichment funding to those districts impacting laboratory workers. 
The amendment is an important step in stopping further funding under the Atomic Energy Community Act of 1955 and fulfills the mandate of the previous Congress.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Is the Dorgan amendment with reference to base closures pending? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-domenici-nm-2-19970709</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to speak for a few moments on the subject. I will not take long. 
Mr. President, I rise in support of the Dorgan-Domenici amendment to require the Department of Defense to submit a report to Congress detailing the costs and savings of previously authorized base closure rounds and on the need, if any, for further base closure rounds prior to the Congress authorizing the Department to move forward with additional closures. This amendment stands for a simple proposition. It says that as Members of Congress we will take our oversight responsibilities seriously when major decisions that affect the lives of all Americans are on the table. It says that we will take a long hard look at where we have been before we chart a course for where we are going. We owe the people we represent a commitment to carefully analyze what the last four rounds of base closure dating back to 1989 have accomplished before we decide to give the authority to the Department of Defense to conduct two more base closure rounds. This amendment does not say that additional base closure rounds are not necessary, or that they will not be needed in the future. This amendment simply requires that the Congress be able to have essential factual data about the costs and savings associated with previous rounds before we authorize legislation that would give the Department of Defense the authority to conduct new rounds. This amendment is reasonable, it is fair, and it offers a common sense approach to the serious modernization problems we face. 
Mr. President, I want to make clear before I begin that I understand the argument of those who say that BRAC savings are an important part of the funds that will finance the future modernization of our Armed Forces and keep our military the most technologically advanced and lethal fighting force in the world. I understand that the Quadrennial Defense Review and the National Defense Panel established by the Congress concluded that further reductions in the DOD base structure are essential to free up money we need to modernize our forces. I am aware that in a recent letter, all members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff urged the Congress to `strongly support further reductions in base structure proposed by the Secretary of Defense.' Nevertheless, Mr. President, the question is not whether the savings are needed, the question is will the necessary savings for force modernization be present if we conduct two more rounds of closure? In that regard, no one can guarantee that the savings will be present after two more rounds. No one can guarantee the projected savings from previous rounds will be what they are currently estimated. The QDR did not guarantee the savings will be present, the National Defense Review Panel has not assured the Congress that the savings will be present, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff has not assured the Congress that the savings will be present if we close more bases. 
There have been four rounds of base closure--1988, 1991, 1993, 1995. They have resulted in decisions to close 97 of 495 major bases in the United States. Between 1990 and 2001 the DOD estimates that BRAC actions will produce a total of $13.5 billion in net savings. After 2001, when all of the previous BRAC actions must be completed, steady State savings are estimated by the DOD to be $5.6 billion per year. CBO estimates that it will cost $23.4 billion to close 
all 97 bases. These costs are mostly due to environmental cleanup at closing bases, 30 percent, additional operations and maintenance at receiving bases, 35 percent, and additional construction and renovations and receiving bases, 30 percent. 
CBO projects at total of $57 billion in savings by the year 2020. CBO estimates that DOD will save about $28.7 billion during the BRAC implementation process, 1988-2001, which means a net savings of only $5.3 billion during those years. Half of the $57 billion in savings are projected to come from lower operations and maintenance costs; a quarter from less spending on personnel, including civilians whose jobs are eliminated; the remainder comes from projected land sales. 
Mr. President, the main question we must ask ourselves is how reliable is this cost savings information? The answer, unfortunately, is that no one really knows. Not the Department of Defense, not the Congress, not the President. 
We in New Mexico have had a fair amount of experience with the base closure process and one fact that we have learned is that what the Department of Defense estimates in savings cannot, and should not be taken for granted. We need to examine carefully whether the savings promised have some basis in reality. The responsible choice is to see where we have been before we set a course of where we are going. 
For example, during the 1995 BRAC process the Secretary of Defense recommended that Kirtland Air Force Base undergo a major realignment. Before we took a long hard look at their numbers for costs and savings, the Department of the Air Force estimated that it would spend $277.5 million to realign the base while projecting a $464.5 million in savings over 20 years. 
Mr. President, what would you say if I told you that not only did we find that the Air Force's costs and savings were wholly inaccurate, but that after careful analysis by my staff, knowledgeable members of the community, and others in the congressional Delegation, the Secretary of Defense for the first time in the history of the BRAC process wrote to the BRAC Commission and told them that `* * * the recommendation for the realignment of Kirtland Air Force Base no longer represents a financially or operationally sound scenario.' 
Specifically, we found that if the Air Force major realignment of Kirtland Air Force Base passed that the Department of Energy would have to assume $64 million in conversion costs and that it would cost an additional $30.6 million per year to maintain the safety, security, and viability of the critical base operations that remained. 
Mr. President, the New Mexico experience with BRAC may be unique, but it serves to make the essential point that we are making with this amendment. The driving factor behind base closure decisions should continue to be the overall cost to the taxpayer. In our case, the original half-billion cost savings turned out to be a half-billion new cost to the taxpayer. The message of the New Mexico experience is that we need to carefully examine the Department's projected costs and savings in order to thoughtfully determine whether it is a wise decision to give the Department of Defense the legislative authority they need to conduct additional base closure rounds. The Dorgan-Domenici amendment will give the Congress the necessary data to make this decision in a 
thoughtful and precise manner. 
Mr. President, the Senators from New Mexico and North Dakota are not the only people who think that the Department of Defense's current costs and savings projections may not be reliable. The Congressional Budget Office says it `cannot evaluate the accuracy of DOD's estimates without empirical data.' In even stronger words the CBO states that the `Department is unable to report actual spending and savings for BRAC actions.' CBO recommends that, `Congress could consider asking DOD to establish an information system that would track the actual costs and savings of closing military bases. The system could apply to BRAC IV bases because DOD is just beginning to shut down those bases and virtually all the work remains to be done.' 
In addition to the CBO's analysis, the Government Accounting Office had this to say, `DOD cannot provide accurate information on actual savings because (1) information on base support costs was not retained for some closing bases and (2) the services' accounting systems cannot isolate the effect on support costs at gaining bases.' 
Mr. President, the task we have before us is clear. My advice to Senators is to make the responsible choice and let us take a careful look before we leap into two new rounds of base closure. There will be enough time for the Department of Defense to close additional bases if the costs and savings of the first four rounds prove to be accurate. Even those who argue for additional base closure rounds today will not tell you that the future of our military's capability rests on deciding at this moment in time to give the DOD the authority to conduct additional rounds of base closure. By making the responsible choice today and voting for the Dorgan-Domenici amendment Senators will show that they are concerned about the modernization of our forces by requiring the data that shows the savings required to finance that modernization will be present at the end of the closure process. 
Mr. President, I believe that the Dorgan-Domenici amendment will provide the information necessary for the Congress to make decision of whether to authorize additional rounds of base closure sound, well reasoned, and based on fact. I ask my colleagues for their support, and I yield the floor.  
Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Wellstone amendment would require the Secretary of Defense to transfer $5 million to the Secretary of Agriculture for school breakfasts 
The purpose of the nondefense program that Senator Wellstone wants to support with defense funds may be laudatory; however, the amendment is ill-considered and very problematic. 
First the amendment would, in principle, violate the bipartisan budget agreement that Congress has completed with the President and that we are working hard to enforce: the amendment would reduce the amount of defense spending the agreement specifies and would increase nondefense discretionary spending above the levels of the agreement. 
Second, the amendment would violate the intent of firewalls that Congress has adopted over the years--and as recently as the 1998 budget resolution that we just passed last month. As all Senators know, these firewalls are designed to prevent transfers between defense discretionary spending and nondefense discretionary spending, and they establish a 60-vote point of order against such transfers. However, the amendment has been modified to go to great lengths to circumvent a Budget Act point of order and has confused the issue of whether it actually constitutes a Budget Act violation. 
Third, the amendment imposes an unfair obligation on the Appropriations Committee. If the amendment is passed, the Appropriations Committee is given the Hobson's choice of having to repeal the Wellstone amendment or to seek a directed scoring of the transferred money so that it would count as nondefense discretionary spending--as it should. This would, in turn, require the relevant appropriations subcommittees to find offsets for this additional nondefense discretionary spending. If the Appropriations Committee reports a Defense appropriation bill consistent with the letter and intent of the Wellstone amendment, it will immediately be subject to a 60-vote point of order. 
For all of these reasons, the Wellstone amendment is bad legislation, and I urge all Senators to reject it, whether or not they favor the program that would benefit from this amendment.

Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. I hope that doesn't give me a license to speak too long, but I will do my best. 
Mr. President, the amendment I'm cosponsoring today is vital to continuing the progress of our Nation's programs focused on reducing the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Our colleagues Senators Nunn and Lugar initiated the Cooperative Threat Reduction program in 1991, and I was proud to join with them in the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act last year. Your votes by a 96-to-0 margin last year showed the concern that all of you shared with me that proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is a very real threat to the security of the Nation and one of the greatest destabilizing forces that could be unleashed on this Planet. 
In setting up the original Nunn-Lugar program and in passing the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act, the Congress agreed that our Nation's national security interests are best served by preventing the proliferation of any of the former Soviet weapons, components, materials, technologies, or technologists. Congress labeled the Nunn-Lugar programs as cooperative threat reduction and that phrase was chosen very deliberately. The programs are indeed cooperative--they involve our establishment cooperating with their establishment, and the programs involve threat reduction--reducing the threat to our Nation. 
Senator Nunn presents a series of powerful arguments on these programs in a foreword he recently authored for the book `Dismantling the Cold War.' He discusses the transition over the last few years from a world characterized by a high risk of nuclear conflict but also high stability, thanks to the sharply bilateral nature of that world and the fear of using any nuclear weapons. Now we have a period of low risk of massive global nuclear conflict, but also very low stability because of intensification of a wide range of real and potential conflicts around the globe. He notes that the current key question `is whether the U.S. and Russia, now as partners and as friends, can keep the world safe from weapons of mass destruction as we reduce our arsenals.' He argues convincingly against using the Nunn-Lugar program as a form of bribery to encourage Russia to undertake specific actions, simply because these programs are so strongly in our own best interest. In his view, `proliferation of weapons of mass destruction clearly is the number one national security challenge we face.' 
When we passed the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act, we required the President to develop an integrated administration plan for defending Americans against weapons of mass destruction. The President's budget submission for fiscal year 1998 should have been coordinated with his plan. But we haven't seen that plan to date--and the country needs it. I'm very concerned with the lack of coordination in national activities against weapons of mass destruction that this plan would enable and I call upon the administration to develop and release that plan. Further, I encourage that the final House-Senate conference report reiterate the concern from Congress that this plan needs to be a high priority item for the administration. But whether or not the administration fulfills this requirement, I believe that Congress needs to show its national leadership by fully funding the cooperative threat reduction efforts. With full funding, Congress can again emphasize, just as we did last year, that we treat the issue of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction very very seriously. 
John Deutch visited with a group of Senators just a few weeks ago to discuss his concerns with proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. He and his colleagues argued very persuasively for increasing the funds for defending our Nation against this threat above the administration's request. He argued that if the 105th Congress does not continue to strengthen U.S. capabilities to prevent and respond to the full range of nuclear-biological-chemical terrorist attacks, the country will remain unacceptably vulnerable to mass destruction terrorism. He stated that 
`the theat of terrorist attack with weapons of mass destruction delivered by unconventional means is an even clearer and more present danger to American lives and liberty than the threat of attack by ballistic missiles.' He also took strong issue with the current administration's lack of coordination of efforts to defend against weapons of mass destruction, and recommended that Congress take the lead in directing the administration to improve the coordination efforts. As I've already noted, this absence of a coordinating plan from the administration is serious and Congress must continue to demonstrate its leadership in this area by reiterating the national need for this plan. 
The United States is safer today thanks to the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici and Nunn-Lugar initiatives. This amendment will continue our progress to reduce the risk from `loose nukes' or aging reactors of Soviet design. Through the Cooperative threat reduction programs, there are over 1,400 fewer nuclear warheads deployed and many ballistic missile launchers are no longer a threat to our citizens, along with many other major improvements. Three nations--Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan--no longer have nuclear weapons. 
The International Nuclear Safety Program's funding is also being restored by this amendment, and it is critical to prevention of another Chernobyl. We need to apply the expertise of our national laboratories to help the former Soviet states reduce any risks present in these reactors. To some, the solution is to shut down these reactors, but it isn't that simple when they are supplying power that is critically important to their regions. The International Nuclear Safety Program is working and must remain at full strength. 
Of the three programs being restored in this amendment, I'm most familiar with the Materials Protection Control and Accounting Program. This program is absolutely essential to minimize the threat of nuclear materials moving to rogue states or terrorist groups. By far the greatest challenge to any of these groups considering creation of nuclear weapons is obtaining the special nuclear materials--the highly enriched uranium or plutonium that provide the fission energy source for the bomb. 
In the old Soviet Union, nuclear materials were protected with guards and guns. The guards were well paid with stable jobs. Today, those guards may not have been paid by their government for months. Those guards may be wondering where their next meal is coming from, and more willing to consider compromising the material they are charged with protecting. Workers in the nuclear facilities are in similar straits, and within the last few months we saw the suicide of the director of the Russian Chelyabinsk facility out of frustration for his inability to pay his workers. 
We simply cannot rely on outdated ways of protecting nuclear materials in a country faced with the economic hardships and turmoil prevalent in the former Soviet Union. We need modern systems monitoring and controlling these materials, systems of the type that have been developed in this country and are in place wherever nuclear materials are found in the United States. 
This program is an outstanding example of international cooperation. Work is in progress at more than 50 sites in Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Georgia, Lithuania, and Latvia. These sites are estimated to have 90 percent or more of the fissile materials outside of actual weapons--enough for tens of thousands of new weapons. The program is also an outstanding example of cooperation among our national laboratories--Los Alamos, Sandia, Livermore, Brookhaven, Pacific Northwest, and Oak Ridge National Laboratories are all playing key roles. 
As just one example of the program's accomplishments, at the Siberian chemical facility at Tomsk-7, by some measures the largest nuclear facility in the world, upwards of 100 tons of highly enriched uranium 
and plutonium are stored. Radiation monitors have now been installed at the exit portals of the facility, significantly improving security of all the material. And a wide range of additional security measures are in progress as well. 
The conference report language for the Nuclear Defense Authorization Act for 1998 raises the concern that the Department of Energy is not expending its allocated funds in this program. I've checked on the details of this concern and learned that the accounting processes required for this program cause as much as an 8 to 10 month delay between when funds are allocated to a specific project and when they are reported as spent after the work is done. We maintain good accounting for these funds by demanding that the projects be finished before final payment. Yet the funds must be in the Department at the time a contract is initiated. In contrast to the conference report, I learned that all fiscal year 1996 funds are committed and all fiscal year 1997 funds that the committee questioned will be fully utilized. Most of the fiscal year 1997 funds not reported as spent are already committed to contracts. 
The Materials Protection Control and Accounting Program must continue its efforts to reduce this serious threat. We have just recently seen new opportunities for the program to expand to include more of the Russian naval reactor fuels. We are on a course to have most of the known fissile material in Russia under some degree of protection by 2002. Significant security improvements have been completed in Latvia, Lithuania, Uzbekistan, Georgia, and Belarus; 16 additional sites, 12 in Russia, 2 in Ukraine, 2 in Kazakhstan, are scheduled for completion by the end of 1997. Fiscal years 1998 and 1999 are the most critical for implementing security upgrades at the very large defense facilities with most of the material. 
With our amendment today, we keep these key programs on target, focused on reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction. This amendment is a significant re-emphasis of the leadership demonstrated by Congress in the past in preventing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. These programs are a significant contribution toward a safer and more stable world for citizens of both the United States and world, both for the current generation and far into the future. 
I urge the Senate to adopt the amendment, which will replenish the three programs I have just briefly outlined, without which I believe we will be taking a giant step backward in the elimination, using the most modern means, of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, starting with nuclear and leading on into chemical and biological. We have to get started on the latter. Time is wasting and it is getting more and more difficult and dangerous. 
I yield the floor. 
Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, fellow Senators, the bipartisan budget agreement and the Domenici-Lautenberg amendment revised the asset sale scoring rule. The new rule prohibits scoring asset sales that would lead to a financial loss to the Government. 
Much work has gone into this. Democrats and Republicans have worked on it. Senator Bumpers wants to make a special exception for public lands. 
Let me suggest the awesome situation that he has talked about never has happened in the U.S. Senate. We have never tried to sell national parks. We have never had any commission to sell national parks. Somebody in the House had a wild idea, and, frankly, that is never going to happen here. 
As a matter of fact, this amendment, what we have already adopted, says that if there is any financial loss to the Government, you cannot count an asset sale. 
I make a point of order against the Bumpers amendment. It violates section 313 of the Budget Act.

I guess I am concerned that there might be a controversial amendment that is well-known that by design could be precluded from ever getting offered.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his very pointed remarks. 
I think I would just say also that I thought the Senator made a good presentation. Senator Conrad is always a contributor here. In fact, he voted for this Republican plan that he does not like here today, as I understand it. All Democrats on the committee voted for the bill in committee, I asked Senator Gramm, and he confirmed that Senator Conrad voted for the package. So I assume what we have going right now is something like this: A good bill was reported out of the committee. It had bipartisan support. It had Democrat support as well as Republicans. Now the Democrats have decided to bring back onto the American political scene the rich versus the poor issue. 
I want to say something about the President because the distinguished Senator attributed the entire growth for the last 4 1/2 years to the deficit package that increased taxes in 1993, and I will not go through what I believe caused it, and I will give the President some credit. I think the two things that economic historians will write are that the Federal Reserve Board for the first time in history has found out how to control interest rates in a very simple way, and they are doing it on a gradual up-and-down basis and they have kept this economy from going into cyclical downturns. 
That is No. 1. No. 2, I give the President of the United States credit for one thing. Once his deficit package went in, frankly, the President listened more to probusiness advisers in his Cabinet, probably led by his Secretary of the Treasury Rubin, than all the rest combined. And I think history will reveal that the President did great things by nonaction. In fact, he is not a typical President in that he did not take significant steps to hurt business during a regime of a Democrat President--to put on more regulations, to make it more difficult to beat them up and talk about business. He was the other way. And I think he deserves some credit for what he did not do that one might have expected from a Democratic President. 
You combine the two. The Federal Reserve is taking care of inflation and the President leaving the economy alone. This strong economy may still last for a few more years and defy some of the rules, although I doubt whether the ups and downs are finally done away with. I see a great economist in the Chamber. I am referring to the Senator from Texas. Maybe someday when we have the time he could talk about the economic cycle. 
But I come here today for two other reasons. First, Mr. President, I really do not believe it is fair to the American people for the other side of the aisle and the White House to continue to talk about this package as if it helps the rich and hurts the poor. 
First of all, Mr. President and fellow Senators, the only odd game out is the White House and the Treasury Department, who are furnishing the Democrats with the evaluation of the distribution of this tax cut package. No other institution of significance and broad acceptance is using that broad definition of income to evaluate the distribution of these tax cuts. And that is because the Treasury Department does not use the income that average people make to determine what bracket people are in. 
It might shock you to know, Mr. President, and millions of Americans, that what the Democrats are talking about magically turns into $65,000 income family out of a $40,000 actual-income family. 
Let me repeat. The Treasury Department's approach says, fellow Americans, taxpayers, what you are earning--and then you look at it and I am paying $6,000 in taxes--they are saying that is not your income. 
They take income, add the value of the rent of your house, the value of fringe benefits, the value of all your assets if you were to sell them--unrealized capital gains--plus the value of our pension and life insurance. That is why a family who thinks they earn $40,000 appears on the Treasury's charts as a family earning $65,000. 
Your income under the Treasury definition assumes that you are out on the street and you rent your own house. So they add about $8,000 or $10,000 to your income. Believe it or not, if you have any stock in any American corporation, even 10 shares, they have gone through the difficulty of imputing to you, the stockholder, the earnings of the corporation in which you have stock, even if they did not declare a dividend. Won't that be a shock to Americans, if they thought they were earning all that much money every year. 
Let me make our case on this side. Actually, we rely upon the Joint Tax Committee. They are bipartisan and professional. 
We did not use the White House's very strange way of calculating income called the family economic income approach which counts all of this phantom income I just outlined. 
I put a credit card up here just to show you about it. I call it the Family Economic Income credit card. This is what the administration would give to an American taxpayer as the White House's credit card. But like the familiar add campaign for other credit cards, if you want to really buy something, you better have a Visa card because the country's shop keepers don't take the Family Economic Income Card. 
Interestingly enough, Senator Gramm, if you took this Family Economic Income card to a store to buy something, it's no good. If you took it somewhere to pay your college kid's tuition, it's no good. 
This card inflates your income between 50 percent and 65 percent. It creates paper income. Or said another way, it counts phantom income as real income. So you can throw it away, just as you ought to throw away the evaluation of this tax package made on these kinds of evaluations. 
It is absolutely plain and simple, and I defy anyone anywhere, including editorial boards, those who are commenting on the news--you just go ask, ask the Treasury Department, `Is a $40,000 income earner who, under this package that the Republicans have, if that person, that family is going to get back a certain amount of taxes and you apply that to the taxes they paid before, and if the difference is a savings of $3,000 in income taxes, you ask them are they giving you credit for that? Or do they have some other process to evaluate what you got by way of a tax cut?' I assure you they will not give you credit for the tax cut you got, because they started out by figuring you were in a different income bracket. Isn't that amazing? That is absolutely amazing. 
How can somebody come to the floor and say this package is predominantly for the rich when one simple fact disposes of it? 
Mr. President, 78.8 percent of the benefit under this bill goes to families earning $75,000 or less. Senator Gramm, isn't that what you understood when the bill was reported out of committee? Isn't that what the Joint Tax Committee said to you? 
Because we put income earning limitations on the $500 child credit we designed the credit to target the middle class. The $500 child credit is a huge portion of this tax cut. And the next component that is significant is for middle-income Americans, is the $1,500 education tax credit. It likewise has income limitations. 
If you take those two together pieces of the package it constitutes over 82 percent of the tax cuts, how can it be that the charts used by the other side of the aisle are right? 
It is because some of the Democrats are not using the income 
that Americans earn. They are using an imputed income calculation called family economic income. Imputed means we count it as income if you did not earn it. It is as if your earnings include what you could have earned, rather than what you have earned. 
We want to make the point today. We are going to try very hard, against very difficult odds to rebut the media reports that this is a tax cut for the rich. The fact is this: 78 percent of the tax benefit goes to middle-class families earning less than $75,000. 
Mr. President, for those who want to look up here, this is the way the Joint Tax Commission of the United States, a bipartisan group, says these tax cuts are spread. Less than $10,000 gets .06 percent tax cut because they are not paying much taxes. Let's go down this chart. For people earning $10,000 to $20,000 the percent of the tax cut goes to 4.8; for people earning between $20,000 and $30,000 their taxes are cut by 15 percent; and for those earning between $30,000 to $40,000 their taxes are cut by 32 percent; those earning $40,000 to $50,000 their taxes are cut by 48 percent. 
That means families earning $75,000 of real income or less, 78.7 of this tax cut goes to them. 
If you want to report that the tax cut goes to the rich you ought to report that 75 percent of the benefits goes to American wage earners who are earning $75,000 or less. 
Having said that I want to move on quickly. There will be a little obfuscation because the White House will say this family income approach is not theirs, it was done in the Reagan White House. 
This is a way to figure out how much people are worth. And they did that as a model for tax reform. Does it mean that on income tax and other taxes that you are paying currently, that this is a true model of what your income is? Of course not. Because it assesses to you income you never earned, you probably will not earn, and it says it does not matter, we are `imputing' it to you anyway. That is the way you are distributing this money pursuant to those kinds of tables. 
Let me move, for a minute, to a couple of more facts. We are on the threshold of passing the largest tax cut in 16 years. It will help Americans of all ages and all brackets. Again, I commend the chairman and I commend the Democratic Senators who voted for the package. I thought it was an exemplary example of bipartisanship. As I said, apparently some of them if not all of them have decided to produce a new package today, just to prove a point and try to make a point based on White House Treasury analysis rather than those analyses done by the experts that represent us. 
Let's put this in perspective. Parents of 43 million children will pay $500 per child less in taxes; 4.8 million parents with kids in college and taxpaying students will have $1,500 more to spend; and 7.2 million recent job entrants will be able to deduct their student loan interest. That is a pretty big percentage of Americans, and a huge portion of Americana, and essentially all of them are, for all intents and purposes, all of them are middle-class Americans if you use $75,000 as the definition of middle class. 
Mr. President, the $500 child care credit will help the working poor and the middle class. The value of the personal exemption has been eroded over time, and the cost of raising a family has become more expensive. The credit in this bill will totally eliminate the Federal income tax burden for tens of thousands of families in New Mexico. I am particularly pleased that the Finance Committee decided to design the credit so that the working poor would also see the benefit of the $500 credit. Of the 718,850 families who file tax returns in New Mexico, 175,087 of them claim an earned-income credit. I applaud the Finance Committee's approach. It is a logical sequel to the new welfare reform law with its emphasis on moving from welfare to work. 
I want to speak for a minute and I hope every Senator avails himself or herself of this, the $500 credit will save New Mexico families $454 million over 5 years. 
A $500 per child credit is significant tax relief. According to the Heritage Foundation, a family with two kids eligible for two $500 credits would have an extra $1,000 a year in the family budget, and this amount would be enough to pay the mortgage for 1.5 months or pay for 15 months of health insurance or buy gas for the family automobile for 8 months.

Mr. DOMENICI. This bill provides some very, very good deductions and credits for going to college. So a tax cut, as I view it, is long overdue. In 1948, American families sent about 3 percent of their income to Washington for taxes. Today it is closer to 25 percent. I believe it is much better to leave more money in the hands of our families and our parents and our people. 
This bill provides eight separate provisions that help finance college. The most significant is a $1,500 tax credit for 50 percent of the tuition for the first 2 years of a 4-year college; 75 percent of the tuition paid at a community technical school. I believe the committee designed these right and I believe they make good sense. 
There is the deductibility of student loan interest. This provision automatically shifts the benefit toward children of low- and middle-income families. The $2,500 deduction of student loans and the interest on them is well designed, and it will produce some powerful incentives as students graduate for them to get on with their lives and get out from under the debt burden as soon as possible. This bill makes an exclusion of $5,525 worth of education assistance. 
Mr. President, I have additional remarks that analyze my State but I close by once again repeating: This is the chart of the Joint Committee on Taxation of the United States, that says this is the distribution of our tax cut based on income the American people are making. It has a few imputed things in it but nothing like the White House, and people will be surprised how much they are allegedly earning under the Treasury of the U.S. evaluation of their earnings. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I believe it is my turn to offer an amendment. I am going to offer an amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Lautenberg of the State of New Jersey. 
Before I send the amendment to the desk, let me just talk a little bit about what I am trying to do. In the agreement reached with the White House, on the very last page of it, the White House, members from both sides, and the House, agreed that we would, as part of enforcing this 5-year budget, that we would extend and revise the discretionary caps for 1998 to 2002 at agreed levels shown in tables included in the agreement, and to extend the current law of sequester, which had its early origins in T. Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. 
We also agreed within the discretionary caps we would establish what we call firewalls. They have been in existence for some time. We struck a compromise and said for now we would only extend them for 2 years instead of for the entire agreement, meaning we will have to bring those up in about a year, but we will have an opportunity on the next budget resolution, or the one after that, for those who want to extend it beyond that time, and I do. 
We also agreed, and I want everybody to understand this one, to return to current law on separate crime caps at levels shown in the agreed tables. That has to do with a matter that is of real importance to Senator Byrd, Senator Biden, and the distinguished Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm. That is an extension of the trust fund for crime prevention, to fight crime, which was established here in the Senate when Senator Gramm on one day sought to use up the savings attributable to a reduced workforce, as I recall, 
and then said in that, if we are going to save the money, we ought to spend it for something everybody understands and would be worthwhile. 
That trust fund then came into being with the amendment of the Senator from Texas, supported by Senator Byrd and others. Now, that law expires in 2 years, but we agreed in the sessions with the White House and the leadership that we would extend the trust fund within the caps for the 2 remaining years of that law, meaning 1998 and 1999, after which the Congress is free to pass a new law on the trust fund or whatever they would like with reference to the trust fund. 
But I think it is clear that without a new law, since that is a trust fund, you couldn't just continue to appropriate, and the trust fund is a fund set aside within the caps and getting the highest priority because it is already there in trust. 
We agreed to four or five other things that are less important, and then we agreed to extend the pay-go, pay-as-you-go provisions which had heretofore been adopted and become part of the Senate's working process from the year 1990. Those pay-go provisions essentially said, if you are going to raise entitlement spending, you must offset it with entitlement cuts or tax increases. If you are going to cut taxes, you must offset that with entitlement cuts and vice versa. 
We have in this amendment done all of those things. The distinguished Senator from New Jersey, who was part of the agreement and also my ranking member on the Budget Committee, joins me in sending a Domenici-Lautenberg amendment to the desk on this matter, and we ask for its immediate consideration.

<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want the Senate to know that this amendment is subject to a point of order, and I won't wait around for a point of order. I want the Senate to know that I am fully aware that this amendment is subject to a point of order, because it is obviously not part of deficit reduction. I am fully aware that a point of order could be made. I knew that from the beginning, and we knew that when we discussed extending this and putting in the caps for 5 years, which is the only way to enforce the discretionary savings in this budget. So I won't wait for a point of order. When the time is expired, I myself will move to waive the Budget Act in order to allow this legislation to be considered on this bill. 
I say to my fellow Senators, there are many process amendments around. When the Senator from New Mexico said I would not offer this on the first bill, about 12 amendments came tumbling down because they are all waiting for process reform. Some of those amendments I would sympathize with, others I would not, which is not necessarily very relevant. But I must make a point of order on each and every one of those, if the sponsors do not, that they, too, will take 60 votes, unless somebody has some magical way--and maybe Senator Gramm will try a magical way, maybe he won't--to try to get these amendments in at 50 votes. But I think everybody who wants to do these kinds of process changes ought to get 60 votes or they ought not get it done. That will be applying the law to everybody who wants to change our processes. 
I hope everybody knows we could be here for the entire remainder of this bill if everybody who has a process change intends to offer it. 
I will use no more time other than to shortly yield to Senator Lautenberg with reference to the amendment which he cosponsors. But let me make it very simple, if we do not adopt this amendment, or something like it, there is no way of enforcing the 5-year caps on appropriations. This was a three-legged stool. We get savings on the caps on appropriations, we get savings in entitlements, and we would do that sufficient to allow for a $85 billion tax cut, the third leg. There will be no enforcement of the appropriations total accounts that they can spend, and there will be no firewall between defense if we don't adopt something like this amendment. 
I think it is properly drawn, and I hope that we can adopt it later on this evening when the debate is finished. 
I yield the floor to Senator Lautenberg.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. Leader, we have worked with everybody that had process amendments. They don't have to offer them, and I am not asking especially for them to offer them, but I wonder if we couldn't get an agreement that would set in motion, so everybody would understand, these process amendments? Could I try a request on for you and see if you can agree? 
I ask consent that the withdrawn amendment No. 537, that withdrawal be vitiated--that is the one I offered--and that a motion to waive with respect to amendment 537 be made and that it not be amendable, the motion to waive is agreed to the amendment, and if it is, it be treated as original text. Then I ask consent that the following Senators, if they choose, be authorized to offer amendments for budget process: Biden, Gramm--Senator Gramm of Texas, Senator Bumpers, Senator Gregg, Senators Brownback, Frist, and Abraham. And if they offer them they would be taken up in that order tomorrow.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first of all, we discussed all of these issues in the very lengthy negotiation with the White House. Their packages in the past have been gifted by having the tax cuts be temporary. That is the way the President's budgets have been in the past. He finally came to the realization that that was not fair to the American taxpayers. So that concept was eliminated from the budget agreement. We are going to give taxpayers a tax cut, period. 
But also the argument that is being made that this may somehow explode in the outyears, we have an agreement that for the first 10 years it will not exceed $250 billion. I understand the valuation of this package is that we have done that in this finance bill. It is only $247 billion over 10 years. That is the best we can do. We are right on the money. 
I believe we ought to leave the agreement alone and leave this very good tax bill alone.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment, I regret to say, should be defeated. It creates a new overbudget trust fund for medical research. It is based on estimates. The biggest argument against it is if we save more money in Medicare than we expect under the budget agreement, it ought to go to Medicare. It ought not go to be used in an appropriated account. 
Essentially, this says, if we save more money than was agreed upon by the White House and the Congress in Medicare, the extra money goes to a trust fund for NIH. I believe it ought to stay right where it is and be used by the Finance Committee for Medicare and other purposes. 
I make a point of order that the amendment is not germane.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is going to be accepted. This amendment will reclassify certain Amerasian immigrants as refugees to exempt them from the restrictions on receiving benefits under the welfare reform bill. It costs about $1 million and has been accepted on both sides.

Mr. DOMENICI. This McCain amendment would reclassify certain Amerasian immigrants as refugees. Thus, they would be entitled to benefits of people similarly situated. The amendment costs about $1 million per year, and those on our side who handle these matters have indicated they are willing to accept it. I understand the minority is willing to accept it.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first of all let me say it is the position of the committee of jurisdiction that these children are covered under the $16 billion child care provisions of the bill. Since that is the case, I first would ask the Senator if he would like to withdraw the amendment and confirm that. If not, I would make a point of order against the amendment and he would have to get 60 votes to pass it.

Mr. DOMENICI. There are two amendments we are going to accept, and then we will proceed to a Kennedy education amendment. The first is a Harkin amendment, No. 498, on microdemonstration programs for welfare recipients under small business. Senator Harkin, we have agreed to accept that. There is no objection on either side.

Mr. DOMENICI. Let me say for Senators' benefit, it looks like there are only three to four amendments left. So, if you can bear with us for just a little longer, I know this has been an ordeal.

Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator, the chairman of the committee on Labor, Health and Human Resources. The chairman opposes this. 
Mr. President, the Kennedy amendment is a substitute to the Labor Committee's title. It violates the bipartisan agreement that we made with the President and with Democrats and Republicans. It is not germane to this bill before us. It violates the Byrd rule because it increases spending in the year 2002 and thereafter without any offsets. The Kennedy amendment reduces the student loan origination fees, and is offset by significant reductions in revenues to the lenders and guaranty agencies participating in student loan programs. 
With that, I make a point of order that the Kennedy amendment is a violation of the Budget Act and the Byrd amendment.

Mr. DOMENICI. Might I say to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, I think you have been in this position and the position of this chairman many, many times. I do not know whether we ever have a chance to be in exactly this position when we have a reconciliation bill like this. 
I might say, I think this amendment fits together a lot of concerns and fulfills a lot of concerns about the bill by many, many Senators. I hope the Senator would not ask for its division, but rather ask us to spend more time discussing it, which I believe, even though the consent agreement says a minute on a side, I think you might be clearly within your rights to say: This is a managers' amendment. Could we have some additional time? Certainly I would not object. 
I objected one time in my life to giving the distinguished Senator from West Virginia additional time when time had run out, and I vividly remembered that for at least 5 years. It seemed like every time you looked at me it was reminding me that I had jumped up and objected to your getting time, additional time. I have never done that again, so I would not do it now. 
I just wonder if that makes any sense to my friend from West Virginia.

<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I could not agree with the Senator more. But I think we have followed the rules--the general rules of the Budget Act, plus the Byrd rule interpretations--as best we can. I think everyone should know that one of the problems on any reconciliation bill is that when the time has run, people can still offer amendments. That is written right into the statute. It says that when the time has run, you can send amendments to the desk, and I assume one could stay forever--I don't mean literally--and they shall be voted on then and there. I believe it says there is no time on the amendment. We have gone from allowing 1 minute to 2 minutes to 3 minutes per amendment. We decided we would allow Senators to offer their amendments last night, thinking they would stay and offer them. We got caught in a trap because Senators started walking up to me and Senator Lautenberg and giving us their amendments and asking us, as managers, to introduce them for them. I guess I could have said no, and the literal interpretation would have been that if you are not going to be around here, you are not going to offer them. 
That was the genesis of what happened this morning. We put them all in order and tried to encapsulate them so you could understand them, and there were 64 of them, plus a couple of points of order. So we have done the best we could. As a matter of fact, I am very grateful. I would guess that more than 30 amendments were withdrawn--maybe 35. Others were clearly very simple amendments, and maybe in adopting them we should have used a little more words of explanation than we did. If that is the case, as to any Senator or anybody listening, we will just try to do better. But that situation is the law. 
Now, the law is, as you say it also. You can still divide those amendments and have that minute on every one, I assume. You know the rules better than I. I have learned them a little bit now. But I believe, from this point on, we only have a few left. We would be very glad on this one--I asked the chairman, and he would be glad to explain it now as much as you would like and answer any questions. I understand we would only have a few more, and three or four points of order, and, finally, this ordeal will be behind us. Again, you have reminded us of our responsibility. I thank the Senator for that.

Mr. DOMENICI. On those four amendments we will try, if the chairman of the Finance Committee will explain, we will try to ask the Senators the relationship. It is not obvious on two of them that they are related at all, from what I could see. I think they were just trying to see how these major health matters are going to get clarified here, which is not in this amendment. I don't believe they are even in this amendment. So we will find that out, and before we vote, we will try to have an explanation.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to yield all of the time to the chairman of the Finance Committee. But I do want to make one statement. 
My friend from Arkansas said, I guess, that today made him happy that he would soon stop being a Senator. 
Let me make sure, if there are only six people listening on television, that this Senator would like to say that it makes me very proud what we are doing here. I am very proud of this bill. I am very proud of the balanced budget. I am very proud of how we got here and what we are doing here. 
Frankly, if things keep going as well as this, I may break all longevity and stay here for a lot longer. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Sure. 
Let me say, Mr. President, to the Senator from West Virginia that there was a Hutchison amendment. It had to do disproportionate share of payments to hospitals, and there is a modification of that which had adversely affected Texas that is apparently somewhat ameliorated there. Senator Specter had the exact issue, and he had a disproportionate share of payments amendment. He is part of this overall agreement that is in this managers' amendment. 
Then there was a Bob Kerrey abortion amendment that had nothing to do with this amendment. But I asked him to wait for the managers' amendment before he did something on it. 
I assume that Senator Murray is going to make the point of order on that issue. But I am not certain of that.

Then there was a Senator Kennedy uninsured children's amendment that also seems unrelated. But he indicated that he would like to wait and see what happened to this amendment.

I think that is the full stint of those amendments and the stories behind them.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to address some concerns expressed by the administration with regard to two items they believe should be in this reconciliation bill. I would like to clarify what we assumed in the 1998 budget resolution for those items. 
The bipartisan budget agreement did include assumptions on additional funding for unemployment insurance benefits integrity and on extension of fees for SSI State supplemental benefit administration. In both instances, the budget resolution assumed that these proposals would be implemented by the Appropriations Committee, and therefore the authorizing committees were not instructed to achieve these savings in reconciliation. The budget resolution is the basis for scoring congressional action and cannot be changed in an ad hoc manner, that is, without passing another concurrent resolution to change it. 
I would ask the chairman of the Appropriations Committee if it is not also his understanding that these proposals are to be considered by his committee?

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me take 1 minute, and then we are going to final passage. I want to thank everybody for their cooperation. Under a very difficult process and procedure, I think we did very well. On a number of issues, there was great bipartisan support. I thank those on the other side of the aisle who have supported this overall package, and I hope the vote is overwhelming. Tonight we complete the first step of three legs. The three legs are to get the deficit down by reducing spending; second is for us to get a good tax bill for all Americans; third is to do the appropriations bills in a manner that is consistent with the agreement and which doesn't violate the Budget Act. 
I believe this is a historic beginning, and I am very pleased to be part of it. I thank everyone here for their role. I thank all eight committees that assumed their burden and produced their reconciliation package. Mostly, I thank Senator Roth, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and Senator Moynihan, his Democratic manager, and all those on the Finance Committee who worked to produce a bipartisan bill. 
The lesson learned is that we can get things done that are difficult but good for the American people in a bipartisan way if we just work at it. I believe the best example we have of that is the Finance Committee this year. All the other committees had lesser responsibilities, but they provided their savings without rancor and with almost unanimity and, if not, a unanimity of spirit. I believe there is no process that would have let us in the U.S. Senate get this much work done. If this bill were freestanding and the tax bill were freestanding without the protections of the Budget Act, I just ask you to dream about what might happen. First, I think each bill could take 4 or 5 weeks, I think the amendments could run into the hundreds, and the bill could look like something completely different by the time we finished than what we started with. So we take some bad with the good in this difficult process called the reconciliation bill. 
I thank the ranking member of the Budget Committee not only for the work here on the floor, but actually as we moved through the last 3 1/2 months, Senator Lautenberg has been very good to work with, and we produced a good package, which will show up here in a bipartisan vote tonight. I thank the Senator. We produced a good bill.

<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes to respond to the distinguished Senator from Maryland. 
First, let me suggest that there are some Senators who want tax cuts. There are some Senators who want only certain kinds of tax cuts. I have never found a tax cut that the Senator from Maryland agrees with. 
So we ought to start the argument by understanding that he is against the tax cut in this bill and probably any comparable tax cuts because he just doesn't like to cut taxes. 
Having said that, let me just talk about some of the arguments he made. First of all, I am very pleased that this is a bipartisan effort to create some sense out of the havoc that is going to come down on the Treasury of the United States if we don't find some way to control home health care costs under part B for the seniors of our country. 
Everybody should understand, including the seniors, that what we did in this package and what is being done in the House package is very, very beneficial to the senior citizens. In each bill we took half of the home health care costs--the fastest growing program in America, on average, 30 percent--we took half of that program out of the trust fund thus eliminating imminent bankruptcy. And we said, `Seniors, you don't have to pay for that out of your trust fund.' 
We did not hear anything from seniors, or the AARP, other than the AARP said `thank you' because, obviously, that is a very big gift which we did in order to make that trust fund solvent. We then put that amount of money down, and said let the taxpayers pay for it. So the Finance Committee came along and said, well, if the taxpayers are going to pay for it, we ought to start putting some control in it so that it will make sense in terms of costs. And the argument has been made by those who oppose what the committee did--and I don't serve on the committee--but the argument has been made that there are many poor seniors who can't afford the deductible. 
Let's repeat again. If they are poor, the Medicaid Program of America pays their deductible. Let me repeat. For poor seniors, the Medicaid Program pays their deductible. 
Frankly, I believe every other aspect--I am not an expert but I asked about this--every other aspect of delivering health care, hospitals and others, all have some kind of deductible. They do not have a deductible because we like to charge people where we could afford to give them something free. But we have deductibles so that everybody understands, including the recipient, that the program costs some money. Historically it has been a pretty good way to get that message across to the users. 
The last argument being made by my friend from Maryland is a New York Times article that says the tax bill, which will come up next in the Senate and which already is on the House side, except ours is a little better in terms of the middle-income people--and he has an article from a newspaper which says that the tax bill is not good for middle-income Americans. 
Let me suggest to the Senate that we don't have a New York Times article. We have the Congressional Budget Office. We have the Joint Tax Committee and every major accounting firm in the country that looks at this say to the contrary. In fact, let me tell you what the overwhelming evidence is that will soon be available from the Joint Tax Committee but also what our own firm that does our work for us says. They say that, at a minimum, 75 percent of the tax cut goes to those Americans who earn $75,000 and less. That is not a bad distribution. 
In fact, I believe before we are finished, when we take into account the other things the Finance Committee did, it will probably be more like 78 percent of all of the tax cuts that are in this package will go to people in America earning $75,000 and less. 
Now, that leads me to believe that those who want to attack the bill because of its distribution among taxpayers just do not want any tax cuts or, and here I will say unequivocally, that the White House chooses to attack this package because they have their own method of figuring out how much the American taxpayers earn and, believe it or not, the White House criticism--I yield 5 additional minutes off the bill--believe it or not, under the White House approach taxpayers should understand--and I say this to my friend from Texas--if they own a house, they are charged under the White House approach to this with receiving rent from the house equivalent to its value. So if you earn $25,000, and you have a house worth $100,000--the rent should be $10,000 on the house--you have earned $35,000. 
Now, in addition, they also say if you have any capital gains--listen to this--they impute to you the value of the capital gain. 
Now, the point of it is that the Joint Tax Commission approaches it in a completely different way. Accountants who have looked at it--and I will put a letter in from a major accounting firm--tell us that, indeed, this distribution under this tax bill, which is probably made better when they put $250 into the earned-income tax receipt--that probably makes the distribution better, but they tell us it is like 75 percent for $75,000 and under. 
Now, I want to try to make a point because already the American people have been told, principally by White House spokesmen, that this tax bill is for the rich. We ourselves must set about to tell the American people the truth, and that will not be easy because every time somebody stands up who opposes the capital gains tax or the like, they are going to immediately say this tax bill is not good for average Americans. 
So 3 years ago, in 1993, now on 4 years, the White House used, I say to Senator Gramm, this same method of distributing earnings in another venture with the Congress, and I want to read and quote what David Brinkley said on one of his ABC wrapups of his own show about the way the White House figures the distribution of taxes, and so let me start. All of this is a quote from him.  
A few words about Federal taxes and what some of the great minds in the United States Treasury are thinking about. The Treasury likes to calculate the American people's ability to pay taxes based not on how much money we have but on how much money we might have or how much we could have. For example, a family that owns a house and lives in it, the Treasury figures that if the family didn't own the House and rented it from somebody else, the rent would be $500 a month, so it would add that amount, $6,000, to the family's so-called imputed income. Imputed income is income you might have had but don't-- 
Said the distinguished news man Brinkley. 
They don't tax you on that amount. 
Nobody taxes you on that amount. 
Now, concluding: 
The IRS does not play silly games like this. Instead, the Treasury calculates how much you could take away from us if you decided to. If that were the system, consider the possibilities. How about being taxed on Ed McMahon's $10 million magazine lottery. 
Maybe you might get that so why not tax you based on that. 
I didn't win it, you say, but you could have. The Treasury must have something better to do---- 
He said. 
If not, there's a very good place for Clinton to cut some spending. From all of us at ABC-- 
He went on to say-- 
Thank you.

Mr. DOMENICI. But essentially you can do all of these kinds of models for different purposes. The purpose that it is being used for now is totally distorted in terms of what the American people themselves are going to realize and who is going to realize the benefits of this tax bill. So wherever anyone will listen, we will hope to get our oar in alongside of the Democrats--some, not all--who say this tax bill does not help average Americans.

Mr. DOMENICI. Well, Mr. President, I am suggesting that for those people who are covered by Medicare today and those who are going to be covered by it in the future, it has been discussed on the floor of the Senate today that people are going to be shocked and they are going to have no insurance. I submit, if you are 36 years of age now, when you get to be 65, you will have 2 years added. So for people 36 years of age, it will be 67. How do any of the arguments made about not having coverage apply to that? Are they not going to have coverage? Of course, they are. If they have Medicare today, they are going to be working 16, 18 years from now, too--unless we assume everybody is no longer going to work, so you won't even qualify. Frankly, maybe we will not do this before the time this finishes conference. I don't know. The House didn't do it. 
But all I am trying to say is, if this is a major issue between the two parties--and luckily it isn't because some Democrats have the courage to face up to the truth--so no matter how much the leader on that side says this is distinguishing between the parties, there are some Democrats who agree with us. If it is being said that this is going to just annihilate senior citizens, I thought we ought to put a chart in and let Americans look at it. Let's ask a 36-year-old, would you rather have a chance of having Medicare solvent so it will be there for you? Or would you rather insist that when you get to be 65, you get it, even if we were to tell you we greatly enhanced the chance of it being there if you wait until 67? If it is a chasm between our parties, let me suggest that it is a little, tiny chasm. It has nothing to do with great philosophical differences about who is for seniors and who is against them. That is just rubbish. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me just suggest that if we are going to go back and forth, we will have disposed of two Kennedy amendments in a row. And then I assume we should get at least one, if not two, and then return to that side. And I would like to do that. Senator Gramm has a simple amendment that should not take very long. We would like to do that next, but I am not asking that we have time agreed to. And then is there another one on our side? 
We then move to your side. You have one for Senator Reed.

<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thought I would just suggest to the Senate and those listening how many senior citizens are covered by this means testing. And here is what I think it is. First of all, let me put it in dollars. The premiums collected over the next 5 years amount to $125 billion. The income-conditioned premiums, the means-tested premiums, amount to $4 billion. That is 3.1 percent of the premiums will be means tested. 
What does that amount to in numbers? The best we can figure, out of 38 million Americans, it is 5 percent--5 percent will be financially affected by this amendment. 
So if you are going into some neighborhood and talking to seniors about this, chances are pretty good that you are not talking to a senior that is affected by this because only 1 out of 20 will be affected by this and 19 will not be affected at all. 
I think that is a pretty realistic approach to trying to change this basic part B law to be more realistic to those people who are working hard, paying taxes, are not even earning as much money as the retirees, perhaps raising two or three children, and unless their employer is paying insurance for them many do not have insurance. So I believe this is a good approach, and I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time. 
How much time do I have?

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is the amendment, 600 pages long. We do not know what is in it. We do not know if it meets the budget reconciliation instruction. We do not know what the Congressional Budget Office says it does to reduce deficits. It is obviously subject to a point of order, which I will make in a moment. 
But I just want to remind Senators so we will know tomorrow that this bill also forces us to vote again on at least three amendments that passed by rather large votes here today. 
It retains the medical care eligibility at 65. We have already passed an amendment that over the next 30 years implements an age increase to 67. 
It strikes the home health copay, which passed by rather substantial margin. 
It eliminates the means testing of Medicare, which we just finished debating about 35 to 40 minutes ago and which passed with a rather significant vote. 
It eliminates medical savings accounts as a Medicare option. Now, we have not voted on that yet. 
But those are some of the things that I know are in it. 
I yield back any remaining time that I have. 
I make a point of order that the amendment violates the Budget Act, 310(b).

<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I obviously would be remiss if I did not thank Senator Wellstone for his diligence in this regard. I think the time is now upon us, with the overwhelming passage of an amendment last year which I sponsored along with my friend Senator Wellstone, which essentially said for the private sector, if you are going to cover people that have mental illness, you have to create some parity for the mentally ill; that is, you cannot say they have less coverage per year or less coverage for the life of the policy. That set a very big wave of movement in the country to try to establish 
nondiscrimination in these kinds of efforts. I think business is beginning to work its way through it. 
Today, we offer an amendment very similar. It says the coverage that is going to be afforded to children under this bill, if mental illness is covered, it shall be covered with the same kind of coverage that you provide for the physical illnesses. 
There is a escape clause of a sort that has to do with making sure we are not impeding the formation of HMOs and managed care. 
Nonetheless, I believe the time is right to try this one on in the country. We are moving step by step, leading to a point where mental and physical ailments will be treated the same in terms of coverage. We need not make long speeches tonight. We made those to the Senate heretofore and we received very warm response. 
On this one we do not have that much time. I yield whatever remaining time I have. I understand the chairman and ranking member of Finance have no objection to the amendment.

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-domenici-nm-109-19970624</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. Well, let me just make a couple comments, because we will not be able to say much tomorrow. 
It is with regret that I oppose this amendment, and actually I will raise a point of order because I believe it is subject to a point of order. I will do that tomorrow. 
But, you know, it is kind of interesting. I do not know what money we are going to be using. You see, what the amendment says is, you take the estimates of what we are supposed to save in this reconciliation bill from Medicare and Medicaid, and then you, whatever those estimates were, you take a look and see if the new estimates say we save more. 
Well, this is an estimate of an estimate. And I do not really know where the money comes from. I mean, do you wait until the end of 5 years and then get the reality check, or do you do this based on estimates? 
Now, that is just purely technical and budgetese. But, frankly, as much as I would like to put more into NIH, I believe it is not right to take savings that accrue on the entitlement side of the ledger that are estimates and attribute that in advance to any function in Government, which is what we are doing here. If we are clairvoyant enough and wise enough in the future, and understand the future well enough to say if we are saving money in Medicare and Medicaid, all that savings ought to go to just this one program, how do we know there are not some health programs that need some of that money? How do we know they should not be used for tax cuts? That is what they are permitted to be used for now. 
And last but not least, I just do not think we need another trust fund. We have plenty of trust funds. We ought not create another one, to use the sense-of-the-Senate vote by which every Senator expressed an opinion and said, as I read it, we sure hope that within 5 years we could double NIH. If you asked 100 people that voted for that, if they thought we were going to be able to achieve that, I believe 100 percent of them would have said probably not. So to turn around and use that to take a slice of savings that might be applied either to the deficit, to tax cuts, to other entitlement programs, and say we just think now we ought to cut that off and we ought to put them in the NIH, I do not believe is good budgeting. I do not believe it is a very good way to advance fund anything. 
So I will use my minute tomorrow. I will not have as much time as tonight to indicate what great respect I have for these two Senators. Everybody knows that. Senator D'Amato from New York is one of my best friends in the world. But I do not believe this is the right approach, and I have to resist it. 
Mr. President, I make a point of order that the amendment violates the Budget Act.

Mr. DOMENICI. So I better not be thinking for a while. The $3.9 billion that we transferred into the trust fund for Medicare from part B savings, what if we are over by $3.9 billion? Do we take the $3.9 billion out of the trust fund and make it less weak and put that money in here? 
Second, I was just thinking, where have we done this before? You might all look at this. We did this because Senator Byrd at one time wanted to set up a trust fund so we could use a lot of appropriated money on crimefighting, because we had found kind of a bird's nest of money when some Senator decided that we were going to cut payroll for the Government. 
And so Senator Byrd said, well, if we are going to do that, let us put that trust fund in crime prevention. But, you know, over time all it has done has been--it is a business, it is an accounting thing. You give that committee, to start with, that entrusted money, but that does not mean that the appropriations give as much money to the committee they would have if you did not put that in, and you end up getting no more money for crimefighting. You cannot solve that riddle with additions from an entitlement program. 
So I will think about it. I will be glad to do that.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think what both sides are waiting for now is to prepare all of the amendments that we are going to offer en bloc in an appropriate unanimous consent request--both Senator Lautenberg and myself. So the time is going to be much to our advantage because we will not be here very long after we get started on that. 
Mr. President, when we first started negotiating with the President of the United States, the Republican and Democratic leadership, the Budget Committee chairman and some others asked how are we going to get through these contentious issues? Some Republicans on our side said how will we be sure what we get done will be signed by the President? That had to do with the reconciliation bill that we are going to finish tomorrow about noon, it had to do with the tax bill, it had to do with the 13 appropriations bills. 
My stock answer was it seems to me what we have learned over the past 4 years is that the best way to get that done is to have the proposals done in a bipartisan manner. That is, send to the President proposals that are both Republican and Democratic in terms of the party affiliation of those who support it. 
From what I gather, at least in the U.S. Senate, the epitomy of that is Senator Roth and his chairmanship, with his ranking member, Senator Moynihan. For even today, on almost all of the amendments that the Finance Committee either offered or were challenged on, almost every member of the Democratic Party voted for--not all, but almost all--and you saw the results. Some of the issues that we were never able to do before in a reconciliation bill following a budget resolution were done today and they were done with overwhelming votes. 
The general understanding in this place that contentious, difficult matters would never clear the point of order under the waiver because it requires 60 votes was dispelled today because of the bipartisan nature of the results desired. I believe that will hold true. I am hopeful when we go to conference that the same thing will happen, that the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, who has most of these matters even if he splits it up into subcommittees, that it will come out of there bipartisan and we will continue to work with the President. 
We want to tell the White House that we know the bill which will be cleared tomorrow is deficient in at least two places and we will have to fix those in conference because we cannot fix them here today. We will tomorrow in an amendment to be offered by Senator McCain, Senator Lott, and myself, attempt to bring the revenues to be received from spectrum closer to the mandate in the reconciliation bill. We are hopeful everyone will support us on that. It will be short by a bit. 
Unless other things mesh out when we go to conference, we will be short the balanced budget by a couple of billion dollars in the last year. We will work very hard on that in conference to try to fix it. 
I look forward to the same thing happening. In fact, some said, how are we going to be sure we do not get Government closure on the appropriations bills when the President vetoes the bills and we close down Government, and my response to most, there is no magic to it. We will not be able to do it by some kind of statute. We tried that. Obviously, it didn't work. I said the best way to do it is to have bipartisan appropriations bills that have been worked on in an effort to meet the agreement which the President joined us on and where there was no joinder because it was not required, that the contents be at least bipartisanly supported. 
Now, our chairman is trying to do that in appropriations. If that continues, I think two things result: We get it done; and second, the American people praise us for it because I believe that is exactly what they want us to do. 
Frankly, that does not mean we have to give away our philosophy or our ideas. In many instances it will take a long time to get where we want to go. I assume the Democrats are saying the same thing on their side, wondering when they will take over again and be able to move it in their direction. None of it will occur in 1 year. It will take longer. We will get only part of what we want. 
The tax cuts are not sufficient when you take into consideration the huge burden imposed on our people, but we also, some of us, recognize we are also spending a lot of money and as we diminish that spending and decrease it, maybe we can have even more tax cuts in years to come. I hope so. 
So that is the way I understand what is going on. I feel good about it and, in particular, the support that was so bipartisan on many critical issues here today. If that can continue, I am almost positive we will end up in early October giving the American people one of the best legislative sessions with one of the most significant accomplishments in modern legislative history. 
Staff is copying the lists so we can do the amendments en bloc, but one amendment that did not get into that is one by Senator Abraham.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me try for a couple of minutes, and if Senator Lautenberg would like to chime in, and obviously the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee is here. 
I think it is fair to say, for starters, that the issue of uninsured children--that is, children without any health insurance--has been a longstanding issue. But in all honesty, it has only become an issue that has been looked at diligently in an effort to see how you might change the way we were doing things this year. 
As a matter of fact, it is very interesting, if uninsured children as a class were a big insurable group, it is interesting to note that you could not buy health insurance for children. In other words, if some State had decided, `Let's go ask Aetna or somebody else, do you have an insurance policy we can buy just to insure kids?' it is within the last 6 months, I understand, that for an exclusive child health care insurance policy--it is a very short-lived instrument that exists. For starters, nobody knew exactly what it would cost. 
There were two other things that came into the discussion, and that was there are at least two ways, maybe three, of getting insurance. One was to expand the Medicaid system, which will cover some of these uninsureds in any event, but to expand it further so that it would encompass more. That amount was estimated by those who do that kind of work. But there were not really any real estimates on if you did it the second way, which was to let the States either provide it or buy insurance for them--those numbers were not readily available. 
So some will say that the $16 billion was too much. In fact, one of our Senators who has studied it diligently believes you could cover all the uninsureds for less than $16 billion. Others say when you are finished with the $16 billion, there 
will still be some that are not covered. I do not believe a magic formula was arrived at in the Finance Committee. I believe there are those who said not enough prevailed. They found a source of money in a compromise cigarette tax--$8 billion out of the total of $20 billion in revenues from that was used for that one function. 
Now, frankly, I'm hopeful for myself, I'm very pleased we did not go the Medicaid route. Neither the House bill nor the Senate bill made it singularly a mandate that you cover the children under expanded Medicaid. In both bills--in the Senate bill they are allowed the option of taking a block grant to be administered by the States, and that is one of the amendments that was around here tonight--what kind of coverage would that be? 
I am hopeful when we are finished and get this implemented that we will see to it that we are able to measure what we are doing with that money and how well we have covered people. It may very well be--although for Government money, I doubt it, because whenever you put it out there I assume it will get spent--but I am hopeful if it is more than necessary, we will not spend it, although I assume that might not happen. That is the best I have.

I am sorry, from my standpoint, that I can't be more technical on the amendment. I believe there is a lot of objectivity that is lacking, and I am sure that is going to evolve with time. Your question seems to be very relevant and germane to a serious problem. 
Mr. President, I believe on our side, and soon to be followed on the Democratic side, we are prepared to ask unanimous consent that a series of amendments be in order for tomorrow's stacked event that we have spoken of.

Mr. DOMENICI. I reserve 5 minutes of my time, and then I want to yield to Senator Roth if he is ready to offer the amendment. 
Let me just make a couple of points. Obviously, the seniors in the country, and even the AARP--not specifically with reference to this $5 deductible, but with reference to home health care--there was a general understanding that when we moved a part of home health care from the trust fund to the part B, which is paid for by the general taxpayers, working men and women with kids who do not have any insurance and nobody gives them any, when we moved it to the general fund and the ratio of payment was 25 percent for seniors and 75 percent for the rest of the taxpayers, that in exchange for moving the home health care to that part B, there would be some additional fee. 
I am not arguing that every fee that was imposed--it seems like there were two--that those were agreed upon, nor am I speaking for anyone whose name I just used. But, obviously, the agreement contemplated that if we moved part of some or all of that home health care that was under 100 days, it more likely belonged with a doctor instead of with the hospital, that there would be 
some additional premium paid into the part B, the 25 to 75 ratio that I have just described. 
Second, the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, raised $1.5 billion on the agreement, and says that when the new fee is imposed we will use $1.5 billion to accommodate the lower income seniors so they won't be burdened by the new fee. I understand the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, when he offers a broad amendment in some other areas, is going to take that $1.5 billion into cognizance and do something about rectifying what is clearly a misunderstanding and a shortcoming in the Finance Committee bill vis-a-vis the agreement. 
With reference to the agreement that we worked out, it is clear that there is no restriction on the Finance Committee or any other committee to do more than contemplated in the agreement. So we cannot look to the agreement every time a committee does something. What we do is we look at it to make sure they did at least as much as we asked. And, in the case of the issue before us, I understand it was almost unanimous in the committee. 
You all can argue that as a committee later this evening or tomorrow. This was not all Republicans. It was Republicans, and all the Democrats supported the fact that something had to be done about these spiraling costs of home health care. Am I somewhat correct?

I myself am very desirous of leaving the Senate shortly and leaving it to Senator Roth to offer two additional amendments, and perhaps the Senator from Minnesota wanted to offer one more. And that would be all we would do this evening.

Mr. DOMENICI. I understand that the leadership has indicated there will be no votes today, which does not mean there will not be amendments offered. We hope that we will take a few amendments and debate them and then put them over in some stacked regime for tomorrow. 
I also understand there are 20 hours of debate equally divided on this bill. Is that correct?

Mr. DOMENICI. And that there is also an agreement between the leaders that we will use 10 hours of that 20 today before we recess. So I think that sort of sets the stage for those who are interested in attempting to modify the bill before us. 
I have a couple of technical consents. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the presence and use of small electronic computers be permitted on the floor during the debate and discussions on this measure.

Mr. DOMENICI. What I would like to do is make a few opening remarks, yield to my friend and colleague Senator Lautenberg, and see where it turns out. 
Today the Senate begins consideration of S. 947, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Some people wonder, when we had the debate and told the American people that we finally had reached an agreement, 5 years in duration, that would get us to a balanced budget, some people wanted us to tell them precisely what the agreement contemplated when, as a matter of fact, the agreement covered only a portion of what must be done by Congress. Then, in addition, a budget resolution was taken up on the Senate floor. During the discussion of that budget resolution, people would ask questions like, `What changes are there going to be in Medicare to make it solvent for the 10 years that are being promised?' They might ask the question, `What is going to happen to Medicaid under this budget proposal and this agreement?' 
Frankly, for the most part, we told them what we knew and we told them that, in due course, a piece of legislation would be coming through that would change various laws of the land and would accomplish the goals, the savings required over the first 5 years and estimated over 10. And now, today, to put it into perspective and so the process is understood better, the committees that were charged under that budget resolution to do things--for the most part to decrease the cost of programs within their jurisdiction, within their authority; in a couple of instances they were asked to increase slightly, the expenditures--essentially those committees, eight in number, have done their work and now what we have is a law, what could be a law, that is a bill, not a budget resolution. 
The bill before us is a very special bill. It is called a reconciliation bill. That is significant in the U.S. Senate, more significant than in the House, because in the U.S. Senate this proposed bill, this reconciliation bill, is granted some very powerful immunity from the rules of the Senate. The biggest one is the bill cannot be filibustered. So you see right off, when I asked the question, is it not correct that there are 20 hours of debate on this bill?--and the Parliamentarian answered yes--that is by law. In other words, we came along and said these bills should not be delayed. They are part of getting you the budget changes you need, and they deserve a privilege of being immune from filibusters. So the law set down how much time would be used for debate. 
In addition, you will hear throughout the next 2 days some interesting verbiage. We will talk about amendments to the bill. Again, this bill is not an ordinary bill. Either by the statute that created the process or by subsequent enactment of the Congress, we have said that it is very difficult to amend this bill. So, essentially almost anything you try to do to this bill that changes matters of real substance that are in it are generally subject to a point of order and require 60 votes, if the point of order is made on a waiver, to make them germane and thus subject to being added to this bill. 
In the meantime, since that law, we adopted another rule for ourselves. The more we did these the more we found that Senators found ways to get around what was contemplated. So, what we did, with the cooperation and assistance of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, we adopted a rule for ourself about this bill and we have now named it after the Senator. It is called the Byrd rule. Essentially what it says is that matters within this bill or matters attempted to be added to this bill that do not substantially decrease the deficit--that is, if you introduce them, for instance, to do away with a commission, but it really isn't there to save money--then the Parliamentarian will rule that it takes 60 votes to pass them. 
This is very different from an ordinary bill that comes before this body, which is the most generous parliamentary body in the world in terms of permitting Members to make amendments and argue what one might even call irrelevant matters to a bill pending. So, as an example, you can have a bill coming through here on education and somebody can get up and say, `I would like to debate the troops in Bosnia.' They would get up and they could introduce a resolution or a statute on that education bill 
that says we are going to be out of Bosnia in 6 months. Frankly, it is debatable for as long as the Senate wants to debate it and it cannot be stricken for germaneness or relevance because, under the Jeffersonian rules that we adopted and parliamentary interpretations, we are free to offer nongermane, extraneous amendments to the bill. 
In any event, Members now are familiar enough that they do go ask for some assistance before they up and offer an amendment to just change this reconciliation bill and do things their way. On the other hand, they may offer them even if they are not germane and subject to the Byrd rule, and everybody knows they are apt to be defeated because it requires 60 votes to concur in their adoption. 
So that is about where we are. Again, getting back to where we are, this legislation is the first reconciliation bill that was instructed by that budget resolution that we talked to the American people about, in terms of getting to balance. It was about 2 weeks ago we adopted that resolution. It told these eight committees of the U.S. Senate to do some work to change some laws. In a sense, this represents the first leg of a three-legged stool that must be constructed to implement the balanced budget, and the bipartisan budget agreement that attended it, that the Speaker of the House and the majority and minority leaders of the Senate agreed and concurred on on May 15. 
I characterize this as the first leg, because that historic agreement, to be fully implemented, requires changes both to entitlement spending, that is this first reconciliation bill; changes to our tax laws, that is the second reconciliation bill; and then, in due course, there will be 13 appropriations bills that are annual spending of money that will have to be kept within the limits prescribed in this agreement and also will have to provide some priority items that were agreed to between the President and Congress for matters that pertain to crime, education, and about 13 different items. Some are small, some are large. We have to try to put those in their appropriate place in the appropriations bills. So, I characterize this as the first leg because the historic agreement, to be fully implemented, requires changes in both the entitlement spending and changes to our tax laws and, also, limits on the annual appropriations spending account. 
Obviously, it is complex. I do not know if we could get anywhere near where we are if we did not have these bills, which are privileged, as I indicated, for many of them would go on in debate for 3 or 4 weeks and many of them would be so burdened down with amendments that you would not recognize the bill when you finished. So, we are ready to take the cumbersome nature of it all and work as hard as we can so that by September 1 we have all three legs completed and perhaps the procedural changes that we must get to enforce it, which will come along here shortly, and thus be where we ought to be to reconfirm to the public we are on a path to a balanced budget. 
Last week these committees of the Congress completing this bill, this first leg, were quietly adopting spending limits established in the agreement for the upcoming fiscal year. Later in the debate on this reconciliation bill, I will offer an amendment, hopefully with my ranking member, Senator Lautenberg, to establish appropriation limits for the next 5 years as required by the agreement. I understand Senator Lautenberg is concerned about one aspect of that. We will try to work together on that. 
So, before the week is out, the Senate, in rapid succession, will have built the three legs of the stool necessary to carry out the bipartisan agreement which we negotiated over a period, generally now understood to be as long as 5 months of negotiating. Among those three legs, first the entitlement spending bill is before us today and, I repeat, immediately after it the second leg, the tax reduction bill, will follow, and then in due course the appropriations. When completed into law and signed by the President--and I am hopeful the two reconciliation bills will be, and I am hopeful that before September 1 arrives we will have passed all the appropriations bills, thus enabling Government to operate for another year--what we will have is we will have set about to balance the Federal budget by 2002. 
If that works, and I have no reason to believe it will not, it will be the first such accomplishment since 1969. Reducing Federal spending compared to current Federal spending projections, spending will slow by nearly $290 billion over the next 5 years. And if the reform policies we adopt this week continue unchanged, we will have reduced Federal spending by nearly $1.1 trillion over the next 10 years, counting the debt service that we will not have to make because of reduced borrowing. Changing the scope of spending measured by the size of a growing economy resulting from this balanced budget plan, Federal spending will decline from 20.8 percent in 1996 to 18.9 percent in 2002. 
Frankly, when I started, in 1974, as a member of the Budget Committee, I really was skeptical as to whether we would ever break this 20 or 21 percent of spending versus the gross domestic product. 
We will be down to 18.9 when this budget agreement is fully implemented. Again, that will be the lowest level since 1974, and, more important, 52 percent of the 5-year savings will be derived from reduced entitlement growth, particularly through the reforms and changes made to Medicare and Medicaid Programs and, in particular, on Medicare, to avoid the bankruptcy of that program. 
Funding priority programs will achieve balance in 2002, and the agreement does assume some directing of our limited Federal resources to priority programs, such as children's health, assistance to disabled citizens, education, environment, transportation, crimefighting, and international affairs. 
Reducing Federal taxes. When we complete the second reconciliation bill, the agreement will have been achieved to reduce taxes on American families and businesses to provide incentives, savings and investments and to provide relief for families with education expenses. 
Enforcing the agreement, when we finally complete work this week, will be extended and strengthened because we are going to add to the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 and give the American people assurances--as sure as we can--that we will live by these decisions, because to break any of these caps over the next 5 years will require a waiver of this agreement and will require a supermajority of 60 votes. 
So, Mr. President, I say to fellow Senators, in short, this could turn out to be a very busy and, hopefully, a very successful week. It will be a week in which the fiscal policy decisions we make will resonate for many years to come. As it relates to the immediate bill before us, I thank the eight committees, their chairmen and ranking members, for acting as quickly as they did to report to the Budget Committee their legislative pieces which will carry out the agreement. 
The legislation before us is, in very large part, consistent with the agreement. However, in a few areas, the legislation does not comport with the agreement. An argument can be made that certain provisions are inconsistent with the agreement. Obviously, we will work on those over the next 2 days. Under the Budget Act, the Budget Committee could only bundle the eight committees and the language given to us for this report, and I quote from the statute, `without any substantive revision.' 
It falls to the leadership and us in the full Senate to attempt, where necessary, and to the extent the rules of the Senate permit, to make changes that might result in it being made more consistent with the agreement and, I also want to mention, to the extent it is not totally inconsistent in some areas. There is one additional opportunity to fix it, and that will be when we go to conference with the House. They will be working on their bills simultaneous with this, and they will be off the mark in a few areas. When we go to conference, we will attempt to reconcile those differences and make them as consistent with the agreement as possible. 
I remind all Senators and their staffs, again, that this bill is on a special fast track, as I have alluded to. It is actually the paramount special fast-track legislation provided for in the laws and rules of the Senate. So amending can be tricky. I have already indicated that germaneness and not being extraneous are very important, and you can violate those standards only with 60 votes. 
So over the next 20 hours allowed on this legislation, I anticipate we will have four broad areas of amendments, and not all will be germane and probably many will be extraneous, but nonetheless, we will need to consider, first, as I mentioned earlier, the agreement calls for enforcement under the strict rules of the reconciliation budget process. Enforcement could not be considered in the committee. Any enforcement legislation similar to 1990 and 1993 will need to be considered on the floor. The joint Budget Committee staffs and the administration officials have been preparing such an amendment, and other Senators will probably also offer their amendments to enforce the agreement. 
Second, there will be a group of amendments that may need to be considered to bring legislative language into compliance. I will work with the leadership and the affected committee chairmen and ranking members to make sure that these amendments are necessary and consistent with the agreement. 
Third, the legislation before us falls short of the deficit reduction target assumed in the agreement. It may be necessary to consider some amendment that would bring the legislation before us into compliance, or modifications to the agreement will have to be considered. 
Finally, the legislation before us includes provisions on which the agreement was silent. Some of these in the Medicare area have been controversial, such as means testing of the Medicare deductible or gradually increasing the age when individuals will be eligible for Medicare. I am sure we will have some hearty discussions about these provisions, and there will, obviously, be amendments to them. 
So now, Mr. President, the Senate business and work lies before us. It is important work for the country's fiscal 
future. After nearly 2 years of debate with the administration on how to achieve a balanced budget, it is work that, once completed, I think, will become law and will balance the budget. It has been way too long in coming. I look forward to closing a chapter in the Senate at the end of this week, perhaps as late as Saturday, and immediately upon return from the Fourth of July recess, to reconcile with the House our differences and get this completed as early after the Fourth of July as possible. 
I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senators for listening. I yield the floor at this point.  
Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.

Mr. DOMENICI. I just want to thank Senator Lautenberg for his observations and his comments. Whatever words he had to say about me, I appreciate. 
I say, I have just an evaluation that is mildly different. I think, considering the great bulk of things the committees had to do--and, you know, we had an agreement for the first time that told them they had to do certain things; before it was a very vague instruction--I think they did fairly well. I mean, I think we can count on the fingers of our hands--probably even if we did not have all five fingers, we could even on less than five--the areas that they did not comply with. I think they are going to work with us to try to get those done. 
Obviously, there is one that is difficult that has to do with the radio and television spectrum. That is a little more difficult. The administration told us we could get a lot of money and, if we did not go that far, it would not last. It turns out it is very hard to do that. But we are working on that, in a bipartisan fashion also. 
I say to Senator Wellstone, you have been here for a while. Senator Judd Gregg has indicated that it was all right with you if he proceeded.

Mr. DOMENICI. First, I compliment Senator Coverdell, so soon after completion of the tax package and deficit reduction package, for him being on the floor encouraging Senators to evaluate it and to speak out. I think it is fair to say that no one has had an opportunity to review, in detail, the tax bill that was written last night. Sometimes people confuse the Budget Committee with the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee is the tax-writing committee. It has a lot of additional jurisdiction, including Medicare and Medicaid in the Senate. The Budget Committee does not write the laws. It writes the budget resolution. But we try our best to keep abreast of what is going on. 
The reconciliation bills will be up next week, and there are some very technical rules about these bills. We will be careful to advise everyone on how to apply those technical rules and the way that is best to get the issues framed in the Senate and get the votes proceeding. 
Today, I want to indicate that the package of tax cuts that the Finance Committee passed last night, from this Senator's standpoint, is a very exciting package. In the Finance Committee package, approximately 82 percent of the tax relief is made up of a family tax cut that we Republicans have been promoting for almost 5 years, and education assistance priorities, which we all share. Let me repeat that we are going to hear a lot about some of the other tax proposals in this bill. But our American citizens ought to understand that out of every dollar in tax reductions in this bill, no matter what is said about the remainder of the package, 82 percent of the tax relief is made up of the $500 child credit and education assistance in this bill. 
It represents the biggest tax cut in 16 years. 
Now, some complain that it is not big enough. The American people should know that, in our efforts to get a balanced budget put together, this is not a huge tax cut. In the first 5 years, it is around $85 billion. To put that into perspective, we spend about $1.6 billion every year. Our gross domestic product, the sum of all input into the economy, is well over $5 trillion, moving toward $6 trillion. So this is a tax cut that permits us to do some good things for the American taxpayers, and I repeat that approximately 82 percent of the package goes to families that are raising children; they get a tax cut of $500. We call it this fancy name, `tax credit.' But, essentially, a tax credit means that if you owed $5,000 in income taxes, you can take $500 off of that $5,000. There is no other way to say it than it is a tax cut. Most of it is for working men and women in America who are not particularly wealthy. 
We are never going to be able to produce a tax cut package that some Senators--particularly on the other side of the aisle--are not going to moan about. They are going to moan that it 
goes to the wrong people. Well, some of them don't want a tax cut at all. Some just have to find something to make sure that the poor in the country believe that the other party is serving the poor better than we are. That is just too bad, because it is obvious in this American society, to most people that look at our economic situation, that we ought to be doing more on the capital formation side of this equation. 
So while this bill is finally and firmly tax relief for middle-class families, it does include some relief from capital gains taxes, and for people with a home. It gives them a very generous $500,000 exclusion from capital gains tax for people who sell their house. But it also provides some capital gains relief for many millions of Americans who sell an asset, be it a few shares of stock, a piece of real estate, a family lot that they inherited from their parents, or stock on the stock market. And we have not gone wild with reference to this capital gains tax. It is a pretty reasonable one, considering that we don't have an awful lot of money to spend. 
Obviously, no matter what is done with reference to death taxes, there will be some who complain that you ought not change death taxes, even though we haven't changed the basic exemption for many, many years. While inflation has built up, we have left it just like it was, and now millions of Americans--not a few hundred thousand--are looking out there saying that 50 to 55 percent of what they have accumulated on death is going to go to the Federal Government. We don't think that is exactly right--most of us--on our side. We think there ought to be much more concern about the energizing of society and this economy that comes with people who work hard because they want to accumulate wealth. We don't want to take that away by making the death tax so onerous. We haven't been able to change it very much in this bill, but there is some improvement. It will take 10 years to be fully implemented. Frankly, we will hear some more about that, too. It is obvious that it is easy to talk about that as if it were something bad for us to try to give some relief to these kinds of Americans who worked hard to build a business up, who have been smart and accurate on how they have done things. We are going to give them some tax relief. It is a small portion of this package. It is something we want to do. I am sure there are many Democrats that want to do this also, and I am quite sure something like the death tax relief in this bill is going to become law. 
Now, let me repeat, this bill provides a $500 tax credit per child, beginning the day the child is born. By making changes in the order that the earned-income tax credit and new child credit are taken, the Finance package adds about 900,000 more children who will be eligible for this tax relief than the House version of this bill. I believe that this change that we now have a bill that we will not be accused of being unfair to a very large part of the working people in the country. 
The earned-income tax credit--although it has been dramatically increased--was a Republican idea, incidentally, for those who wonder. Ronald Reagan was a staunch supporter of saying to those who want to work for a living that we want to encourage you to work, even though you are not making a lot of money. We want to discourage you from going on welfare by giving you this earned-income tax credit. So it is for working adults who are not earning enough in the eyes of Congress and past Presidents, and so we give them that earned-income tax credit. 
When you look at the rest of this bill--at least the major components--the cost of a college education has increased 234 percent since 1980. The bill helps families save for college, helps students pay for college and pay back certain loans, helps employers pay for their employee's education, which many of us have thought for a long time is a very prudent thing to do. If you need more education in this society for better jobs and for the transition required in today's job market, if an employer wants to pay for it, we don't understand why the employer should not be able to deduct that and why the employer should be paying for that as if 
they earned money. So we are fixing that, to some extent. It includes tax relief for education assistance provided by the employer side, which I have just alluded to, and it helps employees maintain what many think is a new characteristic of American society, which is maintaining a lifelong learning opportunity. 
It provides capital gains to help people generate more incentive to invest in U.S. companies that provide jobs and help grow this economy. One of the interesting things is that people can be in favor of jobs, but oftentimes it is very difficult to make the case that there are a lot of ways to create jobs, and they are not singularly--in fact, the worst way in terms of cost effectiveness is for the Government to provide programs that create jobs. We do that sometimes. In fact, in the bill before us, we are going to have a $3 billion, 5-year program on welfare jobs. Frankly, we agreed to it. I have very slim hope this initiative will succeed. But we agreed on some things that I did not believe in and this was one of them. 
When you invest in capital formation and help American companies grow, they can build new modern plants, install efficient technology, you, as an investor and a citizen, are deserving of an accolade that you are helping create jobs. And so a capital gains tax cut should recognize that jobs were created and the country benefited from the investing and risk taking that the investor was willing to take. 
Actually, the capital gains provisions are pretty good. Last night the committee partially corrected the discrimination against real estate--real estate that is depreciable, whether it is a building, whether it is an office storage, or an office building, we came very close to mistreating those investments. Thanks to some amendments last night, it is getting closer to at least a reasonable treatment of the gain that comes when you sell that kind of an asset. It won't be the same as the other asset sales, be it stock equity or your home, or other things, but we are moving in the right direction. 
So I am pleased that the Senate bill treats capital gains investment on real estate better than the House bill. I hope we keep that. It lowers the recapture rate to 24 percent. I actually believe that, in due course, it ought to be the same as the overall capital gains rate. I know my friend from Georgia agrees with that. You only have so much money to go around and you can't do everything. 
Now, I understand that one of the things we have problems with in our country--and I don't stand here saying that the IRA's in this bill are going to solve it. But America is now becoming known, worldwide, as the country that doesn't save. We love to spend, but we don't like to save. We are very fortunate that, for the last 15 or 20 years, or so, our credit has been so great, and our economy so stable, and the country so stable, that a lot of foreign money flows into America to pay our debts. 
But essentially, so long as we run big deficits--and hopefully we are putting a stop to that--and so long as the American people do not save otherwise, we are still going to be the world's largest borrower and the world's worst saver; that is, as a people and as business and as Government goes. 
On the other hand, we are moving in the right direction. I for one think that we ought to have universally IRA's. But we are not going to get there until we totally reform the Tax Code. But there are some powerful IRA provisions in this package. I am not sure that all of them will stay through conference, and I am not sure that some won't be attacked here on the floor. But, nonetheless, the idea of doing something to encourage savings by middle-income Americans instead of just those who are at the top of the ladder is very exciting to me. Countries with the highest saving rates are moving in the direction of greatest economic growth. Greater economic growth translates into better jobs, bigger paychecks and higher standards of living. For the higher the savings rate--Japan has a high savings rate--some people say, `Well, they don't do it voluntarily.' It is almost mandated by their government. But at least they do, and the government almost tells them how much of their paycheck has to go into savings. 
Some of the other countries in the Pacific rim have great savings prospects for their people. We have to do better. And we will be doing better, if this bill becomes law. 
I alluded earlier to the death tax, and I am not going to say much more about that. 
But I do want to comment that I wish today I could tell people of New Mexico--and I wish everybody could know in their States--the exact impact of this tax bill on their States and their constituents. I understand, however, that the Tax Foundation has done that for the House bill. 
So, if you want to know what the House bill has done in terms of the citizens of your sovereign States, you can get that. It looks to me from what I can discern in terms of my State of New Mexico that the tax relief numbers attributable to the people of my State from the Ways and Means bill are worthy of stating because I think the final package will result in bigger tax cuts for New Mexicans. I think the Senate Finance package will result in bigger tax cuts than the Ways and Means package. So I will be able to say to New Mexicans that we are going to do at least this and probably better. 
Let me just recite to show how important it is to a small State like mine. New Mexicans will save $388 million over 5 years because of the child credit in the House bill. New Mexicans will have $388 million of their own money to spend on their families as a result of this tax package. We are doing a little better under the Senate version. 
It is common knowledge that, if you look at New Mexico you discover that we have a lot of children in the families of the working poor. So I would assume for the working people who pay taxes that my State will get a higher benefit as a result of the ways the Finance Committee `stacked' the earned income and new child credit. That is a pretty good chunk of money that will stay in New Mexico rather than coming to Washington because of the $500 credit. That makes it kind of understandable. Mr. President, $338 million-plus will never leave our taxpayers' pockets in New Mexico and come to Washington. It will stay there. 
Mr. President, New Mexicans will also save $229 million in additional dollars of their own money to spend on education for their children. 
There are a couple of glitches in the bill. There will be a big debate about should there be an IRA for education after the 13th year or 14th year. But when it is all taken into account the House bill has $229 million that will stay with New Mexico families to use on education that they would otherwise send to Washington for us to determine how to spend it. And, obviously, we are very convinced on this side of the aisle that both the child credit, the education-type deductibles, and the like are better determined 
there in my home State--and the Senator's State of Georgia by his people, and our people. So as much of that as we can leave there the better we feel and the better we think the lives of our people will be. 
So while this bill has a road ahead of it that may be thorny and may be contentious--I am not speaking only of the tax bill--I believe it is not too soon to come here and say, `Well, this is what I am going to try.' There will be some additional spending money on child health care. And I know that. I have an open mind. I want to hear the committee talk about it and report on it. I am of the opinion--and I know it doesn't set well with some States--but I think the cigarette tax portion of it was inevitable. We could see that coming. And I think the committee took 20 cents instead of 43 cents, which was proposed by Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch, or Senator Hatch and Senator Kennedy. And then it used that money for very good purposes, I think, of the bill. It spent some. And that is why many would like it all to have gone for tax cuts. 
But, you know, the bill came out with total bipartisan support. And I am not sure we need total bipartisan support on every major measure as it goes through the Senate. But I believe we started this budget exercise with a strong suggestion that we might get the package adopted. Frankly, that was because we recognized that the President was not of our party and that we had to work with Democrats here in an effort to get something that the President would sign. There is no use going through another process as in 1993 where Democrats just passed a huge tax increase or 1995 where just Republicans voted for an enormous tax reduction plan with reforms in every area only to find that it would get vetoed. 
The reality of it is--and Republicans are beginning to understand--that we have a President who is not of our party. He is the President. If we want to make a point, we can make a point. When we want to get something done, it is pretty obvious that we have to have him as a part in getting it done as a team. 
So I am hopeful. We are moving in that direction. 
I thank the Senator for arranging the time. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator should also add that as the deficit turns into debt--that is the accumulation of the deficit, the debt--you have to go out and borrow that money. And essentially that is not saving. To the extent that you have to go borrow the money, you have to get it from somewhere. And our biggest activity for not saving has been the deficit. It gobbles it up, and it isn't available. It is used for that, if nothing else, plus the fact that high taxes prevent you from being able to have any left over, which is your premise here today. We are not in the greatest shape in just that one area. The economy looks pretty good. It looks like we are moving in the right direction in how we treat our American business. It seems like they have a little more freedom than European companies. We find that they do better for us and better for workers that way. That is better than most countries. But saving is still something that we are working very hard on. If we can get the deficit down to zero, we are surely moving in the direction of putting more savings into the total pot of savings for growth, prosperity, and other uses. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will try to use less than 10 minutes. 
First of all, Mr. President, let me commend the Judiciary Committee, and in particular, the subcommittee chaired by the distinguished Senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions. 
Frankly, I am of the opinion that it takes us too long to address issues that are obviously important to the American people. That is why I urge we not let this year pass without passing a major Federal reform of our Nation's juvenile justice system. 
The Federal juvenile justice system is a very small part of the overall justice system, but it does have a very big impact on how things are going out in the States, and in many instances needs reform so it does not stand in the way of the difficult job that our cities and States have in this new evolving era of juvenile crime. I am sure some of the talks on the floor of the Senate today have indicated some of the areas we must reform. I will leave that to those who are on the committee. Those are patent. They are clear. But they will be highly controversial. 
Nonetheless, we should do something to make sure that our laws are not in the way of cities, counties, and States--reasonable, rational efforts to control this major, major criminal epidemic. 
Having said that, I believe we also ought to take a lead role in suggesting to our States that if they want some Federal help, then they must modernize their juvenile justice systems. 
It is very strange in America, that we have had for many, many years an adult system of justice, a penal system, probation, and the like. What is new to America is that more and more of the crime is being committed by young people from 13 to 18 years of age. The proportions are exponential in terms of growth of juvenile crime of a serious nature. 
I am not talking about when we were growing up, maybe shoplifting or truancy, which is probably 90 percent of what the police were concerned about with kids. Now it is murder, it is gangs, it is thievery, it is drive-by shootings, it is all kinds of violent criminal acts that are scaring the adult population for two reasons. They are fearful for their own lives, and they also wonder what will happen to this generation of teenagers if that group committing these crimes grows and grows. Where will we end up incarcerating them? 
Mr. President and fellow Senators, there is no question the system is not working. Go to your States and ask how many times must a teenager commit a serious, serious crime before they are taken from society and put into some kind of penal system to try to keep them from committing more crimes and try to help them. It is startling. In many jurisdictions they commit as many as 10 to 15 serious crimes before anything is done to them. It is amazing how ancient, archaic, and broken down the juvenile justice system is. 
It didn't come into being and take a long, long time to perfect itself. It was put together in little pieces and patchwork, where it actually, in many instances, just doesn't work. 
Now, what we have tried to do--Senator John Ashcroft and I have introduced a bill that does a lot of things. But after participating in a series of hearings in New Mexico and talking to victims, it was absolutely something that, as long as you are a Senator, you won't hear anything worse than hearing from the victim of teenage violence. I heard from a beautiful young girl who is a dancer, who for no reason was just stabbed in the throat. She was doing nothing, not causing any commotion at all. We heard about the trauma that beset that young woman and her family and the way the juvenile justice system treated her and the family. It is as if the only thing that counted was the accommodation of the criminal, not the victim. 
But what we would like to do is to set up a $500 million program that is essentially an incentive grant program. Part of it will go to the States just to help them with juvenile justice, and the other part will go to States who choose certain options to modernize their system and make it work better. What we heard over and over again is that we wait too long before we do anything to correct the situation among teenagers. 
Now, anybody that has been a parent--and I have, and I note the occupant of the chair has, my dear friend, because I hear about them often. If you let them get away with little things and more little things and more little things, and you do nothing, when they do something a little worse, it is too late. If you wait long enough, without some corrective measures, you will find yourself engulfed in serious misbehavior. Kids learn by receiving some kind of punishment for every misdeed and wrong act they do. Even if it is a tiny punishment, to know that they are not getting away with it and they must shape up is obvious to everyone who has raised children. The justice system must do that also. No misdeed must go unattended, regardless of how small, even though the punishment would be small. We call this graduated sanctions, and it is an important part of our bill. 
We have set out in our bill, which we hope will be incorporated, a number of things like that. And many, many other important reforms that we found out there in our hearings would have to be adopted by our States if they desire to receive additional money to help them in this, what must be a war on teenage crime. 
If we wait too much longer, we are going to, once again, be a joke as the Federal Government. We are going to come along and society is hit with this pending disaster. They are will wonder where the Federal Government was. Some Senators are going to come to the floor--I hope not many--and say it is none of our business. The States ought to take care of crime. 
I will tell you, I have learned that there is no easy way to draw a line about what is our business as a Nation and what is a State's business as a State. But we can all say that the one thing that is not getting any better in America is juvenile crime. It is getting worse. As statistics show, some of the adult crimes are coming down a bit. The Senator has been part of these hearings. But, juvenile crime continues to go up and up. 
So I am very hopeful, and I challenge our leadership--I already know what our distinguished leader Trent Lott thinks about this. But I think at the first opportunity we have we ought to get this bill reported out and get it to the floor. The public would be very excited about a debate on this issue. We debate many things they aren't interested in. But they would be interested in this and in the philosophy, and perhaps the difference in philosophy between the two parties on this, too. 
I thank the Senator for yielding time and for arranging this morning's discussion on this very, very important issue. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record a graduation speech given by Wendy Gramm at Tri-State College. I think it is an inspirational message to young people. Wendy, while very accomplished in her own right, is also the wife of Senator Phil Gramm. While this speech is about a significant man in her life, she recalled stories about her father, not her husband. 
The central message of the speech is drawn from the personal experiences of three generations of Wendy Gramm's family. Mrs. Gramms' father graduated from this institution of higher learning with a degree in engineering. 
During this commencement, Wendy was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from her father's alma mater. In her speech, Wendy talked about the traits that made her father successful. Mrs. Gramm's point is that these same traits can make the graduating class a success. These traits include: define goals, work hard, show leadership, practice the highest standard of ethics. 
Wendy Gramm gave the students her definition of what makes a leader: `Leaders lead by example, and must show honesty and fairness always.'

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution that recognizes the large disparity between funding for Indian tribal colleges and mainstream colleges. Unfortunately, tribal colleges and technical vocational schools are barely able to keep up with growing enrollments. While many Indian colleges, like Crownpoint Institute of Technology, perform valiantly and have solid records of job placement, they are struggling to educate Indian students with roughly half the resources available to other colleges around the country. Indian colleges receive on average of $2,972 per year per pupil, compared with $6,200 per year for mainstream community colleges. 
My statement analyzes this situation further and concludes that the 105th Congress should pay more attention to Indian education as we reauthorize important education legislation like the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education and Applied Technology Act, the Higher Education Act, and the Tribally-Controlled Community Colleges Act. Hopefully, Senators will review this resolution and come to the conclusion that we are not doing right by Indian colleges and Indian junior colleges, and we could do a much a better job of educating Indians in America. 
Mr. President, Indian education remains far behind standard education in America. There are many reasons for this sad state of affairs. The problem is particularly acute among Indian colleges, where the average annual expenditure per student is $2,972 per year compared to $6,200 per year for mainstream community colleges. 
It may surprise my colleagues, who may assume that the Bureau of Indian Affairs is primarily in charge of Indian education. The fact is that 87 percent of Indian students in America in grades K-12, are in public schools. Only 10 percent of all school age American Indians are in schools funded by the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
While younger Indians are among America's fastest growing population, funding for their schooling gets further behind every year. While most elementary school Indian students are clearly in public schools, their educational attainments remain far behind most non-Indian students. In the federally funded Indian colleges we are seeing much larger student bodies; they are fed by both the public and Federal school systems. 
Federal funding for Indian schools simply has not kept pace with the population growth among Indians, and we are seeing this problem is particularly acute among Indian tribal colleges. 
I thank my colleagues, Senator Inouye, vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and Senator Campbell, the committee's chairman, for joining me today to alert the Senate to this large disparity in education for American Indians. 
Most Americans and many of my Senate colleagues know, that, despite recent income and job increases due to Indian gaming activities, American Indians remain at the bottom by most measures of social and economic well-being. Thirty-one percent live below the poverty line; almost four times as many Indian children over the age of 5 live in poverty compared to nonminority children; life expectancy is the lowest among all ethnic groups; and housing conditions remain substandard for the most part. 
In terms of educational attainment, half of all American Indians in the fourth grade--in both BIA and public schools--read below the expected proficiency level, compared to 42 percent of all students who are below this level. American Indian students have the highest dropout level of any racial ethnic group at 36 percent. They also have the lowest high school completion rate and the lowest rate of college attendance. Only 66 percent of all American Indians are high school graduates compared to 78 percent in the general population. 
Mr. President, our resolution is really quite simple. We are asking the U.S. Senate to take note of this large disparity in educating American Indians. We ask that the Senate reaffirm the Federal Government responsibility for the education of American Indian and Alaska Native children. This obligation is spelled out in treaties, court decisions, Presidential Executive orders, and public laws. Our resolution delineates several key pieces of legislation that will be pending before the Senate in this Congress. Included in this list are the Higher Education Act of 1965, the Tribally-Controlled Community Colleges Act, the Educational Equity in Land-grant Status Act of 1994, and Head Start and Healthy Start. 
In addition, when the Senate considers reauthorization of such national education acts as the Adult Education Act, the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education and Applied Technology Act, and the Individuals With Disabilities Act, we simply ask that special attention be paid to the great needs of American Indian students. 
We also need to consider the establishment of a governmentwide policy on Indian education that will better coordinate and address their educational needs, so that more of our citizens will be better prepared for life in the 21st century. It is our intention to work closely with the appropriate Senate committees to raise the level of educational attainment of American Indians for greater participation in our expanding economy. We hope to bring the funding disparity to a close within a few years. We can hardly expect Indian children to be well educated on less than half the resources we spend on the average American student. 
I urge my colleagues to join in this effort to become aware of the educational needs of American Indians and to help us find ways to close the gap.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, within a few short days, Charles Gentry will be leaving his post as my administrative assistant after many years of distinguished service in the legislative and executive branches of government and 11 years in the U.S. Army. 
Charles has served on my staff twice. First as my legislative director and now as my administrative assistant. 
During his first tour of duty on my staff Congress enacted the partial deregulation of natural gas. It was a major undertaking. It was complicated. It was contentious. Charles masters every aspect of this complicated piece of legislation. Looking back, natural gas deregulation proved to the country that our Nation has massive quantities of natural gas and that market forces would work to everyone's advantage. 
Then, as now, no matter what the task, Charles has always been a leader. He has always excelled. I could count on him. He knows his substance. He knows his politics, and he knows New Mexico. 
During the last 4 years Charles helped me with the critical issues facing New Mexico. 
When Kirtland Air Force base was included on the Base Closure Commission preliminary list, Charles rolled up his sleeves, and in typical Gentry analytical style found out the facts surrounding this recommendation. It didn't take him long to pinpoint the shortcomings in the Commission's evaluation of Kirtland, and to professionally get the facts to the Commission so they could correct their error. Kirtland was saved and the defense readiness of the country benefited from Charles' hard work. 
The administration's grazing fee hike proposal threatened the way of life for hundreds of hard working ranchers in New Mexico. Charles worked diligently to educate members of the Senate about the folly of this proposal. I will always remember the warm welcome we received when we visited southeastern New Mexico and the entire region turned out to thank us for delaying the fees. 
Charles has a keen mind for complicated issues, and in New Mexico dealing with Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories the issues don't get much more complicated. Charles was one of my key advisors on stockpile stewardship, inhalation toxicology, Nunn-Lugar, and Nunn-Lugar-Domenici initiatives to minimize nuclear proliferation. He worked particularly hard on the Industrial Partnership Program intended to provide economic development to Russia. More importantly, this program is designed to keep Russian nuclear experts from moving to Iraq or Lybia. This is probably one of the most important defense initiatives since the Berlin wall came down. 
He worked on minority contracting issues at Los Alamos and Sandia. When Lockheed Martin took over Sandia and initiated contract reform Charles ensured that small and minority contractors were able to maintain their relations with Sandia. 
Two years ago, when I rewrote the energy title of the DOD authorization bill Charles initiated the negotiations with the Armed Services Committee and facilitated the friendly rewrite of more than 60 pages of this important legislation. 
Charles has a big heart. New Mexico veterans are developing a beautiful Veterans' Memorial Park. When Charles heard about the effort during a meeting with me and the sponsors of the park, Charles opened his check book and bought the first commemorative tile. 
Charles helped me start the Senate oil and gas forum. He is one of the most knowledgeable oil and gas lawyers in the country. 
For the past four years, Charles has been my administrative assistant, but our association began many, many years ago. He was raised in Roswell, NM, where he attended the New Mexico Military Institute. While at NMMI, he was an extraordinary student and athlete. Charles was captain of the football team and the New Mexico Golden Gloves heavyweight boxing champion. Before earning his B.A. in science and mathematics at NMMI, he received many academic and athletic honors. In fact, he graduated first in his class. He later received a B.S. in civil engineering from the University of Missouri and a J.D. from Texas Tech University's School of Law. 
He previously served for 6 years as my legislative director, during which he became known for his special expertise in natural resources and energy issues. 
In the private sector, he has practiced law in both Austin and Dallas, TX, specializing in oil and gas, public lands, natural resources and environmental law. 
No recounting of Charles Gentry's life of public service would be complete without noting nearly 11 years in the U.S. Army, where he served with valor as a pilot of fixed and rotary-winged aircraft. When Charles's helicopter was shot down in combat in South Vietnam, he was severely wounded and ultimately medically discharged with the rank of major. His combat decorations include the Bronze Star, Air Medal, Army Commendation Medal with two Oak Leak Clusters, and the Purple Heart. 
Following his years of military service, Charles became a White House fellow and was assigned as a special assistant to the Attorney General of the United States, after which he became Director of the Office of Special Projects at the Environmental Protection Agency. 
To summarize our work together in the years that Charles has served me, this institution, and the people of New Mexico is a tough job, especially since I know that our relationship will not end with his leaving my staff. This is not the end of a book, rather merely the close of another chapter rich with memories and packed with accomplishment. I wish him much success and happiness as he opens the door to his new chapter in his life. 
My wife, Nancy, and I look forward to many more years of friendship and send our best to Charles and his wife Gerrie, his parents, the Roy Gentrys now retired in Albuquerque, his son Geoffrey and daughter Cheryl. 
For his fierce intellect, his incredible capacity for hard work, his political insight and his faithful friendship for so many years, I say from the bottom of my heart, `Thank you, Charles, for a job well done.'

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today a bill that strengthens this country's small business sector, and that is the Women's Business Centers Act of 1997. I am also extremely pleased to have the chairman of the Committee on Small Business, Senator Bond, join me on this bill as my principal cosponsor, along with the ranking Democrat from the Small Business Committee who is also an original cosponsor. I note the arrival on the floor of Senator Kerry from Massachusetts. He is the ranking member of the Committee on Small Business. 
There are a number of Senators in a very limited period of time who have joined us from both sides of the aisle. I ask unanimous consent that those Senators who are listed in my statement be original cosponsors, because they have indicated a desire to do that. 
I thank the ranking member from Massachusetts for his diligence. He has procured a number of cosponsors, and we have also. I believe from the committee itself we have overwhelming support. I would like to take a couple of minutes to explain what we are doing. 
First, let me acknowledge that in the U.S. House of Representatives, starting last year, Congresswoman Nancy Johnson took a lead in this matter and introduced a women's business bill. I introduced the companion bill in the Senate. By way of the recent history of this issue, we have been funding the women's business centers through appropriations. I take a great deal of pride in saying for the last few years, while the administration either did not fund this effort or reduced it in half, we funded it fully with the assistance of Chairman Bond, Senator Hutchison, and others, at $4 million a year. We are asking that this effort, which we will explain briefly, now be funded at $8 million a year. 
Mr. President, I say to my fellow Senators, it might come as a shock to many that the fastest growing part of America's small business is women's small business. As a matter of fact, 2 years ago, we had a startling statistic that women-owned businesses employed more people--even then, 2 years ago--than all of the 500 major corporations in America. That means that there is a major business impact in America. Women are doing marvelously well by adding more women's ownership to the business sector. There is more diversification and more segments of the American population are becoming owners of businesses or have a real opportunity to do so. 
In my particular State, there exists an entity that helps women's small businesses expand, in some instances, get started. I am very proud of that organization, and, frankly, it is growing. One will note that our bill varies a little bit from Representative Johnson's in that we don't want the funds under our bill to be restricted to only those 22 or so States who do not have centers, but rather with the discretion of the administrator, to also use the funds in those States to expand growing programs. 
In a very orderly and organized way, without a lot of overhead, women's business centers, by various names, are helping women who have an idea about a small business, providing them with technical assistance, in some instances to provide micro loans, and in all instances to provide the knowledge and wherewithal and planning that is necessary so that they start off on the right foot. 
I have had the luxury of visiting with many of the women who are being helped in our State by our women's business center. I have been startled. If I could share by way of anecdote with the Senate, if we had enough time, some of the exciting things women are doing in trying to set up their own businesses and how successful they are, it would take me a long, long time. But let me suggest, there is no lack of willingness to compete and take a risk, which is very, very important to being entrepreneurs, and that is not something that is solely in the province of men. Across America, women are succeeding in business with relish and gusto. 
There are many statistics and numbers that we could now talk about in terms of how we go about concluding that this is an important part of the private sector--this women's entrepreneurship in America, and the creation of new jobs in America. Suffice it to say that it is the fastest growing portion of the American small business group. 
Women are succeeding and they are not succeeding in any less numbers, less percentages of success than are men. So what we are encouraging is that every State has one of these centers, and it is modeled after successful ones across this country. In my case, we have the Women's Economic Self-Sufficiency Team, which has a corporate name of WESST corp. It is the only technical assistance group of this type in our State devoted to women's business needs. It is doing a marvelous job of helping hundreds of women find out whether their business idea has a chance of succeeding, giving them technical assistance, in some instances getting them loans through normal loan channels, and in some instances using some of the small moneys they get for startup loans. 
Funds for this program are small, but the women's business centers derive from a grand idea with a marvelous goal. You can't do much better. Senator Burns, who occupies the Chair, wants to be added as a cosponsor, and I so request. 
We are also very pleased the ranking member of the committee, Senator Kerry, is joining us in support of this measure, along with other Senators serving on the committee: Senators Kempthorne, Snowe, Landrieu, Bumpers, Harkin, Levin, Lieberman, and Wellstone. As well, we welcome and appreciate the support of other non-committee cosponsors: Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison, Moseley-Braun, Kohl, Lautenberg, Daschle, Mikulski, and Cleland. 
Mr. President, the Women's Business Centers Act of 1997 bill reflects our commitment for a stronger and more dynamic program for women-owned businesses. Supporting women's businesses is not just common sense, it makes economic sense. 
The National Foundation for Women Business Owners cites these statistics to illustrate the importance of women-owned businesses to our U.S. firms, and provide employment to 26 percent of U.S. workers. They contribute over $2.3 trillion in annual revenues to the U.S. economy. Since 1987, women-owned businesses have grown in number by 78 percent. And, they have done so in nontraditional areas such as construction, wholesale trade, transportation, communications, and manufacturing. Forty percent of women business owners have been in business 9 years or longer. 
Given these phenomenal statistics, it is time we give more attention to this critical segment of our business community. Women-owned businesses are run by creative and professional entrepreneurs who employ millions of workers and deliver trillions of dollars into our communities. At the same time, these entrepreneurs are far too often overlooked and underestimated by our banking and financial communities, as well as by the Small Business Administration. 
I believe it is fair to say that a significant number, if not most, women entrepreneurs have achieved their goals and successes because they are disciplined and committed. We can probably say the same about men who have achieved their business objectives. The difference, however, is that we know there has been a disproportionate amount of training, technical assistance, procurement opportunities, and ready access to capital for male entrepreneurs compared to women. 
Despite these disparities, women business owners have achieved their monumental feats because of their business acumen, self-reliance, ingenuity, and dogged determination. Since it is projected that women will own 50 percent of all businesses by the year 2000, the time is now to assist these women entrepreneurs. 
Looking at the Small Business Administration's [SBA] record, we can congratulate them on their slowly but surely improvement in the percentage of loan guarantees to women borrowers. Within SBA's 7(a) and 504 loan programs, the agency reports that it has tripled its number of loans to women borrowers from 3,588 in 1992 to 11,452 in 1996. That represents an increase in the dollar amount from $634 million in 1992 to $1.6 billion in 1996. That is the pretty side of the picture. 
Turn the picture over, however, and these figures mean that women recipients constitute approximately one-fifth of the total loan clientele and receive approximately one-seventh of the loan guarantee funds. This is at a time when the SBA reports that over the last decade, `new women-owned firms--one-third of all firms--have grown at twice the rate of men-owned businesses.' I do not suggest this SBA picture is all bleak, but I do believe the record is less than optimal, and considerably more effort must be given to addressing women's business needs. 
This year we are committed to improving and enlarging the scope of the SBA's women's program. 
One of the most beneficial programs within the SBA is the Women's Business Centers Program, managed by the Office of Women's Business Ownership. I personally know the excellent record of these centers, of which there are 53 sites in 28 States. 
In my State of New Mexico, I have talked with the clients and toured their businesses. Thanks to the able leadership of the centers' personnel, these businesses are growing financially, employing new personnel, and creating new markets for their goods and services. 
In New Mexico, the Women's Economic Self-Sufficiency Team--WESST corp--is the only business and technical assistance organization specifically focused on the needs of women. Its mission is to facilitate the startup and growth of women- and minority-owned businesses. 
Its target market is low-income, unemployed, and underemployed women. Among its important accomplishments is its expansion to five additional sites, thereby providing much-needed assistance to both rural and urban women across our vast State. Since incorporating in 1988, WESST corp has facilitated the startup and growth of over 500 small businesses. This has created more than 750 jobs and businesses which have average annual gross receipts of $75,000. WESST corp has also established a low-interest revolving loan fund, with 75 percent of the loans extended to rural women and 65 percent to startups. 
Under the direction of the very able and creative Agnes Noonan, WESST corp is one of New Mexico's best business services. WESST corp is one of the 28 State organizations that participates in the SBA's Women's Business Centers Program. It is obvious that its contributions are critical to our State's economy. 
Between 1987 and 1996, U.S. census figures indicate that the number of New Mexico women-owned firms increased by 60 percent, employment increased by 138 percent, and sales grew by 154 percent. Women-owned firms in New Mexico employ nearly 115,000 people and generate nearly $11 billion in sales. Moreover, women-owned firms account for 41 percent of all firms in New Mexico, provide employment for 35 percent of its workers, and generate 21 percent of its business sales. 
As Agnes Noonan says,  
Women's business centers across the United States play a critical role in helping women develop and grow successful small businesses. The acquisition of technical business skills is obviously important. Equally important, however, is the provision of long-term mentoring and support without which many women would never make it beyond an initial orientation session. 
It is important that Women's Business Centers, like WESST corp, continue to target their expertise to the thousands of potential and existing women entrepreneurs. These centers are able to leverage public and private resources to help their clients develop new businesses or expand existing ones. The centers' personnel are skilled professionals who give specialized assistance to women. 
For example, the Women's Business Development Center in Miami, FL, reports that its programs are: tailored to meet the specific needs of  the community, i.e., evening and weekend classes, counseling at business sites and other non-traditional methods of providing entrepreneurial training and technical assistance. Classes are often held in Spanish and other languages. Many sites provide child care, transportation and distance training when necessary. 
I am 100 percent behind establishing business centers in States that do not have them. At the same time, based upon the extraordinary record of WESST corp in New Mexico, it is also equally important that an existing business center be allowed to expand its services into other geographical sites that will serve women entrepreneurs who would not, or could not, otherwise be served at the so-called flagship center. The primary business site has established its record of activities and services, and it is able to offer valuable expertise and guidance to the new center. Therefore, I believe very strongly that requests for replication of existing programs into new sites must also be given a fair and honest appraisal for financial assistance. 
This bill will strengthen the Women's Business Centers Program across the United States. The bill will allow the SBA program to extend its assistance to the individual State organizations from 3 years to 5 years. This will enable the State centers to have a longer period of time to develop their private sector funding base. 
Additionally, we have modified the Federal to private matching requirements to ensure the centers have sufficient time to develop the one Federal to each non-Federal dollar match by the 4th year of activity. Most important, this bill authorizes up to $8 million for assisting existing centers, developing new State programs, or for replicating business center sites in other geographical areas. This is an increase in funding for the business centers' programs from the present, and modest, $4 million annual funding. 
Senator Bond and I, along with the other cosponsors of the bill, strongly support expansion of the SBA's Women's Business Centers Program. We know how instrumental these programs are in helping women entrepreneurs, and how very critical these businesses are to families, communities, and the overall economic well-being of our States. We urge other Members of the Senate to join us in support of this small but powerful program. 
I yield the floor now for Senator Bond who does a marvelous job with the Small Business Committee, has made it a viable active entity, and I thank him for his support.

Mr. DOMENICI. I thank you for those kind words, and, yes, that is sufficient. 
First of all, I am very proud to be a cosponsor of the Family Friendly Workplace Act. The way I see it, this bill is long overdue for American workers in the private sector. Federal employees have had flextime and comptime for nearly 20 years and it is about time the millions of American men and women who do not work for the Government receive the same benefits. 
I vigorously support this bill for the following three reasons. One, it is fair. Federal employees currently have comptime and flextime. It is voluntary. And it protects employees. 
Times have changed since we adopted the rigid 40-hour work week. Under current law, you cannot arrange a schedule to work 44 hours one week and save those 4 hours to take time off in the next week to be with your children or to do something very important to help your sick mother or your grandmother. Current law says you 
cannot do that even if you want to and your boss agree. 
Federal employees have had flextime for many, many years. What we have now found out is that Federal employees who have been participating in flextime are highly satisfied. That should not surprise anyone. It is a very rational and reasonable thing. 
Eight out of ten workers support continuation of the program; 72 percent say they have more flexibility to spend more time with their families and on personal needs; 74 percent said the flexible schedule has improved their morale and made them feel better about their work and about their employers. If comptime flextime is good enough for Federal employees, then why not for the 80 million people that work in the private sector of America? 
For example, FBI employees have comptime and flextime. Isn't what is good enough for them also good enough for restaurant workers, hospital employees, hotel chain workers, telecommunication employees, and, yes, firemen, policemen, and others who might be burdened by the 40-hour-a-week rigid nonflexible time? 
Federal workers can currently use their flextime schedules to attend such things as a school play, baseball games, PTA meetings, dance recitals, Boy Scout or Girl Scout meetings and activities, doctors visits, school field trips, and dental appointments for children. As a matter of fact, I say to my good friend, Senator Coverdell, we got those examples from people who said this is exactly what they would like to do and we got it from Federal employees who say this is exactly what they are doing. 
This bill, as I understand it, and I would not be supporting it without this, is good because it is voluntary or optional. It encourages employers and employees to work together to arrange schedules which fit the individual needs of employees and yet provide the management with enough opportunities to get the work done that they need done. Nothing in this bill requires employees to adjust their work schedules if they do not want to.

Mr. DOMENICI. No question. In fact, I was going to get to that in a moment. 
It is so voluntary that employees under this law can withdraw from a comptime and flextime arrangement at any time. Employees can cash out accrued hours of comptime and flextime at any time. These provisions are going to be enforced just as rigidly as the current provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
This bill protects employees from employer misconduct because it contains anti-coercion provisions. I would not support it if it did not have this protection because this is what assures that it would really be voluntary. There are always people who would like to deny employees certain rights and some employees would like to not work as hard as they should for their employers. We cannot correct all of that. 
But obviously this law says that an employer cannot claim inconvenience as a reason for not allowing an employee to take comptime. Once the employer and employee have agreed to a schedule, the employer cannot then change his mind and say it would be inconvenient to do it that way. 
As an example, an employer cannot force an employee to accept time off rather than monetary overtime pay by promising to promote an employee. This is investigated in the same way that the Fair Labor Standards Act rules and regulations of today are handled on 
behalf of the American workingman and in fairness to the management and ownership. 
Now I do not understand why the Democrats and labor unions are standing in the way of bringing choice and flexibility to the American workplace. If Democrats really cared about the best interests of American workers they would stop misleading the people about this bill and pass it. 
The Baucus-Kennedy substitute amendment does not help the American worker because it only provides comptime and does not contain the flextime biweekly work schedule of flexible credit hours. Flextime is very important. It is important to everyone in the workplace but most important to women and non-overtime workers. 
The combination, Mr. President, of comptime and flextime will benefit 67 percent of all working women in the private sector. Whereas comptime, by itself, will only benefit 4.5 percent of all working women in the private sector. 
The Baucus-Kennedy bill wipes out flextime. Now, what could be more unfair than to penalize all but 4.5 percent of the working women in America by restructuring a bill so narrowly that only 4.5 percent are benefited? Under the broader bill with both flextime and comptime, 67 percent of those same working women would have an option to better their work schedule to help them with their daily lives and with their families. 
The Baucus-Kennedy substitute amendment limits accrued comptime to 80 hours a year, versus this bill's 240 hours. Doing the math, one can say that the Republican bill is three times as flexible for the American working people than the substitute being offered. 
The Democrats, and for some reason the labor unions, falsely claim that this bill will end the 40-hour workweek. This bill will allow employees who want a variation of the 40-hour week to have one--voluntarily and with no coercion. For those workers who want to keep the standard schedule, they can. It is their option and their employers option. They do not have to change one bit. If they like the rigidity of 8-to-5 work with an hour off for lunch, then so be it.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to honor New Mexico's small business-owners and advocates which were recently selected by the U.S. Small Business Administration to receive recognition for their efforts to improve business opportunities in New Mexico. 
I not only want to recognize these individuals for their fine work but also to take a moment and highlight how important small businesses are to the State of New Mexico. Comprising over 96 percent of all businesses in my home State, small businesses are responsible for employing over 115,000 people and creating billions of dollars in revenue for our economy. Not only do small businesses serve as the backbone to New Mexico's economy, but they also serve as the foundation to our local communities. Small businessowners not only create thousands of good paying jobs in my State but also serve as an excellent example for young entrepreneurs who are chasing the American dream of owning their own business. 
Mr. President, there could have been no better choice for the SBA's top award than the family-owned business of Elite Laundry Co. in Gallup, NM. Mary Jean and Andrew Christiansen have worked with their children to build their business for the past 30 years and I cannot tell you how proud I am they are being recognized as the SBA's New Mexico Small Business Persons of the Year. 
The Christiansens have been an asset to me as I work to better serve New Mexico small businesses in the U.S. Senate. The Christiansens have built up Elite Laundry Company to employ 70 employees in a region of New Mexico which has one of this Nation's highest poverty rates. They have actively participated in my Small Business Advocacy Council and have testified on behalf of New Mexico businesses to the Senate Small Business Committee. The Christiansen family can be proud of their efforts in small business and I congratulate them for receiving this award. 
Mr. President, small businessowners and entrepreneurs in New Mexico can also count on receiving the most up-to-date and insightful business information from Michael G. Murphy, the assistant business editor for the Albuquerque Journal. The SBA has chosen this former editor of the New Mexico Business Times as this year's New Mexico and Region VI Advocate of the Year. Mr. Murphy understands the importance of keeping small business-owners informed of the issues, and has worked tirelessly to provide the tools they need to survive. I know I speak on behalf of all of New Mexico's small businesses when I congratulate Mr. Murphy on receiving this award. 
The New Mexico Women in Business Advocate of the Year is Jennifer A. Craig, regional manager of the Women's Economic Self Sufficiency Team Office in Las Cruces. I have worked very closely with WESST Corp. to build a better environment for New Mexico's women business-owners and entrepreneurs. I believe it is only fitting that the SBA highlights the tremendous success story being played out in Las Cruces. This city has one of the highest unemployment rates in the State, yet over the last 2 years, WESST Corp has provided technical and business assistance to over 250 women entrepreneurs and has helped create 50 new women-owned businesses. I congratulate not only Jennifer Craig for being recognized for her hard work, but also WESST Corp. for attracting a person of her caliber to manage the southern regional office. 
Mr. President, I would also like to honor Teresa O. Molina, winner of the 1997 Financial Services Advocate Award for New Mexico. Mrs. Molina is a New Mexico native who attended Deming High School and graduated from New Mexico State University. She has worked with small business for over 14 years helping obtain loans at the First New Mexico Bank in Deming. Currently serving as the bank's vice president, Mrs. Molina has been involved with SBA lending programs since she issued the first ever SBA 504 loan in New Mexico's history. Mrs. Molina works hard to meet the banking needs of her community and I congratulate her for her success. 
Mr. President, as you are aware, this Nation is a melting pot of people with diverse ethic and social backgrounds. In New Mexico, we have hundreds of small and large minority owned and operated businesses. One person that I have always turned to for advice not only on minority business issues but general economic and business issues is Anna Muller, the proprietor of NEDA Business Consultants in Albuquerque. 
Anna is a member of my Minority Small Business Advocacy Council and has gained the respect and admiration of her peers when it comes to minority business issues. She has been chosen as the SBA's Minority Small Business Advocate for New Mexico, and I am hard pressed to think of anyone who better deserves recognition for her services to minority small businesses. Anna Muller is a true leader on 
minority business issues not only in the State of New Mexico, but the entire nation and I congratulate her on this award. 
I would also like to congratulate the SBA 1997 Prime Contractor of the Year for Region VI, Armando De La Paz, president and CEO of Vista Technologies, Inc., of Albuquerque. Mr. De La Paz founded his company on the notion that hard work and determination are the foundation for developing a successful business. Mr. De La Paz's company has provided high-technology solutions to the Federal Government for the last 8 years and has been recognized as one of the fastest growing Hispanic business firms in the Nation for the period of 1993 to 1996. 
I would like to recognize Mr. Dennis A. Reasner, president of Darco Products, Inc., for being selected as the SBA Region VI Subcontractor of the Year for 1997. I recently had the opportunity to meet Mr. and Mrs. Reasner here in Washington and can tell you that they are truly one of the best examples of American entrepreneurship in action. Starting out of their garage, Dennis and Enid Reasner have worked for the past 25 years to develop a company worth millions of dollars which currently employs over 30 employees in Albuquerque, NM. Darco Products is a company we can all be proud of in New Mexico, for not only has a Darco product been used in the space shuttle, but the firm also produced a component part for the first ever American space station. 
Mr. President, New Mexico is witnessing an explosion in the growth of our exports and I believe it is important to recognize those who have helped bring about this change. One woman active in this area for New Mexico is Kimberly de Castro, owner of Wildflower International Ltd., a Santa Fe based export company. De Castro's business provides essential services to foreign buyers by researching various foreign markets and providing her clients with options they need to survive in a foreign marketplace. Wildflower International Ltd. exports to China, Egypt, Israel, and Italy, and is currently negotiating with sales in Taiwan and other Asian countries. Kimberly de Castro is clearly one of the people responsible for New Mexico's phenomenal growth in foreign trade, and I congratulate her for receiving the 1997 Exporter of the Year Award from the SBA. 
In closing, I would like to point out that these people deserve praise and recognition for striving to build a better New Mexico for our future generations. I personally extend my gratitude to these winners, and to others involved with small businesses in New Mexico. I am proud to stand here and recognize these hard-working individuals for creating new jobs and economic opportunities for the people of New Mexico.

Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, the Senator is correct. We have provided $8.5 billion in outlays above the President's budget request for transportation. Even more critical, the bipartisan budget agreement and this budget resolution has as one of its primary discretionary assumptions that Congress will spend all of the highway trust fund receipts over the next 5 years. This will allow for increased highway obligations by the Appropriations Committee of $9.3 billion over the President's budget request for highways between 1998 and 2002.

Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for raising this issue and would be happy to explain the operation of the reserve fund. As the Senator knows, the authority to fund highway programs is split between the Environment and Public Works Committee, which provides budget authority through contract authority, and the Appropriations Committee, which controls outlays of the highway program through annual obligation limitations. 
The bifurcated funding nature of these programs made it difficult to design a reserve fund to allow for additional funding. I appreciate the Senator from West Virginia's assistance in crafting the highway reserve fund. 
The highway reserve fund in this resolution has separate components to allocate funding from additional savings to the Environment and Public Works Committee for additional contract authority and to the Appropriations Committee for additional outlays for highway programs. 
The first provides a mechanism to increase budget authority levels in the budget resolution to accommodate additional highway contract authority. If legislation is reported to the Senate, or an amendment is offered on the Senate floor, that reduces nonhighway direct spending or increases revenues above the levels contained in the budget resolution, these savings will be made available for highway spending. 
The savings would be captured by adjusting the budget resolution's levels to ensure these savings are not spent for other programs. Next, the budget authority levels in the resolution would be adjusted upwards to accommodate higher contract authority for highways. In order for the Budget Committee to determine how to adjust budget authority levels, the provision of the bill or the amendment must either provide the contract authority for highway programs or dedicate the savings in some fashion for highway programs. 
These savings must be either direct spending savings--a reduction in mandatory spending--or an increase in revenues. Other changes, such as a reduction in an authorization of appropriations or the diversion of revenues from the general fund to the highway trust fund, will not qualify. In addition, the savings will qualify only if the committee of jurisdiction from which the savings are found is already within its section 602 ceiling. Savings cannot be used for additional highway spending if the Senate committee of jurisdiction has already used such savings to meet its reconciliation targets. 
The second component of this reserve fund allows for these savings, once they have been enacted, to be reserved for future appropriations bills to accommodate additional outlays that would result from an increase in the obligational ceilings for highway programs. 
When the legislation that generates the direct spending savings or revenue increases is enacted, I, as Budget Committee chairman, will submit to the Senate a document that will reflect the revisions to the budget resolution levels to ensure these savings are not spent on other programs. This document also would provide the amount on a year-by-year basis of the outlay adjustment that could be made to the discretionary caps for additional highway spending. 
As with the adjustment for budget authority I have just discussed, these additional savings must be in addition to the budget resolution savings. It is my belief this reserve fund will allow for a deficit-neutral way of providing additional infrastructure resources.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before we pass the final version of the budget resolution, on behalf of myself and the ranking member, Senator Lautenberg, I would like to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Committee. 
Mr. President, the final budget resolution contains an unusual reconciliation instruction to the Agriculture Committee. Unlike the other committee reconciliation instructions, it calls for an increase in direct spending of $1.5 billion over 5 years. This instruction is designed to fulfill the bipartisan budget agreement between the President, the Speaker of the House, the Senate majority leader and the Senate minority leader. These parties agreed to add $1.5 billion in new spending for the Food Stamp Program for increased work slots and expanded waiver authority in the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee. The specific details of the bipartisan budget agreement can be found on page 89 of the committee print that accompanies Senate Concurrent Resolution 27. 
Mr. President, I would therefore ask the chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Committee about their intentions regarding the bipartisan budget agreement's provisions of $1.5 billion in new food stamp spending consistent with the details that can be found on page 89 of the committee print that accompanies Senate Concurrent Resolution 27?

I want to announce that the House passed the Senate budget resolution 333 to 99. We passed it 78 to 22. 
I believe the reason we have not gotten a balanced budget in the past is we have not had a President and a Congress in accord. And I think we are going to get a balanced budget. 
In recent years, however, the obstacles to the Federal budget have been primarily a question of finding a working consensus between the Executive and the Congress. Today we have a consensus on this issue. Of course, each of us along might have designed the plan differently, but then we might have had a consensus. Yes I personally think we should have done more in entitlement spending programs that still threaten the foundation of this house we build today, but for today we must do what we can to. And I ask you to vote as you did on May 23 and adopt this conference agreement.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Elizabeth Anne (Betsy) Moler brings a strong record to the Deputy Secretary of Energy position. She has performed very ably in her previous leadership of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and her past background with the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will stand her in good stead in dealings with Congress. Two of her many accomplishments with FERC involved crafting order 636, which unbundled and largely deregulated the natural gas pipeline industry. And since 1992, she has led the Commission's deregulation of electricity utility markets--and she can now continue that leadership through her role within the Department. In all her previous assignments, Betsy Moler has demonstrated a keen analytical approach to complex issues. The Department will benefit from her abilities. 
She has a formidable task ahead of her, together with Secretary PenAE6a, to attack the stifling bureaucratic foundations of the Department and root out the serious inefficiencies that plague the Department's operations. Quickly moving to external safety and health regulation of the national laboratories, on a time scale far shorter than the leisurely one proposed by the Department, and slashing the micro-management of the Department will be challenges exceeding those that she faced at FERC. 
I look forward to working with Deputy Secretary Betsy Moler and Secretary PenAE6a to help shape the Department into a critical and highly valued contributor to national priorities.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I am pleased to co-sponsor the Family Friendly Workforce Act. I have always had a long-standing interest in helping workers balance the competing interests of work and family. 
Ten years ago, I introduced the Federal Employee Leave Act of 1987. This act established a type of leave sharing in which employees could donate some of their annual leave to a coworker who faced a personal emergency, but who lacked sufficient leave to attend to the problem. The Leave Act was good for workers because it provided an innovative way for employees to balance work and family when faced with a serious or unexpected illness. 
I now stand before you co-sponsoring another bill which will provide relief to American workers when it comes to balancing work and family. The Family Friendly Workplace Act is not only good for American workers, but it is particularly good for women and children. 
This bill recognizes that the American workforce is changing--especially for women. The number of women in the workplace has increased. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women now account for 46 percent of the labor force. Over 67 percent of women with children under the age of 6 are working. That is compared with only 10 percent of working women 50 years ago. Moreover, 81 percent of American women will be in the work force, by the year 2000. 
While the numbers of women in the workplace have changed, one thing that has remained constant is the difficulty in balancing family and career. Ask any working parent, particularly mothers, and they will tell you that there are never enough hours in the day when it comes to the children. We all know the countless women who spend hours chauffeuring their children from one event to another. There are always school plays, baseball games, dance recitals, PTA meetings, Boy Scout and Girl Scout meetings, doctors visits, school field trips, dental appointments--all in need of a parent's company. This list does not even cover household errands like: Going grocery shopping, picking up the dry-cleaning, running to the pharmacy to get medicine for a sick child, or picking up the children from daycare. 
It is about time for the American workplace to recognize the need for working parents to have flexibility in their work schedules. I think the 58.2 million working women of America want this too. I also think the millions of children currently in daycare deserve to spend more quality time with their mothers. 
According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the No. 1 issue women want to bring to the President's attention is the difficulty of balancing work and family obligations. This is not surprising considering that since 1965, time spent with children has dropped 40 percent. 
The Family Friendly Workplace Act is good for working mothers because it provides choice and flexibility. For women who work overtime, this bill would allow them to choose time-off or comptime instead of receiving pay for their overtime work. For example, an employee could accrue up to 240 hours of comptime which could be used to attend a child's soccer game or school play. 
For the majority of women who do not work overtime, this bill provides for flextime in the form of biweekly work schedules and flexible credit hours. With biweekly work schedules, a mother could schedule 80 hours over a 2-week period in a way that would let her have every other Friday off to spend time with her children. 
With flexible credit hours, a working mom could accumulate up to 50 hours of paid time-off. If her child gets sick, she could then use some of her banked hours to stay home and care for the child. The idea of flexible work schedules is what women want--81 percent of women support more flexible work schedules like those this legislation would make possible. 
I support this bill because it is voluntary. Nothing in the bill requires employees to adjust their work schedules. Nothing in the bill requires employers to implement comptime or flexible hour programs. Instead, this legislation encourages employees and employers to work together. There are tough penalties in the bill to prevent employers from coercing or intimidating employees. An employer cannot force a worker to take comptime instead of paid overtime. 
In listening to the debate on the floor, I am appalled by the opposition to this bill by the Democrats and the labor unions. 
Labor unions of the United States have a problem with flextime. Frankly, if we end this debate with American women asking: What are the labor unions doing in this mess? Why are they interfering?--I am afraid, in the final analysis, the labor unions will find out they were working for the wrong cause. 
I do not understand what is wrong with giving parents flexibility in the workplace to spend more quality time with their children. I also fail to see why my Democratic colleagues are against giving working women in the private sector the same luxury of work flexibility that women in the public sector have. Isn't it about time that the flexibility afforded to Federal employees for almost 20 years now be extended to the 80 million private sector employees in this country with this bill? 
This bill is long overdue. It clearly makes it easier for the working mother to juggle the ever-challenging responsibilities of motherhood and work. I think it is high time for flexibility and fairness in the workplace. What is good enough for Federal employees is also good enough for private sector employees. 
Madam President, these remarks are addressed to the Democrats on the other side of the aisle. It was not long ago that they took a great deal of pride in saying they were for family and medical leave. Everybody knows what family leave is. It is an effort to get businesses to give people time off when there is a family illness or when they need time off because something very serious has happened. 
Frankly, family leave versus flextime is like an ant versus an elephant. Now, I do not know why I chose elephant, but in this case it is good, because the Republicans are for the real--real--family time. 
Plain and simple, this bill modernizes the labor laws of America to meet the challenges of our day. There are no recessions. There is no depression. What we have is five times as many women working and raising children, and they need flexible time.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have served in the Senate for 25 years. Obviously, when compared with Senator Strom Thurmond, I do not even have any bragging rights yet. 
I thought I would come down here to remark, for the Senate record and for the distinguished Senator Thurmond, on a few of my thoughts about my 25 years here, and what I remember most about Senator Thurmond. Rather than talk about legislation, I will talk about some of his qualities and characteristics that stand out most in my mind. 
I guess the most immediate thought that comes to mind is that he is a real gentleman. I think when you have been such an acclaimed, esteemed political leader for as long as he has, it is a rare quality and rare compliment that you can say he has never stopped being a gentleman. By that, I mean he is considerate of everyone. He visits more people and attends more events to honor other people, than anyone I know, and he does it with great enthusiasm. He attends events, whether for the chairman of the Appropriations Committee or a brandnew Senator--he puts it on his list and he spends an hour to an hour and a half, 3 or 4 nights a week, attending events to honor or help other people. It is absolutely beyond belief how much energy and time he spends on other people. 
Second--and I hope this characteristic is never passe, I hope it is always important--I believe he is about as loyal an American citizen as I have ever worked with, as I have ever exchanged views with, and that I have ever been privileged to call friend. By being a loyal American, what I mean is he is constantly asking what is good for America. When he speaks about our national defense, you just know he loves this country. That is what I mean when I say he is a true, loyal American. He is a patriot. He has served America and his constituents in his State in more capacities than anyone in this institution will ever be privileged to serve. Yet, he is always optimistic and he is always sure and certain that this country--that he loves so much--is one of the great achievements of all humankind. He speaks of it as something that we ought to be proud of, that we ought to preserve. 
Mr. President, my last observation about Strom Thurmond is that he knows how to be a team player. 
You know, it is entirely possible that a man of his exquisite accomplishments and seniority wouldn't have to be a team player. But I can tell you, as one who has had to manage a large number of very, very tough measures on the floor of the Senate, Strom Thurmond is one of the best team players when he believes you are trying to do is something good for the country. 
There are many other characteristics that other Senators will speak of. They are all well deserved. I am here to speak of my own evaluation: a gentleman, a true and loyal American, and a team player. That is how view him. That is how I think many will view him they look at his great accomplishments and marvelous life. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to take a few minutes to discuss National Stroke Awareness Month. 
Every year in our country, approximately 28 out of every 100,000 people will suffer from a stroke. In fact, the third leading cause of death in the United States is a stroke. However, advances in medical technology and better control of high blood pressure have greatly reduced the number of strokes per year. 
The number of strokes can be reduced even further if just a few preventive steps are taken. Periodic medical checkups and being on the look out for warning signs like high blood pressure, heart disease, age, and heredity are several basic ones. 
A stroke occurs when blood vessels carrying oxygen and nutrients to the brain either become clogged or burst. The result is that the brain does not receive the flow of blood it requires and brain cells become deprived and start to die. Stroke victims often suffer from changes to their senses, ability to understand speech, behavioral and thought patterns, and memory. Additionally, stroke victims may cry easily, laugh inappropriately, or become easily irritated. 
Luckily, Mr. President, advances in treatment and rehabilitation allow many stroke victims to return to an active lifestyle. Even though recovery is very possible, these stroke victims must often learn a whole new set of skills because old ones were lost and new skills are required. 
Another result of a stroke may be aphasia. Aphasia is the total or partial loss of the ability to speak and understand speech and in approximately 20 percent of strokes a serious loss of speech occurs. This change in speech may turn into an extremely frustrating experience because both speech and hearing are extremely important components within our society. 
People with aphasia may use unusual words or sounds when expressing themselves. Consequently, slurred speech may often result and thus, the appearance of being drunk. 
People recovering from a stroke may also become isolated from others because they cannot communicate. As a result, the person may become depressed and indifferent to rehabilitation, judgment may become impaired, and memory lapses may occur. 
Mr. President, I believe it is extremely important that we as a society take steps to become more aware of a stroke's effects. Charles Huston of Albuquerque, NM, has done just that for the past 30 years. Charles suffered a stroke in 1963 and ever since he has dedicated his life to making others aware of the effects of a stroke. 
Charles has specifically involved himself with the issue of aphasia. In fact the stroke he suffered left him with aphasia. As a result, Charles spent many years just relearning how to speak, painstakingly relearning individual words, one at a time. The hard work and determination paid off because Charles has led a highly successful personal life. 
In particular, Charles has focused on the misperception that people suffering from aphasia are merely drunk. He has tirelessly promoted a document known as the Aphasic Patient's Bill of Rights. The document explains the difficulties a person with aphasia may face and also states that people with aphasia have the right for others to treat them with dignity and consideration in all situations. 
As part of Charles' work to make others aware of the effects of aphasia, he has focused on educating the New Mexico State Police. Within just the past year, he presented the State police with 13 copies of the Aphasic Patient's Bill of Rights and the State police will hang one of the documents in each of the Department's 13 district offices. 
I think Charles Huston has set an example for all of us to follow. He has shown a remarkable amount of determination and resiliency in not allowing the stroke he suffered over 30 years ago to defeat him. Additionally, Charles has applied that same amount of determination to educating people about the effects of aphasia. I think we would all do well to take a little time and educate ourselves about the issues Charles Huston has been advocating for so many years.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President and fellow Senators, on Monday May 26 our Nation observes Memorial Day; a day of remembrance for all the members of our Armed Forces who gave their lives so that our Nation could be free. Sometimes it seems as if, in our haste to address the issues of the day, we forget that the freedom we enjoy--the freedom we take for granted--was not free. Countless American soldiers, seamen, marines, and pilots paid for our freedom with their lives. On the last Monday of May each year we honor our veterans, fly the flag at half-staff, and pause to remember their sacrifice. 
It is unfortunate that if you look in the newspapers or watch the ads on TV, you might think that the only purpose Memorial Day serves is to announce the beginning of another summer season or the start of a new sales drive. But if you spend some time talking with veterans like those who returned from Europe, Korea, or Vietnam; if you talk with those who landed at Normandy or those who survived the Bataan Death March, you learn the real purpose of Memorial Day--to honor the men and women who gave their lives, most at a very young age--in defense of our Nation. 
Today the United States stands alone as the world's only superpower. Today, more often than not our foreign policy debates concern trade, rather than war; economic issues rather than military issues. It is at times like this, times of peace, that we should pay extra attention to the true purpose of Memorial Day. 
The good news is that American citizens understand and respect the role veterans have played in our Nation's history. If you look at the size of the crowds that visit the Korean War Memorial and the Vietnam War Memorial here in DC you get a sense of how Americans feel about their veterans. The same scene is duplicated time and time again at veterans' memorials all across the country. Recently I had the honor of participating in a ceremony marking the progress of the new Veterans' Memorial Park being built in Albuquerque. It is with the creation of special places like this park that our Nation continues to honor the service and sacrifice of all our veterans. 
Mr. President, we set aside one day each year to officially honor those who died for our freedom. For all that our military veterans have done for us, it is the least we could do. To all the veterans, thank you.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, would the Senator from Arizona yield for one moment? There are 11 first-degree amendments, 1 motion to waive a point of order, and possible second-degree amendments and final passage votes that could occur today. If everybody asks for a vote, that means we could have 15 votes, Senator McCain. At an average of 15 minutes a vote, even though we said 10, it would be at least 4 hours of voting. 
I think we can do better. I think at least half of these amendments can be voice-voted, cutting the 4 hours to 2. We will try our best to see if the proponents will accept voice votes. I hope we can encourage Senators not to demand a vote. 
I thank Senator McCain, who I am just told will take a voice vote on amendment No. 327. During this first vote, staff will try to determine which ones can be voice-voted. 
I yield the floor to Senator McCain.

Mr. DOMENICI. The first thing you have to understand is that if this point of order is not waived the budget resolution that we propose for the next 5 years falls. It is gone. For those who would like it to disappear and we would have no budget resolution, we can start over, then vote for Senator Gramm. 
Actually, the problem we are confronted with is not one of overspending. It is one of technical estimating, nothing more. Two-thirds of this overage is because we underestimated the outlays--CBO did--the outlays of the expenditures on the Defense Department. Actually, there is no question that we have been operating under a very tight lid, and I do not believe we should be held responsible for a technical error made in the estimating of the costs of the Defense Department. 
I believe we should waive this. As one who has been working on budgets, I put it this way. I do not waive the budget easily but the better thing to do is to get this 5-year budget rather than to kill it over a point of order that, to me, makes little or no sense in the context of the next 5 years. 
Whatever time I have remaining I yield back.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, this amendment would reduce tax relief contained in the resolution by $16 billion in order to increase spending in programs that the Senator would like to see increased. It happens, in the programs that he would like to see increased, such as Head Start, this budget resolution has an increase of $2.7 billion. It makes it a priority program, so it will most probably be funded at that extraordinarily high level. That was agreed upon. But sometimes, no matter how much you do, it is not enough. In this case, the President brags about the fact that Head Start is going up and going up appreciably, $2.7 billion, yet the Senator would reduce our tax cut for the American people in order to add yet more to that program. 
I do not believe that is what we ought to do. I yield back any time I have. Does the Senator from any time remaining?

We would be back at ground zero. This would propose to take another $134 billion in cuts out of the domestic programs beyond that which we did in this budget, another $134 billion cut off the discretionary programs that are only growing at half a percent. 
I also must tell you the so-called windfall was used in the following manner: Only $30 billion of it was used for spending over the 5 years, and that went for defense, transportation, and dropping the per capita cap on Medicare. 
I believe that we had to do that. I believe it was in everybody's interest that we do that. That is where it went, and that is what we did. So if time has expired, I move to table the amendment.

Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Lautenberg is correct. 
The budget resolution contains an assumption that the Appropriations Committee will provide adequate funding to spend all gas tax revenues into the highway trust fund. In addition, the budget resolution also contains an assumption which provides increased funding for mass transit and Amtrak, in addition to the increase in highway trust fund spending. Therefore, I am optimistic that this agreement provides enough funding to accomplish our mutual goals of spending all trust fund revenues while maintaining our commitments to other modes of transportation, including increased funding for mass transit and Amtrak.

Mr. DOMENICI. I don't want to start thanking people, because there are so many who did so much. I do want to say, from my standpoint, that my highest, highest thanks go to our majority leader. He has not been a majority leader for a long time, and this is a very, very difficult undertaking. There were a lot of potential pitfalls. 
Frankly, I commend him for being a very, very courageous majority leader. He has a lot of courage. When something has to be done and he agrees to do it, it is like you have a great army with you; we just move. If he wasn't in the lead, I was, and we took turns and we got this done. 
I also want to say that this is a bipartisan effort. I say to Senator Daschle, thank you. When we had trouble, we would call on him. 
Last but not least, I always knew Frank Lautenberg, but I didn't know we were really friends. I think I can say we have a bond between us now that came about because we worked on a very, very difficult set of issues for a long time. I thank him and his staff for their cooperation, and close by saying to all the Senators, thanks for the way you conducted yourselves. This is a complicated, messy process, but I think we did the Senate well, which I always want to do. 
I will close by saying that the one staff person I must always recognize, and I think the White House at one point suggested without Bill Hoagland we couldn't put this together. I thank him publicly. 
Frank, it is good to be your friend.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1997, S. 610, adequately serves to implement the obligations of the Nation under the Chemical Weapons Convention that we ratified a few weeks ago. S. 610 reinforces the concerns expressed in the ratification conditions that constitutional protections for U.S. citizens must be maintained during the intrusive inspection regime required by the CWC. S. 610 protects both private companies and Federal installations from frivolous challenge inspections by demanding that probable cause be demonstrated in order to obtain a search warrant.

Mr. DOMENICI. For the information of all Senators, today the Senate will immediately resume consideration of Senate Concurrent Resolution 27, the first concurrent budget resolution. Under the previous order, all time is expired and the Senate will begin a lengthy series of rollcall votes on or in relation to the remaining pending amendments that are in order to the resolution. Therefore, Senators can expect to begin voting on numerous stacked votes momentarily. Senators are asked to remain in the Chamber and in their seats, if possible, to expedite this process. 
Again, all Members should be on the floor to begin this series of votes. After final passage of the budget resolution, it is the intention of the majority leader that the Senate consider the CWC implementation bill under the previous order, the supplemental appropriation bill, if the House completes action, and any nominations that have been cleared for action. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first of all, there is no precedent for Federal involvement in the construction of elementary and secondary institutions except the Education Infrastructure Act of 1994. 
It has an interesting history. The program had a total appropriation of $100 million and that was rescinded in 1995, no funding was provided in 1996, and no funding was requested by the President of the United States in his 1997 budget. No funding was provided in 1997. In fact, it is very interesting, the President, in his fiscal year 1996 Department of Education budget said the following: `The construction and renovation of school facilities has traditionally been the responsibility of State and local governments financed primarily by local taxpayers. We are opposed to the creation of a new Federal grant program for school construction.' That was the President of the United States speaking not too long ago. 
The justification for this initiative is a 1995 GAO report which was based on a national sample of schools and school officials who were surveyed about construction and renovation needs. These schools estimated the Nation needed about $112 billion to repair and upgrade America's schools. The GAO concluded that if that is the case, if that is their conclusion, I say this money will not even make a ripple of positive effect on the horizon on the difficulties that are out there. 
Scarce resources would be better spent on clear-cut Federal priorities, clear-cut education priorities, clear-cut issues like children with disabilities. This budget resolution assumes $5 billion increase for special education and for programs which there is a very clear Federal role. 
Now, from what I understand of this amendment, the amendment would be paid for by, once again, reducing the level of net tax reductions allowable for the American people. It seems to me that every time we turn around somebody wants to say, `We want to give the American people less of a tax cut.' 
We have this great need for something so we will just take it out of the tax-cut package that was going to Americans, including a $500 child care credit to American families who are raising children and having a difficult time getting them through school. 
So when the time is up, while I laud my colleague for her efforts here on the floor, I will move to table this amendment. I hope there would be broad support to go along with the conclusions which the President of the United States so brilliantly stated in 1996 when he said that the Federal Government should not be involved in the construction and repair of public school facilities, that that was the responsibility of local government. I paraphrase, but nonetheless I do state accurately what the President of the United States thought just about 18 months ago. 
I reserve the balance of my time.

The construction and renovation of school facilities has traditionally been the responsibility of State and local governments financed primarily by local taxpayers. We are opposed-- 
Continues the President in 1996-- to the creation of a new Federal grant program for school construction. 
Now, I understand the President has the right to change his mind in 12 months, but I submit his thinking was much, much better in 1996.

Now, he has a right to change his mind about another way to help build schools, but I submit that we also should share with the American people that that change occurred over a 12-month period and, frankly, I believe we ought to agree with the President in 1996, not the President in 1997.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me make it very clear to everyone in the Senate, first of all, I have nothing but the highest respect and admiration for both the sponsors of this amendment, the distinguished Senator from Virginia, who has worked diligently to try to create the transportation programs in the committee he serves and do it in the best interests of our whole country, and believe you me, he has had a tough job, and so has Senator Baucus in doing a great job, whether working on the committee or with transportation infrastructure. 
Their job is very difficult because they have to balance frequently the interests of all 50 States or those that are rural versus those that are very dense in terms of population and thus roadway needs are very different in his State or mine as compared with New Jersey, if you just take into account how much gasoline tax is taken in because we are small, with small populations, but we cannot get from one place to another without roads, so we are in a different category. And over the decades we have all worked very hard to figure out how to do that balancing act. And then it turns out when it is all finished, the House does it differently than the Senate because the Senate is represented two Senators to each State. So Senator Baucus and his co-Senator represent a very small population but they are two. In the House, they always load the bills with the heavy populated States and over here we try to do it with a little more fairness, more fair play. 
They have had to be referees over that. In fact, I might tell the Senators, they probably do not remember, but I was a referee on that once as a conferee, and that was pretty interesting, how we found a formula that year. 
I might say, in spite of these accolades, this is a very, very strange amendment, to say the least. Here we have been for all these days discussing a balanced budget, and as a matter of fact even those who would break this budget did not unbalance the budget. Or even those who had deal breakers because they would take the principal components of the budget and change them, as our leader said yesterday, pulling the wheels out from under the cart so it would break down. This amendment makes no effort to try to offset the $12 billion that they add to this budget. 
In other words, Mr. President and fellow Senators, this amendment is bold enough to say it just does not matter about a balanced budget. We just want to put in $12 billion more for highways. Frankly, I am sorry we do not have the money in this budget for that. But we did in fact, we did in fact increase the President's proposal by $10.4 billion. That is $10.4 
billion more than the President had in mind, and we balanced the budget. We offset it somewhere or in some way reduced the amount of tax cut we were going to have in the overall sense of putting the package together. 
But this amendment just comes along and says, well, we just want this additional money spent on highways, and we will wait until another day to worry about the balance. Frankly, we had a very meager surplus in the year 2002. This particular amendment costs $4.5 billion in the year 2002, and that will bring us out of balance by over $2.5 billion. 
So I urge the Senators who want to support this amendment or this concept, they ought to come down to the floor and cut $12 billion out of this budget so it is still in balance. Then we would understand what would be hit--education and everything else we have been trying to fund. 
So I must say on this one the administration supports us. We were not so sure yesterday morning, I say to my good friend from Kentucky, but they support us. They sent a letter up here saying they do not support this amendment. They support our efforts to see that it does not pass. 
Frankly, I would be less than honest and less than fair with the cosponsors--it is clear we are going to have to do something when the ISTEA Program comes along in the not too distant future. We are going to have to make some serious, serious adjustments. And I think those are going to happen. Perhaps the Senators will help expedite that a bit today by calling to the attention of the Senate the situation as you see it. 
But essentially, we have many trust funds in the United States, many trust funds. I used to know how many. But I think it is probably fair to say we have 100 trust funds. I think that is low by 50. I think we have 150. But let us just say we have 100 of them. 
Frankly, we do not spend every penny that comes into those trust funds every year, nor do we take them and set them out on the side and say whatever comes in goes out. We have put them in the unified budget. I am not sure--people argue on both sides of that concept. Should you break Government up into 150 pieces and then find some more pieces and have no central government running things, no unified budget, I should say. Forget who runs it, just a budget representing them all. And I have come down on the side of putting them all in and leaving them in, and if there is surpluses take credit for the surpluses. As a matter of fact, it is pretty clear that at some point we are going to have to change the way we are doing business, not perhaps spend more. But I would urge Senators not to vote for this amendment today. I will move to table it. I think it breaks the budget. It unbalances the budget. The intentions are very, very good, but this is not quite the way to do it. 
Now I yield to Senator Lautenberg--

Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, you will be writing the new ISTEA law. If you will care to rename it, it will be renamed under your direction, not under mine. But I would say, from what I can find out, this $26 billion trust fund surplus--we spend about $20 billion each year and they have done that for a long time. This $26 billion that is referred to is made up of two things: $20.6 billion of it is compounded interest, and $5.9 is committed to projects. Frankly, that does not mean we have an awful lot of money to spend. As a matter of fact, we probably do not have very much. But, from my standpoint, this trust fund balance is a very reasonable balance to keep in the fund. If at some point we can get to a better plan and do it over a period of time, you are going to find this Senator on your side.

Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, you did not quote me so incorrectly that I would say you didn't quote me right. But, in essence I am just expressing the notion that is pretty rampant, that outside of this budget resolution, at a later date, that in various committees we will be working on what do we do with this highway trust fund and what do we do with the new formula, where there will be a new formula. 
All I am suggesting is at some point that debate is going to occur, but I don't believe it should occur here on the floor of the Senate, taking $12 billion and just adding it to this budget and saying we are just going to go in the red because we have not figured out any other way. There is going to be another way to look at this situation.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me suggest, again, to Senators who might be listening or those who might be listening in their stead, in this budget, we have tried to do many things. We have tried to cut taxes for the American people; we have tried to cover little children who are uninsured with $16 billion; we have tried to cover the National Institutes of Health with a 3.5-percent increase. 
We heard from people what America had to be doing, and, in each instance, we had to get rid of something. In fact, I have not said it yet, but the President gave up 50 percent of his initiatives in the compromise that was made, and every time we did it, we said, `Let's balance the budget; let's balance the budget.' We would come back and say, `Well, we want to add this, what do we take out?' And we would take something out. What we have here today is $12 billion as if it just flopped out of the sky; no effort to balance the budget, no effort to offset it with expenditures so we can all see where do you pick up the $12 billion that is needed for highways? 
Everybody understands that highways are very much needed in America, but this budget, for the first time, will permit us to spend every cent of new taxes that comes into that fund every single year. We are moving in the right direction. Every cent of new gasoline tax that goes into this fund under this budget agreement will be spent in that year that it comes in, obligated during that year. That is a giant stride in the direction that we have been asked to go by many people in our country. 
Frankly, every Governor in America sends a letter in. They want more money. 
And then some of them get up and criticize that we do not balance the budget right. The lead Governor in America, the head of the association, he wants every penny of highway funds, but this budget resolution just does not get the job done right.

It will not be done at the expense of just saying we will spend some money even if the deficit goes up. I look forward to the day we do it in such a way that it is balanced and that, as a matter of fact, if we increase, we cut some things to make up for the difference so we stay in balance.

<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, while I am having a great deal of difficulty discerning the difference between the two amendments, let me tell the Senate what I believe the sum total of the two amendments are. 
The distinguished Senator from the State of Arkansas does not believe in tax cuts. It is just that simple. When you go to work on a budget, you ask the American people to let you reform some programs that are out of control, and you save some money. 
When you ask the American people to let you reduce spending in some other areas, or at least keep it intact, when you do that, you come up with a surplus, and you say, we want to give that back to the American people. You know that is a tax cut. 
We do not have any other way to give back to the American people what is theirs. We give the American people a lot of programs. But when you reduce taxes, you are giving them back what is theirs. They already earned it. 
No matter how you cut it, both of these amendments--one says in this budget resolution you are permanently prohibited from giving any tax cuts. 
That is plain and simple. That is one of them. Now maybe my friend will explain it with relation to other things, but that is, plain and simple, what it is. 
What we have done in the overall budget, we have restrained Government such that there is sufficient funding to give the American people a modest tax cut, a net of $85 billion out of a tax take in the trillions. It is not like we are giving them a huge tax cut. Well, let us give them something. Balance the budget and give them some kind of balance. What is the use of having a balanced budget if there is nothing in it for the people? 
We are trying to get the economy running better, and to do that we want to get a balanced budget and to make sure the American people feel better about their day's work and their taking a chance on investing. You want to give them some back. To those mothers and fathers raising kids under 18 years of age, we would like to say to them, we understand your problem and we have enough savings in this budget we will give you a tax break. It is not pie in the sky. 
The economic assumptions, and I know we are not supposed to talk about technicalities, but the distinguished Senator said he would not rely on any of these assumptions. Mr. President, let me tell you, there are literally thousands of American businesses who do economic planning, thousands of them, and the biggest of them in America rely on more generous economic assumptions than are in this budget resolution. The Office of Management and Budget has more generous economic assumptions. We have the most conservative set of economic assumptions you will find from any major institution or business in America. We did that because that is a way of saying if you should have a downturn, if you should have a downturn you have taken that into consideration by using very, very conservative economic assumptions. Nobody does it any differently. Nobody comes along and says, well, let's write a 5-year budget and in the third year, let's have a recession and plug it in. First, nobody wants to do that because they are frightened to death of such a concept, but what economists do is build in low economic assumptions. That is what we did. 
Frankly, I do not want to be on the side that says there is no room in the Federal budget to balance it and give the American taxpayers a break. I believe there is. In fact, I believe, absent some untoward happening, something untoward happening, I believe we will be balanced ahead of 2002 because I believe the economic assumptions are so low that we will do better for at least 2 out of the next 4 years than are estimated here. I did not choose to put that in. I choose to use modest, conservative economic assumptions. 
Now, the Bumpers amendment that tries to allude to Medicare has nothing to do with Medicare. The President of the United States joined with Democrats and Republicans and said to the senior citizens of America, we want to do something for you in this budget that is positive and good. Lo and behold, what we have done is make the Medicare trust fund solvent for 10 years. That is not bad. It is bankrupt in about 3 years if we do not do that. That is No. 1 on the positive side, we made it solvent for 10 years. We told the providers in America that they will get paid differently, and for the most part paid less. We told the Medicare people that run the program, give the seniors all kinds of options because there are options to get better service at cheaper rates. We also moved part of home health care out of the trust fund and said we will take care of it under a more generous program, all of which contributes to the senior citizens of America in a very mighty way. 
Now nobody can kid anybody anymore. The tax cuts have nothing to do with that. Let me tell you, you wipe out the tax cuts--let's just do that. We will think it out here, take out the tax cuts. But also if you think through Senator Bumpers's proposal--maybe we ought to wipe out all those reform measures that save money for the Medicare fund, or what I am saying in another way is that all of the savings for the Medicare goes back to Medicare. All of the savings for Medicare go back to Medicare. They do not go to taxpayers, they go back to making that program solvent. That is pretty logical, it seems to me, when you have done that, and balanced the budget and found room for a tax break. 
We relish the idea of voting on these two amendments today. We Republicans want to vote on them. We hope a lot of people vote against it, but not a single Republican should. I hope they do not. Because what we are saying is, the modest tax cut in this budget resolution ought to be carried out, and it ought to be carried out in a manner prescribed in this budget resolution. 
If I have additional time on the amendment, I reserve it but I do not think I will speak more than 1 minute on either of the two amendments. If Senator Bumpers wants to use 2 minutes, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are still on our side expecting Senator Specter to arrive. I assume Senator Bumpers will not mind if we stack some votes, if we have him present his, and in due course we will get to his. Then I will have a chance to discuss further with the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts his pending amendment. 
I want to close now on this note. I truly wish Senator Bumpers would not have tied Medicare to this tax cut. 
First of all, Mr. President and fellow senior citizens--I can say `fellow senior citizens.' I just turned 65 a few days ago. But the truth of the matter is we have far more savings from other accounts than the reforms in Medicare to pay for tax cuts. In fact, there are almost three times as many savings in the first 5 years from other sources--two times from other sources, and from the reform measures that are part of Medicare. 
My last remarks are: If you wipe the tax cuts out of here, you still have to do all those things for Medicare to keep it solvent. You have to do those kinds of things or raise taxes, which nobody has suggested we do. 
So, I close by saying I opt for a balanced budget that includes some tax relief. I am comfortable and confident we can do both this time. We have done much in moderation in this budget, which has caused some of our friends who want to do much more, both in cutting the budget and cutting taxes, to opt out of this agreement, not wanting us to pass it. But I think we have had a moderate approach to both sides. I for one hope both of these amendments get defeated overwhelmingly to show the American people that they deserve a tax break along with this balanced budget. 
I am prepared now to move on to another amendment.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before we yield to Senator Murray, let me once again ask my friend, Senator Bond. 
You know, we are reaching a deadline here with an awful lot of things that haven't been handled. From my standpoint, the way the Senator has accommodated his amendment in working with us is acceptable. I urge that he let us accept it at some point and not insist on a rollcall vote. I assume the rollcall vote will probably be 100 percent. But I don't think that helps the Senator any more. I am trying to tell him as clearly as I can that is not going to help him any more than if he lets us accept it. It is going to a conference which is on an expedited process. I want to help him. I am doing everything I can. I don't know if I want to go through a rollcall and then, you know, be very helpful after that. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I might inquire, the sequence has been somewhat misunderstood, but I think we are close to an agreement. If Senator Ashcroft, from the State of Missouri, can agree to 30 minutes on his, then I would proceed to ask that he go next, and then Senator Wellstone go next; but in the event Senator Wellstone is inconvenienced for 5 or 6 minutes, that we do other business but not deny him the next amendment to be called up to be his, after Senator Ashcroft.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to make sure my friend, Senator Gramm, has 4 or 5 minutes, so will you remind me when I have used 5 minutes, and then I will yield as much time Senator Lautenberg needs and then withhold a few minutes for the Senator from Texas. If not, I will take it off the resolution. 
First of all, let me say it is with great regret that I cannot support this amendment. It does not make any difference what the U.S. Senate said last night in a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. They expressed a wish, a hope. The truth of the matter is that we cannot afford this amendment, nor will it work as proposed by the proponents of the amendment. 
First of all, it is without saying, that no matter what we do to try to add money to the function of Government that the two Senators who are proposing this control in the appropriations process, that the allocation of the moneys will be done by the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations. So, in a sense, we are going through an exercise as if we are really increasing NIH when we really are not. There is no doubt in my mind that if this amendment were to be adopted, that Senator Stevens would not have any chance of being fair to all the rest of the parts of Government and take $1.2 billion and add it to this function of Government. 
The second point is, just to be absolutely frank and honest, even if we did it and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee did not agree and did not put any money in, there is plenty of money in the subcommittee to increase NIH by $1.1 billion if the chairman and ranking member chose to do so. They will just have to do what all the other committees do; they will have to reduce a lot of other spending within their committee to make an addition of $1.1 billion to NIH. 
So, in a sense, this is like expressing a desire, but in this one, we actually change the numbers and presume that this is going to be what is going to be carried out. I do not think we ought to do that. 
For Senators who would like to know what the effect of it is, because there is nothing free, you take $1.1 billion out of the rest of the functions of Government and here is what I assume: First, I assume that the agreement between the President of the United States and the leadership, with reference to preferential accounts, will hold, and that in the subcommittees, we will fund those items that are preferred. The distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania has a huge amount of money for these protected items, most of them in education, but I assume they are the largest number 
of protected accounts wherein more money is put in the subcommittee than any other subcommittee. 
Having said that, I am going to assume in this explanation to the Senate that we protect all the other accounts we have agreed to protect, which are considerable. This small amount of money that they are talking about cutting, on that assumption, would yield cuts like this: Veterans, $190 million; WIC, $38 million; LIHEAP, which many around here worry about, emergency energy, $14 million; Social Security administrative expenses, $36 million. 
Frankly, I do not think we ought to be doing that here today. I have the greatest admiration for the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, and, yes, indeed, he has done a marvelous job in seeing to it that he can push NIH up as much as possible, for which we are all grateful. And, yes, I will say he has been very helpful to the Senator from New Mexico, and I hope this debate on the floor will never change that. But I just cannot, in good conscience, let the Senate take $1.1 billion, which I assume is going to come from the unprotected accounts of this Government, and put them into the function that is called 550, where it could be spent for anything in that function. There is nothing we are going to do here today which says you put it in and it must be spent for NIH. The good judgment of the chairman and ranking manager will be what controls it. They could put more in education if they like and nobody could stop them. 
Until the chairman of the Appropriations Committee looks at all the money available in the nonprotected accounts and determines how much he wants to give this subcommittee, we are not going to know how much the subcommittee has to spend, and I regret that, but I believe that is the case. 
I do not think we ought to do this to the rest of the budget. Yesterday evening, when we debated the desire of the institution, called the U.S. Senate, to do more for NIH, you did not hear the Senator from New Mexico say, `And that assures you in this budget we are going to change it by $1.1 billion,' and had anybody asked me, I would have said it does not assure you of that. This budget is finished. That wish is in the future, and I think the proponent of that amendment knows we are not going to get there very easily doubling NIH. It is just we want to shoot for the stars when it comes to science research, especially biomedical research. 
I yield the floor and yield whatever time Senator Lautenberg wants, and if we have a few minutes left, I will yield to Senator Gramm.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I guess I would like to once again compliment the sponsors and certainly indicate that I have great respect for their desire to fund programs like NIH. 
But I tell you, fellow Senators, to say you are going to go across the entire budget of the United States and you are going to get rid of some administrative costs and then you are going to take those administrative costs and you are going to put them in this subcommittee so it can spend it on NIH is a pipe dream. 
There is not going to be any 4-percent cut or 2 percent, whatever it is, in overhead unless it is made by each subcommittee who is doing that. What this amounts to is deciding here on the floor of the Senate that all of the other subcommittees of the U.S. Senate that handle everything from the Department of the Interior to Veterans--in fact, if I were the chairman of the Veterans' Subcommittee I would be here on the floor and I would say, `I don't think the U.S. Senate has given the veterans enough.' I would ask John Ashcroft, `Will you help me? Why don't we just say, let's cut overhead and give the veterans $5 billion more? After all, they're preferred people in America.' 
Boy what an amendment that would make up here at the desk. Who is going to turn it down? It does not cost you anything--does not cost you. Of course it costs you something. 
Huge numbers of other programs are going to have to be cut. All I am suggesting is, we ought to wait for the appropriators to make that decision. 
I think I am glad we stopped the amendments and there are not any more. I would look at very popular programs and send the subcommittee chairman over here and say, well, let's just cut 8 percent out of the Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, the one they are adding to, and just cut 8 percent out of overhead, and stand here and tell the Senate, well, we did not hurt anything in the subcommittee; we took 8 percent out of overhead and put it in the veterans. 
Maybe you can think of a good one, or maybe you can think of a good one. I gave you some ideas, but I do not want you to do that. I tell you, that is what this amounts to. What we ought to do is leave it up to the appropriators as we have in the past. 
It has been said that the Budget Committee's numbers are important as to how they allocate. Let me tell you, sometimes I am pretty puffed up about this process. Other times I wonder what in the world am I doing working so hard at this process. The truth of the matter is, in the last 14 years, the appropriators have used the allocations of the Budget Committee how many times, would anybody think? Once. One time Senator Mark Hatfield said, `I am brand new at this job as chairman, so I am just going to take your allocations and just accept them.' Boy, that did not last very long. By the next year, they figured out what their allocations ought to be and that was the end of that, and they probably departed from it by $5 billion. In other words, they moved it from here to here but stayed with the total. 
I think we ought to stay with the totals. Frankly, I hate to do this because I am a strong supporter of NIH. In fact, I may very well urge that Ted Stevens put more money in NIH when we look through all the accounts of Government and see how we can fit it. I do not think it is fair to come here and say it is not going to cost anybody anything, it is a tiny bit of overhead. The other phrase we used to use is `fraud and abuse.' The best fraud and abuse salesman around here was Senator Dennis DeConcini. He used to come down here at the end of the whole process and say, `I am not spending anything. I just want to tell the Government to save $600 million on fraud and abuse,' and he would write up an amendment, fraud and abuse, take the $6 million, put it in the subcommittee, and say we will spend it there, and everybody went home and he got a press release. The truth is, nobody found the $600 million or the $400 million in fraud and abuse, and so what happened, another committee has to eat it. 
That is what we are asking to do here. I do not think that is the way to do it. We will have a little more time spent on this amendment before we finish here today. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my fellow Senators, I have the greatest respect for the two Senators who spoke. I do not know the new Senator from Rhode Island as well as I know Senator Wellstone, but I am growing in understanding and knowledge and put him in the category of a Senator I respect. 
Mr. President, I actually believed, as I listened to those arguments, that we did not have a budget before us; that somehow or another, we had not done anything in this budget. 
Let me tell the American people and Senators what we did in this budget. Did anybody happen to catch the President's press conference when he bragged about this budget resolution? Remember what he said about education? `We have done more to increase educational funding in this budget than at any time in the last 30 years.' He had in mind a few things that the Senators are talking about in their amendments. 
Let me just tell you a couple of them. A $2.7 billion increase over the next 5 years in Head Start. Over the next 5 years, Head Start will receive exactly what the President of the United States requested. It is interesting, when the President has to look at all of Government like we do in the budget resolution, he gives Head Start a huge increase, and we agree with him in this agreement, and we make it a priority item that is going to be hard not to fund. That program has enjoyed a 300-percent increase since 1990. Not very many programs around have done that. 
I would have thought, if I were one listening here, that this President of the United States just denied these poor people Head Start, just sent them off saying, `I don't want anything to do with it.' It is the President who asked for this much money, and we did not change it one penny. 
Then, they were talking about Pell grants, and then I will return to another issue. Of course, it would be wonderful for America if Pell grants were $5,000. What did the President say about Pell grants? He said, we have the best increase in Pell grants in the last decade. How much? Three-hundred dollars for each Pell grant. 
We conservatives did not say that. We are glad to do it. The President of the United States asked for that. He got every penny he asked for. It is very simple to come to the floor of the Senate, no matter what you do in a budget, to have a new wish list and a new set of statistics about who needs something. 
I have learned more from that side of the aisle about that than I ever dreamt in my life. I can get up after you put the President's budget together, if we had given him everything he wanted, I learned from that side of the aisle that I could get up here and say we have 26 million people who do not have enough food, even if the President had put in a whole new nutrition program. 
As a matter of fact, let's move from Pell grants to nutrition. Child nutrition program, isn't it interesting? The Federal Government spent $12.4 billion on those programs last year. Believe it or not, 70 percent of those programs, Mr. President, are what we call mandatory programs. That means, if you qualify, you get them. There cannot be much more needed; if you qualify, you get them. That means everybody who is poor qualifies for those programs, and we spend $12.4 billion.

<DOCNO>105-domenici-nm-93-19970522</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. You would have thought we did not even have a program from over there, and we did not even have an increase. Let me just finish. 
Believe it or not, the other 30 percent of the money that goes to children's nutrition programs is spent for programs like WIC, Women, Infants, and Children, one of the finest programs in terms of effectiveness we have in the Federal Government in this inventory. It has wide bipartisan support. It enjoys an increase in this budget, and, as a matter of fact, the President is so confident that it will be funded every year and funded appropriately that he did not even ask us to make it a priority program, because by doing so, we are taking more and more of the budget and locking it in, because he knows we are going to fund it. 
Mr. President, I do not know exactly how I will ultimately handle these amendments, because no matter what you say, the argument is going to be that we are against nutrition programs, and it is a ready-made TV ad. 
On Pell grants, no matter if we gave the President every penny he wanted and we increased it $300 a year--it would be great if we had enough money to go to $10,000 a year, I guess, I am not sure. It does not matter. Whoever votes with Domenici tonight is going to vote against Pell grants. 
So I want to make sure the Senators understand that I have great respect for them, and I admire them greatly, but we may have a second-degree amendment to change the way this vote occurs, so we are voting on something different for a change than your add-ons. I am not sure yet, but I am looking at it. So with that, I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Let me answer the question. I would never suggest that any Senator who offers an amendment, with all of the concern that you have in your heart and your mind when you offer these kinds of amendments, I would never consider that they would ever be used to disabuse somebody who voted against you improperly. But I am merely suggesting that happens from time to time, and that is all I was thinking. I do not think it will be much of a defense to say that the President of the United States was given everything he asked for in these areas. I do not think that will help much, if somebody wants to use it for a contrary purpose. 
I yield the floor, and I understand the next amendment is Senator Inhofe's amendment, is that correct?

Mr. DOMENICI. The problem is that what the Senator just described is not the amendment. All the amendment does is take out all the tax cuts the American people are to receive. It has nothing to do with Medicare. 
It is a forthright simple amendment. It says, take out all the tax cuts. It totally violates the agreement and, I repeat, has nothing to do with Medicare, nothing. 
Everything that we saved in Medicare went to make Medicare solvent. There are plenty of other savings to cover these tax cuts if you had to cover them. But we have to make no apologies. We produced a balanced budget, and in that we got $85 billion net new tax cuts available to the American people. 
Plain and simple, this amendment says, no tax cuts. That means anyone that votes for it is against tax cuts. Simple, plain, nothing else. 
I yield any time I have remaining.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will not take very long. 
Fellow Senators, what this amendment effectively does is takes away all the tax cuts except $20 billion--plain and simple. There can be all kinds of rationale. But at least $20 billion of the $835 billion in tax cuts, and the rest of the tax cuts are gone. 
It seems to me that we have made a commitment that we are going to do both--balance the budget and cut taxes for some Americans, including families with children. This eliminates all of that, and I believe it ought to be turned down overwhelmingly. 
Indeed, it doesn't cut any spending. It just cuts out the tax cuts. 
I yield my time. 
I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, today the Senate will resume consideration of Senate Concurrent Resolution 27, the first concurrent budget resolution, with 13 hours of debate on the resolution remaining. As under the previous order, Senator Moseley-Braun will be recognized this morning to conclude debate on her amendment. Senators can expect a rollcall vote between 10:30 and 11 o'clock this morning. Following the disposition of the amendment just mentioned, the Senate will continue to work through the approximately 45 amendments which have been filed to the budget resolution. As the majority leader has indicated, it is his intention that the Senate conclude work on this resolution today. In regard to numerous amendments filed, it is our hope that each and every amendment filed will not require a vote. The Budget Committee has worked through the night, identifying amendments which can be worked out on both sides, therefore expediting this process immensely. 
The majority leader has requested the cooperation of all Members in working with the Budget Committee and/or being prepared to debate their amendments during today's session of the Senate. As always, all Members will be notified as soon as any agreements are reached and votes scheduled. Also, before we recess tomorrow, the Senate will consider the CWC implementation bill with a short time agreement, as under the previous order. 
I thank all Members for their attention.

<DOCNO>105-domenici-nm-5-19970521</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I might just, first, ask that every Senator who is interested in this amendment and what it does, that they get a copy of the amendment. Look through it. Turn one sheet after another. See if you find mentioned in this document cigarette taxes. See if you see it in here. 
There is no mention of cigarette taxes in this. The reason is, you cannot, in a budget resolution, carry out a mandate that a cigarette tax be imposed. Let me repeat. If this amendment is adopted, there is no assurance that a cigarette tax will be imposed because you cannot do that in a budget resolution. So let us look at it, page by page. There is no mention of a cigarette tax. I repeat to Senator Hatch, my very good friend, that there is absolutely no assurance and no way, in a budget resolution, that you can instruct the Finance Committee of the Senate of the United States to levy any kind of tax specifically. 
You can change the total amount of taxation and say, `We sure hope, when you change that, that you will pass a cigarette tax.' I tell you that because the budget resolution is not the place to argue about what a tax package is going to look like specifically, especially with reference to imposing a new one. 
Second, for those who are interested in cutting taxes--I assume there are a whole bunch of people on our side who want to cut taxes, and I think there are some on this side who want to cut taxes--if this amendment is adopted, while it does not mandate a cigarette tax, believe it or not, it cuts the taxes that you can cut by $30 billion. So that will be a wonderful accomplishment, especially by conservative Senators on this side of the aisle, that essentially the only thing you are assured they accomplish is that there will be a tax cut for the American people that will be less than we expected when we got this budget resolution passed. That is just the arithmetic of an instruction to the committee--just plain arithmetic. Having said that, there should be no bones about it, because of what I have just said with reference to a tax cut and with reference to adding more money to programs, this is in violation of the bipartisan agreement. 
Mr. President and fellow Senators, I do not know who is going to lobby this in behalf of the agreement. I do not know who is going to lobby from the White House or from the office of the minority leader. I do know Senator Lott and I intend to defeat this. So we are not only going to be lobbying, we are going to be working to see that this agreement that we entered into is kept and not violated by this amendment or any other amendment. For, make no bones about it, if you adopt this amendment, this agreement is wide open, if you believe anybody on this side of the aisle or that side of the aisle who wants to live under this is going to sit by for a major change like this. Essentially, the principal change is to reduce the amount of money you can cut taxes by $30 billion. 
Let me also say, fellow Senators, and anyone listening here today, whatever the wonderful discussions by well-meaning Senators--and they are all well-meaning, I say that to my friend, Senator Hatch, looking right at him, wonderfully intentioned--the issue of covering children in America who are not covered by insurance, listen up, Americans: They are all covered in this agreement. The President claims victory in this agreement. And guess what he says, Senator Kennedy, when he said this is a great agreement--5 million Americans, and he put up his hand with his 5 fingers like that--5 million Americans, young children, are going to be covered by health insurance because I made a deal to make sure that occurs. 
So let us make sure that the speeches about covering children, trying, in this debate, to tie that to raising a cigarette tax--and another day, another place, another way, perhaps many Senators would vote for a cigarette tax increase. Perhaps.

<DOCNO>105-domenici-nm-6-19970521</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. I just want to finish this thought. 
Mr. President, this cigarette tax is not needed. We need not break this agreement to cover children who are uncovered, in terms of health insurance, because they are covered. Let me tell you how much they are covered by. There is $16 billion--one-six--$16 billion in new money in this agreement that is there specifically and singularly to cover children who do not have insurance. All 5 million are covered by the $16 billion. 
Let me suggest that the White House in these negotiations put before us a plan to cover the 5 million young people, 5 million young children in America. They put forth a plan and they said it is going to be very difficult to find out how to cover these young children because we do not have any experience in it. We do not have any insurance policies out there to cover them. But $16 billion ought to do the job.

</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-domenici-nm-8-19970521</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, the truth of the matter is that nobody knows, nobody knows today how to cover these children who are uncovered in America. Nobody has a plan. Nobody knows which plan to use. Obviously, a very large number ought to be put under Medicaid. 
But they will not all fit under Medicaid, so another plan has to be developed for the rest of them. Frankly, this Senator is convinced that we can devise a plan in the Finance Committee of the U.S. Senate that will cover them all and will not even use the $16 billion. 
That is just as honest a statement as my friend from Massachusetts makes when he plucks a number, because we do not know what it is going to cost. Mr. President, do my fellow Senators know that if you went out 6 months ago across America and you said, `Let's buy health insurance for some uninsured kids; let's just go around to the insurance agencies and say, `How about giving us an insurance bid,' there was no policy until about 2 months ago when a company decided to issue a policy. Nobody even knows, since it is the only one, whether its price is going to remain when they all start issuing them, for it is, indeed, not expensive to cover children; everybody knows that. One of the reasons given to cover them is it is not very expensive to cover them. 
All I am suggesting is that the President of the United States, in this bipartisan agreement, made great, great emphasis to the American people that it was a good agreement for many reasons, and one of them was that we had covered the young people who are not covered with $16 billion in new money. 
I want to close on this point, and I will have a lot more to say, but essentially, this amendment in no way will cause a cigarette tax to be imposed if that is the wish of the sponsors, because you cannot do it in a budget resolution and you cannot find the words `cigarette tax' in the boundaries of their amendment, because there is no way to do that. They just have numbers plugged in and they wish the Finance Committee will use the numbers the way they are giving their speeches on the floor. They are hoping that they will do that, but the Finance Committee does not have to. 
So what we are doing is, we are tying in kids' coverage, which is already in the agreement, to a national issue on smoking cigarettes. And it is a national issue. It is a terribly tough issue, but, essentially, they are unrelated in terms of the budget resolution. So what we are doing is asking for more money for a program that is already covered, with no assurance that it will be spent for that program, and we are calling for a tax increase, with no assurance that it will be a cigarette tax, but a real assurance that you will have cut the $85 billion that we are providing for net new taxes by $30 billion, just the mathematical effect of the amendment. 
I yield the floor at this time.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
I want to make a point again in a little different way. I am talking now to the U.S. Senate, but, obviously, there are people who pay attention who are not in the Senate. 
So I would like to make sure that everybody that was part of this agreement--this agreement--the President of the United States signed it. I would like to make sure he somehow or other hears this next couple minutes. 
Mr. President, fellow Senators, there can be no more frontal attack and violation of this agreement than this amendment. Now let me make it clear. It says that the tax cut to the American people is reduced by $30 billion. And it says we will spend $20 billion of that. So we are going to reduce the tax cut and spend more money. And we already cover the children in this agreement. 
Mr. President, why would we work for 2 or 3 months--and in this instance I say, Mr. President, Mr. President Bill Clinton--why would we work for 3 months to shape an agreement that provides some items that Republicans want and some items that Democrats want, including the President, and then come to the floor and have the President of the United States not fully aware that this throws the agreement away? Perhaps he is unaware of it this morning. But he ought to be aware of it soon. 
I mean, the agreement is as much as a nullity if you are going to violate it to that extent with this amendment, which will not necessarily accomplish the purposes of its sponsors. 
I repeat, look at the amendment. Read it line for line. And there is no mention, I say to Senator Gorton, of a cigarette tax in this because, as you know, you cannot do that in budget resolutions. They are just numbers. So there is no cigarette tax in here, and no cigarette tax assured under this. 
So I hope everybody understands the significance of it. We can debate for quite some time. I was of the opinion we had an agreement. And I was of the opinion that it was Democrat, Republican, Presidential. And I think those who are proposing this amendment better think loud and clear and think carefully, do they want the agreement to disappear because of this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I noted--since we have all been engaged in such a serious conversation--a little article from `The Hill' about polling and budgets. It might interest Senators. If I shared it with them, they might be reassured. For those who believe in politics, however, this fact may be very interesting. Seventy-four percent of the people polled think that news about the budget deal is more interesting than news of Donald Trump's marital failures. Only 10 percent responded that they were more interested in Donald Trump's marriage failures. 
So we have a winner here. 
Mr. President, I would like very much to ask my friend, Senator Lautenberg, if he is prepared to yield back time on the amendment. I will then be prepared to yield and offer a second-degree amendment.

Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. I yield myself 5 minutes. 
Mr. President, let me just read this amendment: 
The Bipartisan Budget Agreement of May 15, 1997, as implemented in the resolution, would spend $16 billion over five years (to provide up to 5 million additional children with health insurance coverage by 2002). The funding could be used for one or both of the following, and for other possibilities if mutually agreeable: (1) Medicaid, including outreach activities to identify and enroll eligible children and providing 12-month continuous eligibility; and also to restore Medicaid for current disabled children losing SSI because of a new, more strict definition of childhood eligibility; (2) A program of capped mandatory grants to States to finance health insurance coverage for uninsured children. The resources will be used in the most cost-effective manner possible to expand coverage and services for low-income and uninsured children with a goal of up to 5 million currently uninsured children being served. 
The remainder of the amendment strikes the additions and subtractions from the resolution that are included in the Hatch-Kennedy amendment. 
Mr. President, let me just speak for a couple of minutes. First, I listened attentively, I say to my fellow Senators, to the explanation of the minority leader of the Kennedy-Hatch amendment. Frankly, I normally I have great, great esteem for the leader, and I respect him almost every time he speaks on the floor. But let me suggest, I would be willing to submit to arbitration by any three intelligent people that you want to pick, and ask them if this amendment, the amendment that I have just tried to modify, the Hatch-Kennedy amendment, does not violate the agreement. 
The parties to the agreement agreed that they would fight against amendments that are inconsistent with the agreement. Mind you, what do you think we argued for 3 months over? We argued one thing: What is the level of net new tax cuts that are going to be available? We compromised and the President compromised. The distinguished minority leader now comes along and tells the Senate, `It's not inconsistent to take $30 billion of that $85 billion.' Now, I am not good enough with percentages, but could somebody figure that out----

<DOCNO>105-domenici-nm-40-19970521</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. More than a third, and just whack it out of there and say, `That's not inconsistent'? I cannot believe there could be anything more inconsistent with the agreement than that. 
If that is not enough, let's take the next one. We agreed in this agreement that many of the things the President wanted he would not get and many of the things he wanted he would get, and the one thing he wanted, and most Republicans wanted, was to cover children that are not covered. So we agreed, I say to my fellow Senators, on $16 billion, and I just read to you, not the budget resolution because it can't do that, but the agreement between the President of the United States and the leaders and what it said about covering children, and $16 billion that was not in any program was put in the budget in compromise with the President of the United States. 
I do not think it matters much whether something is so patently inconsistent as that. It is not going to change any votes, but I do not want the record of this Senate to go by with even such a distinguished Senator as the minority leader suggesting that this amendment is not inconsistent with the budget agreement. It is impossible that anybody could get any dictionary and look up the word `inconsistent' and apply it to these two sets of facts and not conclude that this is inconsistent. 
There is nothing precluding these two distinguished Senators and their cosponsors from offering inconsistent amendments, and when I am finished they are probably going to stand up and say they didn't agree not to submit inconsistent amendments, unless they want to try to continue on with some illogical idea that it is not inconsistent. 
But the point of it is not what their rights and privileges are, the point of it is what we agreed to after all those months. I suggest, Senator Kennedy has already told us--I yield 5 additional minutes--that perhaps the Vice President is standing by to come up here and vote. I hope not, I say to the leader. I hope not. I have no idea whether he is or is not. But, frankly, had I the slightest suspicion that the Vice President himself would come here and vote inconsistent with the agreement that the President signed, I would have asked that the Vice President sign the agreement. That is what we should have done, for he feels not bound by it, I assume. 
He can come up here and vote absolutely inconsistent with it and break a tie, if that occurs, and I doubt that that is going to occur. He can feel comfortable and the President can say--I don't know what. Maybe he will say, `I don't control the Vice President.' Do you think he might say that, I say to the leader? Maybe that is what he will say. Or maybe he will say, `I'm sorry, Senator Hatch and Senator Kennedy have more sway over me than you do, Mr. President, for you're telling us that you support our position.' What is the Vice President saying? You support the President? The President signed this agreement. This is not just some little piece of paper floating around. 
Anybody that knows about this Senator, I have been through so many budgets, so many that I am hoping this is the last one, I say to the leader, because it might be balanced. But I tell you, never have we worked harder to get something bipartisan that is supported by the President of the United States. 
Let me tell you, this language that the distinguished minority leader read from that is included in this agreement--there are 10 covenants. I say to my good friend, Senator Gorton, at one point there were 20. So it is not as if they were just all of a sudden agreed to. There were 20. 
We said, `You know, that's too many agreements. It's too hard to enforce an agreement with so many covenants.' We spent 3 days arguing about those. In fact, one time the majority leader said, `Why don't you go and solve that and don't bother me.' We did. So we left, and in a couple days we came back and got it boiled down to 10 covenants as part of this agreement. It clearly says things inconsistent with this, the President and the Democratic leadership will use everything within their power to see that those kinds of amendments are defeated. 
I am going to take another 3 or 4 minutes beyond the time I have just reserved and talk about a couple of other things. 
My good friend, Senator Hatch, I say to the Senator, if you desire to raise taxes on cigarettes--what is the amount you would like to do it in your bill? 
</TEXT>

</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-domenici-nm-42-19970521</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. Thirty, forty, sixty cents, you go to the Finance Committee. You are a distinguished member. You sit very, very high up in seniority on that Finance Committee. There is nothing in this budget agreement--nothing--that says you cannot try to raise cigarette taxes in that committee. You just propose it. You can raise cigarette taxes right there in that committee. You do not need very many votes. There is nothing that precludes you from it. 
Let me tell you, the irony of it all is that if the Kennedy-Hatch amendment passes, you will have the exact same difficulty getting the cigarette tax through as if you did not have this thing, because there is nothing in this amendment that you propose here today that says the Finance Committee of the United States is bound to vote in a cigarette tax--nothing. 
I said once--I will say it again--cigarette taxes are not mentioned in the amendment. The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts got up and said, we have drawn it like amendments have been drawn forever. You are right. And the interpretation and the efficacy is as it has exactly been forever. That foreverness has meant it is not binding, it is not binding on anyone. To the extent that you want to put a statement with this, it is hortatory. It is giving your views and talking to the American people about what you would like to see happen. But it is not binding, never has been binding. We have never had this kind of situation where you could make it binding. 
Now, having said that, I do not believe anybody in this country should believe that the President of the United States, the Democrats who were at the table with him, his three negotiators, Senator Domenici, Frank Lautenberg, John Kasich, and John Spratt--Members of the House, the last two--I do not think anybody should believe that we ignored a need in our society, to wit: to cover young children who are not covered. We did not. I can say with as much certainty and integrity and sincerity as Senator Hatch has said, we intend to cover them. We intend to cover those who are in need. We said it in disagreement; and there is $16 billion in there. 
Incidentally, for Members who might be interested how this money gets spent--and I draw no inferences from it--but the distinguished Senator, Senator Kennedy, does not sit on the Finance Committee. All the $16 billion that is in this agreement goes to the Finance Committee because they have Medicaid, which is one of 
the major programs. It is interesting, with the amendment, the committee that the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts sits on will get $18 billion to spend. So now we will split the responsibility, $18 billion to his committee, to the committee he serves on, and $18 billion for the Finance Committee. And, again, it seems to me there is little need for that. 
So I close by saying I have offered an amendment that clearly says and unequivocally says we have provided for the children who do not have insurance in this country, and how we provided it is contained in the budget resolution. 
I believe any Senator voting for that ought to be held to saying, `We voted for it. That's what we are getting. That's what the agreement says. And we are not going to vote to turn right around and destroy the very agreement that created that right.' 
I want to assure everyone, if this budget agreement falls apart, and I know on this one--I think I know what I am talking about--there is little assurance that this body is going to approve $16 billion for child health care, little assurance, because clearly there are all kinds of ideas on how we ought to do it, and it will take a few years for those to pan out. We said, `OK, Mr. President, even though you don't know how you're going to do it, we'll put it in there for you.' That is the very truth about the $16 billion. 
Mr. President, I want everyone to know--and I want to state for the other side--at the expiration of the time on this amendment, I will claim the floor back as the floor manager, and unless you intend to let us vote on the Domenici substitute, I will perfect the tree with another amendment, so we will get a vote on it, and we will get a vote on it before anything else happens here in the Senate in terms of this budget resolution. 
I yield the floor at this point.  
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to make just two arguments. 
The first one is somewhat in response to my friend, Senator Hatch, for whom I have great respect. 
Mr. President, I think it is inconsistent with the facts of the agreement between the President and the Congress for any Senator to stand up here on the floor and talk to the American people as if their proposal is the only one that is going to take care of children in America. That is not true, whether it come from my distinguished friend, the senior Senator, Senator Hatch, or from whomever. The statement should be that they think they have another way to do it. But to try to look out there and say to America this is a serious issue, it is about kids, as if to say the agreement we made with the President isn't about kids. 
So we are not going to stand here and let that occur without telling the American people that that just isn't so, no matter how or under what circumstance my good friend, Senator Hatch, desires, or speaks it on the floor of the Senate. We are just as much about kids as his proposal is. For him to stand here and imply that that isn't the case is just not fair. 
We believe in the agreement with the President, although we would do it a different way. We wouldn't send the money to the Labor and Health and Human Services Committee. We would send it to the Finance Committee. But we believe we took care of the kids who are going to be uninsured during the next 5 years of this budget agreement. 
So I just want in my first observation to say, yes, this is about kids. Yes, it is about uninsured kids in America. And, yes, we cover them. If we want to talk about another issue, a cigarette tax, which this amendment does not guarantee--in fact, there is 
every reason to believe that, if you adopt it, the Finance Committee of the U.S. Senate and the Ways and Means Committee of the U.S. House need not adopt it. 
So to make like that is the issue, like something in this amendment is going to get you cigarette taxes--which I am not against, incidentally, I am not against them--but that just isn't what the amendment does. You can talk about some bill you have in mind, but this is a budget, not a bill. 
My last point is this. I defy anyone--and I urge my good friends who would like to take the position that this amendment is not inconsistent with this agreement. I would like them to do just one thing. I ask my friend, Senator Hatch, to do just one thing: Just get the bipartisan agreement when you have a moment. Look at item No. 1. I will read it to you. `The elements of this bipartisan agreement provide for deficit reduction amounts that are estimated to be the result in the balanced budget by 2002.' 
It proceeds then to say that there is a tax--a summary of the agreement. It is in a chart form. The agreement then proceeds to say that the majority leader, the minority leader, the President of the United States--as I indicated, maybe not the Vice President, because maybe he is not bound by the President--but it says that this agreement, as contained in this piece of paper, these numbers, governs and that anything that will be offered that is inconsistent will be opposed. 
I say to Senator Hatch that his amendment takes this agreement, this one right here, and it changes two of the numbers right off the bat--the $85 billion on the tax cuts is changed by his amendment. In fact, it is reduced by $30 billion. Excuse me. The Presidential initiatives, a line here, $31 billion, you have altered that by adding $20 billion. 
So now I don't believe anybody ought to be taking the point that the majority leader of the U.S. Senate, or minority, or our whip, or myself as chairman, that when we say this does break the agreement, I cannot conceive how anybody could say that they have another interpretation that says it doesn't. That makes it a very important event. 
Would Senator Nickles like to speak for a few moments?

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, most people in the United States think the best thing we can do for kids and for children is to balance the budget of the United States. If my motion to table does not prevail, the chance of getting a balanced budget for our children and grandchildren then is out the window because this amendment that they have offered is a total breach of an agreement between our President, Democrats, and Republicans. It is as simple as that. 
Unless you vote to table it, you are voting to accept an amendment that kills the balanced budget, under the rubric of helping children. 
We have covered uninsured children in this bill to the tune of $16 billion. And there are few among us that think that is an insufficient amount to cover the uninsured children in the United States. I hope you will support the motion so we can get on with getting this job done. 
It has been an interesting debate. I thank Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch for the way they conducted themselves, although on occasion we all got a little bit too heated up, according to my wife who is watching this on television. She said, in particular, Senator Kennedy and Senator Domenici, if we talk a little lower our faces would not get so red. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the leader.

Mr. DOMENICI. I say to Senator Gramm, let me compliment you on the expression of your philosophy this evening. I think you have heard me a couple times. I think perhaps it is a question of how much can we do and get it done? But I have a vision of the United States that I would explain to you in a way that is very new to me. 
I did not grow up with this vision. I came to this place. I had been a public servant, and I kind of liked the idea so I said I will run for the Senate. I guess it was because in my State we had so few Republicans then that they looked around and said, well, that young guy just lost a race--thank God, it is the only one I ever lost--he is as good as any, why not ask him to run. So I ran. I came here as the first Republican in 38 years. 
I was here for about 3 years when an announcement came that the King of Spain--remember the young man, King Carlos of Spain, a magnificent transition figure in Spanish modern times. He had been a king, well-taken care of, no idea, as I thought, of freedom because he lived under a dictator, right, for all these years. Then, all of a sudden the dictator goes away, and they say, `You are in charge, King.' 
Then they said, `Why don't you come over and talk to the Congress.' So he came over here. I remember sitting in my office as if it were yesterday, and I said, `I don't know whether I ought to go.' As you already know, I like to work. I was sitting around my desk, in my early years, thinking it was far more important to call to New Mexico or write a letter to my constituents. Then something said, `You know, New Mexico has a lot of Spanish people in it. You know a lot of them. Maybe you ought to go because he might say something about the culture and you may learn something.' 
Well, Senator Gramm, I went. He gave an eloquent speech. I learned nothing about the Spanish culture. I knew more about that than what he talked about up there--he may know more than I--that he alluded to. 
He said something very intriguing that I had trouble with and I did not believe it for a while. He said all significant human achievement occurs when a man or a woman is free. I wrote that down and took it back to my office, and I said how could that be true? Michelangelo was a great achiever, and I ticked off in my mind a number of others that I had heard of in history that achieved a lot, and there was not any freedom around to speak of. I was wrong. There was very little freedom, but the great achievers were made free by selection. Somebody with a lot of money said, `I want to make this talented person free and I would like them to achieve.' 
Frankly, I got a picture of history in my mind right then, but the reason the world had achieved so little until we had more and more freedom of individuals was just that. There were not enough people free to be enterprising, to be innovative, because society did not let them be free. So what I ended up concluding was a different image of the United States where I concluded that we have been superachievers because we have been compared to the rest of the world. In history, we made more and more people free, we got rid of slavery, we made them free. As we moved along, we did civil rights and we made more people free. 
I began to understand as I worked here that there was something else and that was if you worked and made a profit in your business or a good salary in your work that freedom was to be measured by how much you had of that money and that achievement in wealth to use in whatever way you wanted. I came to the conclusion, once again, that our greatness in achievements, and our achievements are everywhere, was because we were leaving people with resources that they earned, to be free and take a chance. Some failed but many succeeded. 
Now, my 25 years here has not diminished that idea one bit. In fact, I believe that I can even make a case. You know how hard I work for the mentally ill. One day we had an exchange on the floor and tonight I am apologetic because I said to you, `It is too bad you do not know anything about the mentally ill,' and you said, `Yes, I do,' and you told me about somebody in your family. So I was not being fair that day. I was being very arrogant. 
But I can make an argument that if mentally ill people is how I think of freedom as the achievement mechanism for America collectively, if a mentally ill person can be cured of the devil in them, which people used to think is some kind of a devil that is a disease, you can cure 3 million people, America has more of a chance for even more achievement, because you never can tell which people you make free are going to be achievers. 
So you see, you have a notion here in your budget, your visionary budget, that you would like to leave more money in the hands of individuals. If I read you right, it is essentially to be free, it might even be free to make mistakes. I have talked to you about that, and you said sure, sometimes you just have to let people make mistakes, but let them make it while they are trying to do their thing with their resources. 
You probably had a much earlier vision and a more profound understanding because you are an economist and you understand capitalism so well, but I have been pleased to learn from you. Capitalism is the essence, when coupled with freedom, is the essence of opportunity because the capital works to achieve and the individual works to achieve, and when you marry them up you have an economy that is just hell bent for success and growth, and when you squeeze it, there are a lot of ways to squeeze. 
People wonder whether regulations have anything to do with freedom. We do not explain it very well. It has a lot to do with freedom because the extent to which you are regulated, you have taken a bit of freedom away from someone or something. 
Now we would both agree in a democratic capitalist society you cannot be free to do everything and anything. We pride ourselves on having laws, but what people do not understand is if you have regulations that are $50 billion more than they need to protect the public, you have taken away $50 billion worth of freedom somewhere in this country to grow and prosper and energize. So I understand that and I understand when you tax people in the wrong way and when you tax them too much the very same thing happens. 
In fact, I believe you, with your expertise as a Ph.D. in economics, can probably find times in our economic history when we taxed things so wrongly that you could actually prove that we went in the wrong direction. I am reminded of one, when in a fit of lunacy we put a big tax on these little boats. What happened? It was amazing, like you and I told them, but they said, `No, no, we are taxing these rich people that own boats.' Well, within 18 months we had our friends down here from those States saying, `Our workers are out of jobs because the people who own the boats decided you are taxing them so much they do not get the boats anymore.' It took a long time but we finally repealed that. To be honest, people have to have a degree of 
freedom or they will not buy a boat they want. They will say if you tax me too much I will go without, and there go workers and businesspeople. 
My problem is, Senator, that I do not believe with President Bill Clinton in the White House that we can get that budget, that consent of yours, that we could get it adopted and implemented. I think we almost tried something like this, you and I together, maybe even a little more, and we did not get anywhere. That does not mean you should ever stop trying what you are doing and expressing your vision, but frankly, I do not believe we can get it. I think you will know later this evening how many votes you will get for your proposal, and it is a little bit of an indication of what I felt when I started working this year. One of my better friends said they would finally say to the Senators who might not have been there, they said, `Domenici said to me last year unless we have some kind of assurance out of the White House I am not sure I want to do a totally Republican budget because I am not sure we are getting anywhere.' 
We are having a great exercise in doing what you and I are doing on the floor and maybe making some sense to a few million but we do not get it done, so I will not even take time to go through how much more we would have to reduce various programs so that Senators might know. I will just say that there would be a substantial reduction in the discretionary accounts of our country almost across the board and almost every one if your amendment was adopted over what we agreed to with the President. 
I am firmly convinced, Senator Gramm, that if we produced appropriations bills at those levels, I do not think we can get there because I do not think we can get that kind of agreement out of either case, and if we were to adopt them, I believe you would have a veto and we would be back as we have been before. So I chose as one who probably does not understand as deeply as you do what economic freedom is, but I think I have shown you today in the few minutes on the floor that I think I am getting it. It has taken me 65 years, but I think I am getting it. I think what we did is the best we can do. 
Frankly, I am going to say what I said before on the previous Kennedy-Hatch amendment. I believe it violates the budget agreement that we entered into, except I would not expect Senator Phil Gramm to read the agreement and say it does not. I think you would read it as the absolute man that you are and you would say, right upfront, it does. You would not try to make some argument that, well, it does not because it is this or that. It just does. 
Frankly, when I find amendments that do that, I hope you understand I am obligated to resist them if I feel comfortable and confident we are going to get there under the budget that you do not like. I totally appreciate every reason you give. I think it is better than not having a budget this year and I think, also, Senator, that unless we have some great experience that I do not contemplate, understanding what I can about the tea leaves, that we will actually balance before 2002, because we have used such economic assumptions that are so conservative that I believe we are going to be off again each year $40 billion or $50 billion, just as we have been the last 3 or 4 years when the economy helped this curve. 
Now, if we had a recession that lasted 3 years, all bets are off, but I assume even in the budget you propose we would be off the mark, there, too, if we had a recession for 3 years and 
we take into account what you economists do when you do multiple years of economic assumptions. You build the potential for recession into being a more conservative versus a more generous set of economic assumptions. That is what I have learned from the CBO as to how they build a recession into their numbers. 
Now, if anybody wants to ask how much more various programs will probably be reduced under Senator Gramm's proposal, I will look it up and go over and talk to you and see if I am right, but I believe you, again, are willing to stand up and say it would be substantial compared to this budget because you find enough savings in your approach to then use those savings and add on to the tax cuts that we have. 
Fellow Senators, I hope you understand that I have not for 1 minute this evening on the floor been critical of Phil Gramm and those who feel like he does. It is just that most of us who will be supporting this budget feel the same way, most of the Republicans who support the basic budget, feel the same. They think there are two ways to get there and that the bipartisan approach is more apt to be successful because it is more apt to happen. It will not necessarily be more successful as an instrument in accomplishing a vision, but it probably will occur. 
With that, I say to the Senate, my instructions from our leader are that we not take any longer time than you need and perhaps my ranking member, and then we would proceed to a vote as soon as possible. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, we are going to try to do a little business even before we vote. 
Senator Gramm has another amendment that we are going to take up shortly that is acceptable, and Senator Brownback has one that has been agreed to. 
But I would like to announce to the Senate that what we are going to try to do is to vote at 6:30, and Senator Gramm has indicated that we will try to do that and work on that together. I would like then to ask unanimous consent that when that vote is finished Senator Strom Thurmond be allowed to speak for 10 minutes, Senator Robert Byrd be allowed to speak for up to 20 minutes thereafter, and Senator Moseley-Braun has an amendment to send up. We are not going to take an amendment to debate it until it is on the list. We are putting amendments on lists and agreeing to tell people that they can take them up.

So could we start over and see if I could straighten matters out so that at least I do not feel embarrassed about having everybody talking at the same time. 
I would like for the rest of the evening if somebody here in the management side of this could invent some streamlined method of letting people introduce these amendments that are nothing more than conforming UC requests that said you have to file them tonight. Maybe you have a code word for it and we just say this is X amendment and we will get it done so people do not have to read them. And if you get a unanimous-consent that kind of does that for us, we would both appreciate that, I assume.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wanted to just alert the Senate, we were not quite sure when this vote was going to occur, and I have just spoken to our leadership office and they would like to give Senators a little bit of time to get in here. So I wonder if we could start this vote at a quarter of. 
Mr. President, I think what we will do, I have a couple of comments, and then I think what we will do is go ahead and have the up-or-down vote and just keep it open for 20 minutes or more, and that will give Senators who are en route a chance to get here. I think that will be all right. 
Mr. President, I compliment Senator Mack on the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, but I would be remiss if I did not congratulate the Congress on what it has already done for the National Institutes of Health. 
Yes, we should do more. But last year we gave the National Institutes of Health a 7 percent increase. This year, if all goes as planned, they will get a 3 1/2 percent increase. 
Now, the National Institutes of Health this year under the new plan will be a $13.1 billion enterprise, so it is not like we are not doing something significant. And while I believe that a sense-of-the-Senate saying we should do more, if we can, makes good sense, let me suggest that the greatest health science in the world is going on at the National Institutes Of health of the United States, the biggest breakthroughs are being made there along with the business investment, pharmaceutical investment in America. We are truly at the cutting edge of some very significant wellness events. 
Sometime when I have time in the Chamber, we will talk a little more about how the Human Genome Project got started, for it is an interesting kind of story. I do not intend to do it tonight. It is one of the greatest programs we have going, and I thank Senator Frist for mentioning my name in conjunction with its inception. I had a bit to do with that. 
Now, if we had any time in opposition, we yield it back. 
Has the Senator asked for the yeas and nays? The yeas and nays have been requested.

Mr. DOMENICI. All right. 
Mr. President, I want to thank and compliment a few people before I proceed to my substantive remarks. First and foremost, I thank Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader of the Senate. He has exhibited a rare determination and real dedication and commitment to trying to get a bipartisan budget resolution through so that the Congress could do the work of the people this year and do as much of it together as we possibly could. 
I thank the Democratic leadership, at least the Democratic leadership in the Senate, for their work in behalf of this resolution. Senator Daschle has been extremely helpful. On the Democrat side, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, has been extremely helpful. He has worked hard. And together we intend to get this budget resolution out of here as close as possible to the form approved by the committee yesterday afternoon, by as overwhelming a vote as we could expect, 17 to 4, and I believe this morning the vote finished up at 17 to 5. So there were 17 Senators from both sides of the aisle and 5 against. 
I thank President Clinton and his negotiators, the President personally for his insistence we stay with it and for his early determinations made to this Senator and to Senator Lott that he wanted to proceed to try to do this. 
Obviously, there are many other people who were very important. I am not going to name them all here now but in due course we will try to do that. 
Let me say to those listening today that 2 weeks ago we announced in the rotunda that Republicans and Democrats had reached an important agreement on a bipartisan budget plan. That announcement represented a crucial step in both sides coming together to produce a budget in the best interests of the American people. 
Yesterday, the Senate Budget Committee took the next step and approved this bipartisan plan, and I sincerely hope this body will follow suit and pass this agreement within the next day or two at the most. 
Because the real winners in this budget are the American working families, this budget will lead to reduced Federal spending, the largest tax cut since 1981, and ultimately to lower interest rates that will mean more and better paying jobs. 
Moreover, this agreement responds to the American people who clearly sent a message in the last election, tough elections for many Members with many issues, but I believe there was one unmistakable resonance through that campaign across America. I think the people said work together when the interests of the American people are at stake, work together when the issues are American. Do not fight all the time. So we have done just that. A year will find this Congress on opposite sides in the best tradition of debate, disagreeing with each other. Ultimately, parts of the implementation of this budget will find us disagreeing, but the truth is we have taken, yesterday afternoon, the first real step in saying to the American people we accept your request, in many cases your desire and your begging us to work together, and we have done just that. And in doing so we have produced a compromise that I believe will improve the lives of families today while providing a better future for tomorrow. 
It will mean, when it is all finished, the first balanced budget in 30 years. It will mean $135 billion in gross tax relief over 5 years. Included in this will be a capital gains tax differential, obviously a child tax credit, and other things that both sides have talked about. Clearly, it will include some of the President's tax requests with reference to education, higher education and some of the ideas he has enacted. 
Now, a budget resolution does not tell anybody precisely what these are. The committees that have to write the law will do that. But what we do give them is a flow of taxes over the years saying how much they can cut each year, and at the end of 5 years they will have a gross revenue number of $135 billion in new tax cuts. We have also agreed, the leadership has, that over 10 years just in the normal sequence of things that body of new taxes will amount to $250 billion in permanent reductions over a 10-year period. 
I believe those two are pretty good propositions that many Americans would support, but we do not want to stop there. We have made adjustments to the trust fund for senior citizens under Medicare such that it will be solvent for about 10 years. That provides Americans, American leadership with ample opportunity to permanently reform the Medicare system. It also without question provides more options for the Medicare plan which can be adopted as part of this agreement by the Finance Committee and its counterpart in the House. Ten years of solvency for Medicare while providing more choice is, indeed, accomplishing something significant. 
Entitlement reforms over the next 10 years including those that will be found in Medicare amount to about $630 billion over the next 10 years. Some of these might be challenged by Members and we are willing to debate them. But it is obvious that the entitlement package we are used to in our country will grow far less because of this budget resolution than if we had left everything alone. Funding for White House and Republican domestic priorities and Democratic priorities including education, transportation, housing, environment, crime control, and science programs have been provided for. 
All of those will be in the ascendancy, and all of those will be deemed priorities so that the Appropriations Committee will have the full support of the leadership in funding these items at a higher level, including, if I did not mention, the basic environmental protection funding for the United States.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, passing this Balanced Budget Act of 1997 will force the Federal Government to finally live within its means. It makes permanent change that will reduce Government spending by some $320 billion in the next 5 years and more than $1 trillion over the next decade. 
The agreement will also give families relief by cutting gross taxes, as I have indicated before, by $135 billion in the first 5 years and gross taxes by as much as $350 billion over 10 years. 
Seniors can be assured that Medicare will remain solvent, ensuring this solvency for 10 years by enacting reforms that slow the growth of spending while providing seniors with more choices, which is what we need in the Medicare system. But nobody should assume that this budget resolution, and I would be prepared as one who knows a bit about budget resolutions, neither this nor any budget resolution will be the vehicle to provide permanent, long-term major reform of the Medicare system which is going to be needed within the next 5 to 6 to 7 years to meet what everybody understands is a very, very large population increase, where the demographics begin to change dramatically because of the baby boomers. We do not have a plan. This budget is not a plan to make Medicare solvent for that kind of change. Anybody who thought it should be has a mistaken understanding of what you can do in a budget resolution. But we did a lot, because it is done on a bipartisan basis and with the President. 
This overall plan will shrink Government, making most of the programs leaner and more efficient. Medicaid, Federal retirement, housing, veterans, student loans programs are just some of those that will be targeted for reform and savings, while overall spending will be reduced, as I have indicated, over 10 years by an excess of $1 trillion. We have added money to protect priorities, and so those priorities that I have mentioned find themselves this time in this budget resolution, and the agreement that attends it finds modest but necessary increases for education, transportation, anticrime, environment, and science. 
Contrasted with other budget resolutions, wherein these kinds of ideas would be nothing more than telling the Appropriations Committee what we hope would happen, we have entered into a very major bipartisan leadership agreement, which I will hold up here, and eventually it will be made a part of the Record, entitled the `Bipartisan Agreement on the Budget,' dated May 15, between the President and the leadership of Congress. It contains the summary tables, the description of agreements by major category, both in the discretionary programs and the mandatory and budget process reforms that have been agreed to that will have to work their way through the various bills, Mr. President, as they find themselves reported by the various committees. 
There are also two letters pertaining to the taxes which were executed by the Republican leaders of the House and Senate directed to the committee chairmen and the President indicating the situation regarding the tax cuts. Once again, I know those listening would like for those of us who write a budget to tell them exactly what the capital gains tax will be. We don't know that. We know it will be significantly reduced. Exactly when the $500 child care credit will be totally implemented we cannot tell you, but it will be, because, with all of the tax proposals, it may be that some have to wait a little bit and others will start more quickly, but that will be done. Some education tax relief for middle-income Americans who are sending children to college as part of the President's request is included in the letter of agreement as to what our committees will work on as they carry out and implement this budget. 
It should be pointed out that this is the first time we have ever had such an agreement, and that means that those of us in the bipartisan leadership and those who worked on this committee, my Democratic counterpart and I, have a very serious responsibility to see we try to carry out on the floor of the Senate not only the budget resolution, but the terms of the agreement as it applies to the budget resolution. We will try that, yet we will have the Senate working its will in its normal manner for the next couple of days. 
I am sure there will be many very, very difficult votes. I myself believe the budget is about as good as we are going to get it. It is now agreed to by Democrats and Republicans and the President. I believe before we finish, it will receive an overwhelming vote of support, and we will just have to wait and see whether that prediction is true or not. 
We have also agreed in two areas to deal with some problems in society that needed some attention, and let me address the two in a general way. 
First of all, it is obvious that even with Medicaid, which 
should cover many of our children, poor children, there are a lot of American children who have no health insurance. We have agreed to put money into two programs, and in the basic agreement that we have with the President, it is spelled out that over the next 5 years, $16 billion will be spent in an effort to cover all children in America who are not covered. There is a lot of leeway on the part of the committees to write that, but it is obvious that there will be added moneys for Medicaid so that they can pick up many of the children who are not covered. There are additional resources in there for a program that will go back to the States, a partnership arrangement, where the States will receive our money and match it and try to cover other children in their own way as they manage the programs in the best possible way. 
That is one area that we agreed needed coverage, and I am pleased to say my own polling of Republicans, not a whip check or anything, indicates there are many of them who want to do that. The question remains, how do we do it best and what will it ultimately cost? But we have provided the $16 billion that goes to the committee of jurisdiction to do the very best job they can. 
We also found in the U.S. Senate not too many days ago on an appropriations bill presented by Senator Stevens that the Senate voted by a huge margin to continue coverage for a group of legal--legal--residents of the United States who happened to come here as immigrants in a legal manner and remain here legally but are not American citizens. They come under an American program of generosity, which permits family reunification. Many of them come here as grandparents and parents. The program has broken down because the sponsors who are supposed to take care of them have not taken care of them, and the law intended to do that has not been enforced for years. As a result, there are more than a few thousand disabled senior Americans who are here as legal immigrants who are getting an SSI check every month. This budget resolution says we are providing sufficient funds so that those people will not drop off the rolls automatically on a date certain as contemplated under last year's law but will continue coverage so long as they live. 
We have also said if there are Americans of the same condition that are here under the same circumstance that I described, if they reach the time when they are both senior and disabled, they would be entitled to SSI. But that ends the pool. In the future, any newcomers under these rules will have to rely upon their sponsors, and we wrote strong laws last year to make the sponsors more responsible. 
Those are the two major areas of additional expenditures that we have put in place and agreed with the President on. 
I will just make a few comparisons by dollars and show those who are paying any attention what we are talking about. 
While some accounts are protected, as I indicated, the emphasis in this plan is clear: For every new $1 added to the budget, it is reduced by $15. For every new $1 in spending, there is roughly $3.50 in tax cuts. 
This displays in a very vivid manner what happens to the deficit. Without the agreement is the red line; with the agreement is the green line. We think that is as simple as we can show it. The deficit will be going up from 90 and not coming back down significantly, according to the best estimates. And under these estimates, the green line represents how we will 
get to balance and, in fact, have a slight surplus by 2002, a pretty important and very-easy-to-understand chart. 
This simple chart is nondefense discretionary spending. In our national budget, we have essentially three kinds of expenditures. One batch is called discretionary, which simply means we appropriate it every year. I am not one who thinks that is the greatest idea. I am hoping we can change that and appropriate for 2 years at a time. Part of that is defense, which is appropriated every year. It is a discretionary account annually done, and then all the domestic programs that are appropriated every year are called the nondefense discretionary program. 
The sum total of those amount to about $540 billion plus, about 37 percent of the budget. Some people think it is the whole budget, but it is about 37 percent. 
This shows under the greenline, spending without this agreement, for the discretionary domestic part of this budget, and under the red line, it shows what will happen. There were some a few weeks ago who were saying this budget agreement was one that was just throwing money at the discretionary programs instead of trying to get some frugality and some better performance. 
This redline indicates that the entire discretionary piece of our Government for the domestic programs will go up, Mr. President, one-half of 1 percent a year. In the prior decade, it went up 6 percent on average. For some, that is bad news. For others, that is good news. The fact that the President of the United States has agreed to that and that we have and said even while it is adjusting at such a low rate of growth, we want to have some priorities like roads, like in education, to me seems to be the kind of thing the public would like us to do. 
Share of the total outlays of our budget has changed dramatically, and I will just show that quickly and summarize my remarks very quickly. 
When John Kennedy was President of the United States, the budget of the United States was broken up into two parts and went something like this. The interest on the debt was small, Mr. President, so let's leave that aside. It was about 67 percent discretionary spending for defense and domestic programs, those annual ones we do every year, and the rest of the budget, which would be about 33 percent, were what we call mandatory or entitlement programs. 
That means a program that spent out on its own, unless Congress changes the law--a Social Security check, a Medicare benefit payment to a hospital. 
All the other programs, pensions, and the like, and I guess I would summarize them this way, any program that the U.S. Government has that if they failed to pay it to a citizen or an institution that is entitled to it, they can prevail in getting their money from the Treasury of the United States direct through a court of law. 
It turns out from President Kennedy's time to ours, it has flipped on its head, and 67 percent of the budget is now on automatic pilot, running on its own, mandatory programs which we can only control if we change the underlying law by a vote of the Congress and the signature of the President. The balance of 33 percent makes up all of the expenditures for defense and domestic programs. 
So it seems to most of us that we know where the area of growth is and the areas that cry out for reform if we are going to bring this Government's fiscal policy under control and not have to look at taxes skyrocketing 15 years from now and the bill that our children must pay getting bigger and bigger and the credit card that we kind of take from them without representation. If ever there was taxation without representation, it is the deficit you impose on kids where they do not get to vote. It clearly means they are going to have to pay taxes in order to pay these bills that they were not even around to vote on. 
So I believe when you look at what we have done and add three other things, we will enforce this program. The discretionary caps, the discretionary programs that I have described for domestic spending, we will have a cap on them for each year at a dollar number agreed to in the resolution. That dollar number is the one that moves this one-half percent growth we spoke of. That will be a cap that says, at the end of a year if you spend more than that, by operation of law, every program in the Government will get cut by the percentage needed to bring it back to that cap. 
It has been the only effective tool we have had. It has worked twice because we have only breached it twice. That is set to expire. We need to reput that in the law for another 5 years. That is provided for here. 
We also preserve budget points of order against those caps. I will not go into that, but that is a second remedy to make sure we are doing what we promised and what we say here. 
In addition, the deficit comes down each year starting in 1998, albeit not as much as we would like in the early years because, remember, we are cutting taxes in those early years and the entitlement program savings grow in the outyears. But essentially it will not go back up and down in spurts; it will be at a level and gradual road and path downward. 
We used conservative economics in this budget. There is some confusion about that. But if one wants to check them, we use the economic assumptions of the Congressional Budget Office as to growth, unemployment, and those basic ingredients, those basic pieces of the economy that we measure. 
This budget is conservative. So when somebody says you have not provided for a recession, I ask, have you ever seen a budget presented by a President or Congress that anticipates specifically a recession and says in 2 years we have a recession and therefore things are changed? Obviously, nobody does that. But when you use the conservative numbers that the Congressional Budget Office says should be used, they say built within it over time is the conservativeness that would permit you to be much safer in case of a recession, that your numbers will not be very much out of kilter, because of the conservatism of the economic assumptions. 
Now, later on, if a Senator wants to talk about the revenues that we assume will come into this budget, I will be pleased to do that. We were confronted midstream with a change in the revenue expectations, but I would be pleased to discuss that with anybody who chooses during the next 2 days. 
Suffice it to say that we hope--we found out the revenues were going to be up, and the Congressional Budget Office, heretofore very conservative in that regard, had decided that their estimates were too low. We spent only about $30 billion of their $225 billion, and that was done for very specific purposes, and the rest stayed in there as deficit reduction. 
So I believe for the future of our country and in particular for the future of our children, the time is now to pass this budget rather intact and get on with implementing it. 
Mr. President and fellow Senators, this budget has the best chance of reaching the reality that is predicted within the four corners of this resolution of any we have produced, because this is not one party's budget resolution, and that party being in Congress, and another party's President being in the White House with a different idea. Since we have something that is agreed to by both, it would seem to me that its implementation has a much better chance of being achieved rather than just fought over and reach stalemates because we cannot agree. 
That is why last year as I finished doing our Republican 
budget, I said, I hope I do not have to do one that is just Republican again unless we happen to have a Republican President, because it would seem to me you have to take into consideration the President and his wishes to some extent. And I believe we have done that. And he has taken ours into account to some extent. And that is the final product. 
So, fellow Senators, that is my best explanation. I will answer anybody's questions and go into as much detail on any parts of it that anyone wants. But for now, again, if you can give us ideas about amendments you intend to offer, it will be greatly appreciated. 
With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. They grow anything you like in New Mexico. It is all sweet, aromatic, and beautiful. 
Mr. President, I want to make a few points. 
First of all, I am very glad, even though I did not intend to during this budget debate, to go through a litany of what Republicans have stood for and what we have accomplished, nor do I intend at this moment to go through all of the things the President asked for that he didn't get. I would like to make just a couple of comments. 
First of all, I believe that I should be very proud of being a Republican because I don't believe without Republicans pushing for a balanced budget this President would ever have gotten to the point where he would have been for a balanced budget, much less negotiating one with us. I think history will reveal that. It was very hard to get him to come to that point. 
I am not now offering this as a critical thing but merely saying that Republicans--since my friend Senator Lautenberg chose to have a great litany of Democratic things the Democratic Party has done--I am very pleased to be part of the party that actually pushed this country and its leaders to get a balanced budget. 
Second, I would like to say I am unabashed in talking about tax cuts. 
Mr. President, there is no question that our philosophy and our idea is that tax dollars don't belong to the Government, that they belong to the people who earned it, and that the Government ought to take from the people only that minimum amount needed leaving the people as free as possible. 
I believe that before we are finished, many middle-income families will be receiving some of their money back. We will not be saying that we are refunding taxes to them. They will be keeping some of their money, which we are hopeful as time passes they can keep more and more of as we make Government more and more efficient. 
The country with the most individual freedom is the country that is going to achieve the most. And one measurement of that over time is going to be the level of taxation that the Government chooses by virtue of which they take from people rather than leave money with people. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, because there will be a lot of people supporting my motion to table, I do not want them to feel the least bit embarrassed about doing that because, as a matter of fact, this agreement that is before us contains every single nickel that the President of the United States asked for in terms of Head Start--$2.7 billion. That is what he asked for. It is a priority item. It must be funded. And you can't do better than that. 
We have a good record in the U.S. Congress in terms of child care. Mr. President, $1 billion was added last year, and $4.1 billion in the welfare bill. 
So those who support my motion are, indeed, doing that with the full cognizance that the U.S. Congress and the President have done right by these programs over the last 2 years, and intend to do even better by them without the Dodd amendment when it is tabled tonight, because we are going to leave that $2.7 billion in. It is in the agreement right now. 
With that, Mr. President, I move to table the Dodd amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, yes, I do oppose the amendment, and let me tell the Senate why. First of all, I think everybody should understand that revenues are not the only thing we estimate in the budget. We estimate the economic growth, we estimate the inflation, we estimate the unemployment, and, frankly, all of them are estimates. We also estimate the amount of revenues that are coming in. 
Might I suggest, it is very interesting, during this recovery, which is not an enormously high recovery in terms of gross domestic product growth, it has been an enormous yielder of revenues. Revenues have been coming in for 4 successive years at much higher than the Congressional Budget Office ever assumed, and, frankly, we have been saying the OMB is too generous, it has even been coming in higher than they have assumed. 
On the other hand, the economic growth, the gross domestic product, has come in higher than estimated by either OMB or CBO. Now, the best you can do in a budget resolution is get the information regarding those factors that you do not have control over, how much revenue is coming in, how fast are we going to grow, what is the inflation rate going to be, how much unemployment are you going to expect and the other myriad of indicators of economic significance to the country. 
Why we would just take one, revenues, and say if revenues do not meet the expectation, that we would then set about to do what? To cut the appropriated accounts. 
Let me remind everyone, the appropriated accounts are now about 33 percent of the budget, and guess what they are, Mr. President? Half of them are defense--about half, almost split in the middle--and half are all the rest of the domestic programs. But how about this? What about the 67 percent of the budget that are the entitlements and mandatory programs and all the other things? 
It would seem to me if you are going to have some kind of 
automatic adjustment--we tried this before and it has never worked--but if you are going to have one, then you ought to do it to everything. Why would you pick out defense, and it essentially is going to get half the cut if such is necessary? I do not think that is fair. Right off the bat, I would oppose this amendment on that alone. 
There are others who say, `If you only do defense, we will support you, Senator from Colorado, and leave out the domestic.' But the point of it is, you are not going to be absolutely accurate when it comes to estimating. You are not going to be absolutely accurate. You do the very best you can, and then you make the alterations year by year if such are required. 
I have even reached the point where I think you ought to make the alterations every 2 years. That is what I think about estimating. Having to go through budgets and appropriations, I think it ought to be every 2 years rather than one. 
I do commend the distinguished Senator from my neighboring State of Colorado. He is a new Senator, and he knows a lot about putting budgets together. He knows a lot about putting reserve funds in place so that you come out right, because he has told me about them in his State of Colorado, a good conservative State that knows how to budget. 
Frankly, it is very difficult to be that accurate with our National Government's budget the size it is, since we have so many programs that, if you change the economic growth just a little bit, then the unemployment compensation goes up a whole bunch and we have a lot of indicators, a lot of things that are related to this estimating that we cannot be certain of, other than look back after we have done it. 
Incidentally, we have even done that. We have even said that, if that is the case, let's look back and correct it retroactively. I am not for that either. I am for being conservative in the estimating, and we have been as conservative as you can be in this budget. We have used the economic assumptions of the Congressional Budget Office in terms of growth, in terms of all the other important indicators, and I believe that that is among the lowest and most conservative set of estimates out there. I think blue chips' is higher than that. I think OMB is higher than that. Most of the major companies who do it have higher ones than we do. I think we are protecting the integrity of this budget as best we can by using that approach. 
Once again, I commend my friend and colleague and neighbor for being genuinely concerned and targeting some of the issues that we might look at more carefully and try to handle in a better way. 
Let me suggest that the only other amendment after my good friend from Colorado completes his argument is Senator Hollings' amendment. I kind of made a mistake. I thought we were going to have a full half hour, starting at 7:30, for Senator Hollings, but it looks like we are going to vote at a quarter of. So I hope if somebody can get hold of him and get him here earlier--I will not use much time in opposition to his amendment, so he will have all the time once he gets here until the vote. I yield the floor.

Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk about trust funds. But let everybody understand that the amendment has nothing to do with trust funds. The amendment has to do with just two things. 
One, it strikes all of the tax cuts provided in this budget agreement, hammered out with the President and the Democratic leaders and the Republican leaders of both Houses. That is No. 1. Strike them all. 
Second, it says that the $31.2 billion over 5 years of new initiatives that we have hammered out with the President--and we cut his initiatives almost in half to get there--but it says those initiatives are gone, too. 
So essentially the President got $31 billion in initiatives on covering the little kids and things like that that most of us want. He would take that out of this agreement, and at the same time, take out all of the tax cuts. 
I don't intend to argue the substantive issue, which I think is totally wrong for America today. I just suggest that nothing could more basically attack the agreement than this, for the fundamentals of the agreement are gone if this amendment passes. 
I yield any time I may have.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997. Let me first begin by stating that an abundance of misinformation has characterized the debate on the partial-birth abortion procedure. I am deeply troubled at how abortion activists have misled the American public, Members of Congress, and especially the President, on the number of partial-birth abortions performed each year and the reasons for them. 
The debate on this issue reminds me of a variation of the old courtroom saying: If you have the facts, then argue the facts. If you have the law, then argue the law. If you have neither the law or the facts, then don't tell the truth. 
The proponents of the partial-birth abortion have neither the facts nor the law, so they argue with lies. 
Ron Fitzsimmons, the executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, which represents approximately 200 independently owned abortion clinics across the country, recently admitted in February of this year, that he `lied' through his teeth when he said that the procedure was used rarely and only on women whose lives were in danger or whose fetuses were damaged. According to Mr. Fitzsimmons, he `spouted the party line' about the procedure--even though he believed his statements were wrong. 
In debating a procedure as grotesque as the partial-birth abortion, the facts regarding its use and necessity are important. Because the facts about this procedure are so damaging, pro-abortionists like Mr. Fitzsimmons, have tried to distort or withhold facts from the American people. Let me highlight some of the mistruths that have surrounded this issue. 
Proponents of the partial-birth abortion claim that the procedure is rare--only occurring about 500 to 600 times a year. However this is not true. The number of partial-birth abortions is closer to 4,000 to 5,000 a year. In New Jersey alone, at least 1,500 procedures are done each year. 
Proponents of the partial-birth abortion also claim that the procedure is necessary to save the life or health of the mother. This is not true. According to the more than 600 doctors nationwide who make up the Physicians' Ad-hoc Coalition for Truth, it is never medically necessary to kill an unborn child in the second or third trimester of pregnancy in order to protect the life, health, or future fertility of the mother. Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has stated that the `partial-birth abortion is never necessary to protect a mother's health or her future fertility.' Even the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has admitted that there are `no circumstances under which this procedure would be the only option to save the life of the mother and preserve the health of the woman.' 
The fact is that partial-birth abortions are elective and not performed for medical reasons. As one abortion doctor stated most of the abortions were performed on women who didn't realize, or didn't care how far along they were. 
Proponents of partial-birth abortion fail to mention that the 3-day-long procedure actually increases the risk of harm to the mother. After 21 weeks, an abortion is two times as risky for the mother as childbirth. 
Finally, proponents of the partial-birth abortion claim it is used only in extreme cases of fetal abnormality. This is not true. Mr. Fitzsimmons admitted that the majority of these procedures are performed on healthy fetuses and healthy mothers. In a March 3, 1997, article in American Medical News, Mr. Fitzsimmons admitted that he called around to doctors who performed the procedure. According to Mr. Fitzsimmons, `I learned right away that this was being done for the most part in cases that did not involve those extreme circumstances.' 
It is disheartening that the debate on this issue has been so clouded by misinformation. The simple truth is that partial-birth abortions are common and the majority of the procedures are performed on healthy mothers and babies. 
On an issue as emotionally charged and divisive as abortion, elected officials have a heightened responsibility to carefully gather the facts and to vote their consciences.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, the first concurrent resolution on the Budget for 1986. 
This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget through May 19, 1997. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of the 1997 concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. Res. 178), show that current level spending is above the budget resolution by $16.9 billion in budget authority and by $12.6 billion in outlays. Current level is $20.5 billion above the revenue floor in 1997 and $101.9 billion above the revenue floor over the 5 years 1997-2001. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $219.6 billion, $7.6 billion below the maximum deficit amount for 1997 of $227.3 billion. 
Since my last report, dated April 15, 1997, there has been no action to change the current level of budget authority, outlays or revenues.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that will convey tracts of land, referred to as `acquired lands,' to the Carlsbad Irrigation District in New Mexico. These are lands that were once owned by the beneficiaries of the irrigation project, and acquired by the Federal Government when the Bureau of Reclamation assumed the responsibility of construction and operation of the irrigation project in the early part of this century. Since that time, the Carlsbad Irrigation District has repaid its indebtedness to the Federal Government, which included not only its contractual share of construction costs, but also all costs associated with the project land and facilities that were acquired from the project beneficiaries. 
This legislation is specific to the Carlsbad project in New Mexico, and directs the Carlsbad Irrigation District to continue to manage the lands as they have been in the past, for the purposes for which the project was constructed. It will accomplish three things: First, convey title to acquired lands and facilities to the District; second, allow the District to assume the management of leases and the benefits of the receipts from these acquired lands; and third, provide authority for the Bureau of Reclamation to cooperate with the Carlsbad Irrigation District on water conservation projects at the Carlsbad project. This bill protects the interests that the State of New Mexico has in some of those lands. 
During the 104th Congress, the Carlsbad Irrigation District presented testimony related to the transfer of acquired lands before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on one occasion, and before the House Committee on Resources on two occasions. Additionally, the administration expressed on several occasions before these two committees that they want to move forward with acquired land transfers where they make sense. The Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, Eluid Martinez, has informed the district and me that he believes that the Carlsbad project is one of several projects where the Bureau would like to pursue transfer opportunities. With this in mind, I believe that the legislation I am introducing today will provide the Bureau with the ability to accomplish their stated goal in a fair and equitable manner.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it isn't too often in the Senate that a chairman of a committee gets a chance to play Solomon and be fair. But Senator Stevens got a chance to do that, and that is what he did in this bill. He decided--and we should all listen carefully--to be fair. Let me tell you the history of half of this problem. The reason I happen to know about it is because I caught the error. The U.S. Treasury Department does calculations upon which the formula is based. In 1994, they made a mistake, just literally made an error in their calculations. Guess what happened? A whole series of States, including the States of the Senator from California and the Senator from Texas, and some other States, were euphoric because they got a huge windfall announced in their formula--a huge windfall. Well, when a batch of States get a windfall, a batch of States get less and I happen to be one of those. I don't get very much anyway, but I looked and said, how could this be? What happened? We had a formula and the money was distributed differently for some reason. Now, for a little while, nobody from the administration wanted to talk about it. But that didn't last very long because Senator D'Amato and Senator Bingaman from New Mexico joined with me and asked none other than the Treasurer of the United States to come to the office and bring his legal counsel. 
We asked the transportation leader--the head man from the executive--`Come and bring your solicitor.' And, before they left the room, they said, `We will get back to you.' And, before the day passed, they called and said, `We made a mistake. It has nothing to do with what people were entitled to. We made a mistake.' But they said, `Isn't it tough? This is an election year. And Texas just thought they were going to get 100 and some million dollars more than last year. What would you like us to do?' We said, `Fix it.' 
Now we have another batch of lawyers. `Can you fix it?' Imagine. `You unfixed it, but can you fix it?' They concluded that it could be fixed. But it didn't get fixed until after the election. And fix it they did. 
Senator Stevens in this bill properly has $318 million that goes to those States that thought they were going to get the higher allocation but didn't because of the error, and we are giving it to them anyway. Speaking of fairness, there is $318 million going to States who shouldn't have gotten it because this is acknowledging that we are going to pay them under an erroneous formula. We gave them back the money under an erroneous formula and said, `Let's be fair.' That is half of this issue.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the rest of this bill has to do with another thing. That is why I said--and the distinguished chairman is playing solidly--there is a portion of the highway bill under ISTEA, a provision called 90 Percent of Payments. Everybody that had anything to do with this bill, dig it up, go look at what everyone thought would happen to that. Nobody thought there would be very much money under this program. In fact, there are some throw sheets showing it was a very small amount of money in there. But guess what happened? We transferred the 2 1/2 -cent gasoline tax that we never expected to, and that fund, never expecting that money, is now bloated, and as a result it is giving States additional money. 
So our friend from Texas said, let's be fair. Let's be fair, and make sure that States like New Mexico--and, incidentally, 27 others--there are 27 winners. If you want to pay winners and losers, there are 27 winners under Stevens. I hope you don't vote for it just because it is a winner. But that happens around here every now and then, and 27 is more than one-half of 50. 
So I would assume, if you want to vote what is best for your State, vote for 1997. In addition, the committee has included $475 million for 31 States to bring their 1997 limitation to 1996 levels. While I disagree with the decision to include the $318 million requested in the first place, I believe the committee's inclusion of additional funds reflects the fairest compromise available to make to the States as a whole.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman, Senator Stevens. And I say to my friend from Texas, I am very hopeful that one of these days on something real important that will come along, the Senator and I will be on the same side. I just happen, on this one, not to agree with the Senator, and I would like to take my few moments to explain to the Senate why. 
Actually, Mr. President, when we drafted the budget law of the United States, we put a provision in it that said you prepare the budgets so that whatever it is Congress decides it wants to spend money for, you budget it, allocate it, put it in place, and then in the event that a disaster occurs, and the disaster is serious enough for Congress to say it is an emergency, and as a further safety valve it is serious enough for the President to say it is a disaster and an emergency, then Congress in its wisdom said that spending does not become part of the ordinary budget. It is on top of the budget. 
Now, frankly, there is good reason to suggest that perhaps, perhaps in the interest of frugality, we ought to not declare this $5.6 billion covering disasters in 33 States of America, as emergency disaster spending. There may be some reason to say it is not a disaster. I do not believe that is the case. In addition, I do not think it is the case from the standpoint of rational, reasonable fiscal policy. 
Now, our Government is big. Our budgets are big. We are already halfway through the year that we have for which we have budgeted money for all of the things the American people expect to get from their National Government. I would be the first to say that I will join with anyone who would like to spend 2 years going through the programs of our Government and see how many we could throw away. We have not done that, and incidentally, the Gramm amendment will not do that. The Gramm amendment takes all programs as they are and says that after you have appropriated for them, and they are operating on a 12-month cycle and you are well past a half year before you ever start taking any of this money away, then you just come along and take it away from the programs that are already funded. 
It is interesting to me, and I do not ask this question of my friend from Texas, but I merely put this before the Senate, how big would a disaster have to be for it to make absolutely no sense to take the cost of the disaster aid out of the ongoing programs of our Government? I believe $5.6 billion is big enough. If one is interested in making Government smaller, I say to the Senator from West Virginia, then maybe there ought to be three or four disasters in a row, maybe three or four at $6 billion each, and then one could say, let us not declare them an emergency. Let us just take them out of Government programs which we have already appropriated. 
I am not suggesting, the Senator from New Mexico is not suggesting, that anybody is thinking of that. I am merely suggesting that it is not very good fiscal policy, it is not very good Government policy to shrink Government by not paying for disasters as emergencies but, rather, by cutting Government to pay for them. 
Now, there may be an overwhelming number of Senators here tonight who want to shrink Government by paying for disasters from the ordinary operations of Government. I would think of 
innumerable ways of shrinking Government that are better than doing it that way. I rise here tonight to say there is nothing about which to be embarrassed. The law of the land says if a disaster is an emergency that is serious and costly--and I would assume comes late in the year when you cannot budget for it--you ought not take it out of ongoing Government operations. 
Will the Senator yield me one additional minute? 
Frankly, I submit we ought to do something a little different, and then my friend, Senator Gramm, will not have to be here and maybe he should not have to be here. I believe we ought to start putting in the regular appropriations bills a sufficient amount of money, literally, that is appropriated for the purpose of responding to disasters. Then one need not come down here and say, let us pay for the disaster out of the ongoing Government programs because we have provided for it, and in the process decided that Government needed less money someplace else, but we did it in an orderly manner. 
So tonight I compliment the chairman of the Appropriations Committee on his first major bill in the Chamber. I want to tell him that I think he's done a wonderful job. He has showed a lot of leadership. Hundreds of amendments seem to flow to the floor on this kind of bill, and we considered them in short order, and yet people got their say and many won and many lost. We are going to decide within the next couple of weeks to keep the business of Government going. I thank him for yielding to me, and I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today, with the Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, and the Senator from Oregon, Senator Wyden, to introduce the Juvenile Crime Control and Community Protection Act of 1997. I don't think there is anything that is worrying the American people more than what is happening to the criminal justice system in their cities, their counties, and their States. 
Senator Ashcroft, a former attorney general from Missouri, knows a lot about these matters on a firsthand basis from having been there. I am hopeful he will arrive before the time expires to speak to one aspect of the bill, which we are introducing, and then I will, as soon as I can, yield to Senator Wyden for some of his observations. 
Last year, I had field hearings in New Mexico to hear the concerns and problems faced by all of the people affected by juvenile crime. We heard from the police, prosecutors, judges, social workers and, most important, Mr. President, as you well know, the victims who reside in our communities. 
The sentiments expressed at these hearings are the same ones felt by people all over this country: One, some juveniles are out of control and the juvenile justice system cannot cope with them; second, other children do not have enough constructive things to do to keep them from sliding into delinquency; third, the current system does little, if anything, to protect the public from senseless youth violence; and fourth, the current system has failed its victims. 
I want to tell my colleagues about an 18-year-old girl from New Mexico named Renee Garcia who was stabbed and left paralyzed by a 15-year old gang member. The stabbing was part of that gang's initiation ritual. The gang member later received only a sentence of 4 years in a juvenile facility. This is what Renee Garcia had to say about the current justice system as it applied to her and her family:  
The outdated laws which exist in our legal system today are nothing but a joke to juveniles. Our laws were meant for juveniles who were committing [small] crimes like truancy and breaking curfews. They are not designed to deal with violent crimes that juveniles are committing today. 
Renee has made quite a recovery from her attack, and we are quite pleased that she is doing reasonably well in our community and in our State. 
The time has come, in my opinion, for the U.S. Government to be a better partner in a major American effort to improve the criminal juvenile justice system across this land. For many, it is well known, we have an adult juvenile system that developed over a long period of time, but we have a juvenile justice system that sort of evolved willy-nilly. It has never reached the stature of the adult system. There are vagaries and much has been left to judges who are asked to respond to the young criminals in a way completely different than if they were adults. 
Some statutes were passed that made this response mandatory, and those statutes still exist today. Still today, in many States, you do not disclose to the public the name and detailed information about juvenile criminals who are committing adult crimes. Their fingerprints and their records are not part of law enforcement's ability to cope with repeated crime, committed over and over, from one State to another by some of these same teenage criminals. 
The Federal Government, in my opinion, should get involved. As we do this, however, we should expect the States to get tough on youth sentencing. We should reward States for enacting law enforcement and prosecutorial policies designed to take violent juvenile criminals off the streets. 
This bill makes some fundamental changes to the crime-fighting partnership which exists between the States and the Federal Government. It contains two important ideas: One, strict law 
enforcement and prosecution policies for the most violent offenders. We cannot tell the States they must do that, but in this bill, we set up a very significant grant program, part of which goes to States that do certain minimal things to improve their system. If they do not, they do not get that money. It goes to States that choose to modernize their system in accordance with a series of options that we have found are clearly necessary today. 
This approach is going to help States fight crime as well as prevent juveniles from entering the juvenile justice system in the first place. It makes important fundamental changes to the Federal juvenile justice system, and I am going to leave an explanation of how we change our Federal juvenile justice system and modernize it to the Senator from Missouri. It would be a shame if we tell the States to do things better, but we leave the prosecutions in the Federal juvenile justice system alone. 
The bill adopts an approach that I suggested last year as part of a juvenile justice bill. It authorizes--we do not have it appropriated yet--but we authorize $500 million to provide the States with two separate grant programs: One, with virtually no strings attached, based on a current State formula grant program; the second is a new incentive grant for States that enact what we call `best practices' to combat and prevent juvenile violence. 
This bill authorizes $300 million, divided into two $150 million pots, for a new grant program, the purpose of which is to encourage States to get tough and enact reforms to their juvenile justice systems. 
I am not going to proceed with each one, but I will just read off the suggested reforms that will comprise `getting tough' and `best practices': 
Victims' rights, including the right to be notified of the sentencing and release of the offender; 
Mandatory victim restitution; 
Public access to juvenile records; 
Parental responsibility laws for acts committed by juveniles released to their parents' custody; 
Zero tolerance for deadbeat juvenile parents, a requirement that juveniles released from custody attend school or vocational training and support their children; 
Zero tolerance for truancy; 
Character counts training, or similar programs adopted and enacted among the States; 
And mentoring. 
These programs are a combination of reforms which will positively impact victims, get tough on juvenile offenders, and provide states with resources to implement prevention programs to keep juveniles out of trouble in the first place. 
The bill also increases from around $68 million to $200 million the amount available to states under the current OJJDP grant program. It also eliminates many of the strings placed on states as a condition of receiving those grants. 
In my home state of New Mexico, juvenile arrests increased 84 percent from 1986 to last year. 
In 1996, 36,927 juveniles were referred to the state juvenile parole and probation office. Some 39 percent of those referred have a history of 10 or more referrals to the system. 
While the Justice Department has said that the overall juvenile crime rate in the United States dropped last year, states like New Mexico continue to see yearly increases in the number of juveniles arrested, prosecuted and incarcerated. 
I mention these numbers because they have led to a growing problem in my home State, a problem which this bill will help fix. 
More juvenile arrests create the need for more space to house juvenile criminals. But, because of burdensome federal `sight and sound separation' rules, New Mexico has been unable to implement a safe, reasonable solution to alleviate overcrowding at its juvenile facilities. 
Instead, the state has been forced to consider sending juvenile prisoners to Iowa and Texas to avoid violating the federal rules and losing their funding. That is unacceptable and this bill will fix that. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to work with the Senator from Missouri on this important legislation. I know that many of my colleagues share my concerns about the need to update our juvenile justice system. I hope that they will examine our bill and lend their support.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the following amendment to S. 672. This amendment involves the New Mexico Department of Education's intent to take credit for $30 million of Federal impact aid funds. I am offering this amendment on behalf of the 331,000 public school children of New Mexico. 
New Mexico is one of three States in the country which uses an equalization formula to distribute educational moneys among its school districts. Presently, 40 out of New Mexico's 89 school districts qualify for $30 million dollars' worth of impact aid. The New Mexico Department of Education relies on impact aid in calculating the amount of State funds which will be used to equalize educational funding among all 89 school districts. 
Without this amendment, the New Mexico Department of Education would not be permitted to consider $30 million of impact aid in its formula for distributing State education moneys among its school districts. The inability to consider Federal funds would create an imbalance in the distribution of educational funds between nonimpact aid school districts and impact aid school districts. 
This amendment allows the U.S. Department of Education to recognize as timely New Mexico's written notice of intent to consider impact aid payments in providing State aid to school districts for the 1997-98 school year.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first let me say that I believe the Senate has done itself proud with reference to the debate and participation of our Members in this series of debates and discussions regarding this treaty. When you add to it the closed session we had today, I think every Senator has had an ample opportunity to thoroughly understand this situation. I believe when the day ends and you have heard all of that, the overwhelming majority of the U.S. Senators are going to vote to ratify this treaty. I believe they are going to do that not because it is perfect, but because the world is better off and we are better off if we have this treaty than if we don't. 
Having said that, while the world has set about to perfect chemical weapons, there is nothing new about this. In fact, I can remember, as a very small boy, a great uncle who was a totally disabled American veteran. He was an Italian immigrant taken into the First World War. He served in the U.S. Army, and he was the victim of mustard gas. In that war, the Germans used mustard gas, a chemical weapon on the front, on the lines. Many Americans received toxic doses. In fact, this great uncle of mine, as I indicated, collected veteran benefits for his entire life for a total disability because of the mustard gas being used in World War I. 
Science has perfected weapons beyond mustard gas, and the world lives under three scourges today. One is the possible proliferation of nuclear weapons; another is the proliferation of chemical weapons, and the third is the proliferation of biological weapons. Now, we have attempted in the past, starting with President Eisenhower, to do something about the proliferation of nuclear weapons. While we haven't succeeded in totality, we have clearly succeeded beyond anything men of that day thought. It was not perfect. There were those who wanted to argue about it because it was not perfect, but we could not have ended an entire era without Atoms for Peace and everything that came with it. Having said that, let me suggest that we probably won't find a way to enter into an international treaty on biological weapons. They are principally weapons of terrorists. 
Let me talk about this treaty and tell the Senate in my own way why I am for it. First of all, I think it is an imperative. Even though it was said before, I say this one more time. Frankly, the reason this treaty exists is because we are trying--the United States of America--to set in motion in the world a security and arms control treaty, and the overreaching question is: Will we be better off or worse off if we commit to its terms? 
Now, this is not a treaty that is going to prevent terrorists from using chemicals as weapons if they see fit. This is more of a treaty that addresses itself to the military use of these kinds of drastic weapons. Now, it is not perfect, but let me suggest the 
second principle that everybody should know, including those Americans who worry about this treaty: America has already committed to totally destroying all of its chemical weapons. President Ronald Reagan, many years ago, said, let's get rid of one kind of weapon, leaving only one left over. President Bush also agreed to get rid of them. America is now on a path to get rid of them in 10 years. All of this discussion has not changed that. So when we talk about the dangers to America, it should be understood that we have already decided that on our own. We want to get rid of them either because we think that is in our best interest--I would assume that is the case--and/or we think it is better for the world that we not have any because we think the world may follow our example. 
Having said that, it seems to me that, with the United States having agreed to destroy all of their weapons of this type, we ought to look at the treaty and ask, is it apt to work its will on the rest of the world quicker and better than if we didn't have it? In everything I hear, everything I have read, in discussions with scientists that worked on it, including some of the top scientists who negotiated this agreement, they have all said that, even with its defects, the CWC is more apt than not to bring the rest of the world to the same conclusion that America has come to. They support that we might get to a point where there are none of these weapons around sooner rather than later if we have this treaty, as compared with no treaty. 
There are all kinds of nuances that one can talk about as you look at something as complicated as this. But I think, fundamentally, the issue is: what is best for the United States after we have committed to destroy our chemical weapons, is it better that we have the treaty or not? From everything I can tell, the 28 conditions that have been agreed upon are good clarifying language and many contain protections to our private property rights that we may have assumed early on would not be violated. But then we got concerned with the CWC and properly so. Now, there is going to be some judicial process to be required before inspections can occur. I believe we now will protect private facilities as well as public facilities like our national laboratories through requirements for search warrants as part of the language that Senator Helms agreed on with our staff. 
In summary, it seems to this Senator that if we join with other countries and begin moving to implement this treaty, that we are better off with it than without it. Will it be difficult to get everyone in the world to agree with our position--the civil position of moral, decent leaders? I am not sure. But the question is, will it be any easier, or are we apt to succeed better, without the treaty? I am convinced that such is not the case. 
Now, Mr. President, there are so many Senators to thank, but I say to Jon Kyl, whose position I don't agree with, that I don't believe anybody has done a better job on something as complicated as this since I have been in the Senate, which is now 25 years. I compliment him for that. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. 
Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that for the past 6 years, I hoped would not be necessary. This legislation is necessary, however, to ensure that the American people will continue to be able to enjoy the natural and cultural resources of Petroglyph National Monument. 
For almost 10 years, I have worked to provide needed protection for the invaluable cultural resources located throughout the 17-mile-long escarpment on Albuquerque's west side. In 1990, New Mexico's congressional delegation successfully enacted legislation which I sponsored in the U.S. Senate to establish Petroglyph National Monument. The bill was signed by President George Bush on June 27, 1990, providing protection for prehistoric and historic artifacts from looting, vandalism, and imminent development. 
That legislation provided a unique management program for the new monument, directly involving the National Park Service, the State of New Mexico, and the city of Albuquerque. Cooperation was and remains critical because, among other reasons, the State of New Mexico and the city of Albuquerque hold title to almost 63 percent of the land within the boundaries of the monument. Albuquerque alone holds title to about 3,800 acres of the 7,244 acres within the monument. In order to provide protection of the petroglyphs and other artifacts along the escarpment, a partnership between the three layers of government--Federal, State and local--remains the most appropriate way of managing these important resources. 
Even before its introduction, I have already heard from several of my colleagues that the Domenici bill regarding petroglyphs has begun to generate controversy. I am sure that many more things will be said about it following today's introduction. By introducing this legislation, I want to reduced the debate to the basic essence of the relevant issues. It is about resolving a problem for two growing communities that encompass a national monument. That resolution involves providing access to less than one-quarter mile of a right-of-way that has been in the planning process for well over a decade. The problem with that one-quarter mile stretch is that it falls on city-owned land within the current boundaries of the national monument. 
This legislation will adjust the monument boundary to exclude approximately 8.5 acres, providing a corridor for the extension of Paseo del Norte. This accounts for approximately one-tenth of 1 percent of the 7,244 acres within the monument boundary. This is not an authorization for the city of Albuquerque to begin construction on the road. When passed, it will simply remove the Federal Government as a barrier to the process of developing locally needed access to Albuquerque's west side. 
In order to maintain the local support needed to sustain a national monument in an urban area, the city's needs must be acknowledged and dealt with. The extension of Paseo del Norte is an important piece of the planned transportation network for the west side. Access to much of the area for emergency services, such as ambulance and fire equipment, is currently inadequate. Albuquerque and Rio Rancho must have the ability to deal with the needs of those who already live and work in the area, and plan for needs of those who will live and work there in the future. At this point, growth and development north and east of the monument have eliminated any other reasonable alternatives that would resolve the problems that the cities face. The need for a resolution is indicated by demographic and traffic pattern projections provided by the regional planning organization, the Middle Rio Grande Council of Governments. 
The extension of Paseo del Norte and the protection of the monument's cultural resources are not mutually exclusive ideas. They have been brought together before when a coalition was put together in 1989 to address these very same issues. At that time, the transportation needs and preservation concerns were coordinated to move forward with an idea that all could support. That plan, which resulted in the creation of Petroglyph National Monument, acknowledged the idea that neither the Paseo del Norte or Unser boulevard extensions would detract from the integrity of the monument, and the purposes for which it was created. Since that time, the city of Albuquerque has gone to great lengths to minimize any disturbance to the artifacts. In fact, the proposed road alignment would not directly impact a single petroglyph as it ascends the escarpment. 
This legislation will once again commit us to the goal of a national monument that benefits the Albuquerque area, the Pueblo people, and the public, at large. The relationship between the city and the National Park Service has deteriorated since all parties entered into a 1991 joint administrative agreement. The situation now goes beyond issues surrounding the transportation planning of the city of Albuquerque, centered around Paseo del Norte, and whether it should or shouldn't be extended to the west side of the escarpment. As I mentioned earlier, the city of Albuquerque owns well over half of the land within the monument boundary. A breakdown of cohesive and coordinated management of the monument and its natural and cultural resources continues, and threatens to dissolve the support of the local communities and the surrounding municipalities. As was the case when the monument was established, a return to the intimate working relationship between the National Park Service and the cities of Albuquerque and Rio Rancho is required. This cannot happen, however, until the issues surrounding transportation planning are resolved, just as they were when the monument was established. Without a cooperative and productive relationship between the cities and the Park Service, the monument will never be what it was intended to be--a benefit to all Americans. 
Throughout the ongoing debate, the urban development on Albuquerque's west side has been a constant reminder that the monument does not exist in a vacuum. Efforts to manage and protect the monument's natural and cultural resources must be coordinated with the needs of New Mexico's fastest growing cities--Albuquerque and Rio Rancho. That is to say that neither altruistic protectionism, nor unmitigated growth can be paramount in this relationship. 
Both the city and the Park Service have made it clear that legislation is required to reach the goal we all desire. Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what the legislation should include. The city sees its transportation and infrastructure needs as the most important component. The Park Service believes that resource management and protection need to be considered as the top priority. Both the Park Service and the city have sound reasons for their respective positions. I believe that this legislation is not only the right thing for the city of Albuquerque or Rio Rancho, but the right thing for Petroglyph National Monument. 
In closing, Mr. President, I want to make it clear that neither the Park Service, nor the city of Albuquerque can continue to pursue its own agenda without considering the needs of the other. We must all begin to refocus our efforts on our ultimate goal, providing for Petroglyph National Monument in a way that we can all be proud. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that is critical to the communities of the Albuquerque area. Just as important, this legislation is vital to the continued enhancement and protection of the national monument we created in that urban area to preserve these invaluable cultural resources. 
Without this, it seems to me the park will never again have cooperation between the city, the State, and the Federal Government and what could have been a marvelous example of government working together will probably end up in shambles. 
I send the bill to the desk and ask it be appropriately referred.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to discuss our environment following Earth Day 1997. 
In consideration of the 27th annual commemoration of Earth Day, the American people should remember that they have been fortunate to live in an industrialized and prosperous society that has afforded environmental protection. Growing consumer demand for parks, improved air quality, and open land for hunting and hiking is largely responsible for improving the quality and quantity of ecological resources. Advances in technology, production methods, and manufacturing practices, an offshoot of our economic growth, have resulted in less pollution. 
However, Mr. President, Earth Day in 1970 was not the beginning of environmentalism in this Nation. Rather, it was evidence of a trend. Since the turn of the century, a strong conservation movement, led by rural interests, wanted national policy that would manage those resources they depended on to survive. Beginning with the passage of the Wilderness Act, Congress responded to those interests. In the last 27 years, the United States has continued to make great strides in improving the quality of its environment. 
The United States of America has become a world leader in so many environmental areas. The Clean Air Act has been strengthened, and the Clean Water Act and the reauthorization of the Safe Drinking Water Act have improved the quality of our Nation's environment. We can take pride in the progress that has been made in the last 27 years since the first Earth day, and we have learned a great deal. We are in far better shape than we were in 1970. 
According to the EPA, between 1970-95, air pollutants have decreased substantially. EPA has also observed that our rivers, lakes, and coastal waters are cleaner today than 25 years ago. Carol Browner, Administrator of the EPA, stated yesterday that the United States has the best drinking water in the world. We now recycle almost 35 percent of our municipal waste, 40 percent of all paper, and 60 percent of all aluminum cans. Our children consider recycling a way of life. 
Since 1970, air pollution has been steadily declining, despite the fact that the U.S. population has increased by 28 percent and vehicle travel has increased by 116 percent. This is due in large part to advanced emissions equipment on newer cars. But we have learned as a people to change our personal habits as we demand that industry change theirs. Air pollution, for example, would continue to be greatly improved if people kept their vehicles, old and new, tuned up. 
Mr. President, we know that humans will inevitably effect the environment because they are an inherent part of nature itself. We are not in a battle against the environment; rather, we now know that we are interdependent. Congress has further learned that top-down administration and imposition of regulations may not achieve the goal of true interdependence, but incentives, cooperation, respect for property rights, and more local control does. As most Americans have come to learn, if you want a better society, you build it yourself. 
The term `sustainability' has come to represent our Nation's environmental goals. Activists, entrepreneurs, and scientists are being successfully linked with ecosystems. Technological advancements have shown us how to improve the environment. Programs such as the 
Waste-management Education and Research Consortium, or WERC, which I put together several years ago, are the future of environmental protection, not top-down regulation imposing unfunded mandates to states. Let us leave local environmental issues to the locals. 
Sustainability is a goal best realized with local initiative. This Nation needs more flexible, market-oriented regulations that allow businesses more options for controlling pollution but that retain limitations on overall discharges. Concern and cooperation has bred environmental self-reliant activism. 
Communities have just now been able to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, and air quality is improving. According to the EPA, air pollutants have greatly decreased since the first Earth Day. Let's let communities continue to improve, rather than impose strict and costly new air quality standards before we know that they are based in sound science. We should be proud that we are reaping the benefits of our current standards. 
The working people of this country appreciate and have a healthy respect for nature. People who live on the land are closer to nature. Coming from New Mexico, I see the interdependence and cooperation of agricultural, timber, native American, urban and environmental interests. Congress has funded such programs as my initiative to preserve one of the largest areas of riparian cottonwood in the world, the Rio Grande Bosque. In the middle of a growing city like Albuquerque, citizens can walk among the native trees and animals. At the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, rare migratory birds coexist with agricultural development. We all strive to maintain a delicate balance in our society and on our planet. 
We all have to live on this planet, at least for now. Some might say progress is a curse. I say we are blessed in this Nation to be leaders in environmental protection and to also enjoy modern conveniences. Continuing progress is a blessing to all our families; we must just proceed to take care of our planet as we learn to live better in it. 
This Congress will continue to work to improve environmental quality, and we will build on the experiences and successes of the past. We must promise to better our lives, our Nation, and our world. Earth Day should be every day.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Physician Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997. This bill would maintain current Federal policy to prevent the use of Federal funds and facilities to provide and promote assisted suicide. It would not nullify any decision by a State to legalize assisted suicide, nor restrict State or privately financed assisted suicide; nor will it affect any living will statutes or any limitation relating to the withdrawal or withholding of medical treatment or care. 
The bill is urgently needed to protect Federal programs which have traditionally been designed to protect the health and welfare of our citizens. The ninth circuit recently reinstated an Oregon statute which provided for physician-assisted suicide through the State's Medicaid Program. This program is funded in part with Federal tax dollars. Unless we enact this statute, Federal dollars will be used to fund physician-assisted suicide. There is an immediate and pressing need for the Senate to act on this matter now. Our Nation has always been committed to the preservation of the lives of its citizens. The American people expect that tradition to continue. 
Last week, the House of Representatives acted in a decisive vote of 398 to 16 to ban the use of Federal funds to support physician-assisted suicide and the President has indicated that he does not oppose this legislation. Mr. President, the American people do not want their tax dollars spent to assist individuals to commit suicide. 
This legislation simply prohibits the use of Federal funds for assisted suicide. It does not address the issue that is currently before the Supreme Court in Washington versus Glucksburg. The issue in that case is whether there is a liberty interest in committing suicide, and if so, whether that interest extends to obtaining the assistance of a doctor to do the same. Mr. President, nothing in this legislation will affect the decision that the Supreme Court will announce later this summer. What this bill does is maintain the longstanding Federal policy of preventing Federal funds from being used for this purpose. The American taxpayer shouldn't be forced to pay for the activities of Dr. Kevorkian and other physicians who may be engaged in assisting suicide. 
Mr. President, we are not acting prematurely by passing this legislation. The State of Oregon already has decided that physician-assisted suicide is legal and that State Medicaid funds may be used for that purpose. The long-standing policy against the use of Federal tax dollars is now in jeopardy, and congressional action is now needed. Tax dollars ought to be used to extend life, not cause death. 
Finally, I am pleased to see that this legislation contains a provision to allow for research into ways we can reduce the rate of suicide among individuals with disabilities and chronic illnesses. Modern pain management techniques are improving rapidly, and it is my hope that this research will reduce the demand for assisted suicide, whether legal or illegal, in the future. We need to continue pain research, and make resources available to ensure that health care professionals are capable of administering these new treatments as they develop. This is a forward-looking approach and we should encourage this sort of research--it will improve the quality of life for those with debilitating diseases. 
Mr. President, I think I speak for the vast majority of the American people when I say that their Federal tax dollars should not be used to fund physician-assisted suicide. I am very pleased to support this bill. I commend Senator Ashcroft for bringing this issue to the attention of the Senate. I hope my colleagues will support the bill, and I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Disclosure of Court Appointed Attorneys' Fees and Taxpayer Right to Know Act of 1997. 
Mr. President, what would you say if I told you that from the beginning of fiscal year 1996 through January 1997, $472,841 was paid to a lawyer to defend a person accused of a crime so heinous that the U.S. attorney in the Northern District of New York is pursuing the death penalty? Who paid for this lawyer--the American taxpayer. 
What would you say if I told you that $470,968 was paid to a lawyer to defend a person accused of a crime so reprehensible that, there too, the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Florida is also pursuing the death penalty? Who paid for this lawyer--the American taxpayer. 
What would you say if I told you that during the same period, for the same purpose, $443,683 was paid to another attorney to defend a person accused of a crime so villainous that the U.S. attorney in the Northern District of New York is pursuing the death penalty. Who paid for this lawyer? The American taxpayer. 
Now, Mr. President, what would you say if I told you that some of these cases have been ongoing for 3 or more years and that total fees in some instances will be more than $1 million in an individual case? That's a million dollars to pay criminal lawyers to defend people accused of the most vicious types of murders often which are of the greatest interest to the communities in which they were committed. 
At minimum, Mr. President, this Senator would say that we are spending a great deal of money on criminal defense lawyers and the American taxpayer ought to have timely access to the information that will tell them who is spending their money, and how it is being spent. That is why today I am introducing the Disclosure of Court Appointed Attorneys' Fees and Taxpayer Right to Know Act of 1997. 
Under current law, the maximum amount payable for representation before the U.S. magistrate or the district court, or both, is limited to $3,500 for each lawyer in a case in which one or more felonies are charged and $125 per hour per lawyer in death penalty cases. Many Senators might ask, if that is so, why are these exorbitant amounts being paid in the particular cases you mention? I say to my colleagues the reason this happens is because under current law the maximum amounts established by statute may be waived whenever the judge certifies that the amount of the excess payment is necessary to provide `fair compensation' and the payment is approved by the chief judge on the circuit. In addition, whatever is considered fair compensation at the $125 per hour per lawyer rate may also be approved at the judge's discretion. 
Mr. President, the American taxpayer has a legitimate interest in knowing what is being provided as fair compensation to defend individuals charged with these dastardly crimes in our Federal court system. Especially when certain persons the American taxpayer is paying for mock the American justice system. A recent Nightline episode reported that one of the people the American taxpayer is shelling out their hard-earned money to defend urinated in open court, in front of the judge, to demonstrate his feelings about the judge and the American judicial system. 
I want to be very clear about what exactly my bill would accomplish. The question of whether these enormous fees should be paid for these criminal lawyers is not, I repeat, is not a focus of my bill. 
In keeping with my strongly held belief that the American taxpayer has a legitimate interest in having timely access to this information, my bill simply requires that at the time the court approved the payments for these services, that the payments be publicly disclosed. Many Senators are probably saying right now that this sounds like a very reasonable request, and I think it is, but the problem is that oftentimes these payments are not disclosed until long after the trial has been completed, and in some cases they may not be disclosed at all if the file remains sealed by the judge. How much criminal defense lawyers are being paid should not be a secret. There is a way in which we can protect the alleged criminal's sixth amendment rights and still honor the American taxpayer's right to know. Mr. President, that is what my bill does. 
Current law basically leaves the question of when and whether court appointed attorneys' fees should be disclosed at the discretion of the judge in which the particular case is being tried. My bill would take some of that discretion away and require that disclosure occur once the payment has been approved. 
My bill continues to protect the defendant's sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel, the defendant's attorney-client privilege, the work-product immunity of defendant's counsel, the safety of any witness, and any other interest that justice may require by providing notice to defense counsel that this information will be released, and allowing defense counsel, or the court on its own, to redact any information contained on the payment voucher that might compromise any of the aforementioned interests. That means that the criminal lawyer can ask the judge to take his big black marker and black out any information that might compromise these precious sixth amendment rights, or the judge can make this decision on his own. In any case, the judge will let the criminal lawyer know that this information will be released and the criminal lawyer will have the opportunity to request the judge black out any compromising information from the payment voucher. 
How would this occur? Under current law, criminal lawyers must fill out Criminal Justice Act payment vouchers in order to receive payment for services rendered. Mr. President, two payment vouchers are the standard vouchers used in the typical felony and death penalty cases prosecuted in the Federal district courts. Mr. President, the information of these payment vouchers describes in barebones fashion the nature of the work performed and the amount that is paid for each category of service. 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>105-domenici-nm-2-19970416</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, my bill says that once the judge approves these payment vouchers that they be publicly disclosed. That means that anyone can walk down to the Federal district court where the case is being tried and ask the clerk of the court for copies of the relevant CJA payment vouchers. It's that simple. Nothing more. Nothing less. 
Before the court releases this information it will provide notice to defense counsel that the information will be released, and either the criminal lawyer, or the judge on his/her own, may black out any of the barebones information on the payment voucher that might compromise the alleged criminals' precious sixth amendment rights. 
Mr. President, I believe that my bill is a modest step toward assuring that the American taxpayer have timely access to this information. In addition to these CJA payment vouchers, criminal lawyers must also supply the court with detailed time sheets that recount with extreme particularity the nature of work performed. These detailed time sheets break down the work performed by the criminal lawyer to the minute. They name each and every person that was interviewed, each and every phone call that was made, the subjects that were discussed, and the days and the times they took place. They go into intimate detail about what was done to prepare briefs, conduct investigations, and prepare for trial. 
I am not asking that that information be made available for, indeed, it might prejudice the way the trial goes to the detriment of the defendant. Clearly, if all of this information was subject to public disclosure, the alleged criminal's sixth amendment rights might be compromised. My bill does not seek to make this sensitive information subject to disclosure but continues to leave it to the judge to determine if and when it should be released. But the barebones must be released. We must know the amounts, and it must be made available as the dollars vouchers are paid by the Federal district court using taxpayers' moneys which are appropriated to them by us. 
In this way, my bill recognizes and preserves the delicate balance between the American taxpayers' right to know how their money is being spent, and the alleged criminal's right to a fair trial. 
So we need to recognize and preserve the balance between the American taxpayers' right to know and how much is being spent on these attorneys and the alleged criminal's right to have a fair trial. 
I believe we should take every reasonable step to protect any disclosure that might compromise the alleged criminal's sixth amendment rights. My bill does this by providing notice to defense counsel of the release of the information, and providing the judge with the authority to black out any of the barebones information contained on the payment voucher if it might compromise any of the aforementioned interests. I believe it is reasonable and fair, and I hope I will have my colleagues support. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be appropriately referred.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about one of the provisions contained in H.R. 914 which is necessary for the 315,000 public school children of New Mexico. The specific provision involves the New Mexico Department of Education's intent to take credit for $30 million of Federal impact aid funds. 
New Mexico is one of three States in the country which uses an equalization formula to distribute educational moneys among its school districts. Presently, 40 out of New Mexico's 89 school districts qualify for 30 million dollars' worth of impact aid. The New Mexico Department of Education relies on impact aid in calculating the amount of State funds which will be used to equalize educational funding among all 89 school districts. 
Without this legislation, the New Mexico Department of Education would not be permitted to consider $30 million of impact aid in its formula for distributing State education moneys among its school districts. The inability to consider Federal funds would create an imbalance in the distribution of educational funds between non-impact aid school districts and impact aid school districts. 
This legislation allows the U.S. Department of Education to recognize as timely New Mexico's written notice of intent to consider impact aid payments in providing State aid to school districts for the 1997-98 school year.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, my amendment is, in effect, a technical amendment which ensures that any joint resolution addressing a change to the fee set out in this bill does not automatically escape Budget Act scrutiny. 
The underlying bill provides fast-track procedures for enacting the joint resolution. The procedures provide that all points of order are waived. My amendment provides that Budget Act points of order are not waived: It would be a bad precedent to waive Budget Act points of order when we don't have the measure before us for review.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, for his devotion and dedication to doing something about the tax mess in America. I look forward to supporting many of his ideas here on the floor. 
Mr. President, I thought today I would speak just a few moments about the history of the income tax law in this Nation, and see if we can't all agree without equivocation that something has really gone awry. 
On October 13, 1913, President Woodrow Wilson signed the bill enacting the income tax law under the authority of the 16th amendment to the Constitution of the United States--October 13, 1913. The entire law was 14 pages long. Slightly more than 1 percent of the population had incomes large enough to be subject to the new tax. 
The New York Herald predicted that many new taxpayers would proudly display their income tax receipts as evidence of the fact `that their value and standing in the commercial world was worthwhile.' So people were pleased to pay their taxes and held up their receipts to indicate that they had accomplished something meaningful in the United States, they had gotten somewhere. 
According to the Treasury Historical Association, when the first income tax was due--listen to this--throngs of new taxpayers crowded the IRS offices to pay and some of them were glad to be there. There are throngs at the post office today mailing in their tax forms. I daresay few are glad to be there. 
At the time of the enactment, Representative Cordell Hull, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, labeled the income tax `the fairest, most equitable system of taxation that has been devised.' 
Amazingly, most Americans actually agreed and welcomed the tax. Perhaps those statements were true in 1913, I say to our new Senator from Arkansas in the Chamber, but in 1997 they no longer reflect reality. 
The current code is neither fair, equitable, efficient, nor loved. It adds one-third to the cost of capital. Capital which makes a modern economy grow and prosper is encumbered by the antigrowth ingredients of this Tax Code such that capital has had added to its cost one-third--in other words, one-third is wasted because of the nature of our tax laws. It is hostile toward savings. It is tilted toward debt. Thus, it slows economic growth, prevents jobs from being created, and makes us less competitive in world markets. 
The Tax Foundation estimates that complying with the Federal tax system of the United States will cost the American people--I am not talking about paying the tax. The cost, the waste, the money, the energy--$225 billion in 1996. 
Based on historical data from the IRS and the OMB--that is the Office of Management and Budget--taxpayers will spend 5.3 billion hours complying with the Federal tax laws. 
Since 1954, the number of sections dealing with this have increased dramatically. Determination of tax liability has grown 1,000 percent; deferred compensation, 1,400 percent; computation of taxable income, 1,500 percent. Since 1954, there have been 31 major tax bills enacted, more than 400 public laws that have amended the Internal Revenue Code. 
Two-thirds of the compliance burden is borne by the business sector. Because of the marriage penalty built throughout this code--speak of something that is antifamily. I would assume if you have a policy that is antimarriage it cannot be, by definition, very profamily--most working spouses work primarily to pay taxes rather than to improve the standard of living of the family. 
Congress will be dealing with tax cuts if we arrive at a budget agreement, and that is good because it is obvious the tax take for the United States, the amount of revenue we are getting from taxes, continues to rise. But I believe ultimately the country is not going to be as well off as it should be until we do a comprehensive tax reform. We have put together, Senator Nunn and I and many Senators and many people helping, an entire new tax plan. When time comes for reform, it will be on the table. This Congress Senator Dodd has agreed to carry on the work of Sentator Nunn. 
We call it the USA Tax Plan--Unlimited Savings Allowance. For those who think IRA's are great investment vehicles we ought to be using, I agree, but this is an unlimited IRA tax plan because essentially people will pay taxes only on income they spend. Amounts they save or invest will not be taxed until they take it 
from the savings pool of the Nation, an investment pool of the Nation, and spend it. The tax would be deferred, in other words, until it is consumed and has become income that is being spent. 
There is talk about tax credits and deductions for education purposes. This USA tax recognizes those needs and takes care of that. It provides a tax credit not for some taxpayers but for all, all families facing higher education expenses. This plan recognizes investment in capital should be expensed by the business community. It provides a deduction from taxable income in the year that the investment is made instead of requiring installment deductions called depreciation, which I assume is the major argument between the business community, business people, and the IRS. 
This plan which I am speaking of today, with its unlimited deferral, results in a capital gains tax rate of zero so long as the proceeds remain invested. When they are no longer invested and they are being spent, they are listed as income and subject to taxes. 
The President and Republicans want to provide a $500 tax credit for children, recognizing that family budgets are stretched most when there are children in the family. I should say the President wants to do this, although with less money. And the age that this stops vesting is lower in the President's proposal. Nonetheless, they both recognize that families, income tax payers are most stretched when there are members of the family under this code. 
The USA tax proposal includes a family living allowance, in addition, to the dependent deduction. It does not phase out when a child reaches 13. It goes on until the child reaches adulthood. 
Taken together, these two USA tax provisions provide relief equivalent to what the dependent deduction would have been if it kept up with inflation since the time it was first enacted. 
So let me suggest that while we are all talking about tax cuts, and I hope I have given a bit of the history that should shock us into understanding that something basically is very wrong. 
Our current Tax Code is sapping the strength of this country, it is sapping the entrepreneurial spirit of people. This country will be great when the entrepreneurial spirit, when innovation and risk taking is maximized. Unfortunately, we have a code that does the opposite, obviously, and we ought to get rid of it. 
For now, we are scheduled this year for some tax cuts. I have outlined them heretofore, and the Finance Committee chairman and others have announced them, and the President has his set of proposals. But I do not think we should let today go by without saying that tinckering is not enough. 
What we must do is throw out what we have and do a new one for the American people, for growth, prosperity, and peace of mind for the American people. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, the first concurrent resolution on the Budget for 1986. 
This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget through April 14, 1997. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of the 1997 concurrent resolution on the Budget (H. Con. Res. 178), show that current level spending is above the budget resolution by $16.9 billion in budget authority and by $12.6 billion in outlays. Current level is $20.5 billion above the revenue floor in 1997 and $101.9 billion above the revenue floor over the 5 years 1997-2001. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $219.6 billion, $7.6 billion below the maximum deficit amount for 1997 of $227.3 billion. 
Since my last report, dated March 4, 1997, there has been no action to change the current level of budget authority, outlays or revenues.

Mr. DOMENICI. I believe whatever needs to be said about my amendment, which is clearly a budget issue, has been said. From what I understand, my amendment is not controversial. If there is controversy, it has to do with the amendment to my amendment; not with it. So I would like to take no longer than 10 minutes, and if the Chair will tell me when I have used the time, I would not want to take any more time than that, of the Senate, to speak on the bill. 
When Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, we created a contract with the country's taxpayers that the Government of the United States would accept responsibility for waste from the reactors providing them with power across these United States. We have now watched for 15 years while the date for this permanent geological repository has moved from an original target of 1998 to the current earliest possible date of 2010. Even though progress at Yucca Mountain in the last few years has finally been significant, the taxpayers impacted by their regional utilities are faced with continued storage of high-level waste at 80 sites in 41 States. Many of those storage sites are near population centers and significant funds are now being expended to keep those multiple sites safe and secure. Many of those sites are nearly full; 23 will be full in 1998, 1 year from now. 
Incidentally, nuclear energy is still important in the United States. While we are not adding any nuclear capacity to our electric generating system, about 20 percent of the Nation's electrical power is nuclear energy and a failure to promptly act in that regard could, indeed, affect the viability of one-fifth of our Nation's electrical supply. That is not a small amount. 
Senate bill S. 104, the bill before us, provides a comprehensive plan for the Federal Government to meet its obligation to provide a safe place for the Nation's spent fuel and high-level nuclear waste. It continues the path toward a permanent geological repository that is being explored at Yucca Mountain, and provides a critical intermediate step to relieve the pressure at those 80 sites by building an interim storage facility near Yucca Mountain. I voted last year for S. 1936, and S. 104 traces its parentage to S. 1936. But, when S. 104 was introduced in the Energy Committee this year, it contained improvements over S. 1936. I commend Chairman Murkowski, and those who have worked with him, for their diligent, bipartisan efforts over the last few weeks to work with many of our colleagues to further improve S. 104.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as my friends on the other side of the aisle like to point out, the Congressional Budget Act includes a timetable for Congress to adopt a budget resolution that includes having the Senate Budget Committee report a budget resolution by April 1--it used to be May but it was moved back to April 1--and the conference with the House is supposed to be completed by April 15. What, of course, is not being said is the simple fact that since 1987, when we moved the completion date from May 15 to April 15--only once in those 11 years has the Congress ever met the April 15 deadline. Only three times has the Senate Budget Committee itself met the April 1 deadline. 
Obviously, we have not been in charge of that committee most of those years that the Democrat majority on the other side was in charge. Nonetheless, this year the Senate Budget Committee received the President's budget on February 6. Incidentally, the President's budget was delayed a few days this year also. Nevertheless, the committee has engaged in many hearings and meetings on the President's budget. And only 17 days ago, on March 3, did the Congress receive the Congressional Budget Office's preliminary analysis of the President's budget. The final analysis is yet to be completed. And we all know that the Congressional Budget Office analysis of the President's budget set us back in our efforts to get this job done quickly. The President's plan did not achieve balance according to this preliminary report in the year 2002 without relying on some awkward triggering mechanisms. 
Yesterday, I, along with my fellow House Budget Committee Chairman and two ranking members, met with the President to discuss the budget before he left for Helsinki. We agreed that over the upcoming recess and early when we return we would work to identify and clarify our differences and attempt to seek some settlement of issues so that we might return together a bipartisan budget blueprint that will get us to balance in 2002 and keep us on a path to balance well into the next century. 
Our hope is that these meetings which will take place in the next 2 weeks at the staff level to be followed by an intensive week of work on our return will yield a bipartisan budget blueprint with the President working with the Congress. I am not saying to the Senate that I am certain that will work, but I truly believe there is a probability that this could work. There has been a lot of behind-the-scenes work, and I think the issues are pretty well defined. Everybody wants to be rather specific in the solutions and that will take a little bit of time. 
As I expressed with the President yesterday, it is my fervent hope and I am committed to finding that common ground that will achieve the goal not for anybody's political gain but for the country's economic future. 
For today, however, it is obvious that the statutory deadline in the Senate will come while we are out on Easter recess and while staff is working on this budget process during the recess. So today, in order to ensure that the work of the Senate will go on, regardless of the outcome of these discussions, I am introducing two fully drafted budget resolutions that will be referred to the Budget Committee but will be automatically discharged from the committee on April 1 and placed back on the Senate Calendar. All of this occurs by statute which dictates that procedure. This is not unprecedented and certainly not unreasonable. My former Democratic chairmen, Senators Chiles and Sasser, routinely followed this process to provide that insurance the Senate needs that we would, indeed, be able to work our will even if the committee failed to report a resolution. 
So I want to make it clear that I do not intend that the Budget Committee not report a budget resolution. That is clearly not my intention. I would not want to be vested with that result because we have always been able to report a budget resolution out of the Budget Committee for better or for worse. It has always met its responsibilities, and I am certain we are going to do that again this year. But in the event we could not, either of these resolutions which I introduced today could be called off the calendar by the leader and the full Senate would then work its will on either of those as they are called up and made part of the Senate's ordinary business. 
The first resolution I am submitting today is simply the President's budget submitted back in February and reestimated by the Congressional Budget Office which we now know did not reach balance in the year 2002 but resulted in a deficit of nearly $70 billion in that year. Obviously, I do not support this resolution. I am doubtful whether it would have much support of the Senate. And if it were called up by the Budget Committee in the Chamber, I would work to modify it significantly so that it did achieve balance and make these fundamental changes required to truly address the fiscal concerns that lie beyond 2002. 
The second resolution I am introducing, I must say that I do not support it either and I do not think there would be a lot of Senators who would like the medicine provided in that budget resolution but, reluctantly, would be forced to vote for this if progress is not made in the next few weeks to modify the President's proposal, and that might be the case. 
This is my own resolution. It is not necessarily a Republican resolution. It is simply my effort to point out to all what would be required to reach balance in 2002 without any changes to the President's limited entitlement savings. This second resolution, based on the Congressional Budget Office benchmark used to analyze the President's budget, assumes the President's relatively low stated savings over the next 5 years in Medicare of $100 billion and Medicaid of $9 billion. 
This resolution assumes essentially the same defense spending pattern as the President had. The budget makes no assumptions about any changes to the Consumer Price Index and no changes to the Congressional Budget Office assumptions. This alternative budget resolution assumes no net tax reductions over the next 5 years. 
This resolution includes what might be thought of as a reverse trigger. It is based on the Congressional Budget Office economic forecast which is more conservative than the administration's, but the resolution would allow for an adjustment to domestic spending and permit tax cuts, if the administration's more optimistic economic assumptions turn out to be right, more right than the Congressional Budget Office, and the targets toward a balanced budget are being met on a specified timetable. Then there would be a trigger in instead of a trigger out as the President proposed to make up for an unbalanced budget. 
Finally, to achieve balance in 2002 with these assumptions, that portion of the Federal Government that represents annually appropriated accounts for most domestic agencies will be reduced by $183 billion over the next 5 years--nearly three times the level that the President assumes in his budget. I estimate that these domestic spending programs would see nearly a 20 percent reduction in the level of spending over the next 5 years. And, of course, that is estimating that they all take the same cut. To the extent that you cause some to increase others would have to be reduced even more. There would be absolutely no room for any new initiatives and many existing programs would obviously have to be terminated. 
The message from this second resolution, if the goal is still to reach balance by 2002 using the conservative Congressional Budget Office forecasts and unless the President is willing to do more than his budget now envisions in mandatory programs or entitlement programs, not only would we not be able to fund any new initiatives, there would be significant reductions in programs such as education, environment, crime fighting, transportation, housing and others and neither would tax cuts in the President's budget or the congressional budget be possible. 
Again, this is not a preferred option on my part. I certainly am not recommending this to anyone. I think we can do much better, and I think we will. I think we can achieve balance and provide some relief, tax relief, to hard-working American families. I believe we do not need to devastate Government programs in the manner that I have just described. 
But it will require courage in dealing with entitlement spending, and I am asking that the President join with us in a bipartisan way to exhibit that courage. I am dedicated to making sure neither of these resolutions I have introduced today will ever need to be considered when we return from this recess, for they will not be considered if we produce a balanced budget in the committee and report it to the Senate, for that will be the subject matter before the Senate at that time. 
I believe that is entirely possible. If we cannot work something out with the President, which I am still hoping and indicating today there is a probability that we could, then we will work it out in the committee. One way or another it will come out of there, in my opinion perhaps bipartisan. Work is underway and I remain hopeful that a solid budget will be prepared that will enjoy the support of the President and the vast majority here in the Congress. I think we all understand the significance of these events this year, and I must say that I believe the President understands the significance. 
I mean, it seems to me that if, in fact, we do not reach some accord with the President, he can look forward to a very frustrating couple of years, achieving little or nothing, not moving toward a balanced budget with any dispatch and any earnestness. And I am not sure that is good for him. 
For Republicans, I am quite positive that we do not want 2 or 4 years of just constant turmoil, working by ourselves, among ourselves as Republicans, but rather should look forward to working this very important set of circumstances out in a bipartisan manner for the benefit of everyone.

Mr. DOMENICI. First, let me note the presence of Senator Conrad on the floor. 
Might I just say, I do not think you heard any of my remarks since I returned from a couple of hours at the White House yesterday. And I have not had a chance to speak with the distinguished Senator. But we are busy, as of today, working on trying to reach our differences. There will be a lot of work the next 2 weeks. We are very hopeful 1 week after we return, with that week being spent by some of us getting down to the final stages of negotiations, that we will have something very constructive. 
It is hard to say where it will all end up, but I can say the President approached it with a degree of not only earnestness, but a sense that we ought to go ahead and move and we ought to resolve some differences and get going. And I have expressed that here today, indicating that as these two budgets are only there in the event we cannot get a budget out of the Budget Committee, then we have to get something to work off of, and this is a rather normal way to do it: Put a budget resolution in. Then the leader can call it up if we were to fail, and we have something to work on. 
I simply think everybody knows there are a lot of possibilities of working a budget together this year because there are many Republicans and Democrats who are looking seriously at ways to put something together that does do some difficult things, that is not just a skirting over the difficulties, and is saying, let us do some things that have real long-term impact and as you, I say to the Senator, have so eloquently said, something we can all be proud of that really does the job. 
That is my goal. I will try as best I can in the next few weeks. And, again, subject to the frailties of partisanship and things that can happen that you know nothing about, I said I thought there was a probability we could reach an agreement with the President, bipartisan, that many Senators would like.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, about 4 years ago I came to the floor of the U.S. Senate--I did not check for the exact date, but I came to the floor to congratulate and praise Mexico. In particular, I was praiseworthy of their then-President Carlos Salinas. 
I even said on the floor of this Senate that, man for man, I thought he had the best Cabinet in the free world. In fact, I chose some of his Cabinet members because of their tremendous intellectual capacity and great training and compared them with our then-Cabinet members and said, I am pleased to tell the Senate that for the first time in history they probably have a better Cabinet than the United States of America. 
For those people in Mexico who wonder how Senators like Senator Domenici have become more and more concerned about what is going on in Mexico, let me suggest that it was a very serious letdown to this Senator. It was a serious letdown having made statements like that, to find out what they were doing and what that pinnacle of free enterprise and privatization, a graduate of our best schools of economics, Carlos Salinas, was all about. 
So it was that just a few weeks ago, as one Senator, I joined in saying to the President that he should not certify Mexico as being in compliance and cooperating fully. 
But I would remind my good friend, the new Senator from Arkansas, that we in the Congress do not certify. The President certifies. What happened, even with many of us saying he should not, the President certified that Mexico was in cooperation and compliance. 
So now we are confronted with the situation where our own President and all of those who work for him, including a very able drug czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, have told us that the best thing we can do is keep the pressure on Mexico, but not to proceed with decertification from our end on the legislative side because in their opinion, instead of making matters better, it will make matters worse. Instead of causing more cooperation, it will cause less. Instead of causing Mexico to work with us in many areas that they are working in that we are now all becoming familiar with, it will force them politically to sever those kinds of relationships and to go their own way. 
Might I remind fellow Senators, all of this is happening in the context of an election in Mexico which is going to take place in the not-too-distant future. 
Fellow Senators, I understand Mexico. My State borders Mexico. For those who wonder whether I know about their culture, I would remind you that 38 to 40 percent of the residents of my State speak the Spanish language. While many of them are truly Hispanics from Spain, there are many who are Mexicans. But in all respects, I understand the relationship of Mexico and its populace, to the United States. I understand how they feel about us in terms of whether we really are their friends or are we the big giant to the north who is always trying to tell them what to do? 
So I have come to the conclusion, absolutely and unqualifiedly, that it is better for us not to override the President but to go ahead and state our case, state our case in a resolution and then say godspeed to the President and General McCaffrey and all the others. Let us see if we can get better cooperation between these two great neighbors in the next few years. 
I remind everyone the best experts now say we are not going to fix this drug problem with Mexico where all of these drugs come flowing into our States. 
I might say to my friend, Senator Coverdell, they are pouring into my State, you can be assured, and into the principal city, although it is a couple hundred miles from the border, Albuquerque. We have never had so many murders and gang slayings and drug addictions as we have now because we are at the crossroads of the two interstate highways, both of them leading in some way to the south toward Mexico. 
So I am aware of that. But I came to the floor to make sure that Mexico understands that we have once again--and I hope it will be rather unanimous in the Senate--that we have come to the conclusion that we want to urge our nations to cooperate and we are urging, if not begging, Mexico to do what it can to be more cooperative and do more to alleviate this scourge on our people. 
I want to also say that the current President of Mexico, Ernesto Zedillo is a very competent man. Some say he is not a good enough politician. But indeed he has a good enough brain and a good enough commitment to that country. I believe--and here again I hope I am right--that he is absolutely honest, that he is truly dedicated to clean up what he can clean up in Mexico. 
President Zedillo I hope you will do that. And I hope America is there helping you rather than hindering you as you attempt to do that. 
This resolution is a good resolution because it requires that sometime in September a full report will be sent to the Congress of the United States by our President, indicating whether there has been progress made in the many areas cited in this resolution. We are clearly laying before the Mexican leaders what we hope is a constructive resolution, by saying these are the kinds of things where we must see some progress. 
We will be around for another day. The Mexican Government knows that. The President will be around next year and have to decide on certification again. I think the President understands that we are not expecting certification to come easy and to be a matter of course or ever just be a matter of whatever the State Department recommends. We are moving in the direction of saying we should be honest about it. 
For now, most of us who urged that the President not certify, we have all come to the same conclusion. We want to lay before the American people and the Mexican people and their government what we think is going wrong in Mexico and say we want to help with it. We want to say that we are willing to stand back and do what we can in our appropriation process with the things we must do on the border for law enforcement, but we are also saying to Mexico, you can count on it. We are doing this because our President urges us to. Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the drug czar, urges us to. The State Department urges us to. But we are going to hold all of them accountable, not just Mexico. 
We are expecting our Government to say the Senate really is serious and we should do something about these areas. I must say to our Government, we really risk future action by the U.S. Senate--I do not speak for the House--if we do not get some real performance and some honest evaluation in this report that we are requesting here. 
That is why I am here. I feel this will do more good in our efforts to work binationally with Mexico. We need to work with Mexico on myriad fronts--those affecting this drug scourge that is flowing into American cities and thus into our young people and Americans across the board. 
I thank Senator Coverdell for his leadership, and the distinguished Senator from California. 
It was a pleasure to help you get the letter signed. I think I got a few Senators, and I am pleased to have been on that. I believe our collective work will bring forth positive fruit both for us and for Mexico. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators Campbell, McCain, and Murkowski in sponsoring this act to extend the authorization of several important programs for American Indians. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [HHS] administers these programs through the Administration for Native Americans [ANA]. Over the past 5 years, funding has ranged from $34.5 million to $38.6 million. In fiscal year 1997, the funding was $34.9 million. 
Our bill will reauthorize important programs to promote economic development, strengthen tribal governments, and provide for the better coordination of social programs available to tribes. The ANA funding policy is to assist Indian Tribes and Native American organizations to plan and implement their own long-term strategies for social and economic development. The aim is to increase local productivity and reduce dependence on government social services. 
Competitive grants are the means for distributing these vital funds. In New Mexico, the Pueblos of Laguna ($382,000), Picuris ($167,000), Pojoaque ($120,000), Sandia ($133,890), Tesuque ($125,000), San Juan ($232,000), Santa Ana ($112,000), and Santo Domingo ($110,464) all received grants from fiscal year 1996 funds. New Mexico Tribes and Pueblos have participated in ANA grant activity for about three decades. 
The Social and Economic Development Strategies [SEDS] program fosters the development of stable, diversified local economies. SEDS grant funds are used to develop the physical, commercial, industrial and/or agricultural components necessary for a functioning local economy. Social infrastructure includes the maintenance of a tribe's cultural integrity. Pojoaque Pueblo's Cultural Center is the beneficiary of an ANA grant. 
Other ANA grants are used to establish or expand business activity or to stabilize and diversify a tribe's economic base. Micro enterprises and other private sector development are encouraged. 
Mr. President, I thank Chairman Campbell of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs for his good work to extend the authorization for these valuable resources to improve tribal opportunities for self-sufficiency. I urge my colleagues to support the reauthorization of these Administration for Native Americans Programs.

<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say that it is not often on matters such as this one that I am on the floor in opposition to something that Senator Hollings favors. We normally are here on either economic matters or budget matters or the like. I want to say right up front while I totally disagree that we should adopt this constitutional amendment and send it out to the States for ratification, I believe it is fair to say that among the Senators who have been talking about limiting or dramatically changing the campaign laws of this land, of limiting of the amount of money that can be spent, at least this amendment is honest. 
It faces the reality right between the eyes, and the Supreme Court of the United States has said that you can't do that because you are limiting freedom of speech. And the distinguished Senator has said, OK, if that is the case, I want to change the Constitution, so we can do it. At least that is a straightforward position, instead of coming here and trying to get around the Supreme Court decisions and around the clause in the U.S. Constitution that protects freedom of speech. 
Having said that, I want to take a couple of minutes to talk with the Senate about my views and version of why we should not adopt this amendment. First of all, I believe that I should lead off by saying, yesterday afternoon, I was in my office when some speeches were being delivered on the floor of the Senate. I don't think I am much different from most Senators. Normally, if you have your set on and somebody is speaking on the floor, even though we all love them dearly and they are great speakers and they have great things to say, we don't listen very often--at least, if we are busy in the office, and we do other things. 
But I took time out to listen to Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, and I tried to tell him this personally so it would precede me saying it on the floor, I thought his remarks yesterday afternoon were very eloquent. They expressed a very good picture of the history of our Constitution and, in particular, of that part of our Constitution that we so glibly say is freedom of speech, protected by that wonderful document and the Bill of Rights. 
Having said that, I was not prepared to argue that this amendment is broad enough to perhaps some day affect the editorial policy of the newspapers. I didn't come here particularly prepared to argue that point. But over the evening I read it again and read my remarks. I am prepared to say that I believe the Congress of the United States, if this amendment ever became law, will clearly then be able to determine how we can change freedom of speech in the manner described, and to what extent and when and who will be affected by our changes. I think where this amendment says that the amount of expenditures that may be made by, in support of, or in opposition to a candidate for nomination for election to a Federal office, and where it is said that you are able to put limitations on the amount of contributions that may be accepted, I believe it is entirely possible that some time out in the future, if this were in fact the law of the land, Congress could decide that a newspaper could only write one editorial a week on behalf of its favorite U.S. Senate candidate because they might equate that with an expenditure. In fact, they might be able to ask, what's the newspaper charging for advertising? And then they might say, when you write something in that paper about a candidate expressing your views, we are going to assume that it is worth at least the advertising costs of the paper. 
Now, frankly, I am giving you kind of a shirt-sleeve lawyer's opinion. But I can see out there in the future where, under the right circumstances, with a Congress that is being beaten up by newspapers, or perhaps the majority party being beaten up by newspapers or editorials on television, they might indeed decide that they are going to determine the expenditures that can be made and attempt to change our most protected basic right. 
Now, having said that I believe the first amendment guaranteeing free speech is the matrix of every other freedom we have, and the most fundamental and urgent application of free speech is to conduct campaigns for political office. Elections and campaigns that lead up to those elections are how the democratic process works. Therefore, I repeat, the amendment guaranteeing freedom of speech is the matrix of every other freedom because it is through the democratic process, the selection of candidates, perhaps even the selection of the philosophy or the ideology of candidates and parties, that decisions are made about our lives and are made about our future. And, therefore, freedom of speech, if controlled, can control that which affects our lives in a most profound way. 
I regret to say that while I am not one who comes to the floor 
very often and chooses to become popular at home by beating up on Congress--in fact, I don't think I have done that very often in my life--I believe it is a mistake to put this power in the hands of a partisan Congress, with the potential for a President of the same party with a huge majority in the Congress, this absolute power to abridge freedom of speech and decide just how much can be spent by whom, what organizations can spend how much on which candidates. The power to determine how much a right-to-life organization can spend on behalf of its candidates or party, or its opposition organization in America, how much they can spend, and a myriad of other organizations that are out there trying to affect Government and how Government works and how we vote--for Congress to be able to regulate that means we are placing in the hands of Congress and a President of the party in control the absolute and unequivocal future destiny of the election process. They will determine it either directly or indirectly, just as certain as you write in black ink on white paper so that it will be most legible.

Mr. DOMENICI. I think, given the right circumstances, that is entirely possible. I can dream up a scenario in my mind where it would probably be constitutional under this amendment. You could have a situation in the country where Congress would make a finding, which may be backed up by what's going out in society. Those kinds of expenditures could cause harm in America, at least to some major group that thought the unlimited use of propaganda --this is they would call it--has been harmful to the country, so they will say that we will have none of it. 
Let me say, that is one issue, it is clear to me, that in and of itself ought to cause us to say no to this amendment. I think there is even a more serious one. I guess I will choose to say, as my point No. 2, that it's hard enough to win a fight with someone who buys paper by the ton and ink by the barrel. That leads me to ask, who uses freedom of speech most in the United States? Who does? The media of America. The media of America, be it the newspapers, radio, television, or whatever other media we have. That is the principal use of freedom of speech in the United States. They, combined, are the big makers of news. They are the ones who write the news, who talk the news, who present the issues on TV. Frankly, the media sets the agenda. They have even been called the `fourth estate,' meaning that we have three branches of government, and they are also a branch of government. Well, we say: Protect them. 
As a matter of fact, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a very historic case, New York Times versus Sullivan, a 1964 case, has even held that for a public personage to have a cause of action against the media, which has the right to freedom of speech, to have the right to sue because they told an untruth, you can't sustain a cause of action unless it is made with actual malice, with knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard of whether it is false or not. 
That is how important we think that right is. 
Should it surprise anyone that those who use freedom of the speech in the press of America--that they have their prejudices? Should it surprise anyone that they pick and choose candidates? Should it surprise anyone that they have a philosophy? Should it surprise anyone, even though they are my good friends, that they are predominantly liberal and predominantly Democrats in terms of party affiliation? That just happens to be true. If they were without opinion and used no discretion, what good would they be as the fourth estate in America? For they would be dullsville, and nobody would care what they said. So they are not that. And they can really influence a candidate or an elected officer's future. They can even do it by neglect, if they choose. They can fail to cover what somebody does in their elected office because they, either directly or in some other way, are prejudiced by what Senator Jones from Kansas says, and so it doesn't appear in the newspapers in the State of Kansas. Or, at least in one chain perhaps, or at least, if that is too far-fetched, a certain reporter won't write about Senator Jones, and he is the reporter that writes the front page story all of the time. That is kind of the benign neglect of the media. 
What we know is happening in America is that we have moved away from editorial writing only appearing on the editorial pages of the paper. It now also is appearing in the stories in the media. TV has gone from just reporting news to interpreting the news and interpreting situations in America. News shows which do that abound. Should it surprise anyone that sometimes the media take a position in opposition to a President, in opposition to a Senator, in opposition to a party, in opposition to a philosophy of government? 
Mr. President, if that is the case, where is the candidate or elected officeholder going to get the resources to tell his side of the story? I know where they are getting that kind of resource today. They are getting it because people contribute to their campaign, and they run ads, or they buy time, or they put out brochures, or they get on a radio show and pay for the time. And they say, `If the media and my opponent can get on and get free time, I want to get on and pay for it.' Whatever the media puts on is their choice, and they are free to do as much as they want. 
I am not going to stand here and be critical of that. In fact, I am suggesting that they are important in this society. It leads me to the conclusion that they have a right to try to be effective in trying to change public opinion. When they do that and exercise that prerogative, they create a situation which in the combat over political ideas requires that, if you are going to respond and have a chance of being heard, you must compete either in ink, or in paper, or in voice over the radio network, or in your picture and voice on television. Or else, how can you get the message across? 
Having said that, I am absolutely convinced that while I stand here and give credence to the United States Congress having great authority, and I would even say that over history, I trust its collective wisdom, I can already in my time in the U.S. Senate find many occasions when I think we weren't very wise and we passed laws that weren't the very best. But even if I were to say over time that we perhaps come out on the wise side more times than not, I am not prepared to give the United States Congress the authority to control the destiny and the lives of political figures today or in the future when it comes to how much of their resources, or resources that others want to give to them, that they can use to make their case. 
I believe it is a greater and more frightening evil to control the opportunity for candidates to make their case through the exercise of free speech. That is a far more serious problem for America than the concern over too much campaign spending. 
We can pass reasonable rules and regulations regarding campaign contributions. Clearly we already have. We have limited PAC contributions. We have individual contributions limited. But 
when it comes to those things that the U.S. Supreme Court has already said are protected because they are political speech, isn't it interesting? Some people, including this Senator, had trouble understanding what they were talking about when they said that spending is equal to free speech. If you want to spend your money on a campaign, the use of that money is speech, they said. Well, I understand it now. I hope I have expressed it today. It is precisely what I have been talking about. For what other way than through the use of resources can you get your speech heard and exercise that freedom I speak of? How can you get your message out to the public if you are limited as to how much, or when, or which organization can spend how much in behalf of your candidacy, your position, or your ideology? 
So from my standpoint the issue is really very, very clear and very simple. We should not change the Constitution of the United States when it comes to that part of this protected speech that has to do with candidates and political parties getting their message across through the use of resources. Nothing, in my opinion, will suffice other than to leave the decision of what is needed and how it will be used in the hands of the person claiming the freedom. To place it in the hands of somebody else to determine for that person claiming that freedom will, in my opinion, render the freedom useless. For the more you try to tell somebody how to exercise their right to free speech and when they can exercise it, the more the freedom becomes a nonfreedom. It becomes control rather than opportunity to enter into combat in a way that is equal and able to meet any circumstance. I am fully aware that there are many other approaches that we can take to modifying our campaign laws. And some of those being discussed will be constitutional without this change. 
But I for one want to close today saying to the U.S. Senate, and to the people of the United States, do you really want Congress to be the one that manages by statute the use of this freedom, political freedom, the freedom of political parties and people running for office to use resources in a way that they think is best to get their message out, their cause, and to exercise their rights? 
Mr. President, I want to make 5 points about this resolution and to make them clearly, strongly and simply. 
Point one: This is an attempt to make the unconstitutional constitutional. 
The first amendment guaranteeing free speech is the matrix of every other freedom we have. 
The most fundamental and urgent application of free speech is to conduct campaigns for political office. 
Elections and the campaigns leading up to those elections, after all, are how the democratic process works. 
Point two: It's hard enough to win a fight with someone who buys paper by the ton and ink by the barrel. This amendment would make it impossible to win that fight. 
The liberal news media exercises its free speech rights more than any other individual or entity in the United States. They are the Big Opinion Makers. They compose the editorials, write the news, talk the news, present the issues on TV. Frankly, they set the agenda. 
The media are the ones who exercise freedom of speech as it pertains to politics. They are on the airwaves every day. It used to be that there was political speech on the news at 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. In 1997, there is news at 6 a.m., 7 a.m., noon, 4 p.m., 5 p.m., 6 p.m., 10 p.m., and 11 p.m. on the regular channels. We also have numerous 24-hour news channels. 
No one would tolerate a suggestion that reporting and editorializing should be censored or otherwise limited or that there should be--to use the language of the proposed amendment --`reasonable limits.' 
All of the political speech contained on the news is protected. In New York Times versus Sullivan (1964) the Supreme Court held that public officials could maintain defamation actions only upon proof that the media's statement was made with `actual malice' defined by the Court as made `with knowledge that it [the statement] was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.' As a result, the `comfort zone of protection' given to a political figure or candidate for public office under the defamation actions for libel and slander is very small. Public figures are given little protection. 
Defamation stands virtually alone in the 20th century tort law. Every other major substantive area has expanded a plaintiff's right to recover, while in defamation the balance has shifted, and quite dramatically, in favor of the media defendant. 
Point three: Government rationing of political speech by candidates will increase the power of the media, which has an unlimited free speech right. 
The makers of the Constitution, influenced not only by their own experience but also by theorists such as Montesquieu, consciously provided for allocation of national authority among the executive, the legislative and the judicial branches. By insisting upon separation of powers, the Framers sought to protect against tyranny. Over the years, the media has emerged as the fourth branch of Government. Creating an elite of those with unlimited free speech will dangerously upset the balance of power and make the Fourth Estate the most powerful. This runs contrary to our fundamental notions of freedom and effective democracy. 
The members of the fourth estate are mere mortals and they have strong biases. 
Reporters are opinionated. Arguably, they are the most politically homogenous and biased group in American politics today. Most studies of media voting behavior show 9 out of 10 reporters and editors voting for liberal Democratic candidates. And the media coverage mimics the media's voting pattern. 
A study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a nonpartisan Washington research group, shows that TV coverage overwhelmingly favored President Clinton this past election season. 
In September, Clinton received 54 percent positive coverage on the networks' evening news programs, compared with only 30 percent for Bob Dole. The networks criticized Dole's economic views 81 percent of the time, his social policies 78 percent of the time; and his conduct as a candidate 81 percent of the time. Yet, voters view the media as balanced. 
We have TV commentators who criticize ideology, personalities, and lifestyle. Yet, the quantity, quality, and content of the media programs and articles are totally protected and unrestricted. 
A paper could editorialize every day of the week, every week of the year against a candidate. If an elected official or candidate wants to respond, he has to buy an ad. He has to make an expenditure. 
At the other extreme, a Senator could toil tirelessly day in and day out in meetings, in committee, on the Senate floor. An unfriendly paper could ignore his efforts during his entire term. If that Senator wants to let voters know of his accomplishments he has to buy an ad. He has to make an expenditure to compensate for the medias' benign neglect of his efforts. The Supreme Court is correct, free speech is a fundamental right essential to getting reelected. The Constitution is right to protect this fundamental right. 
My question to Senators is: Do you really think it is wise to exclusively vest the power of unlimited speech in the fourth branch? If the Founding Fathers were wise enough to resist tyranny by requiring a balance of power among the branches that existed when they wrote the Constitution, we should recognize this amendment as a bald-faced attempt to shift the balance of power from the candidates involved in the legislative and executive branches, over to the media. In practical terms this reserves to the media the control of freedom itself. 
The ACLU has called this proposal a recipe for disaster. This amendment makes mincemeat out of the first amendment. Mincemeat belongs on a menu, not in the Constitution. 
Point four: Being an incumbent is a formidable advantage and this amendment would make this advantage insurmountable. 
Spending is the way challengers combat the inherent advantages of incumbency, such as name recognition, access to media, and franked mail. 
Besides, the most important and plentiful money spent for political purposes is call the Federal budget--$1.6 trillion and rising. 
Federal spending--along with the myriad regulations and subsidizing activities such as protectionist measures--often amounts to vote-buying. 
Write a tax bill and wealth is redistributed. 
This amendment will allow incumbents to write limits on campaign spending. These limits, when coupled with the inherent advantages of incumbency, will make it more difficult for challengers to compete. 
History gave us 40 years of House control by Democrats. If this amendment had been law, the `reasonable' limits would have been written decade after decade in a self-preserving fashion to favor the ruling party. Is there any doubt that the spending limits would give any challenger a fighting chance? 
Point five: When amending the constitution, err on the side of caution--you better be very careful. 
Mr. President, today truly is a remarkable day. In the name of `campaign finance reform,' some of our distinguished colleagues have come to the floor to offer a resolution which strikes at the very heart of one of the fundamental freedoms the Founding Fathers of this great Nation sought to protect. While I agree that our campaign finance laws are in need of change, amending the first amendment to allow the Government to restrict political speech simply is not the way to reform the system. 
The authors of the first amendment were very straightforward: `Congress shall make no law * * * abridging the freedom of speech.' 
Mr. President, surely none of us here today agrees with all of the `speech' people in this county make, especially in this town. I don't like the fact that pornography exists. I don't like violence on TV But regardless of what I like, the first amendment protects this type of speech. While the protections of the first amendment are not absolute in all circumstances--we all know that the amendment does not protect one's right to yell `fire' in a crowded theater--the right to free speech is nearly absolute when that speech is directed toward the political process. 
Throughout its jurisprudence, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed this notion time and time again. In recounting the history of the first amendment, the Court in the past has observed that: `there is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of the first amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs * * * of course including discussions of candidates.' The Court also has noted that: `It can hardly be doubted that the constitutional guarantee [of the right to free speech] has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct for campaigns for political office.' 
The Court extended these principles to campaign spending in the Buckley case and held that restrictions on campaign expenditures are improper under the first amendment. The Court's decision can be summed up very simply: restrictions on the resources needed to make political speech heard are restrictions on political speech itself. As the Court has said, `the distribution of the humblest handbill' costs money and the Court consistently and properly has refused to make a distinction between the humble handbill and other forms of political speech. They all deserve first amendment protection. 
The authors of this proposal are not so straightforward. It will regulate who may speak, when, where, for how long, and for what purpose. 
For some, this debate will be about the wisdom of the Supreme Court's decision in the Buckley case and those decisions which followed it. Supporters of this amendment believe that, if spending equals speech, then only those with a lot of money will be able to participate in the political process. 
I look at the problem from a different perspective: is it at all proper to amend the organic law of this land to allow the Government to begin regulating the political speech of individuals and groups? It runs contrary to the spirit of the entire Constitution to answer that question in the affirmative. 
Thomas Jefferson once wrote that `there are rights which it is useless to surrender to the government, and which governments yet have always sought to invade. Among these are the rights of thinking and publishing our thoughts by speaking and writing.' This amendment would be the first step toward surrender, the first step toward putting the Federal Government in control of all political speech in America. 
Let us take a look at the language of the proposed amendment, because there are two areas which I believe need to be mentioned. 
First, the resolution gives Congress the power to set reasonable limits on campaign contributions and expenditures. Proponents of this amendment and campaign finance reform bills like McCain-Feingold claim that the current system favors wealthy candidates and protects incumbents able to raise large amounts of money because of their name recognition, seniority or membership on important committees. 
Yet--under this amendment--who would be responsible for making the initial determination of what is `reasonable'? Incumbents. Members of Congress. Setting aside whether it is at all wise to allow the Government to regulate political speech, I also wonder whether this amendment would accomplish the goals many of its supporters would hope for. Government micromanagement of 
political speech, particularly by those already entrenched in government, to me seems like a recipe for more of the same problems we currently face. 
The proposed amendment also allows Congress to regulate contributions and expenditures `made by, in support of, or in opposition to' a candidate. Under this language, Congress can regulate the political speech of candidates, parties, individuals and groups. One group that apparently remains unregulatable is the media. By limiting all political speech, except that by the media, the role and importance of the media in the political process would grow exponentially. I have already discussed that. Yet despite the power it would provide to the press, the Washington Post and New York Times oppose this amendment. I think I know why. 
The first amendment is at the heart of the basic freedoms all Americans enjoy, including the freedom to promote one's political views. If we amend the first amendment to limit the political speech of candidates and parties, what is to stop us from amending the press's free speech rights if we become unhappy with their role? 
While we all have felt the sting of a harsh editorial on the pages of a State or national newspaper, I do not believe that any of us feel comfortable with the possibility that Congress could be in the business of regulating the content of newspapers. Yet that seems like the logical next step if this amendment were to pass. 
I understand my colleagues on the other side of this issue who seek to `level the playing field' or make the campaign finance system more equitable for all participants in the political process. We all would like to see candidates unburdened by the `money chase' and campaigns free of excessive negative ads. But this is not the way for us to get our house in order. 
President Eisenhower once told Congress that `freedom has been defined as the opportunity for self-discipline * * * Should we persistently fail to discipline ourselves, eventually there will be increasing pressure on government to redress the failure. By that process freedom will step by step disappear.' I think that comment sums up where we are headed with this amendment. 
As politicians, we have failed to bring discipline to the campaign process. Rather than give in to the pressure to redress our failure by restricting the freedoms offered by the first amendment, I believe that we should look to other, less onerous, means to achieve our goals. I support reasonable campaign finance reform legislation, and have done so in the past. But this proposal goes way beyond reform. It makes mincemeat of the first amendment. 
If the concern is that money corrupts and a lot of money corrupts absolutely, there are steps that can be taken that don't require amending the Constitution. Full disclosure is a good way to provide good government. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.

Mr. DOMENICI. So it seems to me that if the National Education Association opposes this amendment and the National Rifle Association opposes this amendment, then they must be saying that if this were the law of the land, that some Congress in the future could do violence to one or the other of them in terms of their promoting their cause with the American people and with candidates. In fact, they must be worried about whether there might be some picking and choosing among those who might have the right to promote or to participate in the process of trying to influence candidates and elections. Is that not correct?

Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. 
I am not here saying that Congress absolutely would do this, that this would be something that we could just expect in ordinary times, but I believe bad laws are made in unordinary times. I believe bad laws are made when things are not going well and somebody decides that they know why they are not going well. That is why I am reluctant to say Congress, over the scheme of history, would not act in some almost aberrational way to limit speech if things just were not going right and it was their decision there was just too much going on out there in the political arena. Those kinds of things have happened in our history. They have happened and you look back and say, how could it have happened? Historians say all of these different things came together at the same time and, of course, some people thought they knew precisely why and they acted accordingly. 
Now, I also commented about the media collectively as being the big user of this freedom and, indeed, I think that is a fair statement. Frankly, I do not think anybody individually within that collective media would question this statement. They are not always right either. They are not always right in their conclusions, individually and collectively. Even if they are not disposed to be philosophically one way or another, they are frequently wrong. And yet their wrongness is protected by the Constitution. The quantity of that is protected in that if they have enough money and own enough papers, they can be as big as they want. Or if they happen to be a personality that now gets on the nightly news and has reached an esteemed position, then clearly they can say what they like and it becomes kind of what people think, what people talk about the next day. And they might be wrong. 
So it seems to me that when you put all that together, you do not want to change that. That is a great part of America. We want to live with that. Some of us do not think that Congress ought, with that being the reality, to have the authority to say how much you can spend in a campaign to tell your side of those same facts that others are pushing on the public either through the exercise of their right or by campaigning and being in the political arena. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill on behalf of myself, Senator Inouye, Senator Campbell, Senator Johnson, Senator Murkowski, Senator Stevens, and Senator Bingaman. 
Our bill, the American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997, says that the U.S. Congress desires to treat the Indian people of the United States fairly when we pass a new ISTEA; that is, a new highway and transportation and transit bill. As everybody who knows anything about our Indian reservations and Indian pueblos knows, the Indian people buy gasoline just like average Americans. They have cars and pickup trucks. But they have a road system that is maintained for the most part by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Now, if there is not a dedicated source of revenue, then obviously you have to take money out of the Bureau of Indian Affairs general funding to build roads. 
For a number of years we have decided--and I am pleased that I took the leadership--to set aside some significant portion of money out of the highway trust fund that should go to Indian roads. 
Today, I am introducing a bill that says to our 557 Indian tribes and the Alaskan Native villages, which are served by about 50,000 miles of road--about 42 percent of these roads are Bureau of Indian Affairs roads, as I indicated--we are going to try to begin a program that will not only build some more roads but will maintain them and will give the Indian people their share of each category of ISTEA money for their road needs, be it construction of bridges, transit programs, highway safety, scenic byways, or the like. 
Mr. President, our Nation's 557 Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages are served by over 50,000 miles of roads. About 42 percent of these roads are Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA] system roads. Beginning in the 1982 Surface Transportation Assistance Act, these BIA system roads were included in the national highway trust fund for the first time in history. The gasoline tax, paid by every Indian who buys gasoline, was invested on Indian reservations through the Indian Reservation Roads [IRR] Program. Indian tribes were included in subsequent major highway legislation, most recently in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA], where annual funding has been $191 million for the past 5 years. Prior to ISTEA, annual IRR funding was $80 million per year. 
Our best estimates indicate that at least $300 million is needed annually to begin to bring the IRR system up to par with the rest of American roads and highways. Today, I am proud to be joined by Senators Inouye, Campbell, and Johnson in introducing the American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997. Our legislation increases the Indian Reservation Roads Program from $191 million per year to $250 million in fiscal year 1998; $275 million in fiscal year 1999; and $300 million each year for fiscal years 2000 through 2002. These funds are primarily used for the design and construction of the BIA road system in Indian country. It is significant to most tribes that our bill also includes road maintenance as an eligible activity. 
In addition to increasing the planning, design, construction, and maintenance money in our bill, we make other significant changes in the IRR Program and related ISTEA Programs to improve the transportation system on our Nation's Indian reservations. These changes will improve the bridge construction program; provide a set-aside for transit systems; allow DOT certification to directly operate DOT programs; provide a set-aside for highway enhancements like lighting and transfer points to buses; create a competitive grant process for scenic byways; exclude State roads on tribal lands from the apportionment adjustment provisions of ISTEA; and increase funding for Indian Technical Centers from $200,000 each to one million dollars each for the six existing centers. 
In the ISTEA Bridge Program, which now requires each State to set aside 1 percent of its ISTEA Bridge Program funds for Indian tribes, our bill would consolidate the 50 separate State set-asides into one national pool. This national set-aside is then distributed to all tribes using to the BIA National Bridge Inventory Standards Program. This BIA Bridge Program rates each Indian bridge and gives it a national ranking by deficiency. Funding priorities for all tribes would be set through the BIA bridge ranking system. 
To encourage and expand transit systems on Indian reservations, The American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997 [TAITIA] would also establish a 1 percent set-aside from ISTEA--and its successor--transit programs. While a national formula to allocate transit funds is developed in consultation with tribes, the Federal Transit Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation [DOT] would allocate the funds. Without the new set-aside, tribes would have to continue to compete within each State for transit moneys. Our bill also allows the conversion of up to 3 percent of IRR construction and design funds for local transit purposes. 
Under current law, tribes are not included as eligible entities for direct certification by DOT. This situation is clearly detrimental to tribes hoping to directly operate DOT highway programs other than those operated by the BIA. While only a handful of tribes, like the Navajo Nation, are potentially capable of meeting the DOT certification standards, none are allowed to be certified under the terms of current law. Without changing any of DOT's certification standards, this bill would allow tribes that qualify to become certified by DOT to directly operate Federal highway programs. 
In a related certification issue, any tribe certified by DOT, as States are now certified, would be allowed direct access to DOT highway safety program funds. Other tribes--most tribes--would continue to fund their highway safety programs through the BIA-DOT program. 
Indian tribes need better access to the Highway Enhancements Program for such improvements as lighting, bike trails, transfer points to buses, and other enhancements. States are allowed to use up to 10 percent of their ISTEA funds for these types of enhancements. Our bill creates a national Indian set-aside of 1 percent and would be administered through the 
Federal Highway Administration competitive grant process. Each tribe would be eligible to compete for these funds. 
The Scenic Byways Program of ISTEA is essential to many tribes for enhanced access to scenic areas for improved economic development activities and other purposes. The Jicarilla Apache Tribe in New Mexico, for example, has committed $3 million of its IRR funds--about 2 years of its total allocations--to complete its portion of the narrow gauge scenic highway to Colorado. To improve critical roads like this one without detracting from the more basic highway needs, our bill would create a 1 percent set-aside for Indian scenic byways. The Federal Highway Administration would allocate these funds through a competitive process with priority consideration given to tribes with the greatest potential for tourism and other economic development activities for tribal members. 
Many States commit ISTEA resources to public lands highways on Indian reservations. Under current law, there are apportionment adjustment hold harmless provisions between donor and donee States. If a donee State like New Mexico decides to allocate funds for a public land highway through an Indian reservation, that donee State's allocation for the following year is reduced by the amount of money committed to the public land highway through the Indian reservation--as well as public land highways elsewhere in the State. To encourage States to commit their ISTEA resources to these critical highways on Indian land, like New Mexico highway 537 on the Jicarilla Apache Tribe's reservation, our bill exempts State commitments to public lands highways that are built on Indian land. 
If The American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997 were law today, the State of New Mexico and similar donee States would not be penalized for committing their resources to State roads like New Mexico highway 537. Our bill does not address the more general issue of the apportionment adjustment hold harmless provisions in ISTEA, we simply exempt Indian land highways from those provisions. 
Finally, The American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997 increases the allocation of IRR funds to the Indian technical centers from $200,000 per center for six centers to $1 million per center for the 
same six centers. These centers provide training to Indian tribes in all phases of highway planning, design, construction, maintenance, procurement, and related bridge programs. Increasing the ability of these centers to train Indian highway administrators, engineers, and others involved in the IRR Program will significantly enhance the ability of tribes to operate their own programs and improve their transportation systems. 
Mr. President, The American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997, was developed in close consultation with Indian leaders. I would like to give special recognition to Paulson Chaco and Sam Johns of the Navajo Nation Transportation Department and Arnold Cassador of the Jicarilla Apache Tribe and Mark Wright, their tribal roads engineer. Their assistance in developing this bill has been essential and their knowledge of these highway programs is impressive. 
The American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997 will be a considerable improvement in the current way we do business for the BIA roads system. This system serves over a million American Indians who live on or near a reservation. In my home State of New Mexico, IRR funds have made a large difference in the past decade. It is time to accelerate this effort for the direct benefit of Indian people in America. 
Under the current relative needs formula for distributing the IRR money, the Navajo Nation--in New Mexico and Arizona--is now scheduled to receive about $55 million annually in IRR funds. New Mexico Pueblos receive about $12 million and the Apache Tribes receive about $3 million in New Mexico. I know from personal observation, that these funds are generally well spent and much needed throughout Indian country. I believe they are critical funds for improving the poor employment opportunities on most Indian reservations. I urge my colleagues to study the importance of Indian roads for economic development opportunities, and support our effort to greatly improve the Indian Reservation Road Program as described in our bill. Our bill will go a long way toward helping American Indians make the best use of our Nation's highway programs to improve their daily lives. 
We have not heretofore broadly applied this degree of Indian participation in the trust fund we set up for highways and mass transit. We have, in the past, principally put money in to build roads. This year, the new bill that we introduced with the cosponsors that I have spoken of, will increase the ISTEA Indian Reservation Road Program to $250 million in 1998, to $275 million in 1999, then $300 million in each of the years 2000, 2001 and 2002. The ISTEA Indian Reservation [IRR] Roads program is currently funded at $191 million per year.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send a summary of the provisions, the purpose and various provisions. This document will show that Indian reservation bridges, for example, will be handled in a better way. Our bill continues the basic design and construction of Indian roads. We also add road maintenance as an eligible activity. We also provide transit, scenic byways, highway enhancements, and other Indian set-asides in our bill. 
We include scenic byways, especially those that will help to develop reservation economies. We think if there are byways that are scenic in Indian country and can add to the reservation economy, they ought to get their share of these highway trust funds. We allow DOT certification for tribes who can qualify to directly operate DOT programs without going through the Bureau of Indian Affairs. We increase funding for Indian technical centers to enhance tribal capabilities in the entire range of highway planning, design, construction, and maintenance.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I first say to my good friend, Senator Frist, from Tennessee, I compliment you on your remarks and thank you very much for what you are doing. I believe we are on to something. I believe people in your State and in my State and in every State in America are beginning to understand that the time is now--in fact, it might be past--for us to empower our teachers and parents once again to inject a very common, ordinary idea into the classroom where our children spend much of their time. Students, in an attempt to learn how to be grownup, self-sustaining citizens need to be empowered in our classrooms, in various ways, with character education, plain and simple. 
Before this movement, many teachers were frightened to talk about trustworthiness, which means you should not lie, which means there is a virtue to honesty, which means that you ought to be loyal. When you make a commitment, you ought to live up to it. 
Many of our teachers and principals and superintendents were frightened of the notion that we would talk with our young people about responsibility. They thought that was an infringement some way or another on somebody, somewhere, somehow who ought to be teaching this. 
Respect: Our teachers were frightened with the notion that we ought to actually use that word and get our young people to understand the word `respect' has meaning and to find ways to instill into our classrooms, and thus into our children, the idea of basic human respect, one person for another. 
Or fairness, or caring, or citizenship. 
Those six simple words--the six pillars--form the nucleus for what is commonly known as Character Counts that is associated with the Character Counts Coalition of America. 
Today, for the fourth year, with the assistance of the original cosponsors, Senators Dodd, Cochran, Mikulski, Bennett, Lieberman, Kempthorne, Dorgan, Frist, and Cleland, and I am sure many others will join us, we are going to adopt soon in this Senate a resolution setting aside a week in our Nation when our communities, our schools, and our businesses will participate in character development programs. These six pillars of character that I have just described will come once again to the forefront and will become commonplace words for the participatory activities of the previous year and with renewed commitments in the future. 
I am very proud to say that since the Aspen Declaration was adopted--an event which occurred sometime in 1990 or thereabouts under the auspices of an ethics foundation known as the Josephson Foundation, headed by an ethics professional and lawyer named Michael Josephson--an event attended by about 70 or 80 Americans from all walks of life, after 2 or 3 days of discussions they came forth with these six pillars of character and this notion of Character Counts. These six pillars are words that we should get back into our children's vocabulary and into their daily lives. Since that meeting, the program relies almost exclusively on action at the grassroots. There is a modest national effort directing this program, but the real efforts are at the grassroots to take those six words and put them into our daily lives. 
I am proud to say, and perhaps brag, that the State among all the States that is doing the most in this area is the State of New Mexico. I took this notion to my home city of Albuquerque and asked Mayor Chavez to help me, and together we started a Character Counts Program for the city. Believe it or not, it has spread from that community to almost every community in New Mexico. I will soon, just for the record, state the counties, municipalities, and school districts wherein Character Counts is now a vital part of daily life. 
Now, fellow Senators, if you want to do something exciting, you get Character Counts started in your States. You go on one of your recesses to visit a grade school, a grade school that has the six pillars of character not only in the vocabulary day by day in that school but in the month-by-month selection of one of those words as the word of the month, whereby all the students practice the word `responsibility.' 
Now, they all do it differently. Nobody has a book on this. Nobody says exactly how it ought to be done. But if you want to do something exciting, start this program and get your school boards committed, the superintendents committed, and then get the teachers committed, and you will see something very dramatic happen. The teachers are excited that for once they have been relieved of the fear of discussing good character, and you will find that with parent groups and others this is becoming a vital and important part of the daily education life. 
I frequently go to these schools when they are having their monthly assembly. That is how most of them do it. They have a monthly assembly, they commend people, grant certificates, give awards. I am reminded of one where the grade school was putting on a play with reference to the monthly word which was `responsibility.' Something very, very funny happened. They had chosen Little Red Riding Hood as their skit. I had a lot of difficulty understanding how that had to do with the word of the month, `responsibility.' As that wonderful skit completed, they recalled how Little Red Riding Hood did not quite follow the instructions that were given to her by her parents and went astray and, as a result, all these things happened, including in the one version where the grandma got eaten up by the wolf. When they finished the play, they all stood up front, and their meaning of `responsibility' was that if Little Red Riding Hood had followed the directions given by her parents and been more responsive, and thus responsible, then nothing bad would have happened to grandma. I am not sure everybody takes the story that way, but in a sense it shows you how young people, helped by adults, can get the message across. 
I was recently in a community of Clovis, NM. A grade school there has been heavily involved in Character Counts. As my wife and I walked in to visit, they had just recently composed, under the direction of their wonderful music teacher, a song with its own melody and its words about the six pillars of character, and everyone in the school would soon know it. Part of the participation in the Character Counts program is this kind of activity. 
This resolution endorses character education for children. It clearly states that children need, first and foremost, strong and constructive guidance from their families. In addition, children's communities--including schools, youth organizations, religious institutions, and civic groups--play an important supportive role in fostering and promoting good character. The resolution identifies six core elements of character that transcend cultural, religious, and socioeconomic differences that are intrinsic to the well-being of individuals, communities, and society as a whole: Trustworthiness, Respect, Responsibility, Fairness, Caring, and Citizenship. 
These six simple elements are commonly referred to as the six pillars of character. They represent the values that define us at our best--the common ground we can build upon--individual by individual, family by family, community by community. Arguably, there can be many additions to this list. These six, however, are ones that can serve as the core elements of good character. 
Since introduction of the first `National Character Counts Week' resolution, we are witnessing an enormous groundswell of interest in the issue of character education. Secretary of Education Riley speaks to this issue often in his public addresses, and countless other educators have programs and training sessions to promote character development activities. More important, however, is the extraordinary support of character education at the local level. This is where character development programs are the best because they involve the children and the community at large. And, character education is not just for children, it is for everyone who cares deeply about the social and cultural pulse of this country. 
As the resolution quotes from the Aspen Declaration: `The character and conduct of our youth reflect the character and conduct of society; therefore, every adult has the responsibility to teach and model the core ethical values and every social institution has the responsibility to promote the development of good character.' 
From everything I have seen in the State of New Mexico, children and adults alike are embracing the six pillars of character. They are finding ways to spread the message--from plays, to musical groups, to school lessons, to printing the messages on billboards. Let me just briefly outline a few of the community initiatives and related activities that support the character-building idea: 
The Albuquerque Public School (APS) system has endorsed the incorporation of character education programs in all of its 119 schools. It estimates that between 80-90 percent of its 89,000 students have been introduced to the Character Counts program. 
The Archdiocese of Santa Fe Catholic Schools system has incorporated Character Counts programs in all of its 21 schools--from preschool through seniors in high school--and has interwoven the six pillars of character in all of its classes. 
The New Mexico television and radio media have jointly cooperated to promote Character Counts through news coverage, public service announcements, and incorporating Character Counts in most of their other public affairs projects. For example, there is now an annual Character Counts Care Fair each December. All of the television stations take part, illustrating their Christmas charitable projects; they used the Character Counts theme in all of their air promotions for their holiday collection drives. Additionally, the KOB-TV/Hubbard Foundation made Character Counts one of the foundation's major grantees in 1996, with the award of $5,000 to be used by the Albuquerque Character Counts Coalition to help promote the character education initiative. 
In Farmington, the San Juan County Character Counts group has translated each of the six pillars into the Navajo language and produces posters for the children. 
In Gallup, the McKinley County School District incorporates Character Counts into its schools, and the local Character Counts 
organization is developing a business community program to help support school and civic activities. 
The Las Cruces Character Counts Partnership Taskforce selected three students for special recognition for their Character Counts achievements. The elementary and secondary student winners received a day with the mayor and the Governor of New Mexico, and the high school winner received a 3-day visit to Washington, DC, including attendance at the inauguration of President Clinton. 
The New Mexico State Department of Education has initiated plans to commence an overall assessment program to provide basic data to determine future needs, changes, additions, and modifications of the program throughout the State. 
The Lea County Coalition for Character Counts planned an entire week of activities for last year's Character Counts Week. It included an art show of children's works at the city library depicting people in situations showing respect and responsibility. It also included a chamber of commerce-sponsored hotline that ran public service announcements for Character Counts Week. 
The Character Counts student council from Gadsden High School formed committees for cleaning up the school and school grounds, developed door contests in the school and public announcements at football games on the six pillar words, and participated in the school talent show with Character Counts lessons. 
The Roswell Character Counts Partnership Taskforce has initiated training programs for all youth league program coaches and volunteers to include character programs in summer youth activities. 
T-VI--Technical Vocational Institute--in Albuquerque now offers two 5-week sessions on Character Counts. 
I have given but just a fraction of the exciting programs and initiatives under way in the State of New Mexico to promote the six pillars of good character. Literally thousands and thousands of children and families, schools, youth organizations and businesses are involved in these endeavors. Simply put, the people of the State have said it is OK to talk about and practice the traits of trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. 
Practicing the principles of character goes beyond the schools too. In Albuquerque, and now other communities are picking up the idea, an entirely new program is being launched: Character Counts in the Workplace, sponsored by regional chambers of commerce. The stated goal of this program is to put the six pillars of character into the workplace `so we can count on one another to make principle-based decisions rather than merely expedient ones throughout the New Mexico business community.' As one New Mexican said, `People may not believe what you say, but they do believe what you do.' 
Practicing the principles of good character is for everyone. I am immensely proud of what the people of New Mexico have done in 4 short years to awaken one another to the benefits of practicing good character traits. It is an effort that has brought all ages of people together, in all professions, to work a little harder to bring civility in our relationships with one another. 
I would like to close with some words from His Excellency, Michael J. Sheehan, Archbishop of Santa Fe, in his letter endorsing the Character Counts program in the 21 Catholic schools in the Santa Fe Archdiocese:  
Our Catholic schools assist parents in their efforts to help their children understand that God commands us to be honest, just, truthful, faithful, kind, generous, and forgiving. Character Counts provides the common language for citizens of all ages and all walks of life. Every educator knows the key to an effective education is consistency and repetition--from the pulpit to the boardroom to the playground. Let us be consistent with our brothers and sisters in our Nation's community by integrating this common language into our everyday encounters with our children, our families, our colleagues. 
Mr. President, National Character Counts Week represents an important time to set aside and observe the thousands of local programs and individuals who believe we can endorse and practice six pillars of good character. It is families, schools, civic and social organizations, local and State governments, businesses, and ordinary citizens who are participating in this movement. We, too, can be a part of this movement by supporting this resolution. 
So, I could not be more pleased, even thrilled at what is happening in my State. I am hopeful within a couple of years we will be able to measure the positive consequences that we think are going to flow from building these six words into the everyday vocabulary of our children, incorporating them just in the ordinary teaching every day so that trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring and citizenship might become a way of life. If ever we needed change in that direction and help in promulgating character, it is now. In fact, it is long past due. 
I am very hopeful that we are giving parents, children, teachers and the entire community a vehicle to promote better character and build character around these six very, very acceptable words that I have repeated at least once or twice--three times here on the floor. That is the essence of the Character Counts Program. Get these six pillars into the classroom, into the daily vocabulary, into the teaching--those ways that are used to teach our young people. And then use innovation and creativity to instill them. 
I urge my colleagues to join us again this year in cosponsoring and adopting `National Character Counts Week.' Thank you. 
I know other Senators are waiting to be heard, so I will yield especially to my friend who is a cosponsor and one of the early founders of this coalition in the Senate, the distinguished Senator Bennett from the State of Utah.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Mr. PenAE6a has an impressive set of challenges ahead of him. From our meetings as well as his committee hearing, I'm confident that he understands the responsibilities of this new assignment and that he is willing to make key changes in the Department to enable future success. 
Mr. PenAE6a listed the key priorities for the Department, including the need to ensure a safe and reliable nuclear weapons stockpile while reducing the global nuclear danger. He spoke to the importance of cleanup of former nuclear weapons sites and to finding a timely path for disposing of nuclear waste. He emphasized the importance of using and leveraging science and technology throughout the Department. Those are appropriate priorities. 
Responsibility for the Nation's nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons technologies was rightly prominent on his list. Perhaps no other challenge requires as much of his personal attention. The safety and security of the Nation's nuclear arsenal must be assured. The Nation will place this responsibility squarely on his shoulders. 
We talked about the importance of avoiding over dependence on his staff and about moving forward with some key recommendations of the Galvin Commission to minimize micromanagement by the Department. 
He assured me that the nuclear weapons program will receive annual budget support above $4 billion for the foreseeable future. Below that level I doubt we can maintain the stockpile at the level of confidence, safety, and security that the nuclear weapon responsibilities demand. He assured me that the Department will continue to fully meet the requirements of the Department of Defense, including weapons production capabilities and a reliable tritium supply, and that the Science Based Stockpile Stewardship Program will remain a cornerstone of the nuclear weapons programs. 
He assured me that the Department will continue to pursue strong nonproliferation programs with the former Soviet Union, and seek opportunities for the Department to increase its contributions. 
He assured me that the Department will move forward with stronger coordination of policy and budgets, and that an independent review of the Department's overdependence on the NEPA process will be forthcoming. He assured me that he will explore rapid movement away from the Department's self-regulation toward outside regulation. And he assured me that the Department will support not only opening of WIPP this November, but also release of funds to construct the WIPP bypass system in New Mexico. 
Based on these assurances of appropriate support for the Department's programs of critical national and global importance, as well as those programs that directly impact on the State of New Mexico, I look forward to working with Secretary of Energy PenAE6a on these challenges over the next 4 years.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to amend the New Mexico Enabling Act of 1910. I am pleased to have as a cosponsor, my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman. I am also very pleased that identical legislation is being introduced today in the House by New Mexico's Representatives Skeen and Schiff. 
Mr. President, the Enabling Act of 1910 provided the people of the New Mexico with the authority to convene a State constitutional convention and to organize a State government. As was the case with almost every State west of the Mississippi River, New Mexico was also granted certain public domain lands to be held in trust for the purposes of supporting the State's public educational institutions. 
The New Mexico State Land Commissioner's office has a proud history of producing sustained revenues from these State trust lands. These revenues have served the public schools of our State as they were intended, by providing for investments in a permanent fund. Mandates for managing the trust lands to sustain the permanent fund, as well as the control of and distributions from the fund are a part of our State constitution. In order to amend the constitutional mandates related to the State trust lands and the permanent fund, the Enabling Act requires that Congress give its consent to the amendments. Today, we begin the process of allowing New Mexico greater flexibility for investment, and protection of the permanent fund from the effects of inflation. 
In New Mexico, the State Investment Council is charged with managing our State's permanent fund. The council is currently constrained by constitutional mandate, and the Enabling Act, from making certain types of investments that would have provided millions of additional dollars for our State's educational institutions over the past 20 years. Additionally, they are currently required to distribute, on an annual basis, the dividends and income from the permanent fund, regardless of the impacts of inflation on the value of its assets. This requirement has also cost the beneficiaries through periodic market value erosion of the fund's assets. 
Mr. President, the voters of New Mexico have spoken. On November 5, 1996, 67 percent approved amendments to our State constitution that will improve the situation. These amendments give the 
State Investment Council the necessary flexibility to prudently invest the assets of the permanent fund. Additionally, they restrict the distribution of revenues to a fixed percentage of a rolling 5-year average market value of those assets.

We are good friends. I do not support him on that basis only. I think he is ready to undertake this very difficult job. I wish him well. 
I think we can work together to make the Department of Energy a better department under his administration. I look forward to working to that end. I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, I rise today to introduce a measure, the title of which will be the Genetic Confidentiality and Nondiscrimination Act of 1997. 
Let me just suggest, during the last 2 weeks at every turn we have seen and heard reports of the latest achievements in the advancement of genetic technologies. Man has been controlling the genetics of domestic animals and plants for many thousands of years, but the latest announcements about the cloning of sheep and monkeys have been particularly dramatic. Most of the drama arises from the media speculation that follows about the possibility of cloning human beings. 
Such an event is widely viewed as next to impossible because the scientific community and officers of Federal funding and oversight vigorously reject the concept of creating genetic copies of human beings. But what these new events do bring home to us, and what is of significance to us, is that genetics is important in our daily lives now. 
Let me suggest that the time has come to protect information about human genetics that has been obtained by researchers or otherwise from individual human beings, individual citizens of this country. 
I have a rather detailed bill, in which Senator Dodd is joining me, as is Senator Jeffords, the chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Resources Committee. This will actually say that what we are going to have to get is the consent of the person whose genetic information we intend to use in almost any way. We know that genetic information is just as significant as fingerprints of the past in terms of identifying people. 
Much can be determined about a person's life, about a person's future, from genetic information. Now is the time to have a serious debate in the U.S. Congress about how that information should be protected. The bill which I introduce will begin that dialogue in the appropriate committee. 
I send to the desk the bill. For those who have been giving us constructive information about it, this is the very last draft after many people in industry, in the biotechnology community, and in the community of genetics have given us information. I have a side by side on this bill and a detailed statement explaining it. I send them all to the desk and ask that the bill be referred to the appropriate committee. 
Now I yield to my good friend, Senator Dodd, from Connecticut.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I did not, in my statement, mean to tie cloning into this bill. It is just that all of that is part of this explosion of the science of genetics and its application for various aspects of both human and animal life in America and in the world. 
Let me suggest that if we are going to continue research, we have this major American project called the Genome Project wherein all of the chromosomes of the human being are going to be mapped, all 23 pairs of them. We will know where most of the diseases are located within the chromosome system of the human being. Our scientists can then take this information and begin the long journey toward curing most of humankind's serious diseases over time. 
While all that is going on, the one thing we do not need, we do not need an abuse of the information by either researchers, scientists, insurance companies or the like, such that it would excite the American people to turn against such research. One thing we ought to do in that regard is pass some kind of protection for genetic information. That is what this bill attempts to do. 
Obviously, there is a whole field of ethics that must be really put together and nourished across the land regarding this, or we will cause breakouts to occur in terms of abuse of genetic information, all of which could be very harmful to the greatest wellness effort in humankind, in human history. That is, finding out the basic genetic structure of the human being. 
Mr. President, during the past 2 weeks, at every turn, we have been seen and heard reports of the latest achievement in the advance of genetic technologies. Man has been controlling the genetics of domestic animals and plants for many thousands of years, but the latest announcements about cloning sheep and monkeys have been particularly dramatic. And most of the drama arises from the media speculation that follows about the possibility of cloning humans. Such an event is widely viewed as next to impossible because the scientific community and offices of Federal funding and oversight vigorously reject the concept of creating genetic copies of human beings. But what these new events do bring home to us is the grave significance of genetics in our daily lives. 
I rise today to revisit a timely and momentous issue in the discovery and elucidation of human genetic information--the issue of genetic confidentiality and nondiscrimination. 
The human genome project is rapidly proceeding toward its goal of deciphering the human genetic code. Current projections tell us that the goal of reading the entire genetic script of 3 billion nucleotides and some 100,000 genes of the human genome will be reached by the year 2005, which will be several years earlier than was initially projected when the project was undertaken in 1990. 
When the project is complete, we will have knowledge of man's complete genetic blueprint--a blueprint that is the most personal and most private information that any human being can have. 
We will have a wealth of knowledge of how our countless individual traits are determined. And perhaps more important, we will have fundamental knowledge about the 3,000 or more genes that can cause sickness and sometimes even death. And we will have realized one of mankind's greatest scientific achievements. 
At the time the human genome project was first brought to my attention 11 years ago, I realized that deciphering our genetic code would have immense implications for our medical welfare. But equally important, if not more so, were the implications of genetic information with respect to ethics and the law. This is why I insisted that the budget for the human genome project include funds specifically allocated for addressing the ethical, legal, and social implications of our new genetic technologies. 
Now that we have the know-how to generate genetic information on individuals and their families, we find ourselves asking some very basic 
questions about who has a right to control access to personal genetic information. Should our personal physicians know this information? Our families and friends? Our insurers and employers? As we begin to consider these questions, we find that they are deeply troublesome issues that reach into the lives of many Americans. 
Today I place before you a bill that addresses the broad issues of genetic confidentiality and nondiscrimination. This legislation will affirm the right of the individual to have some control over his or her most personal information. To be sure, much of our genetic information is similar--even identical--among all human beings. This is what makes us all members of the family of man. But much of our genetic information is also unique--it is the information that makes each human distinct from all others. And it is information that can be deciphered from cells in a drop of blood or cells that are stored in a laboratory after we have medical tests. 
Our personal and unique genetic information is the essence of our individuality. And today we seek to protect this information from public scrutiny or disclosure without the express consent of the individual who is the source of the information. 
So, today, I, and my colleagues, Senator Jeffords and Senator Dodd introduce the Genetic Confidentiality and Nondiscrimination Act of 1997. This legislation is designed to reinforce the statutes that some 19 state legislatures have enacted. This legislation echoes the concerns of many of my colleagues in this Chamber as we all seek to come to grips with this pressing and ubiquitous issue. I hope that this bill will invite exhaustive debate and legislative review, so that we will achieve a firm national standard for individual privacy with respect to genetic information. 
The bill that I introduce today focuses on two areas of serious concern. 
The first issue is the relationship between the interests of genetics research and the individuals who selflessly participate as subjects in hundreds of genetics research projects. The past year, 1996, witnessed the 50th anniversary of the birth of the Nuremberg Code and the public acknowledgement of the doctrine of informed consent for participation in research. Over this half century, we have repeatedly affirmed the right of the individual to be fully informed about any research project that he or she is asked to participate in and to give voluntary consent to participation. 
In this present bill we will extend the concept of informed consent to give each individual the right to control the deciphering of his or her most personal information and the disclosure of that information to other 
persons. And we will create a partnership between researchers and the people--the subjects--who are the foundation of research in genetics. 
We might consider a recent example of genetic testing that was carried out on a collection of samples that had been retained for some years in a genetics laboratory. These samples had been gathered for the purpose of detecting carriers of a recessive gene for Tay Sachs disease, a disease that invariably causes the death of infants who get a double dose of the gene, one from each parent. The more recent question concerned the frequency of one of the breast cancer genes in that population. So samples that were originally collected for one purpose were later used for another purpose, without the permission of the people who had donated the samples and without the possibility of getting any new information back to the people who had donated the samples. 
Both protection and partnership are critical as we continue to define our genetic legacies, particularly because genetics has implications in many facets of our everyday lives, including medicine, employment, insurance, education, forensics, finance, and even our own self-perceptions. 
The second issue addressed in this legislation is the relationship between individuals, on the one hand, and employers and health insurers, on the other. This legislation will very simply preclude employers or health insurers from requesting or requiring genotype information as a condition of employment or health insurance. 
Many people in our society have already been discriminated against because other people had access to information about their genes. We want to avoid any more situations in which healthy people are denied employment or insurance when they disclose information about their genes. Consider, for example, the man who acknowledged that he had genes for hemochromatosis. This is a disease that can be devastating if untreated, but it can be successfully treated. This man was successfully treated and was completely healthy, but he was denied insurance simply because of his genes, and this should not happen. 
We do, however, carve out one exception to the general rule, for protecting employees and coworkers from hazardous conditions or situations in the workplace. For example, an employer may have a valid reason to know whether an employee has a genetic susceptibility to a certain chemical that is a part of the work environment. So the exception allows a request for genetic information if it is a matter of immediate business necessity. 
I would like to be very clear that this legislation does not make it illegal to collect, or store, or analyze, or even disclose, an individual's genetic information. It simply gives the individual control over this process 
through a rigorous procedure for written, informed consent. The only exceptions for individual control are questions of compulsory process, such as criminal investigations, or court-ordered analyses. 
Specifically, the purposes of this legislation are: 
First, to define the circumstances under which DNA samples and genetic information may be collected, stored, analyzed, and disclosed; second, to define the rights of individuals with respect to genetic information; third, to define the responsibilities of third parties with respect to genetic information; fourth, to protect individuals and families from genetic discrimination; and fifth, to establish uniform rules that protect individual genetic privacy. 
The need for this legislation is clear and pressing. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and in the House to bring this issue to a satisfactory resolution for the American people. The Human Genome Project holds the greatest promise of benefits for mankind, but these benefits will elude us if people are afraid of the consequences of deciphering their own genetic formulas.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to support the nomination of Charlene Barshefsky to become the U.S. Trade Representative. 
Mr. President, one of the things I find most interesting about Charlene Barshefsky is that in many ways she is a study in contradiction. On the one hand, she is a tough-as-nails trade negotiator who has developed a reputation for bringing the most experienced and determined of opponents to their knees. On the other hand, she is a loving and supportive wife and mother who recognizes the importance of family and, despite having very important responsibilities, makes time for her children. 
Mrs. Barshefsky's tough negotiating strategy has earned her the nickname `Stonewall' from her colleagues, and `Dragon Lady' from the Japanese. This reputation, however, was not gained at the expense of attention to her children. It has been reported that she has been known to help her children with homework while on the telephone to Hong Kong and other far off places. 
Mr. President, I have had an opportunity to witness Mrs. Barshefsky's abilities first hand in the 1980's. At that time, a number of my colleagues and I fought to stop Chile from dumping Government subsidized copper on the world copper market potentially putting thousands of people in New Mexico and throughout the United States out of work. Although U.S. copper producers ran the most competitive mining operations in the world, Americans were loosing jobs because the Chilean Government was subsidizing its industry with Government revenues and development funds from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Charlene Barshefsky was one of the primary people who worked to rectify this situation. 
Mrs. Barshefsky has successfully worked on numerous other trade related issues since then. She became the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative in May, 1993, and Acting Trade Representative in April, 1996. She marshaled support for the Global Information Technology Agreement and successfully concluded negotiations on the Basic Telecommunications Services Agreement to expand telecommunications trade and facilitate the building of a global information infrastructure. She played a vital role in solving trade disputes with Japan and China. She fought to open markets for the U.S. agricultural industry, and is leading efforts to expand trade with Europe. In fact, its hard to find an area of trade where Mrs. Barshefsky has not been involved. 
Charlene Barshefsky's tenacity and skill as a trade negotiator is well know the world over. Her demonstrated ability to do an exceptional job, her reputation for being a supreme tactician and tough negotiator, and her ability to do all of this and still make time for her family makes her an ideal choice for this post. For these reasons and others, it gives me great pleasure to support Charlene Barshefsky's nomination.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just listened to my good friend from Virginia talk about whether we have the will or not without a constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget. Let me say to everyone, the President of the United States has been saying he has the will; the will to get a balanced budget by 2002 has been a cornerstone to what he has been saying during his campaign and during the last couple of months. 
The truth of the matter is, I say to my friend from Virginia, he did not present a balanced budget. Last night, the Congressional Budget Office told us that the President's budget, in the last year, the year it is supposed to be in balance, is $70 billion in the red. You know, we are only starting this exercise at $106 billion. Mr. President, $106 billion is where we are, and after all the Presidential hoopla, sending us this great budget, those who estimate say it is still $70 billion in the red in 2002. 
If that is not enough, let me tell you, the will seems to be to delay, delay, delay. A constitutional amendment would put a finality to that and you would reach the time when you could delay no more, which I believe is the reason that my good friend has decided that he must go for this amendment, even though we would all prefer to balance the budget on our own. Is delay part of the President's budget, while he admonishes us not to adopt a constitutional amendment? You bet. The Congressional Budget Office just told us that next year, the first year we are supposed to be moving toward balance, the deficit goes up $25 billion. Can you imagine a deficit increase, from a President telling us not to adopt a constitutional amendment because it is too rigid and he would like the flexibility, and stating he just sent Congress a balanced budget? 
My friend, Congressman John Kasich, tried to explain this, and I must borrow his analogy. He talked about somebody going on a diet and deciding that the first 4 years of the diet, you will increase your weight preposterously--$25 billion worth, in the first year--and then when you finally get to the year you are supposed to actually lose weight, you all of a sudden, in that last year, you are going to lose 100 pounds. 
This budget is before us now, brought to us by a President who is telling us, I will balance the budget myself--right? That is what he is saying. Do you know how much of this deficit reduction, according to the experts that we must listen to, occurs in the last 2 years of this budget? I assume you were appalled, I say to Senator Robb, when you heard 75 percent as the estimate 2 weeks ago. That is wrong. Mr. President, 98.5 percent of the President's deficit reduction occurs in the fourth and fifth year of this budget. Do you believe it? Do you believe that will happen? Of course not. You will have another budget stacked up here, saying, `Well, we thought we were getting there, but we are not.' 
As a matter of fact, the response of the administration today is, we are not changing a thing because, come that final year, we 
have a trigger. Did you ever hear of a trigger in budgeting? You pull a trigger and you cut spending. Why don't you pull the trigger next year and start cutting spending? You wait until the end and you `trigger' out--neat word--trigger out the tax cuts that you put in place. So you raise taxes, because you were wrong and you could not get to balance, so you say, we will cut your taxes for 3 years but in the fourth and fifth years, when we are out of balance, we will put the taxes right back on. That is a neat trigger, isn't it? It is a trigger, so clearly we ought to be down here saying, `We do not need a constitutional amendment" --this is a new one--`we have a trigger. Forget the amendment. We will balance the budget with a trigger.' 
And then the President says, `Of course, we cannot do it all by taxes.' So, what we are going to do is we are going to trigger an across-the-board cut, 4 percent across-the-board on almost everything. Do you believe it? Of course not. It will not happen. It is an absolute phony device. 
For those who think we do not need a constitutional amendment because we will balance the budget ourselves, I submit, with great regret, that the President's budget is not an example of doing it ourselves, for it will not achieve the goal. As a matter of fact, it obfuscates, it hides, it delays, it terminates a bunch of programs. 
One big program is terminated in the fifth year, even though it is an entitlement. And guess the rhetoric? The rhetoric is, `Well, the President promised to do it for only 5 years in his campaign, so it is in the budget for 5 years.' A new entitlement, but at the end of 5 years, it is out. That won't happen. You already have hundreds of thousands of Americans on this entitlement to help pay for health care of one type or another. But because we had a campaign that said we are going to do this for 5 years, we will stop it. 
You see, the President has just given us, in his budget, I regret to say, the best example of why we need a constitutional amendment. We just absolutely cannot put ourselves to making tough decisions. I say to those negotiating for the President, I remain hopeful that there are two things at play that may still get us to the Holy Land, and the two things are that this President cannot live with 4 years of a sustained fight with a Republican Congress--he cannot--because what kind of a legacy is that? `I did battle with the Republicans for 4 years, and that is my legacy.' Of course that is no legacy. Nor can the Republicans who control this place--and thanks to Senator Robb for helping us on these matters. We don't draw lines. He is one of the most committed Senators to getting a balanced budget, and I compliment him for it. But we can't live fighting the President for 2 years or 4 years. So I think maybe the pot may be able to get stewed up moving in the right direction of getting a balanced budget. 
Let me say, for those who claim we will do it ourselves, they better do a lot better than the President, because he is not doing it himself. His budget needs a constitutional amendment almost as bad as any of those budgets we have up here. How many years is that, I ask the Senator from Utah? Twenty-nine? Twenty-eight? We probably need it as bad on the President's budget as any of those budgets out here which caused us to go into this 5 trillion dollars worth of debt.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the best thing the President can offer in his budget, in lieu of a constitutional amendment to do the job, is a trigger. This trigger is not going to get us where we have to be, but it is the only answer the President has to saying he will get us there. There is a newfangled procedure in budgeting that says when the time comes to do what we should have 
already done, we will use a gun and we will call it a trigger, and we will automatically cut things that we didn't have the courage to do anything about for the 4 preceding years. 
Now, that is not doing it yourself and it is not anything that would justify our throwing away this constitutional amendment. However, I do believe we are not going to pass it because I think those opposed to it are still convinced we need bigger Government, and the constitutional amendment is an instrument for less Government rather than more, and that is the reason we are going to lose. I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma very much. Let me say to all the Senators on our side who are here, I am very proud to be here with you, and I am exceptionally proud that every single Republican Senator is going to vote for this constitutional amendment. I think the American people ought to make note of that. 
I also call to your attention, in case you wonder why we are losing this amendment today--if we do--that 72 sitting Senators, 72 out of the 100 who sit, have voted for this constitutional amendment, or one just like it. Now, isn't it intriguing that at one time or another, 72 could vote for it, but today only 66 will find their way clear to vote for it? 
It seems to me games are being played with the American people, without any question. If 72 voted for it before, I say to Senator Cochran, how come only 66 today? Are we better off? Are we more apt to get a real balanced budget today? Has our President sent us some budget that should renew our faith and our hope that we will do it ourselves? 
The budget the President sent us starts with a deficit of $106 billion, and our accounting department tells us, when we are finished with 5 years of cuts under his budget, the deficit is still $70 billion. What a dramatic budget. It should renew our hope and our faith that we can do it and that Presidents can lead us, right? Wrong. It means that we ought to have a constitutional amendment, there is no question about it. We won't do it. 
For a nation that was born in tax revolutions where we said, `No taxation without representation,' I close this debate by saying, why should we tie the hands of our children and leave them a legacy of debt when they cannot be represented because we refuse to pay our own bills? That is why we need a constitutional amendment. We should not burden our children with a legacy that says no prosperity, no growth, a life of taxation to pay our bills, because 72 Senators heretofore have voted for a constitutional amendment like this. 
But games are being played so that today, it will lose, once again. 
I close with, isn't it a curious turn of events that it loses by one vote each time? Perhaps those watching this debate might wonder, how does that happen? Well, I tell you how it happens. Members of the Senate on that side of the aisle tell their voters one thing, and when it gets right down to voting, either a President or their own leaders talk just enough of them out of it to make us lose by one vote. We ought to be proud we are not on that team. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my good friend from Utah for yielding the wrapup minutes to me. 
Frequently we use a word to describe what we are all for--that is `freedom.' I would like to suggest that the constitutional amendment is about freedom, because to the extent that Government grows and grows, freedom diminishes and diminishes. To the extent we tax and tax, the freedom of our people diminishes. 
It has been said that all significant achievement occurs because a man or a woman is free. That is why America is so great. That is why we have achieved so much. 
So it seems to me that today we have a very historic vote. I honestly believe those who have twisted the last arm and got this where we will lose by one vote once again are those who are frightened about the concept of less Government rather than more. They are the ones who want more Government rather than less or at least they want the opportunity to have more Government rather than less. For they see Government as the achiever rather than individuals who maintain more of their freedom if they are taxed less and if Government is smaller. 
So to me, it is a very interesting philosophical debate. Those who will vote for it say we trust--we trust--people, we trust families, we trust States, we trust individuals, and we trust decisionmakers at the home level. The others are saying, we are not sure of that. We want to reserve the option to continue to incur debt and let Government grow and grow. I believe it is clear. I wish we would win today. I am sorry we will not. I think I understand why. I hope the American people do. I yield the floor.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, the first concurrent resolution on the budget for 1986. 
This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget through February 28, 1997. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of the 1997 concurrent resolution on the budget House Joint Resolution 178, show that current level spending is above the budget resolution by $16.9 billion in budget authority and by $12.6 billion in outlays. Current level is $20.5 billion above the revenue floor in 1997 and $101.9 billion above the revenue floor over the 5 years 1997-2001. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $219.6 billion, $7.6 billion below the maximum deficit amount for 1997 of $227.3 billion. 
Since my last report, dated January 22, 1997, the Congress has cleared, and the President has signed, the Airport and Airway Trust Fund Reinstatment Act of 1997, Public Law 105-2. This action changed the current level of revenues.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I am pleased to announce my support for S. 318, a bill introduced by the distinguished chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Senator D'Amato. This bill, the Homeowners Protection Act of 1997 will protect consumers across the country from paying millions of dollars in unnecessary private mortgage insurance PMI premiums. This bill corrects a serious inequity faced by many first-time, middle class homeowners, and I commend Senator D'Amato for his thoughtful approach to this problem. 
No one can argue that PMI has served a useful and admirable purpose by allowing middle class families a greater opportunity for home ownership. Traditionally, mortgage lenders expect home buyers to make a down payment of at least 20 percent. For credit-worthy borrowers who lack the cash to make such a large down payment, PMI enables them to purchase a home while protecting lenders from default until the borrower has built significant equity in the home. To that end, requiring the purchase of PMI is good policy. 
The problem arises when homeowners make several years of mortgage payments and reach the point where they have built up enough equity, usually 20 percent of the original value of the loan, to virtually eliminate the risk of default. At that point, the need for continued PMI coverage disappears and borrowers should have the right to cancel their policies. Yet, according to many reports in the newspapers and on TV, many uninformed borrowers continue to pay unnecessary premiums which can cost additional hundreds or even thousands of dollars each year. Others who have sought to cancel their coverage have faced unbelievable redtape and confusion. 
Senator D'Amato's bill will eliminate these problems and make home ownership more affordable and more attainable for all Americans. Under this bill, homeowners will have the right to cancel PMI when they have accumulated 20 percent equity in their homes, the value generally determined to be sufficient to protect lenders from default. The bill takes the reasonable step of allowing the Federal Reserve the ability to grant exceptions to this rule--either to protect consumer access to credit or to protect lenders from economic factors which may create unique default risks. The bill also will require that notice be provided to homeowners at closing and at least once a year thereafter of their right to cancel their PMI coverage once they have reached the equity threshold. 
I commend my good friend, the distinguished Senator from New York and I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this thoughtful bill. I hope that Congress will work hard this year to pass it, so that we correct this flaw in the system and provide middle class borrowers with a greater opportunity to own a home.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, and fellow Senators, I note that my good friend, Senator Reid, is on the floor. Let me say that it is with great reluctance that I say to the Social Security recipients across America that the Reid amendment threatens Social Security. Let me repeat. The Reid amendment threatens Social Security. Senator Reid and others have introduced their own version of a balanced budget amendment which would require a balanced budget in 2002 excluding the Social Security trust fund. 
It is interesting right off. The President of the United States opposes the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. One of the reasons he gives is that Social Security ought to be off budget. Everyone should know the President has been touting to all Americans that he has a balanced budget. And he said to the Republicans, `Why don't you work with me, and maybe together we can have a balanced budget by 2002?' Everybody should know that the President does that balanced budget with Social Security on budget--not off budget. He has never once ever said in a budget document that he sends up here that we ought to take Social Security off budget so we will protect Social Security. Never, never, never has he done that. 
The people on the other side of the aisle have proposed their own balanced budgets in the past, and I am going to say, since I am not sure of one those budgets, that every single one ever offered included Social Security on budget--not off budget. Isn't it interesting when the time comes that you are really going to insist that the American people are protected in the future from big Government and big deficits that now the excuse is Social Security should not be on budget. It should be off budget. 
Those same people argue that Social Security in the balanced budget effectively authorizes the raiding of the Social Security trust fund and the surpluses that are in that trust fund for purposes of balancing the budget. 
Mr. President and fellow Senators, I believe the argument that is being made, and this argument in particular and the Reid proposal in particular, is nothing more than a smokescreen. It is intended to divert public attention from the real issue--constitutionally required fiscal discipline. It provides an excuse for some who supported the balanced budget in the past to vote against it now, now that their vote really matters, for this is obviously within one or two votes at the most of leaving the Senate and going to the House, after which there is a real chance it will go to the sovereign States to see if three-fourths of them want constitutionally imposed fiscal restraint. 
Let me repeat. Now that the chips are down, that a vote is a real vote, excuses are coming forth from the walls in abundance, and the biggest excuse and risky gimmick is that we should leave the largest program of the Federal Government, into which the largest amount of American taxes are entrusted, that we should not have it on the budget. I believe the American people will ultimately see through this smokescreen because it is obviously a charade. It is not about Social Security. It is about defeating the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
It is clear to me that it is their version of a balanced budget that would lead to the so-called raiding of Social Security, while our balanced budget would protect the trust funds. Let me repeat, it is very, very interesting to note that the argument is being made that you must take Social Security off budget or you will harm Social Security when as a matter of fact from what I can tell, and I think I understand budgeting, to take it off is to put it more at risk. Let me see if I can explain why. 
Make no bones about it. The Social Security trust fund, who gets paid and how much they get paid, what is subject to the trust fund and what can they pay out of it, is not enshrined in the Constitution. It is totally, purely, Mr. President, legislation. Social Security is defined by whom? It is not defined by God. It is not in the Ten Commandments. It is written by legislators. They define it. They write into that law who can get money, what programs might be within the Social Security trust fund, and here we go. 
The Reid amendment says balance the rest of the budget but leave this very large trust fund to float hither and yon on its own, subject to what, Mr. President? Subject to what Congress wants to do with it. Senior citizens, you are being duped, if you are coming here in large numbers telling us to leave it off the budget. Leave it off the budget, for what? For what? So that Congress can do with it what it wants without regard to the budget. 
Now, I am not suggesting that any Member of the Senate has that in mind, I say to the Senator from Oklahoma. I am not suggesting that my great friend from the State of Nevada has that in mind, but I am suggesting that when you enshrine in the Constitution a balanced budget that leaves Social Security out of the budget, you then have to ask the question over time, what might 
happen to that trust fund? I submit, in the past 15 years on at least one occasion that I am aware of, believe it or not, the now bankrupt Medicare fund, a trust fund, had a surplus, I say to my friend from Oklahoma, and Social Security was hurting. So guess what we did under the leadership of the chairman of the Finance Committee, Russell Long. We borrowed money from the Medicare fund and put it in the Social Security fund. 
We made up for that later. But now what we are going to do is take Social Security and put it out there all by itself. Guess what is going to happen in the next decade. The Social Security fund has a lot of money in it. It is growing. It has a lot of surplus. And guess what. Its sister fund for hospitalization for seniors is diminishing. We are all running around saying let us keep it from bankruptcy. What if we do not keep it from bankruptcy, I say to my friend, the occupant of the Chair? What if we do not keep Medicare from bankruptcy and in 8 years it is desperately in need of money? Where do you think Congress might look to get the money? This budget that has Medicare on it will be a tough budget because it has to be in balance. So I think it will be as easy and as axiomatic as anything that goes on, like day following night, Congress will say, let us take it out of the trust fund. Then somebody will rise up and say, but what about the balanced budget? Then some will stand up and say, well, we did not put it in that balanced budget because we wanted to protect it. Then somebody will say, protect it? Let us use it. So they will borrow from it. Or in fact make the payments for Medicare out of it saying we will fix it later. 
Now, frankly, I truly believe there is a higher probability of that happening than there is the probability that when the Social Security trust fund needs the cash that its reserves represent, that we have borrowed for the Federal Government, there is a higher chance of harming it by taking money out of it than there is the chance we will not have the money when the time comes that the surpluses have to really be turned into cash available. 
Then, might I suggest, if the whole purpose of a constitutional amendment--and I do not deny the sincerity of those who propose a constitutional amendment other than ours, than the one we propose. My friend from Nevada probably really wants a constitutional balanced budget, but the truth of the matter is the purpose of that is so that you get to the point in time, fellow Senators, the point in time when you cannot borrow any more money. Right? That is the whole purpose of this constitutional amendment. It is structured in that way and there is no question about it. 
Now, I ask you to just take a look at this one chart. I will use no more than this one. You see the black dotted line. That comes down to about 2020. That is the period of time when there will be a surplus that Congress can play with and spend if they would like because it is sitting out there, and in the Reid constitutional amendment it is subject to no limitation. 
Now, if the purpose then of the balanced budget amendment that my friend, Senator Reid, introduces is to say we are not going to be borrowing more money after we get to balance, then I ask what is going to happen in 2022 when that trust fund starts going in the red and you need to borrow money if you have not fixed the program? That is the red line. If we do not fix Social Security out there in the future, the difference between that green line and that red line, that great big triangle, is the amount of money that would have to be borrowed if we do not fix Social Security. 
Now, let us assume that it is sitting out there in 2024. That is not farfetched because the constitutional amendment is supposedly forever, right, for 100, 200 years. Now, here we are. The whole purpose of the Reid constitutional amendment is to put us in the position where you cannot borrow any money after you are in balance. 
I ask the Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] what happens when Congress says, well, we need $650 million for Social Security; it is going in the red? So somebody proposes, why, America has a great, strong economy. Let us borrow the money. Right?

Mr. DOMENICI. What will there be in the constitutional amendment, if the Reid amendment became law, that says we cannot borrow that money? Nothing, Senator Nickles. It can be borrowed. So we have kind of a charade going. You write a constitutional amendment that says when you finally get to balance you cannot borrow any more money, right? But that is only on that budget. On this other budget that is floating over here, there is no limitation on borrowing. I ask, if you are trying to protect the American economy and future generations from borrowed money, is there any difference between the borrowed money that might go into the first budget as compared with borrowed money that might go into the Social Security fund? I think not. I think both have the same negative effect on the future of our children and the growth and prosperity of the Nation. 
So, if we want to stop at $5 trillion in deficits, when we finally get to balance under the Hatch constitutional amendment, we are saying we should not borrow any more money. But if the Reid amendment becomes law, we are not saying that. We are saying, for Social Security purposes you can borrow as much as you want. If that isn't a sorry state of affairs, after we have adopted a constitutional amendment if we were to adopt the Reid constitutional amendment, then I have not seen one; a situation which is more dissimilar after the fact than this. For after the fact there is no limitation on borrowing money. 
Having said that, I choose, today, not to take up the second part of my comments other than to say we are struggling here today--have I used all my time?

Mr. DOMENICI. We are struggling today to see if we can make a deal with the President of the United States. We are trying to get a balanced budget by the year 2002. It is hard to do. The President struggled, he said, with putting one together and said how hard it was. We are now looking at how we would do it and we say the President's is not a very good budget, but still we have to get there. 
If, in fact, we got a constitutional amendment like the one my friend from Nevada offers, it says you will be balanced in 2002 without Social Security surpluses being counted. I will just tell you what the President would have to add to his budget in order to be in balance under that definition by 2002: $75 billion more in Medicare cuts. We are having trouble, arguing between $120 billion in savings and $160 billion in savings. But you would have to add $75 billion to the President's. Mr. President, $35 billion more in Medicaid; $28 billion more in civil service, military retirement, and other mandatories, and $158 billion more in education, environment, law enforcement and discretionary spending. Mr. President and fellow Senators, we all know that cannot happen. I mean, we cannot even settle on a balanced budget using the unified budget. It is difficult to get done. 
So I must submit, in all deference and with as much respect as possible, that the Reid amendment is not intended to become the law of the land. It is not intended to become the constitutional 
amendment that goes to our sovereign States for ratification. For, if it was, it would have no chance of being ratified, for who would support it under the circumstances I have described? 
I thank the Senate and thank Senator Hatch for yielding and I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I first say that it is a pleasure to address this issue with the senior Senator from the State of Washington in the chair. I don't know that what the Senator from New Mexico is going to speak to today is needed to edify the occupant of the chair, but I think it is imperative that, after an awful lot of talk about a constitutional balanced budget and its potential effect on the Social Security trust fund, that some of us state what we think this whole scare about the Social Security trust fund is all about. 
So let me first say to the senior citizens that I gather now that you know the emotional ramping up by frightening senior citizens is beginning to take place out there in our States and communities. Let me, to the extent that I can, say to the seniors who are listening to those who would like to make you believe that they are really here arguing to save Social Security, suggest to you that what they are really arguing about is that they don't want a constitutional amendment to balance the budget and they have now hit on what I perceive to be a risky gimmick in an effort to frighten seniors and by that approach defeat a constitutional balanced budget amendment. 
I might say to the seniors of this country, it is now the almost universal consensus of those who look at the next 25 years that the most important thing for senior citizens and the best effect on the trust fund is that this economy grow and grow and grow and that we have low inflation and sustained economic growth. Those who have worked for decades, looking at what is going to happen to Social Security and putting into that all of the mix that goes into it to see what they can project, without exception they testify here and everywhere, do not forget that you must have a sustained and growing economy for these numbers to be believable about the validity of this trust fund in the future. 
Having said that, it would appear that balancing the American budget and keeping it balanced is probably in and of itself the single most important factor--not the only factor, but the single most important factor--to productivity, growth, and prosperity when you already have a $5 trillion accumulated series of deficits which now equal the debt. 
So let nobody be fooled, for those who want to inject Social Security and are trying to take it off the budget of the United States, the risk is we will never get a balanced budget. It is my honest opinion that it was not an overstatement of the case when 29 budgets were piled up here. In fact, I didn't have time to ask somebody, but how many times in those 29 budgets can Presidents say, `I am giving you a balanced budget?' How many times after they were presented did Congresses of the United States say, `Oh, we are going to do better, we are giving you a balanced budget"? It never happened. And it will not happen. In fact, we are all dedicated to getting it balanced by 2002. But I am suggesting, as one who is as dedicated to that mission as anyone here, that you are far more apt to get it and keep it with the organic law of this land saying that is the way it is going to be, it is the law of the land. 
Having said that, let me see if I can convince senior citizens and those in this body who are worried about the issue of should you have Social Security on budget or off budget. 
First, just from the standpoint of a budget, you know Social Security is now the largest program in America. The tax for it is the largest single tax on America and Americans of all the entourage and litany of taxes we have. Literally 55 to 60 percent of the public pay more in Social Security and Medicare taxes, I say to my friend occupying the chair, pay more in that tax than they pay in income taxes. 
Just from the standpoint of a budget, doesn't it seem kind of strange that you would say Americans should have a budget and it should be balanced, but, oh, let us take all of that big program that I have just described and all of those taxes and let us just take them off the budget? 
So it is rather ironic that we speak of budgets and leave all of that which is so important to our future, so important to our young people who have jobs--because the taxes there must be compared with what? With the taxes that the rest of society imposes on us. You cannot leave those taxes and those payments out there untouched, unrelated as if they have nothing to do with the corporate income tax and the individual income tax and the State taxes. They are all related, and they should all be part of our budget as we look at it. 
Now, I am not sufficiently versed in economics, but I have learned something because New Mexicans have sent me here long enough that, if nothing else, by osmosis I learn something about it because I sit there with my colleagues most of the time and they talk and I listen. Frankly, the United States made a decision that to be real about its budget, you ought to use a unified budget. We decided that more than two decades ago. And it serves us very well in trying to look at the effect of taxes and expenditures on the American economy and our people. 
Therefore, point No. 1. For those who are talking about gimmicks to frighten us into not passing the constitutional amendment, the first thing that is happening that is very, very dangerous is they are denying senior citizens the most significant tool to assure the success of Social Security. 
Now, a second point. 
Since Social Security is on budget now and it has a surplus now and the surplus will go away at some point in the future and we will be starting to spend that, there are some now who are saying to seniors we better take it off budget so they cannot spend it. Get it. Take it off budget so they cannot spend it. Take it off budget so you cannot borrow from it. 
Listen for a minute. You take the Social Security trust fund. It is defined by statute law. It is not going to be in the Constitution. Who defines statute law? Who defines statute law? Congress. Congress defines statute law. So you take off a huge amount of money and a huge amount of taxes and you say it is no longer in this budget because we do not want anybody to spend it or borrow it. 
Friends, in particular senior citizens, do you believe your trust fund is protected by being out there all alone, running up huge surpluses, subject to whom? Who can spend it? Who can spend that surplus? Oh, the same Congress that has been creating all these deficits. 
You mean they cannot spend it? somebody is going to stand up and ask. Of course, they can. All they have to do is pass a statute and spend that surplus. On what? On what? Right now you have to invest it in Treasury bills of the United States. But I say to our friend from Michigan, over the next 20 years as that surplus is there and as Congress feels the pinch of not having money to spend over here and perhaps a Medicare system that is really hurting; 6 years from now we have not helped it very much, or 8, and it is hurting for money to pay the bills, what do you think is going to happen? Congress is going to say, well, it is all seniors, right? Let us spend $48 billion for what we need for the next 6 months for Medicare. Let us take it out of the trust fund.

Mr. DOMENICI. My friend, it is the biggest potential gimmick I have ever seen. And let me tell you, if there are those who say this cannot happen, I will give you one. The President in this year's budget decided that another trust fund, the Medicare trust fund--in this case it was running out of money, but the President decided I am going to tell Congress to just take out $82 billion of the expenditures that are in that trust fund, right, by fiat, by law. Who is going to do that? Congress is going to pass a law, he says, take out the $82 billion and let somebody else pay for it. 
Now, if you can do that, you can take a trust fund that is very solvent and do the exact same thing. A President says, well, look, it is going to take us 5 more years to fix this Medicare mess so why not just borrow from that trust fund. It is sitting out there. It is all alone, right, and we do not want to count it over here on our budget because we thought it was really going to be protected if we took it out there, and lo and behold, that budget could have that very same thing in it. That is the real kind of gimmick that is going to be used.

Mr. DOMENICI. I think that is right. 
I might also say to the Senator I am going to give myself enough latitude so that I know I am right, but I think that same balanced budget to which the Senator alludes, if carried out and all of the changes made in it and projected it out beyond that time, would be balanced 3 years, no longer than 3 years thereafter without using the Social Security trust fund. 
So what I am saying, you put yourself on a trend line by entitlement reform to where you cannot get to balance without the Social Security trust fund in the process of accomplishing your major goal of getting it balanced within the unified budget with everything on budget.

Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct. In fact, I did not bring to the floor a chart showing that, but it is one of the wonderful, factual presentations about how, after a few years, what they have been talking about down here, about `the Social Security fund ought to be off budget so we can handle our matters within the rest of the budget and how we can protect its solvency,' it turns out that down the line a little--and if we do a constitutional amendment, it is going to be down the line for a long time, it should be here forever--when the Social Security fund starts to spend out and go in the red, guess what we can do? We can let it go right on in the red and spend. But over here on the rest of the budget, which we call the unified budget less Social Security, you can spend so much money in that budget and still be in balance because you are not charged with the deficit in Social Security. It is billions, about 18 or 20 years from now. You are going to be able to spend on this unified budget, less Social Security, something like $7 trillion more than you are currently expecting to spend, and be in balance, because you let this other big deficit occur and you do not do anything about it. 
I want to add one thing. You could have asked me, `Senator, when you have this trust fund sitting out here all by itself and it starts to go in the red, because we did not have the guts to fix it, and over here is the rest of this budget, it has been kind of wallowing around, now, Congress gets together and says, `How do we fix that Social Security?' Guess what, they can borrow money without being subject to the constitutional amendment and put it in that trust fund. They could borrow $5 trillion. And guess what we would be doing? We would be getting ourselves right back in the mess of borrowing to pay deficits.

Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct. And, frankly, I have to say, in all honesty--I had a group of seniors I talked to today. They said to me, `You may be right, and you may be more right than them.' But then they said, `Can't Congress, if you take it off budget, can't you just pass a law so none of these terrible things will happen to this wonderful trust fund?" 
And I said, `By asking me if we could pass a law, you have just answered your own question. Of course we could.' But Congress makes the laws and Congress changes the laws. Consequently, we could protect it by statute and then, when it got in trouble, we could unprotect it by statute. But if you insist that it be counted in the unified budget, then what you are saying is when money is spent out of it, it counts. And you have to find, within a budget, some cuts to make up for it. And that is especially the case when Social Security starts to go in the red, if it does, and probably at some period in its history it will for awhile.

Mr. DOMENICI. So I want to wrap up my few minutes. I thank the Senator for his questions which made my presentation far more understandable than had I gone on rambling for 15 minutes. 
But essentially the truth of the matter is, if the risky gimmick being offered by some defeats the constitutional amendment, that will inure to the detriment of senior citizens, for we will probably never have a sustained and long-term balanced budget, and that is what Social Security needs more than anything else. 
Second, the risky gimmick is to take it off budget and subject the entire trust fund to the will and whim of Congress and Presidents, without any of the discipline that would come from the spending and borrowing that you must account for within a unified budget.

Mr. DOMENICI. I might say to the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, I did not hear your entire argument with reference to estimates, but I would suggest that in due course--I have difficulty getting time on this floor because when there is time I cannot be here and then when I get here, eminent Senators are using all the time. I am not complaining. 
But I would like tomorrow to explain a bit about estimating. I would just suggest that we need not use the estimating that has taken place to produce that chart. There is another way to estimate it. You can estimate right up close to the end of the period of time, and you get estimates that are pretty close. 
I would also suggest that whether it is red or whether it is black----

Mr. DOMENICI. Half that red and half that black is not estimates at all. Half or more is based upon programs that cost more than you estimate. Frankly, that has nothing to do with economic estimates. It has to do with us not doing a good enough job figuring what programs are going to cost. That could be fixed. In fact, we are doing much better at it already in terms of that. 
But my last observation has to do with a thought you had as you captured the notion that this would make this budget so unreliable that you called it all a gimmick. 
Frankly, I want to make sure that everybody knows that the best use of the word gimmick for anything going on on this floor has to do with the gimmick that some on that side of the aisle are using when they speak of taking Social Security off budget so you will assure Social Security's solvency and the checks. That is a gimmick of the highest order. For you do that, and there is no assurance that Congress will not spend the trust fund surpluses for anything they want. It is no longer subject to any budget discipline. It is out there all by itself. 
Second, there is no assurance that programs for senior citizens that are not Social Security would not be moved there, and that that trust fund becomes more vulnerable then when it is subject to the discipline of the give-and-take of a budget. And on that I am certain. 
And last, some Senators today got up and said that the Congressional Research Service had given them all they needed because it had apparently said that you risked Social Security in the outyears. Well, that did not sound right to any of us. We called them up and they have issued a correction. It could not conceivably be what they said and what was implied from it. They are now saying--and I quote: 
We are not concluding that the Trust Funds surpluses could not be drawn down to pay beneficiaries. The [balanced budget amendment] would not require that result. 
So it does not stand for the proposition that was used. They made a mistake in the translation, in the way they interpreted and we can debate that a little tomorrow. But I just thought we ought to make sure that we understood that. 
Now, I know that my friend from West Virginia is a proponent of the Constitution. And when you speak of amending it, he stands on it. But let us face it, you cannot stand on it when you are talking about amending it. Because that would have meant none of the amendments that were added to it would be there. You would have held up the old Constitution when it was first drawn with no amendments and said, I stand on it.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise just to say a few words in behalf of my good friend, the U.S. Representative from the State of New Mexico, Bill Richardson. I think I would have been remiss if I did not come to the floor today and say to soon-to-be Ambassador Richardson in behalf of New Mexicans, we wish you the very best good fortune. We know that whatever you have tried, you have succeeded at it in your life. And now, through that achievement and because New Mexicans have sent you to the U.S. House in numerous elections and for a number of years, we all think you are ready for a much bigger role and a much bigger mission in behalf of our country. 
Most of us who know you, and most New Mexicans who have observed you, are confident you are going to do a splendid job in behalf of our country. The fact that you came from a State that has multiple cultures, that clearly accepts the diversity that no other State in the Union has like ours, bodes well for your work with people from all over the world. 
While I could stand here and speak for a long time in your behalf, it is not necessary today because you are clearly going to be confirmed and your name is going to be sent to the President as the next Ambassador to the United Nations. But I believe I will close with just a couple of words in Spanish. Buena suerte, Bill. That's the simplest way of saying good luck and good fortune in Spanish. I have been privileged to work with you. I hope you will continue to work with those of us in the U.S. Senate and House who are interested in the United Nations succeeding. We think you have a big mission. We hope you can establish some inroads, in terms of the United Nations being a more effective and efficient body, so that the United States can truly continue to support its efforts and your efforts in behalf of our country. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the confirmation of Administrator Rodney Slater to be the next Secretary of Transportation for this great Nation. 
With 1 of every 10 workers and over $700 billion dollars being devoted annually to transportation products and services, we certainly need a person of Mr. Slater's caliber. 
Transportation touches the lives of each and every American citizen on a daily basis; and while we can be proud of our railways, interstate, highways, and airport systems, there are still significant challenges which lie ahead. 
Mr. President, both personal and business travel are at all time highs and the concern for safety is shared by all Americans. 
We are continually facing the problems of congestion and pollution in metropolitan areas while attempting to meet the demand for increased mobility. 
And, in New Mexico, like many other rural States, we are witnessing a demographic shift which is placing a strain on our current regional transportation systems. 
In addition, there are still the growing demands for speed and efficiency in the transportation of goods. With the emergence of just-in-time manufacturing, transportation authorities must continue to research transportation innovations and utilize new technologies which will help preserve time and money. 
Mr. President, I believe Mr. Slater's creativity and fresh thinking will be an asset to the President as we begin to face these issues and look towards the future of transportation in America. And that future begins with the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA]. 
I believe we must build upon the priorities set forth in this important legislation while continuing to provide the necessary funding to ensure the strongest transportation infrastructure possible. 
ISTEA's reauthorization must be based upon principles that will sustain a strong globally-competitive economy and ensure the mobility and safety of our people. 
I believe Mr. Slater recognizes the challenges ahead of him as Secretary of Transportation and I am truly encouraged by his commitment. 
Administrator Slater's history is clearly is one of hard work and dedication. He served as assistant attorney general for the State of Arkansas and later worked as an assistant to the Governor on economic and community programs. 
Administrator Slater began his focus on transportation by serving as the chairman of the Arkansas State Highway Commission. 
And I believe in this era of new federalism, his experience in running a state highway agency will be an excellent background as we look to provide State governments with enough flexibility to produce local answers to transportation issues. 
In addition, Administrator Slater served as a member of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials' Executive Committee of Commissions and Boards and is currently serving as the first African-American to head the Federal Highway Administration where he worked as an effective leader in escorting the National Highway System legislation through Congress. 
In speaking with Administrator Slater on many occasions, I have always been impressed with his desire to participate in open discussions with one priority in mind--and that is to reach a solution which is best for the American people. 
In fact, as Federal Highway Administrator, Mr. Slater personally traveled from coast to coast as part of an outreach program which he initiated. 
From Buffalo, NY to Laredo, TX and from San Francisco, CA to our Nation's Capital--Administrator Slater sat down with real people to discuss their thoughts and concerns about our Nation's highways and interstates. 
I believe Administrator Slater, in his new capacity as Secretary of Transportation, will continue to provide all Americans with a transportation network that will be second to none. 
And it is in my judgment that Administrator Slater has first hand knowledge as to what the future needs are for this Nation's transportation infrastructure. 
I commend President Clinton for his nomination, and shall cast my vote for his confirmation with confidence and wish him the best as he begins to face the transportation challenges of this great Nation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my fellow Senators, I happened to be on `Meet the Press' on Sunday. I couldn't put all 29 unbalanced budgets there, but I put a couple. Frankly, I described this episode in American history as 29 years of engagement where we have been engaged with the American people 
and to the American people on a balanced budget, and, as I put it, the time has come to get married, to tie the knot. The engagement has been too long, 29 years. 
My second point is, for those who are listening and frequently see some of us speak to these issues on the floor, before you believe the statements coming from those who oppose this constitutional amendment that by taking it off budget you make it more secure and more safe, just be patient. Some of us will convince you that by taking it off budget, you put the Social Security trust fund at risk and pensions for the future at risk, because they will be subject to exclusively the will of a Congress. 
That is all you need to worry about is to put a trust fund out there that has money and let Congress have ahold of it and no balanced budget requirement. You can just imagine what we are going to be able to show seniors what is going to happen to that fund if you take it off budget. 
I thank the Senator.

<TEXT>
Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Ford and 23 other Senators, I rise to introduce the Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations Act, a bill to convert the budget and appropriations process to a 2-year cycle and to enhance oversight of Federal programs. 
One of the greatest challenges facing the 105th Congress and President Clinton is to balance the Federal budget by 2002 and maintain balance through the next century when we will need to confront the very serious fiscal problems associated with an aging America. Balancing the Federal budget will require long-term planning, tough choices, and steadfast effort. These decisions should not be made, indeed I contend cannot be made, using the current fractionated annual budget process. 
Congress should now act to streamline the system by moving to a 2-year, or biennial, budget process. This is the most important reform we can enact to streamline the budget process, to make the Congress a more deliberative and effective institution, and to make us more accountable to the American people. 
Mr. President, moving to a biennial budget and appropriations process enjoys very broad support. President Clinton has proposed this reform. Presidents Reagan and Bush also proposed a biennial appropriations and budget cycle. Leon Panetta, who has served as White House Chief of Staff, OMB Director, and House Budget Committee chairman, has advocated a biennial budget since the late 1970's. Former OMB and CBO Director Alice Rivlin has been arguing for a biennial budget for almost two decades. Other supporters include Senators Lott, Ford, Roth, Thompson, and Glenn. Last year, 42 Senators wrote our two Senate leaders calling for quick action to pass legislation to convert the budget and appropriations process to a 2-year cycle. 
The most recent comprehensive studies of the Federal Government and the Congress have recommended this reform. The Vice President's National Performance Review and the Joint Committee on the Reorganization of Congress both recommended a biennial appropriations and budget cycle. 
A biennial budget will dramatically improve the current budget process. The current annual budget process is redundant, inefficient, and destined for failure each year. The current process to develop, legislate, and implement the annual budget consumes 3 years: 1 year for the administration to prepare the President's budget, another year for the Congress to put the budget into law, and the final year to actually execute the budget. 
Today, I want to focus just on the congressional budget process, the process of annually passing a budget resolution, authorization legislation, and 13 appropriation bills. The record clearly demonstrates the serious shortcomings of this process: 
We have met the statutory deadline to complete a budget resolution only 3 times since 1974. In 1995, we broke the Senate record for the most rollcall votes cast in a day on a budget reconciliation bill. 
The Congressional Budget Office just released its report on unauthorized appropriations. For fiscal year 1997, 121 laws authorizing appropriations have expired. These laws cover over one-third, or $89.6 billion, of appropriations for nondefense programs. Another 52 laws authorizing non-defense appropriations will expire at the end of fiscal year 1997, representing $31 billion more in unauthorized nondefense programs. 
Since 1950 Congress has only twice met the fiscal year deadline for completion of all 13 individual appropriations bills to fully fund the Government. 
While we have made a number of improvements in the budget process, the current annual process is redundant and inefficient. The Senate has the same debate, amendments, and votes on the same issue three or four times a year--once on the budget resolution, again on the authorization bill, and finally on the appropriations bill. 
I recently asked the Congressional Research Service [CRS] to update and expand upon an analysis of the amount of time we spend on the budget. CRS looked at all votes on appropriations, revenue, reconciliation, and debt limit measures as well as budget resolutions. CRS then examined any other vote dealing with budgetary levels, Budget Act waivers, or votes pertaining to the budget process. For 1996, CRS found that the Senate devoted 73 percent of its time to the budget. 
If we cannot adequately focus on our duties because we are constantly debating the budget in the authorization, budget, and appropriations process, just imagine how confused the American public is about what we are doing. The result is that the public does not understand what we are doing and it breeds cynicism about our Government. 
Under the legislation I am introducing today, the President would submit a 2-year budget and Congress would consider a 2-year budget resolution and 13 2-year appropriation bills during the first session of a Congress. The second session of the Congress would be devoted to consideration of authorization bills and for oversight of Government agencies. 
Most of the arguments against a biennial budget process will come from those who claim we cannot predict or plan on a 2 year basis. For two-thirds of the budget, we do not actually budget on an annual basis. Our entitlement and revenue laws are under permanent law and Congress does not change these laws on an annual basis. The only component of the budget that is set in law annually are the appropriated, or discretionary accounts. 
Mr. President, the most predictable category of the budget are these appropriated, or discretionary, accounts of the Federal Government. I recently asked CBO to update an analysis 
of discretionary spending to determine those programs that had unpredictable or volatile funding needs. CBO found that only 4 percent of total discretionary funding fell into this category. Most of this spending is associated with international activities or emergencies. Because most of this funding cannot be predicted on an annual basis, a biennial budget is no more deficient than the current annual process. My bill will continue to allow supplemental appropriations necessary to meet these emergency and unanticipated requirements. 
This legislation also will enhance oversight of Federal programs and activities. Frankly, the limited oversight we are now doing is not as good as it should be. We have a total of 34 House and Senate standing authorizing committees and these committees are increasingly crowded out of the legislative process. Under a biennial budget, the second year of the biennium will be devoted to examining Federal programs and developing authorization legislation. The calendar will be free of the budget and appropriations process, giving these committees the time and opportunity to fully review and legislate changes to Federal programs. 
We also build on the oversight process by incorporating the new requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 [GPRA] into the biennial budget process. The primary objective of this law is to force the Federal Government to produce budgets focused on outcomes, not just dollars spent. When the goal is to balance the budget, decisions must be made based on performance. 
More specifically, GPRA requires agencies to develop strategic plans, performance plans, and performance goals. GPRA requires agencies to report on their actual performance in relation to these goals. Finally, GPRA requires the President to incorporate these performance plans into the President's budget submission to Congress. 
At the beginning of each even-numbered year, this new biennial bill requires Federal agencies to submit their preliminary performance plans and any proposed legislation that will enhance the performance of Federal programs to authorizing committees. During these even-numbered years, the authorizing committees will review these performance plans and actual performance and develop authorization legislation geared to enhancing the performance of the Federal Government. 
Mr. President, a biennial budget is not a panacea for all our budget woes. A biennial budget cannot make the difficult decisions that must be made in budgeting, but it can provide the tools necessary to make much better decisions. By moving to a biennial budget cycle, we can budget more effectively, strengthen oversight and watchdog functions, improve the efficiency of Government agencies, and work to balance the budget in an intelligent, fair, and deliberative manner. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Washington Post article, a description of the bill, and a section-by-section analysis of the bill be made a part of the Record.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the confirmation of Mr. William Daley as the next Secretary of Commerce. 
I am glad to learn that Mr. Daley recognizes the need to streamline the Commerce Department and that he is willing to perform a top to bottom review of its agencies and programs to ensure productivity and efficiency. In addition, I am hopeful that Mr. Daley will address the numerous concerns which have hampered this Department's effectiveness in the recent past and that he will strive to restore the Department's good reputation. 
As we enter into the 21st century, America must make new strides to ensure its strong standing in the ever growing global economy. We must continue to further our ties with foreign nations and businesses so that our economy will continue to be the engine that drives the world's prosperity. 
Although our economy continues to grow yearly, I believe we should be concerned with how slow that rate of growth has been. Small businesses are the backbone of our national economy and I am hopeful that Mr. Daley will focus more attention on promoting the role of small business in foreign trade. With only 12 percent of our small businesses participating in foreign markets, I believe we have to focus more attention and resources to promoting their interests worldwide. 
As it did with NAFTA and GATT, we need the Commerce Department to continue to open new markets. Additionally, the Department of Commerce must ensure that our trade partners comply with the promises set forth in all such agreements. As competition around the world becomes stronger by the day, the Department of Commerce, under its new Secretary, must strive to guarantee a level playing field to ensure the economic future of the American people. 
With nearly one-fourth of our gross domestic product resulting from exports and with more than 11 million workers owing their jobs to their employer's overseas business, Mr. Daley's work as Secretary of Commerce will be felt nationwide. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe Andrew M. Cuomo has the potential to be our Nation's finest Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. I am impressed with his understanding of our Nation's budget situation, and I am equally impressed with his commitment to meeting the housing challenges of needy Americans. 
Andrew Cuomo impressed the Senate Banking Committee with his understanding of the section 8 crisis that is upon us. Section 8 is the program by which HUD provides landlords with the necessary subsidies to allow them to rent their property to low-income Americans. A typical section 8 HUD payment will make up the difference between the actual market rent and the ability of the renter to pay. Thus, landlords continue to provide private housing stock to needy Americans. Because many of the 20-year contracts for section 8 housing are expiring, new Federal commitments of $16.4 billion are needed by the year 2002. Continuing this basic HUD program will require careful balancing to avoid crowding out other needed housing and community development programs. 
I have personally worked with Mr. Cuomo in his valiant efforts to increase funding for housing the homeless while streamlining the many HUD homeless programs. Together, and with the able guidance of the Senate Banking Committee chairman, Senator D'Amato, we have consolidated them into fewer grants with greater and more reliable impact on the very tough problems of homeless Americans. 
A little known HUD section 811 program for the disabled has come a long way under Mr. Cuomo's direction. HUD makes better housing available for the mentally ill and mentally retarded at reasonable costs, so that a handicapped person living on supplemental security income and Medicaid can afford to try more independent living. More group homes have been started to give these disabled Americans a fighting chance at independent living. I am confident that Secretary Cuomo will not abandon the mentally ill or the homeless when he makes his hard budget choices in the next few critical years. 
Andrew Cuomo is the founder of the largest provider of homeless services in the Nation. He did this in his native State of New York. There he learned first hand the true value of federal housing assistance as well as its limitations and frustrations. Now he will lead the nation's efforts to help others like himself do the best possible for those most in need of temporary and permanent housing. 
Before he left his widely respected HELP nonprofit in New York, Andrew Cuomo had built an organization with 350 employees, a $25 million budget, and more then $120 million worth of needed and affordable housing. While serving as HUD Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, Andrew Cuomo got the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community Programs up and running after a stiff national competition to select participating towns and cities in urban and rural America. 
Under his leadership, the fledgling HOME affordable housing program increased its achievements from less than 2,000 units of affordable housing to over 110,000 units across America. Andrew Cuomo created the HUD Economic Development Initiative, now seen by mayors as their most flexible economic development tool for revitalizing poor communities through a unique combination of HUD resources. 
As he said in his confirmation hearing, HUD can be a vital partner with State and local government by being `smarter, smaller, and better.' He has a keen eye for the projects that can attract private sector support. He understands the support HUD can give these projects in revitalization efforts in our inner cities and in rural towns. 
I was very impressed with his observation that `the pride and dignity of having a job and earning one's own bread is the best social services program that exists.' 
Mr. President and Senate colleagues, I highly recommend Andrew M. Cuomo for the important job of Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. I urge you to vote in favor of his confirmation today. If you vote to confirm Mr. Cuomo, you will be doing a great service to the millions of Americans whose lives will be touched by his active and creative leadership.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that I believe will finally start us down the long neglected road of developing a coherent, integrated, and coordinated national drought policy. I offer this legislation, Mr. President, in the wake of one of the most devastating droughts the southwestern United States has seen in a century, a drought for which there was simply no preparation at either Federal, State, or local levels. 
Mr. President, some people do not consider a drought to be a disaster, but if live in a drought, and live through a drought, it is just as much a disaster as a tornado or an earthquake. It causes just as much devastation. 
The problem is it kind of creeps up. And in the flow of its destructive force are many ruined lives, many lost businesses, many people who cannot make the mortgages on their farms and homes. It is time we have some coordinated effort to address these disasters. This legislation seeks to get that done. 
Before I talk about the particulars of my bill, however, I would like to spend a few minutes describing to my colleagues just how devastating a serious drought disaster can be. Unfortunately, my State of New Mexico can be used as a prime example of this devastation. 
Mr. President, water is everything in New Mexico. Ours is an arid State, and the rain and snowfall we receive in the spring and winter is literally a matter of life and death to our cities, towns, businesses, and environment. In 1995-96, however, precipitation levels were the lowest the had been in the 100 years that the State has been keeping such records. The results were nothing less than disastrous. 
For example, the drought decimated the State's agricultural community. Every single county in the State received disaster declarations from the USDA. Farmers in the southern part of the State were forced to go to water wells, depleting an already-taxed aquifer. And, in northeastern New Mexico, winter wheat crops failed for the first time in anyone's memory. 
The drought also destroyed forage for livestock producers, causing an industry already hit hard by high feed prices to hurt even more. In all, it was estimated that ranchers lost up to 85 percent of their capital. 
The drought had a catastrophic impact on New Mexico's forests. The Dome, Hondo, and Chino Wells fires were all sparked by the incredibly dry conditions brought on by the drought, and were exacerbated by the lack of water needed to extinguished them. In all, there were over 1,200 fires in New Mexico last year burning over 140,000 acres of land and wiping out dozens of homes and businesses. 
The drought also caused municipal water systems to be taxed to the hilt, forcing many cities and towns to consider drastically raised water rates for their citizens. And the drought meant that critical stretches of the Rio Grande River were almost completely dry, which in turn meant vastly reduced amounts of water for wildlife such as the endangered silvery minnow. 
And New Mexico's problems were those of just one State: the 1995-96 drought devastated the entire southwestern region. Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and Kansas were all severely impacted by the drought. Small businessmen, farmers, and ranchers all across the area were wiped out. Oklahoma experienced almost $500 million in agricultural losses alone. Texas's agricultural losses exceeded $2 billion, while its overall statewide losses were over $5 billion. And in the southwest as a whole, almost 3 million acres of land were engulfed by fire, an amount almost three times the 5-year acreage. 
In short, Mr. President, this drought was a killer. We in the Southwest were fortunate that this year is proving to be a much better year for precipitation than the last. But we do not know what the next year will bring. There could be yet another drought, again sending towns scrambling to drill new water wells, sweeping fire across bone-dry forests, and forcing farmers and ranchers to watch their way of life being wiped out. 
But I do not want to give the impression that severe droughts are solely the curse of the Southwest. Every region in the United States can be hit by these catastrophes. In 1976-77, a short but intense drought struck the Pacific Northwest, requiring the construction of numerous dams and reservoirs to secure millions of additional acre feet of needed water. The 1988 Midwest drought caused over $5 billion in losses. And the infamous 7-year drought of 1986-93 experienced by California, the Pacific Northwest, and the Great Basin States caused extensive damage to water systems, water quality, fish and wildlife, and recreational activities. 
And yet, even though they are so pervasive, and even though they so seriously impact the economic and environmental well-being of the entire Nation, we in New Mexico have learned from hard experience that the United States is poorly prepared to deal with serious drought emergencies. As a result of the hardships being suffered in every part of my state last year, I convened a special Multi-State Drought Task Force of Federal, State, local, and tribal emergency management agencies to coordinate efforts to respond to the drought. The task force was ably headed up by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and included every Federal agency that has programs designed to deal with drought. 
Unfortunately, what the task force found was that although the Federal Government has numerous drought related programs on the books, there simply is no integrated, coordinated system of implementing those programs. For example, while most of the Federal drought programs require a person to apply proactively for relief under them, there was almost a total lack of knowledge about those programs on the part of the victims they were designed to help. Worse yet, the programs that are in place are fragmented and ad hoc, and stop well short of comprehensively helping people prepare for or respond to drought. Consequently, at first drought victims in this Nation do not know who to turn to for help, and then find that the help that is available is too late and totally inadequate. 
These fundamental problems were specifically identified by the Multi-State Drought Task Force in its final report on the drought of 1995-96. The task force stated that `[t]he States are left are left to navigate the ocean of applicable assistance programs as best they can.' The task force went on to observe:  
The Federal government does not have a national drought policy, national climatic monitoring system, nor an institutionalized organizational structure to address drought. Therefore, every time a drought occurs the Federal government is behind the power curve playing catch up in an ad hoc fashion to meet the needs of the impacted states and their citizens. 
The Western Governors' Association recognized the exact same problems in its 1996 Drought Response Action Plan. The WGA stated that `[t[he absence of a lead agency to handle drought--in addition to the lack of Federal interagency coordination--has significantly reduced the Federal Government's ability to provide adequate support over the long term.' 
Indeed, the Multi-State Drought Task Force recommended that `Congress in coordination with the administration develop and adopt a National Drought Policy to include a national drought monitory system and an institutionalized organizational structure with a designated lead Federal agency to direct and coordinate the efforts of the Federal Government in preparing for, responding to, and recovering from drought, as well as mitigating the impacts of drought.' 
Similarly, the Western Governors' Association recommends `[d]evelop[ing] a national drought policy or framework that integrates actions and responsibilities among all levels of government (Federal, State, regional, and local). This policy should plainly spell out preparedness, response, and mitigation measures to be provided by each entity.' And it is my understanding that the National Governors' Association is considering adopting a similar recommendation sponsored by Governor Johnson of New Mexico. 
All of this, Mr. President, has led me to introduce today's legislation. I believe that my bill will be the first step toward finally establishing a coherent, effective national drought policy. My bill creates a commission comprised of representatives of those Federal, State, local, and tribal agencies and organizations which are most involved with drought issues. On the Federal side, the Commission will include representatives from USDA, Interior, the Army, FEMA, SBA, and Commerce--agencies which all currently have drought-related programs on the books. Equally important will be the nonfederal members, including representatives from the National Governors' Association, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and four persons representative of those groups that are always hardest hit by drought emergencies. 
The Commission will be charged with determining what needs exists on the Federal, State, local, and tribal levels with regard to drought; with reviewing existing Federal, State, local, and tribal drought programs; and with determining what gaps exist between the needs of drought victims and those programs currently designed to deal with drought. 
More importantly, the Commission will then be charged with making recommendations on how Federal drought laws and programs can be better integrated into a comprehensive national policy to mitigate the impacts of, and respond to, serious drought emergencies. Should Federal drought programs be consolidated under one single existing agency? How can the Nation be better prepared for these disasters? Should emergency loan programs that stand the risk of sinking drought victims deeper into debt be reevaluated? These are just some of the questions that we in Congress need guidance on if we are to move to the next level in developing a national drought strategy. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, my legislation is just the first step in addressing the major national problem of drought disasters, but it is a step that must be taken quickly. Drought can strike any State, at any time, for any duration. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to wholeheartedly support the nomination of former Senator Bill Cohen to be Secretary of Defense. Senator Cohen will be taking on a great responsibility in carrying out his duties as Secretary of Defense. When confirmed, he will be providing the President with essential advice about planning for the defense of our Nation and in making sure that America's finest men and women have all of the assets they require to carry out their mission. I am pleased that the President has chosen Senator Cohen for this position. The vast experience and knowledge he gained as a distinguished member of the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, and this body, will serve the President and the Nation well. He is highly qualified for this important position. 
I have worked with Senator Cohen on many issues and have always found him to be knowledgeable, thoughtful, and a constructive consensus builder. He has demonstrated an ability to think issues through carefully and thoroughly. His record on critical defense matters during his tenure in the Senate speaks for itself. He has demonstrated that he is able to analyze the critical issues and make decisions based upon what his conscience tells him is that right thing to do for the country. 
During this time of severe budget constraints I know that he will be able to help the President align budgets with priorities. Fundamental questions will have to be answered as we prepare our military for the future wars they will have to fight. The world is still a dangerous place. The recent missions the Department has undertaken are proof of that fact. As we move into the 21st century, and as the United States becomes more involved in crisis spots around the world, Senator Cohen's challenge will be help ensure that our Armed Forces remain the best trained, best equipped fighting force in the world. This is no small task, but he has consistently supported these objectives in his position as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He played an important role in calling for the Quadrennial Defense Review, has shown keen insights into the importance of weapons modernization, and has been a stalwart supporter calling for ballistic missile defenses. 
I have been very pleased to know many Secretary's of Defense in my 24 years in the Senate, but I must say that I have been especially proud to know Secretary Designate Cohen. We began our legislative careers in 1973. He first started in the House of Representatives, But I watched his career develop there and then in the Senate where he won the respect of his colleagues and became a giant here on Defense and Intelligence issues. 
I have enormous respect for Secretary of Defense Designate Cohen. I believe his confirmation will be good for the country. I think it is fair to say that he enjoys the respect of every Member of this body. I look forward to working with Senator Cohen in his new position as Secretary of Defense. I think the President has made an excellent choice in nominating him. The people of Maine can be truly proud of his accomplishments, as I am proud to support his nomination.

 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under section 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, the first concurrent resolution on the budget for 1986. 
This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget through January 22, 1997. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of the 1997 concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. Res. 178), show that current level spending is above the budget resolution by $16.9 billion in budget authority and by $12.6 billion in outlays. Current level is $17.8 billion above the revenue floor in 1997 and $99.2 billion above the revenue floor over the 5 years 1997-2001. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $222.4 billion, $4.9 billion below the maximum deficit amount for 1997 of $227.3 billion. 
This is my first report for the first session of the 105th Congress.

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe that most Americans realize the world in which we live has changed dramatically over the last decade. The world which had been divided into two hostile yet stable camps since the end of World War II entered a new era when the Soviet Union ceased to exist. When the Berlin Wall fell the divide between the East and West did as well, and we entered a new era. 
Today, democracy is spreading around the globe and our international priorities which once focused on strategic arms reduction treaties can now focus on other issues such as improving relations with democratic countries in South America, Asia, and Eastern Europe that have burgeoning market economies. 
These tremendous changes, however, come hand in hand with new challenges. Fighting international terrorism and crime is important to law abiding citizens everywhere. Fighting international drug traffickers is of particular importance to the citizens of New Mexico since approximately 70 percent of all illegal drugs entering the United States comes across our southern border with Mexico. 
Helping Russia emerge as a stable democracy with a growing economy is, also, very important. A strong, democratic Russia would be a stabilizing influence in Asia and could help prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In fact, the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico is already working with Russia to safeguard its nuclear weapons and ensure that nuclear materials do not fall into the wrong hands. 
Another important challenge is helping China emerge as a peaceful, responsible world power. A friendly China with its strong economic growth, huge population, and vast resources would be both a valuable partner in trade and a valuable ally in Asia. An aggressive China, however, could become a destabilizing influence in a region that is vital to our national interests. 
The United States faces a number of other important international challenges. Among them are: arriving at an agreeable method to allow Eastern European and central Asian countries to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO], resolving the dispute between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus, finding a lasting political solution to the problems of the Korean Peninsula, and securing the peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and bringing the young men and women of the United States armed services home safely. 
With all of the changes of the last decade, one might view the world as unstable. In fact, facing such a list of daunting tasks, one might consider these challenges insurmountable. I view them as an opportunity. 
With strong leadership, and clearly defined and consistent international policies, the post-cold-war era could be one of even greater American prosperity. I believe Madeleine Albright, as Secretary of State, will provide such leadership. 
Madeleine Albright spent 2 years working here, in the U.S. Senate, when she served as chief legislative assistant to Senator Muskie from 1976 to 1978. Her intelligence and competence were recognized when, in 1978, she moved to the National Security Council and the White House to handle foreign policy legislation. Many foreign policy professionals might consider being on the National Security Council the pinnacle of a career, but Madeleine Albright was just getting started. In 1981 she was awarded a fellowship at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars at the Smithsonian. She became a professor of international affairs, and the director of the women in foreign service program at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown. She served as president of the Center for National Policy. In 1993, she was appointed U.S. Representative to the United Nations, and made a member of President Clinton's Cabinet. 
Madeleine Albright is living proof of the American dream. Having fled Czechoslovakia and both the Nazis and Communists, Madeleine Albright came to the United States, studied hard, worked hard, and has now been nominated for the office of United States Secretary of State. Madeleine Albright, once a persecuted immigrant, is now the first women in United States history to be nominated to the highest office in the State Department. Not since Margaret Thatcher governed Britain has a woman occupied a position on such a scale of international influence. As Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright will negotiate with the world's most powerful leaders. 
Mr. President, Madeleine Albright has done a superb job as Ambassador to the United Nations. She has worked to make the United Nations more efficient and more responsive to U.S. interests. She prevailed in urging the NATO bombing in Bosnia, which she argues eventually led to the Dayton Peace Accord last year. She condemned Cuba when it shot down two unarmed civilian airplanes over international air space. She has fought for the freedom and the rights of people around the world. For these reasons and others, I believe Madeleine Albright will provide the strong leadership necessary make the post-cold-war era one of opportunity, cooperation, and American leadership. It is my honor to support Madeleine Albright for the position of U.S. Secretary of State.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, fellow Senators, I rise to compliment the Republican leader on the announcement today of the first Republican legislative agenda for the 105th Congress. I believe that most Americans would support the principles and the ideas contained in these 10 pieces of legislation. I also believe that within the Senate itself there is a compelling majority that will support these 10 proposals. From my standpoint, I support them all, but I do reserve the right in two or three instances to change some of the things that are in the bills. But in no way does it minimize my admiration of and respect for the leadership for putting these bills forth, and the Republican conference and the hard work they put into coming up with these ideas and these basic premises. 
I would like to just run through each one quickly with a few thoughts of my own, and then yield the floor to my friend, the new Senator from Wyoming. 
The balanced budget constitutional amendment: I do not think there is any question that that piece of legislation speaks to the wishes of a huge percentage of Americans. I would not be surprised if as many as 70 percent or 75 percent of Americans believe that we ought to build into our institutions a mandate--unless we have a war where we cannot abide by a balanced budget --that we ought to produce a balanced budget every year. 
Frankly, I have been working on budgets long enough to on the one hand be pulled by those who say, `Why don't we do it ourselves? Why do we need the force in effect of a constitutional amendment?' I guess the fact that we have all been working on it so long and can't get it done--and that when we look across the industrial nations, all we find is that with the passage of time instead of spending less, all governments spend more; instead of getting their deficits and debts under control there is growing concern, even in Europe, among most of our industrial friends there, that such things as pension plans and deferred obligations are going to bankrupt their countries. We are doing fairly well. But I do not think anybody ought to misconstrue the trend lines in terms of our current deficits to think that it is going to be easy to keep the deficit under control. 
In the next couple of weeks the Budget Committee will have a series of hearings to show what the next century is going to look like and what the major problems are, as the President speaks of a `bridge,' what we ought to be carrying across that bridge so we don't have bigger problems rather than a better life in the next century. 
The balanced budget amendment's time has come. There are some who will say, `What happens when you need to spend more money and there is not enough room in this budget,' such as unemployment compensation during a recession. Let me say that this amendment is very, very simple in that respect. If that is a serious problem, as serious as some would say, then all you need to do is get 60 votes. You don't have to pass any resolutions declaring emergencies. You just need 60 votes instead of 51 to let those expenditures take place. I believe that is good enough. I think history will reveal that we have had caps that are similar to this, to this constitutional amendment, on parts of our budget and that when we have been confronted by the need to increase something like unemployment compensation there has been far more than 60 votes to go ahead and break the caps because there is somewhat of a countercyclical economic necessity that is forthcoming. 
So, from this Senator's standpoint, I hope that the early count of Senators who back home during the campaign said they were for a constitutional amendment, plus those who voted heretofore, continues to add up--and that the number clearly when you do that is there are plenty of votes to pass it--that they will not change their minds based upon Washington, DC talk--because most heard from their people, and I hope that we will all live up to that and get this job done. 
Safe and affordable schools is our second one. All I can say about that is I am not sure that any of us know the extent to which we ought to be for change in our education system. But I can tell you one anomaly that is rather frightening. All you have to do is go home and talk to people in the business sector that want to employ people from your State of Maine, or my State of New Mexico, and who continue to tell us, `Well, the people we need don't have the skills required. They don't have the right training.' I guess in the broadest sense they are saying they are not educated for the workplace. 
Frankly, I hope that we could sooner rather than later go beyond these few principles in this bill and come up with some concepts that would push our current institutions that educate our young people--and even our adults--to force them to be more responsive to the needs of our people who are looking for jobs. 
I ask for another 5 minutes.

Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, let me suggest that while the United States for college, community colleges, public education, and kindergarten through 12 continues to spend more and more, everywhere we look there are huge numbers of Americans who are not well enough educated for the jobs of today. Frankly, we continue to pour money into vocational institutions and vocational education; we put the strings on that so we can put money into our public education, albeit very small amounts. But somehow or another it seems that the time has come to ask the institutions which we currently spend our money on to see if they can't change their way of doing business a little bit so they may be more the engine of training and skills improvement rather than us having to fund new institutions and new ways of doing them. 
Family tax relief: This Senator's only comment is that every single item in there are very exciting items. And they are all probably good for either American families, or the American economy, or are motivated by fairness. In that context, I support them. In the context of how much we will be able to afford, I reserve the right to decide. We may not be able to afford all the enumerated items in the bill. But obviously, we will have to look at that, and I want to make that comment in the Record. 
The workplace act I think is an exciting piece of legislation. I support it. I hope we can get the message out as to what is in the bill and what is not, for some who are already talking about what they believe the bill does, but they are really talking about things that are not part of this legislation. 
Product liability reform has come under some great leadership in the Senate. We have already done a lot of work on that bill, but we cannot get it passed through for the President's signature. I hope we get there. 
For the partial-birth abortion ban, I believe there is a compelling majority of support for the bill. The question is whether we have enough to override a Presidential veto. I have heard words from the White House, but more importantly from Senators like Senator Daschle saying maybe we ought to work something out here, which leads me to believe that there are even more Senators who deplore the partial-birth abortion technique than those who voted for it. I, too, hope we can get something done there. 
Let me just quickly go through the Missile Defense Act. Obviously, there are some who would not put this in the top 10, but there are many who are concerned enough about it, and I support it wholeheartedly, in an effort to solve the problems that are stated by that legislation. 
The Superfund cleanup is long overdue. It is now good to know that Senator Chafee and Senator Smith of New Hampshire support a measure that will reform Superfund. And reform means that we will put more of the billions that will be spent during the next 10 years into actual cleanup instead of into court cases and litigation. I think that is the motivation and that is what we are trying to do. I think that is very positive. 
The Paycheck Protection Act speaks for itself. And then I will go to the last one, the Violent Juvenile Offenders Act. I am very pleased that many of the provisions of the legislation I introduced last year, after numerous hearings in New Mexico and a great deal of input from our judges and from probation officials, are in this bill. I think it is obvious that if any part of our criminal justice system has fallen apart, it is the juvenile justice system. For the most part, in most of our States, the juvenile justice system has not kept up with the times. It does not meet today's challenges, and I believe we are going to sensitize our States to this by offering to give them more financial support if they will modernize their systems. I believe this bill will lead them to hold more teenagers accountable for their actions and make more public the activities of the courts, rather than to hide their activities. They also should make juveniles more accountable, even for smaller offenses, so they do not wait until they have committed the equivalent of 10 or 15 felonies before something is done to try to help the teenager. 
Many of these things are encapsulated in the bill. There are some things that I am not sure ultimately, after detailed hearings, are going to be as good as they sound. We are trying to reform the existing law. The existing law is rigid and in many cases harms juvenile justice at home in our States. 
I am not sure that people are aware of it, but we have mandates in the Federal juvenile justice law, and one of them is called sight and sound separation. It has gotten way out of hand. I am not sure we should do away with the mandates entirely, but we have had a situation in New Mexico where because one correctional facility would have had the same kitchen for both adults and teenagers, the State was told that it could not house teenagers there. I guess they expanded the mandate to sight, sound, and smell, or maybe the flavor that will come from using the same kitchen. But I do not know how that had much to do with whether you ought to keep the teenagers in that facility. 
Perhaps we are underfunding the OJJP provisions, we are cutting those a little bit, and we ought to look at that. There are a couple of other things we ought to include, but for the most part we are moving in the right direction, and I am very pleased to be a cosponsor and essentially had a lot to do with what we put in that bill. 
I believe I am close to the time the Senate has granted me to speak, and I thank the Senate for the time and yield the floor. 
Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.
