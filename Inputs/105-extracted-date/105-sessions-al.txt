Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, six years seems too short a time for a man of Dirk Kempthorne's character to serve in the United States Senate. In the two years that I have been privileged to work with the Senator from Idaho, I have been impressed by both his considerable integrity and also his unwavering dedication to the citizens of Idaho and to his fellow countrymen. When I reflect upon Senator Kempthorne's tenure in the Senate, I will remember the traits that made him such a successful legislator. I will especially remember the thoughtful approach the the Senator used when addressing the pressing issues of the day. When Senator Kempthorne chose a course of action, every Senator could be certain that his decisions were guided by careful deliberation, broad consultation, and sincere prayer. Now, Senator Kempthorne has decided to return to his people of Idaho, offering to sere their interests closer to home. Selfishly, I and others will miss his quiet strength, his leadership in a pinch, his good judgment, and his deep faith. It has enriched all who have had the privilege of serving with him and, I must say, it has been a special source of strength to me. Dirk not only talks the talk, he walks the walk. His concern is for the least among us and his insights are superior. Whether he is in a small group meeting, a committee hearing, a leadership conference, a Bible study, or on the floor of the United States Senate, Dirk Kempthorne always reveals himself to be a man of integrity. This is so because he is one solid whole. He does not compartmentalize. What you see is what you get, from the surface to the center. 
Dirk has called us to higher things than mere public policy. He wants our government to make us better, not just richer and more powerful. His service in the Senate has been to that goal. He is both a humble servant of a higher calling, and an effective leader. We will miss that leadership and strength on issue after issue. We will miss even more his good example, his living proof that one can serve in public life and posses the richest qualities of a Christian gentleman. Dirk, we will miss you. You have made us better by your word, your manner, and your life. Our best wishes go with you. Godspeed Dirk Kempthorne.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join others to comment on the service provided to America and to Kentucky by Wendell Ford. While we were members of different political parties, I often had the opportunity to hear him speak on this floor and to observe him represent his party as a Democratic leader. He is strong, experienced, filled with good humor and a tough advocate for his state and for his beliefs. I was honored to be the presiding officer for the Senate on the day in which Wendell Ford eclipsed the service record of a host of outstanding Kentucky senators and became the longest serving Senator from that great state. 
While he loves government, politics and the debate that goes with this office, he is a family man at heart. He has the sense of a southerner. He remembers his friends and he loves his state. 
He is also independent. I recall one late night that we were debating whether to limit the high attorneys' fees in the tobacco cases. Senator Ford came on the floor and I noticed him looking my way during the debate. As we concluded, he asked if I would yield for a question. I answered his inquiry as best I could and he firmly nodded. Even though his party was strongly against my amendment, and no one could doubt that Wendell Ford is a good Democrat, he voted for the amendment and it passed by one vote. 
Those are the things that you remember and are a good example for all of us. While we want to be loyal, we are also independent. 
Mr. President, we are losing one of our more notable members. We will miss the richness of his experience, the sharp debate, and the good humor. While our association has been a short one, I have enjoyed and benefitted from it, and expect that it will continue.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have been honored to have the opportunity to hear Senator Bumpers share his perspective on public service and his personal odyssey. His story is the story of the South--depression, hardship, tough economic times, small businesses, and the son of a shopkeeper. I, too, am the son of a storekeeper and can understand and identify the qualities that have shaped Senator Bumpers' life. 
I have had the opportunity to personally observe his service in this body for just 2 years, but in that short time I have been able to appreciate his many excellent qualities. He does indeed reflect the character of the people of Arkansas. He is part of that State; he comes from its people; and, he shares its values. As an attorney who has tried many cases, I have had the pleasure to see him work on the floor of the Senate. He is articulate, able, well prepared, logical, and persuasive. He states his case very effectively. I can just imagine him before a jury in Arkansas as he boils down complex issues to their essence and appeals to their sense of values. I can see just why people refer to him as an outstanding lawyer. Many denigrate that profession, and I have been a strong critic of some of the abuses of the legal profession, but the skills possessed by the Senator from Arkansas are those skills that make a lawyer most valuable. He cuts straight to the heart of the matter in words that are comprehensible by all. 
Again, I am pleased to have served with the distinguished senior Senator from Arkansas and I wish him well in his future service. He has conducted himself with high standards and has not done anything to bring discredit on this body. He has stood courageously, alone if necessary, for the values that he believed in. There is no doubt, I say to the children and grandchildren of the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, that your father and grandfather has been an able and noble practitioner in this great deliberative body of the greatest nation in the history of the world. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning the VA health care system, a system that is currently undergoing dramatic changes and reorganization. I would note that these changes, in turn, to include managerial reforms, facility consolidations, and reallocation of resources, all initiated by the Under Secretary for Health, Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer M.D., M.P.H., are having a dramatic impact on when, where, and how VA is providing for our veterans, many of whom are in my home state of Alabama. 
The private health care sector is likewise undergoing massive managerial and resource changes. We saw evidence earlier this week of the erosion in care for elderly Americans, for instance, when a number of HMO's decided not to participate any further in Medicare+Choice. Over at the VA, using managed care models, Dr. Kizer also shifted inpatient care to outpatient care and heightened the focus of primary care at the expense of specialty care and specialized services. So elderly veterans, and those in speciality care programs around the country, are under the same stresses as their civilian neighbors. 
Dr. Kizer apparently likes decentralized decision making, and I cannot say that I necessarily disagree with that style. It can be very effective at times and in certain organizations. He has given local VA managers incentives and authority to design and run their own health care operations independent of VA's National Headquarters. In many respects these reforms have been beneficial, even bold I am told, particularly at a time when the VA budget is under severe stress. 
However, I expressed my personal concern to Dr. Kizer in a phone call earlier this week that there is one area where I believe decentralization and certainly the shifting of resources is having a very negative effect on one of the VA's core missions, and that is, the provision of specialized services for veterans with spinal cord injury and dysfunction. 
Mr. President, the Congress mandated in P.L. 104-262 that the VA would maintain its capacity to provide specialized services, such as care given in VA's 23 Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) centers. Many have wondered, and rightly so I believe, that budget pressures, reorganization and decentralization of management have created the incentive for local managers to downgrade these expensive specialized programs, generally shifting resources and staff out of one area to make up for shortfalls in others areas. Costs are thereby reduced at the expense of the care for the veterans who need it the most. 
Specialized programs, including blind rehabilitation, amputation care, specialized health programs, as well as spinal cord injury care, are core disciplines of the VA health care system. They, least of all, should be subject to re-engineering until all aspects of that care have been analyzed from a headquarters perspective. I don't think allowing numerous mangers to make that kind of decision is in the national interest or in the interest of our veterans. 
Former Senator Alan Simpson from Wyoming, then Chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, presided over the passage of the legislation protecting specialized services. Addressing this particular provision, he said: `VA is required to maintain special programs (such as treatment of spinal cord dysfunction, blind rehabilitation, amputation and mental illness) at least at the current level. On a per capita basis, these services are expensive to provide and it is not the intent of the Committee to allow VA to reduce them in order to pay for other kinds of routine care.' 
Mr. President, I am afraid what Senator Simpson and the Congress feared could happen to specialized programs in general and spinal cord injury programs specifically under VA's current reorganization initiatives is, in fact, happening. 
Nearly a month ago, I had a visit from Mr. Aubrey L. Crockett, the President of the Mid-South Chapter of Paralyzed Veterans of America. Aubrey represents the health care interests of 1830 spinal cord dysfunctional veterans in Alabama. As he sat confined to his wheel chair, he raised serious concerns that the VA was not maintaining the quality and quantity of its specialized health care services for the over 120,000 veterans nationwide with spinal cord dysfunction. 
Last month, Gordon Mansfield, the National Executive Director of the Paralyzed Veterans of America addressed the same subject from a national perspective during hearings on the Hill. PVA's leadership has expressed its concerns to me as well. Over 75 percent of their membership, a larger percentage than any other veterans service organization, rely on the VA for all or part of their specialized health care needs. For these individuals with chronic and catastrophic disabilities, any erosion in the care they require can be life threatening. Aubrey indicated that something as simple as a pad for a wheel chair can make a big difference for a veteran. 
I have come to believe that PVA's concerns need to be addressed. I further believe that any erosion in staffing, bed availability or the quality of care at our nations VA Spinal Cord Injury Centers cannot stand without a review of the underlying reasons, and that the VA must direct the resources to fix the problems in order to comply with the intent of Congress as mandated in the statutes. 
In an era of tight budgets, local hospital administrators and managers don't see these programs, such as the Spinal Cord Injury programs, as being `National Programs.' Ignoring the national mandates, local managers acting under Dr. Kizer's administrative decentralization guidelines have been left to do whatever they felt was warranted. We may disagree on the numbers of reported beds and staff in SCI centers, but even GAO has criticized the inaccuracy of VA data collection efforts. So, it should not be surprising that a number of Senators have questioned VA's procedures and policies as applied to managing its specialized programs. Paralyzed veterans, I think, are the only true judges of the state of the health care they receive. They are the reason the VA health care system exists. If paralyzed veterans have a concern then the Congress must listen, and more importantly, if warranted we must act on their behalf. 
On September 29, 1998, I wrote to my colleague from Pennsylvania Veterans Committee Chairman Arlen Specter expressing my concerns in this matter. I indicated that `I will consider placing a hold on the re-nomination' of Dr. Kenneth Kizer, `until my concern regarding the maintenance of specialized services within the Veterans Health Administration is adequately addressed.' 
Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Specter, and the Committee for its support in this matter. The Committee met every request I had in a timely fashion. Moreover, it helped coordinate a solution acceptable to all parties. America's veterans owe Senator Specter a debt of gratitude for his hard work on their behalf. 
The solution I had in mind when I wrote to Dr. Kizer was to bring the reins of control for SCI programs back to the National Headquarters level and in the process elevate the controls over policy and resources and restore a greater degree of national guidance and oversight. In doing so, I hoped we would be guaranteeing for some time to come that these changes would meet the needs of our paralyzed veterans and conform to the mandated statutes. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to report that Dr. Kizer has responded to my concerns with a suggested list of administrative and policy changes that would bring additional control over the spinal cord injury program.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Illinois. He did a good amount of work. He worked hard on this bill in committee. He worked hard on it to the very end. He was a champion of it in the committee. It came out of our committee by a 17-to-2 vote. It passed in the Senate with only one negative vote. Then we went into conference with the House. I am convinced that the bill is better today after having been be in conference than it was before it left, even though I had to give up some things that I favored. 
I certainly agree with the idea that this homestead situation, where millionaires move off, buy mansions, and then declare bankruptcy, is a scandal. 
But I am telling you, I was amazed how many Senators from States who have those homestead exemptions, mistakenly in my view, felt very strongly that this somehow abrogated their State law, their State constitutions. Their opposition, as Senator Grassley knows, jeopardized the ability of the bill to pass. We made some modest progress towards restraining this abuse. 
Senator Grassley said he was prepared to let us take it up again next year and see what we could do then. But in order to move the bill, we made some progress rather than no progress on this issue. I certainly believe we can do better. 
This bill passed the House with 300 affirmative votes; 75 Democrats supported it. I really do not agree with the assertions that this is not good bipartisan legislation. 
It really hurts me to hear the Senator say that this bill guts the protections that were in the Senate version. This bill institutes protections for debtors, but it does set some standards in bankruptcy. It will not let an individual come in and wipe out all of their debt without any explanation or any justification for it. They have to justify that they need this radical protection. 
With regard to the question of fairness, we have been on this bill for years now. Senator Grassley has met and met and met. He worked very hard and had the bipartisan support of his Senate Judiciary Committee and his subcommittee on this bill. Senator Durbin is the ranking member of it. The staff on Sunday met for 7 hours. They met 10 hours with the Democratic staff between Sunday and Wednesday of this week discussing this bill. They were asked to sign the conference report and they chose not to. Those of us who supported the bill signed it. The Democrats refused to do so. Obviously, at some point, they made a decision they were going to object to this bill. I don't believe the majority of the Senators want to do that in either party. It came out of this body and the other body with overwhelming support. 
It is stunning to me. I know there is a campaign theme about this `do-nothing Congress.' The President has been suggesting that. 
This is a good historic piece of legislation. We haven't made a major improvement bankruptcy laws since 1978. A lot of work has gone into this reform. This is major legislation setting forth major progress. And, all of a sudden now, at the last minute, all of the objections come up. I suppose they will accuse us of not being able too pass the bankruptcy legislation. 
But I want to say this: I think some people who killed this bill are going to have to answer why. I don't believe it is going to be a satisfactory explanation to say that they voted against it because it prohibited trial lawyers from bringing a bunch of class actions. Only within the area of a finite part of the bankruptcy law are class actions prohibited. 
That is almost an insignificant part of this bill. And to raise that now and suggest it is a basis to oppose this bill suggests to me just how good a bill it is, if that is all they can find to fuss about. Maybe this suggests that it is trial lawyers making the phone calls and stirring up the opposition. It really is frustrating to see a man of the ability, the patience and the integrity of Senator Grassley bring this bill up with the great support he had from both parties and see it now being jeopardized by a Presidential veto. 
I would hate for that to happen. I believe when the President actually studies this bill carefully, he is going to conclude ti is a historic improvement over the present law, that he cannot justify not signing it, that it will be good for America and that he will sign it. I certainly hope that is true. 
Let me mention a couple of things about the bill. We have several pages of restrictions on credit. There is a whole section of this bill entitled `Enhanced Disclosures on the Open End Credit Plan.' We went into credit cards and some of that stuff, but this is not a banking bill. This is not a credit card bill. This is a bill to improve bankruptcy, not credit cards. Attaching and raising all those issues is something that ought to be done by the Banking Committee. But we included some restrictions, a number of restrictions, and we put in this bill a study required to be done by the Federal Reserve Board to help us develop a way to control any abuses in the credit card industry. I think it will be a step forward. 
This is a not a stonewall. Here at the last minute we don't have to be creating movement from bankruptcy to credit cards. I feel strongly about that. 
Let me just mention a couple of things the bill does. It, for the first time, states that if you have plenty of money to pay back a lot of your debts, you ought to do so. So if you can pay back 50 percent, 70 percent of your debts, you ought to go into chapter 13. The court will protect you from lawsuits and creditors, and you set up a payment plan and you can pay back those creditors a portion of what you owe if you have sufficient income. 
Now, the standard used for income is the national median income for a family of four. This means that the person would have to make over $50,000 a year to be required to pay any back. If they make less than that, they can stay in the chapter 7 and wipe out all of their debts. So I don't think the standard is very high at all. But people who are wealthy, have money, ought to pay back some of their debts. And many of them can pay all of their debts back. 
That is the historic step. It is only fair. And it is just not moral to allow people to not pay their just debts when they are capable of doing so. 
I see the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee has come in the Chamber. I have a couple of minutes remaining. I will be delighted to yield for any comments he has. He has been a strong leader in this legislation. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to express my sincere appreciation and admiration for the distinguished Senator from Indiana. The Senator from Indiana has set a standard and an example in this body of what it means to be a Senator, what it means to be a decent Christian gentleman, the likes of which I do not think have been surpassed in my experience here. I have had the honor of calling him friend. I have had the opportunity to serve or participate with him in a prayer breakfast that he leads. He sets the kind of example of good public service that all of us ought to seek to emulate. And I am delighted that he has played an important role in this piece of legislation, as he has in so many others. And it will be, I am sure, successfully pursued.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the role of the Senate is to advise and consent in nominations by the President for judicial vacancies. That is understood in the Constitution. Every nominee of the President comes before the Judiciary Committee and then they come before this body for a vote. We are at this point analyzing the nomination of William Fletcher, Willie Fletcher from California, to the Ninth Circuit. I regretfully must say I have concluded that I have to oppose that nomination. And I would like to discuss the reasons why. 
Most of the nominations that have come forward from the President have received favorable review by the Judiciary Committee. In fact, we cleared nine today. A number of them are on the docket today and will probably pass out today. So we are making some substantial progress. 
Nearly half of the vacancies that exist now in Federal courts are because there are no nominees for those vacancies--almost half of them. But on occasion we need to stand up as a Senate and affirm certain facts about our courts and our Nation. One of the facts that we need to affirm is that courts must carry out the rule of law, that they are not there to make law. The courts are there to enforce law as written by the Congress and as written by the people through their Constitution that we adopted over 200 years ago. Also, that is, I think, where we are basically today. 
With regard to this nomination, it is to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California. Without any doubt, the Ninth Circuit is considered the most liberal circuit in the United States. It is also the largest circuit. There are 11 circuit courts of appeals. And in the United States we have the U.S. district judges. These are the trial judges. The next level--the only intermediate level--is the courts of appeals. And they are one step below the U.S. Supreme Court. It is the courts of appeals that superintend, day after day, the activities of the district judges who practice under them. 
There are more district judges in the circuit than there are circuit judges. And every appeal from a district judge's ruling, almost virtually every one, would go to the courts of appeals in California and Arizona and the States in the West that are part of the Ninth Circuit. Those appeals go to the Ninth Circuit, not directly to the U.S. Supreme Court. As they rule on those matters, they set certain policy within the circuit. 
We have--I think Senator Biden made a speech on it once--we have 1 Constitution in this country, not 11. The circuit courts of appeals are required to show fidelity to the Supreme Court and to the Constitution. The Supreme Court is the ultimate definer of the Constitution. And the courts of appeals must take the rulings of the Supreme Court and interpret them and apply them directly to their judges who work under them or in their circuit and in fact set the standards of the law. 
We do not have 11 different circuits setting 11 different policies--at least we should not. But it is a known fact that the Ninth Circuit for many years has been out of step. Last year, 28 cases from the Ninth Circuit made it to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court does not hear every case. This is why the circuits are so important. 
Probably 95 percent of the cases decided by the circuits never are appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court will not hear them. But they agreed to hear 28 cases from the Ninth Circuit. And of those 28 cases, they reversed 27 of them. They reversed an unprecedented number. They reversed the Ninth Circuit 27 out of the 28 times they reviewed a case from that circuit. And this is not a matter of recent phenomena. 
I was a Federal prosecutor for almost 15 years, and during that time I was involved in many criminal cases. And you study the law, and you seek out cases where you can find them. Well, it was quite obvious--and Federal prosecutors all over the country used to joke about the fact that the criminal defense lawyers, whenever they could not find any law from anywhere else, they could always find a Ninth Circuit case that was favorable to the defendant. And they were constantly, even in those days, being reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court, because the U.S. Supreme Court's idea and demand is that we have one Constitution, that the law be applied uniformly. 
So I just say this. The New York Times, not too many months ago, wrote an article about the Ninth Circuit and said these words: `A majority of the U.S. Supreme Court considers the Ninth Circuit a rogue circuit, out of control. It needs to be brought back into control. They have been working on it for years but have not been able to do so.' 
All of that is sort of the background that we are dealing with today. 
When we get a nominee to this circuit, I believe this Senate ought to utilize its advise and consent authority, constitutional duty, to ensure that the nominees to it bring that circuit from being a rogue circuit back into the mainstream of American law, so we do not have litigants time and again having adverse rulings, that they have to go to the Supreme Court--however many thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars--to get reversed. 
This is serious business. Some say, `They just reversed them. Big deal.' It costs somebody a lot of money, and a lot of cases that were wrong in that circuit were never accepted by the Supreme Court and were never reversed. The Supreme Court can't hear every case that comes out of every circuit. So we are dealing with a very serious matter. 
The Senator from Ohio who I suspect will comment today on the nominee, Senator DeWine, articulated it well. When we evaluate nominees, we have to ask ourselves what will be the impact of that nomination on the court and the overall situation. We want to support the President. We support the President time and again. I have seen some Presidential nominees that are good nominees. I am proud to support them. There are two here today who I know personally that I think would be good Federal judges. But I can't say that about this one. 
We need to send the President of the United States a message, that those Members of this body who participate in helping select nominees cannot, in good conscience, continue to accept nominations to this circuit who are not going to make it better and bring it back into the mainstream of American law. 
With regard to Mr. Fletcher, he has never practiced law. The only real experience he has had outside of being a professor, was as a law clerk. His clerkship was for Justice William Brennan of the U.S. Supreme Court. That is significant and it is an honor to be selected to be a law clerk for the Supreme Court. But the truth is, Justice Brennan has always been recognized as the point man, the leading spokesman in American juris prudence for an activist judiciary. I am not saying he is a bad man, but that is his position. 
Justice Brennan used to dissent on every death penalty case, saying he adhered to the view that the death penalty was cruel and unusual punishment, and within that very Constitution he said he was interpreting, there are at least four to six references to the death penalty and capital crimes. The Founding Fathers who wrote that Constitution never dreamed that anyone would say that a prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment would prohibit the death penalty, because the death penalty was in every State and colony in the United States at the time the Constitution was adopted. It never crossed their minds. 
This is an example of judicial activism when Justice Brennan would conclude that he could reinterpret the Constitution and what the people contracted with their Government when they ratified it. It says, `We, the people, ordain and establish this Constitution. . ..' So they adopt it; it is reinterpreted. That is a classic definition of judicial activism. 
We know Mr. Fletcher was his law clerk and has written a law review article referring to Justice Brennan as a national treasure. It is obvious he considers him an outstanding judge and a man he would tend to emulate. 
Of course, judicial activism is part of his family. One of the problems, and the Presiding Officer has attempted to deal with it through legislation, and was successful. Just today, I believe, we have passed legislation dealing with nepotism, two family members serving on the same court. 
The truth is, Mr. Fletcher's mother is a judge on the Ninth Circuit already. Of the judges in the United States, I am sure she would be viewed as one of the most activist--in the Ninth Circuit, it is common knowledge she is one of the most activist nominee members of that court. It doesn't mean he will be, but he is connected to Justice Brennan, and his mother is a very liberal, an activist, and will remain on the court as a senior judge and will have the opportunity to participate in a substantial number of the opinions that are rendered by the Ninth Circuit, because they have three-judge panels who assign these cases out of the judges there and they often put these judges on a panel. If she takes senior status, which I understand she has agreed to do, she would not resign from the bench but take senior status and still be able to handle a substantial caseload. That is a troubling fact to me. 
To me, a judge is a very important position at any level of the courts. This is not an absolute disqualifying factor to me, but it is a very important factor to me, and that is that Mr. Fletcher lacks any private practice experience. Mr. Fletcher has never practiced law. Mr. Fletcher has never tried a lawsuit. He has been a law clerk for William Brennan and a professor at the University of California Law School. He has never been in the courtroom as a litigant. He has never had the opportunity to have that knot in your stomach when a judge is about to rule on a motion, to understand the difficulties in dealing with human nature. He has not had that experience. 
Having had 15 years of full-time litigation experience in Federal court trying cases, you learn things intuitively. Supreme Court justices and appellate court justices will be better judges if they have had that experience. It is an odd thing, and not a healthy thing, normally; it takes extraordinary and exceptional circumstances, in my opinion, to conclude that someone who has been nothing but a law professor all their life is now qualified to take a lifetime appointment to review the decisions of perhaps 100 or more trial judges in their district who are working long and hard, for whom he has never had the opportunity to practice before and see what it is like. That is not a good thing in itself. That is another reason I have serious reservations about this nominee. 
Certainly Mr. Fletcher has a right to speak out, but in 1994, not too many years ago, he made a speech in which he criticized the `three strikes' law legislation, the criminal law changes that have swept the country, calling it `perfectly dreadful legislation.' He has never been a prosecutor. He has never been a judge. He has never been a lawyer. Here he is saying this about this legislation, which I believe is widely supported throughout the country. In my opinion, it has helped reduce the rise in crime, because `three strikes and you are out' focuses on repeat, habitual offenders. 
Make no mistake, somebody will say, `You will have everybody in jail, Jeff.' Not so; everybody is not a repeat, three-time felony offender. If you focus on the repeat offender, those are the ones committing a disproportionate percentage of crime. We have done a better job on that in the last 10 or 15 years. We have tough Federal laws dealing with repeat offenders. States have implemented `three strike' laws and it has helped draw down the rise in crime. As a matter of fact, crime has been dropping after going up for many years because we got tough and identified the repeat offenders and prosecuted them successfully and States have stepped up to the plate and done so. 
He criticized that. That gives me a real insight into his view about criminal law, and here he will be presiding over reviewing cases of trials involving murderers and other criminals in the Ninth Circuit and he has never had any experience. 
The only thing we know about him is that he considers good, tough law legislation dreadful.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to share some thoughts with you about judicial activism. In 1982, Mr. Fletcher wrote an article entitled `The Discretionary Constitution.' He was a professor then. It has been interpreted by many as a blatant approval of judicial activism. He discusses institutional suits. I was attorney general of the State of Alabama and I had to deal with Federal judges who have major court orders dominating the prison system. Most States have prison systems under court order, having Federal judges ruling those, and mental health systems and school funding issues are decided by Federal judges. So he wrote about that and other issues. In that article, this is what he said, and it really troubles me: 
The only legitimate basis for a Federal judge to take over the political function in devising or choosing a remedy in an institutional suit is a demonstrated unwillingness or incapacity of the political body. 
I want you to think about that. That is a revealing quote, that, well, the only way you can do it is if the institution demonstrates an unwillingness or incapacity to act. That is the rationale of the liberal activist. What they say is, well, the State of Alabama didn't provide enough gruel for the criminals, so we are going to issue an order and tell them what they have to feed them three times a day. Or we are going to have a law library for every prison, and they have to have so many square feet. Or you have to spend so much money on education; you have to change your whole way of funding education in your State. Why? Because the State would not act. 
Now, we live in a democracy. In a democracy, the people rule; they decide what they want to do. I know the distinguished Senator in the Chair, Mr. Ashcroft, shares this view. I have heard him express it. I think these are his exact words: `When the legislature does not act, that is a decision.' When they go into session, they decide to act on matters or not act on them, and not acting is an action, a decision not to act. The people have influence with that because they elect their representatives and, if they are not happy, they can remove them from office. 
But you can't remove a Federal judge because he has a lifetime appointment. He cannot be removed, except for the most serious personal abuses of office. Normally, making bad decisions is not one of those. I will just say this. We have a circuit that is in trouble. It is considered by a majority of the Supreme Court to be a rogue circuit. We need to put nominees on this circuit and move it back into the mainstream and not continue it out on the left wing. We have a responsibility to assure that the judges we confirm are going to improve the courts, and I think we need to vote `no' on this nomination because I don't believe it will take us back in the direction we need to go. I think it will take us in the wrong direction. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there have been several speakers, including the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Missouri, who have talked about the unique circumstances that are at foot here in dealing with the Ninth Circuit, and that we have a responsibility and a duty to make sure that we use our advise and consent authority wisely to improve the courts in America, and the Ninth Circuit is in need of, severe need of reform. It has been reversed in nearly 90 percent of its cases in the last 2 years--an unprecedented record that no circuit, to my knowledge, has even been suggested to have approached. The New York Times has referred to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals--which includes California and most of the west coast--and they said that a majority of the Supreme Court considers the Ninth Circuit a rogue circuit. 
Now, some Senators suggest this is politics. Mr. President, I was elected by the people of my State to come here, and one of my duties is to evaluate Federal judges. I have affirmed and voted for the overwhelming majority of the Clinton nominees. I am willing to vote on this one. I have agreed to this nomination to come up and be voted on. But I want to have my say. I am concerned about this. I don't think that is politics. 
As a matter of fact, let me quote to you from an article that Mr. Fletcher, the nominee, wrote a few years ago referring to the confirmation process involving Justice Clarence Thomas. What he said about the role of the Senate was this: 
Does the Senate have the political will-- 
That is us, me-- 
to come down here and do the unpleasant duty of standing up and-- 
And talk about a gentleman who is charming, I am sure, and a nice fellow-- 
talking about the unpleasant fact that he may not be the right nominee for the court? 
He said: 
Does the Senate have the political will to insist that its constitutional advise and consent role become a working reality? 
Mr. President, I have been here 2 years. One nominee withdrew before a vote, and we hadn't voted on any nominees. So we are not abusing our advise and consent power. As a matter of fact, I don't think we have been aggressive enough in utilizing it to ensure that the nominees to the Federal bench are mainstream nominees. 
That is what we are talking about. He said, `The Senate must be prepared to persuade. . . .' This is Mr. Fletcher, who wrote this article. He is an academic, a professor, so he can sit around and find time to write these articles. We are not dealing with a proven practitioner, a person who served as a State or Federal judge, as we normally have. We are dealing with a nominee who has never practiced law in his life, has never tried a lawsuit, has never been in court and had to answer to a judge. Yet, he is going to be superintending the largest Federal circuit in the country. This is what he wrote:  
The Senate must be prepared to persuade the public that an insistence on full participation in choosing judges is not a usurpation of power. 
That is all we are doing. We are telling the President of the United States--and it is going to get more serious with additional nominees to this circuit--that we have to have some mainstream nominees. We have to do something about the Ninth Circuit, where 27 out of 28 cases were reversed in the term before last, and 13 out of 17 were reversed in the last term. That has been going on for 15 or 20 years. It is not even a secret problem anymore. It is an open, acknowledged problem in American jurisprudence. The U.S. Supreme Court is trying to maintain uniformity of the law. 
For example, this summer, the Ninth Circuit was the only circuit to rule that the Prison Litigation Reform Act--passed here to improve some of the horrendous problems we were having with litigation by prisoners--was unconstitutional. Every other circuit that addressed the issue upheld the constitutionality of this act, including the First, Fourth, Sixth, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuit have affirmed the constitutionality of the Prison Litigation Reform Act. But not the Ninth Circuit. It is out there again. 
As a matter of fact, I have learned that they utilize an extraordinary amount of funds of the taxpayers on defense of criminal cases. In fact, they have approved one-half of the fees for court-appointed counsel in the entire United States. There are 11 circuits in America. This one is the biggest, but certainly not more than 20, 25 percent of the country--probably less than that. They did half of the court-appointed attorney's fees because they are turning criminal cases into prolonged processes where there is no finality in the judgment--a problem that America is coming to grips with, the Supreme Court is coming to grips with, and the people of this country are coming to grips with. That is just an example of what it means to have a problem there. 
Mr. President, I will just say this: This nominee was a law clerk, in addition to never having practiced, and he clerked for Justice Brennan, who was widely recognized as the epitome of judicial activism. His mother is on this court today, the Ninth Circuit, and she is recognized as the most liberal member of the court. Perhaps one other is more liberal. It is a problem we have to deal with. 
I would like to mention this. In talking about the confirmation process, he made some unkind and unwise comments about Justice Thomas in a 1991 article. He questioned, I think fundamentally, the integrity of Justice Thomas. What kind of standard do we need to apply here? He believed a very high standard. This is what he said: 
Judge Clarence Thomas did have a record, although not distinguished enough to merit President Bush's accolades. But Thomas backed away from that record, pretending he meant none of what he had written, and said that he never talked about Roe v. Wade with anyone and, of course, he didn't talk dirty to Anita Hill either.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I just had the opportunity to hear the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Michigan concerning the independent counsel. 
I must say that those remarks are troubling to me and I do not believe contribute to really the kind of bipartisan effort that we need to make here in this body with regard to the delicate problem of the President's troubles. 
It was raised under the pretension or the suggestion as part of an evaluation of the independent counsel but really amounted to, I think, an unfair restatement of many charges that have been made against the independent counsel, most of which I believe have already been answered, or could be answered pretty easily. 
I served as a prosecutor for a number of years, and I would like just to share some thoughts. 
I prosecuted a number of government officials. And it was my experience during that process that government officials, more than any other person I had the occasion to investigate, were the most aggressive and most impossible to the prosecutor. It is part of their team effort with their attorneys to attack the person who is out speaking the truth. 
It is not an easy job for this independent counsel to obtain the truth. These officials don't want it out. It is not their choice. It is not their preference, or their desire, that what they may have done is revealed, particularly if what they have done may involve perjury or some illegality. 
So it is not an easy thing to do. And when the independent counsel was charged with going out and finding the truth, he faced a systematic effort to obfuscate that truth. I wish it weren't so, but that is what appears to be. 
So now when we get through this process--it took several years to finally get this information that we now have--we have Members of the other party wanting to come in here and attack the man who ultimately produced what appears to be the truth. At least I have not heard it substantially disputed. And he submitted a report. They said, `Oh, well.' Judge Sirica, he said, wanted to review the grand jury testimony. That was before the independent counsel law. That was an unprecedented thing, I suppose, for Judge Sirica to report grand jury testimony. There was no law. 
But now, under the independent counsel law, the independent counsel is required to submit the information that he finds to the Congress, to the House of Representatives. That is what his duty was--to find out the truth and to submit it. And it was not easy to find the truth. It often is not. It was particularly difficult with the clever people he was dealing with in this instance. 
So it just disturbs me, I must say. And if it is true, if he has so violated his oath, the Attorney General can remove him from office. If she has a basis for it, she ought to do it. 
And she will not be criticized by this Senator. 
So they say, `Well, his duty is to prosecute fairly.' Well, you don't prosecute until you get the truth. You don't prosecute until you get the facts. And his responsibility was to find those facts. 
They say graphic details were not necessary. Well, I am glad that we have some fastidious concern. I think we do have too much unhealthy sex and stuff in this country today. But we have a denial. We had a suggestion that, `What I did was not really sex.' 
So I suppose the details of what the President may have done are relevant to whether or not he had sex or not, and I am certain that is why the independent counsel felt it was his obligation to do so. And his goal is to report that information. 
They say, `Well, he shouldn't have suggested in his report that the President lied under oath.' That is one of the words that was said he used. But he was required to report on matters that may lead to impeachment charges. 
So by nature his summary report was his opinion as to whether or not there was evidence accumulated sufficient to lead to impeachment. He is required to give his opinion and his summary of the evidence as to whether or not it required impeachment, and he concluded, based on all the studies, that the President lied under oath, apparently, and he put that in his report. 
I submit he was required to do so. 
Oh, they say, you didn't get all the exculpatory evidence, that that didn't all come out, and that she said, Miss Lewinsky said, `No one ever asked me to lie.' Well, I am not sure and therefore--but from what I read in the report, it would suggest to me that the Starr report didn't say anybody ever said she was asked to lie. The Starr report simply said that there were circumstances that led to that, apparently. But it did not use those words and he would not have been required to put forth her statement in that regard. 
So Judge Sirica's circumstances are not quite the same, is all I am saying. And I respect the distinguished Senator and his comments and his concern, and we ought to hold every public official accountable. We ought to scrutinize all of our behavior here and we ought to be prepared to stand the heat. I am sure Mr. Starr has got to stand the heat like everybody else if he is going to be in the kitchen. If you recall, we have a word in the criminal lexicon today called `Sirica.' And what happened was, if you will recall, some of those burglars who said, oh, this is just a two-bit burglary--do you remember that? Judge Sirica gave them the maximum sentence, the maximum `John,' and that is when they testified. 
So I am sure these things are tough for Miss Lewinsky or anyone else. She had a choice whether she was going to cooperate and tell the truth or continue to hold fast to her previous story, and it does appear that she did for a while adhere to one story and then changed it. 
So I don't believe the independent counsel has placed himself above the law. I don't believe he has abused his office. And I don't believe most of the other complaints that have been made about the independent counsel, once the full facts are out, are going to suggest any problems. No doubt, there are so many complex rules over the period of an investigation, somebody will say you should have done this under this circumstance and you should not have done this under that circumstance. 
Normally what happens is any evidence obtained from an improper source gets excluded from the trial and can't be used, but it doesn't undermine the overall integrity of the investigation if that was obtained properly. 
So I don't know what the end of this will all be. It would please me if things get settled and that is the end of it and this body isn't involved. I don't think we need to be debating these issues on this floor, and the only reason I have spoken on this floor fundamentally is because others have made statements related to those issues, so I felt I ought to suggest there might be another interpretation that could be given to those issues. 
So, to me, the issues are complex. The House is dealing with this matter. Let's let the House deal with it. Let's try to make sure we have a bipartisan effort, or a nonpartisan effort, that no partisanship should be involved in this. Let's let the process work its way. My understanding of the reputation of Judge Starr is it is very good, and it remains to be seen whether he committed any error. If he did, that will come out. That does not undermine the basic facts we are dealing with here. 
Mr. President, I thank this body for allowing me to make these comments. I have some other things I could say but I will not. I just believe that we need to be careful. Let's let the House do their business. They have had votes over there. It is their business, not our business. And I think we would be better off if we left it there. I thank you. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I had the opportunity a few moments ago to hear the distinguished Senator from Delaware talk about his views and his analysis and his historical perspective from his extensive research on the question of impeachment. I found it instructive, full of much good insight and food for thought, and I agreed with the vast majority of it. 
We ought to be respectful and responsive as we go through this process. It may be that it will never even get to this body. I certainly don't hear many Senators making speeches about it. We don't have any hearings going on in this body concerning impeachment. It is solely a decision to be made by the House first, and only then would we begin to focus on it. And I think that is the way it should be. 
So far as I can tell, our attention in this body, the U.S. Senate, has in fact been on appropriations bills and other legislation that is important for the American people, and I am glad that is what has been happening. 
I agree that the founders were concerned about the abuse of the impeachment process, and well they should be. They were wise people. They knew there were dangers and they discussed whether or not to have impeachment. But the important thing is they did adopt an impeachment process and they set it forth in the Constitution with good clarity, and it requires a majority vote in the House to impeach and a two-thirds vote of the sitting Members of the U.S. Senate, with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presiding, I assume in the President's chair. He would preside and manage the action on the floor. It would be a controlled environment with the case being presented by managers from the House following the historical rules of procedure. I believe impeachment proceedings would be handled in a dignified and proper manner. Certainly, that process is part of our Constitution and it is something we ought not to treat lightly. 
Now, as to the question of politics, I, and I think every Member of this body, would be careful and very diligent to ensure that any decision they made concerning such a momentous subject as impeachment would be made on the law, on the facts, and on what is fair and just. 
I do not believe politics will control this process, but, of course, to get the 67 votes, the necessary two-thirds, a substantial number of Democrats would have to vote for conviction before such an event could occur. So I think the framers thought it out carefully, and they have done a very good job in planning it out. 
I hope that we do not talk politics in such a way that we create a political situation. I know the House is dealing with procedure: Some want to do it this way; some want to do it that way and some want to do it another way. Often these are legitimate debates. Who knows precisely how some of these procedural steps should be accomplished? Now, if every time you lose a vote you say it is politics and accuse the other side of politics, the charge of playing politics can be thrown back on the person making the accusation. 
I think both groups--the people who are supporting the President and want to see him succeed, and those who are politically opposed to him--both need to be careful to ensure that what they do is fair and is perceived as creating a positive environment, as was done by Senator Howard Baker during Watergate. He didn't always agree with everyone, but he conducted himself in a way that brought respect to the system. 
I think both parties, the Republican and the Democratic Parties, and Members of the House and Senate need to be careful about how we conduct ourselves and avoid politics and try to decide these matters on what is right and fair and just. 
I don't know what others might say, but I was a Federal prosecutor. I had the opportunity over the years to be before grand juries hundreds of times. Perhaps, I have presented a thousand cases to a grand jury. I have seen people testify and tell the truth at great pain to themselves. 
I would agree with Senator Biden that it just may be that as a matter of law, we are not in this body compelled to any conclusion because the President may have committed perjury. At the same time, I want us to not denigrate, not to too lightly respect the obligation of every citizen, when they are called in a civil case or a criminal case and placed under oath, to tell the truth, because when we do not have truth-telling in the judicial system, then the whole legal system is corrupted and can be undermined. That is so fundamental. 
I have seen witnesses sweat drops of blood, but they told the truth. A businessman lately told me: `I had to give a deposition and it never occurred to me I was not required to tell the truth.' 
A few years ago, I had occasion to prosecute a young police officer who was, basically, I think the driver for the chief of police, a controversial chief of police, in my hometown. I liked him. He was an aggressive young African-American officer and made some good community-based changes. There were people with different views about things, and the young officer made some statements that were not true, and a lawsuit was filed. He testified in that lawsuit and later admitted what he said was not true. 
It caused a big controversy in town, and in the newspapers. The people were upset, they didn't know whether the chief deserved to be kept in office or not. Finally, we found out it wasn't true. I was U.S. attorney then. We returned an indictment against that young officer for perjury in a civil case because he abused the legal system. He corrupted the legal system and caused great public damage and turmoil in the community. 
I don't know what the standards are here. I don't expect to be prejudging what ought to occur in this body. But I want to say, as someone who has spent 15 years, really 17 years as a prosecutor, as someone who has been in court all my life professionally, and having seen these kinds of cases, I am telling you, we don't ever want to get in a situation in this country where we treat lightly the act of testifying falsely in a court of law. I mean that very sincerely and from my heart. 
The President of the United States takes an oath to faithfully execute the duties of the Office of President, and one of those duties is to faithfully `take care that the laws of the United States be faithfully executed'. 
I think the Senator from Delaware has given us much insight and much food for thought. He said these are stark and momentous decisions, and they are. But at the same time, he said something else that was just right. He quoted his father saying, `This country is so big, so strong, so solid; we can handle an awful lot.' I really believe that. 
The process is set out in the Constitution and, as the Senator from Delaware said, this is not a constitutional crisis. Some way, we will get through it. If we follow what the Constitution says, if we let the House do its duty, and if they vote impeachment, it will come over here; if they don't vote impeachment, it won't come over here. It is set out clearly in the Constitution. I don't think there will be any doubt about the procedure to follow. I am much comforted, as I have studied the Constitution in that regard, that there won't be much confusion or doubt about how this process ought to be handled. 
I thank the Senator from Delaware for his comments. They are insightful and important. All of us need to begin to think about this. I don't think we are required to be mute and not say anything about what is obviously taking place around us, never expressing an opinion about anything relating to this matter. This is not that kind of process. I think we ought to be careful and respectful and, above all, fair and just as we do this process.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, on another subject, and the primary purpose of my being here this afternoon is to talk about the issue of tritium. It was a much debated issue in the Armed Services Committee bill. 
I thank the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Strom Thurmond, for his outstanding leadership, his commitment to this country and his dedication to America. He, at age 40, volunteered to fight--he was a judge--he forced his way into World War II, went off to Europe and volunteered on D-Day not just to land, he volunteered to get in one of the glider planes that they pulled up and let go and flew over the enemy lines and landed who knows where, in Belgium or somewhere near, to form commando groups to assist in the invasion effort. 
Senator Thurmond recounted, when they asked him how rough the landing was, `Well, I'll just say you didn't have to open the door, you could just walk out the side of the plane.' It is kind of hard to land one of those things in hedgerows and who knows what else when they are coming down. He served his country. 
I asked him, `What happened after the surrender of Germany? Were you there all the way to the surrender, Strom?' 
He said, `Yes,' he was there until the day of the surrender, and then he was put on a train and sent to the Pacific, but Japan surrendered before he reached the battlefront in the Pacific. 
He is a true patriot and has done an outstanding job on this entire defense bill--the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act. I do appreciate his willingness to work with us as we endeavored to reach a compromise on the question of tritium. 
There was a colloquy on the floor of this body yesterday between Senator Warner, Senator Kyl and Senator Robert Smith. Due to Hurricane Georges ravaging my hometown of Mobile, AL, I was not able to be here. 
But I appreciate Senator Warner's expressed concern for the people of our State during that colloquy. I would like to make a few comments, since I was not able to be here at that time. 
First and foremost, tritium is an essential element for maintaining the safety, security and reliability of a national nuclear weapons stockpile. Without it, as Senator Jon Kyl alluded to yesterday, we place our ability to meet our stockpile needs under the START I treaty, by 2005, in a precarious situation. 
Therefore, regardless of how passionate we may become in debating the merits of the options on this issue, let there be no doubt that the core of this discussion lies in the U.S. national interests. And we cannot compromise that issue. We cannot compromise the national security interests of the United States. 
For the last several years, the Department of Energy has been pursuing a dual-track strategy in considering two technologies for tritium production: One is a commercial light water reactor and the other a proton accelerator. I firmly believe it was premature for the House of Representatives to engage in a political effort that would have eliminated one of those options; that is, the commercial light water reactor option. 
I personally believe that the commercial light water reactor option would be the most cost-effective and is the most proven way to produce tritium. So, we will have that debate coming up next year. We will go into some detail about it. 
But beyond my own personal belief in the commercial light water reactor option, I continue to be committed to the support of the role that the experts at the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense must have to select the best option. We have had a process that has been going on for 2 years to have them analyze the options and make a selection. I believe they are better suited to deal with these technological questions than are Members of the House and the Senate. 
So I worked hard, along with Senator Shelby and Congressman Robert Aderholt and Bob Riley and Bud Cramer, and other Senate and House colleagues with the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House National Security Committee on this issue. 
We did what we could to raise the issue. We let everyone who would listen know we were making a mistake to allow the politics of the moment rule the day. The amendment to eliminate the commerical light water reactor option was never debated in the House, but was attached to a large defense bill, and boom, passed. There was no discussion or debate on a measure that interrupted and abrogated the almost 2 years of study on tritium production by the Department of Energy. 
There has been a lot of discussion about it. We concluded, according to recent CBO studies--that the accelerator option would cost between $4 billion and $13 billion more than the commercial light water reactor. That is a lot of money. We do not have $4, $5, $6, $7 billion or more to waste on that process. 
So we have not had the final decision. The Department of Energy is analyzing it. They need to be allowed to complete their analysis. And that is what I believe was achieved in this bill. The process was allowed to continue. It was delayed somewhat, but I do not think it was delayed too long. But the Department of Energy will make its decision. And next year I suppose we will make our decision in this body, and then in the other body, as to how tritium should be produced and in what process. 
So I am pleased that we have reached this accord. Senator Lott stated yesterday that `we cannot afford to delay this program.' I cannot agree more. And I hope this message is understood as we go forward to reaching a final solution on the production of tritium, an essential component for our nuclear arsenal. 
In June, I entered a number of letters in the Congressional Record on this issue. We had letters from the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Cohen, and from the then Secretary of Energy, Secretary PenAE6a, and the White House--all expressing grave concern about a political decision on a scientific, technical and defense issue. And Senator Carl Levin, my good friend from Michigan, was very strong in resisting this effort that had begun in the House of Representatives. So we now find ourselves on the right path again. 
Secretary Richardson needs to move forward deliberately and aggressively in selecting the proper option. The Department's implementation plan must be submitted early next year and should be carefully considered by this body, thoroughly debated and swiftly acted upon. 
The majority leader, Trent Lott, and others have indicated they will be thoroughly engaged in the debate when it comes. This is the next and logical step in the tritium story. Its outcome will provide a roadmap to a future guarantee for our Nation's security. I plan to be engaged in that important debate. I encourage my colleagues to do so as well. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. We both share a keen interest in space. I will also be speaking on the topic of the 40th anniversary of NASA, which is today. 
Mr. President, next month, from launch pad 39B at Cape Canaveral, the Space Shuttle's main engines will fire up, the solid rocket motors will ignite, and the crew of seven will be sent off into orbit around our home planet. One of those seven will be the distinguished Senator from Ohio. More than 36 years after his first flight, John Glenn will again orbit the earth in a United States spacecraft. 
I have here a picture of Senator Glenn taken 36 years ago with Dr. Wernher von Braun in Huntsville, Alabama, my home State. They are shown here discussing a proposed lunar landing craft. What an imagination, what a vision, what an exploring capacity they had. Shortly after that first orbital flight, they were already planning a trip to the moon--a vision that many thought could never be achieved and was achieved so successfully. 
Senator Glenn's remarkable story is a subplot to the remarkable story of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. On October 1, 1958, just six months before the distinguished Senator from Ohio was named as one of the original Mercury astronauts, NASA was born. Today, NASA marks its 40th anniversary of service to this Nation. 
It is hard to believe that more than 40 years have passed since the Soviet launch of Sputnik. Spurred by concern over the Soviet advantage in space, the Eisenhower administration proposed the creation of a civil space agency to lead our Nation in the exploration of space. Forty years later, the Soviet Union no longer exists. But NASA stands on the threshold of a new millennium, the undisputed world leader in space exploration. 
The agency's achievements and discoveries during that 40-year period have changed our world in many ways. Those who are familiar with the space program talk frequently of the many `spinoffs' from the program. There are, in fact, many products and services that are obviously and directly attributable to the space program. 
For instance, many Americans do not leave home in the morning before checking the weather forecast. Being from Mobile and just sitting through a hurricane, this was particularly true for me this past weekend. Of course, weather satellites orbiting the earth have revolutionized weather forecasting. Many of us check the forecast by turning on the television networks that distribute their signals by satellite. Indeed, I saw a writer interviewed recently. He said he realized just how significant this global communications system was when he was on a dirt road in Africa and he picked up a cell phone and, through a satellite, called his home in Ohio. 
There are a great number of beneficial byproducts of NASA's work that are less obvious. Indeed, many credit the micro-miniaturization of electronics, which was driven by the needs of the space program, with ushering in the whole technological revolution and the information age that we are now experiencing. 
As important as the tangible benefits from the space program have been, I believe the intangible benefits have been even more significant. What value can we assign to our victory in the space race--to our come-from-behind win against a totalitarian rival? What would have been the military and foreign policy implications of Soviet domination in outer space? 
But Cold War implications aside, NASA's success has been an important factor in elevating our national spirit. For America, exploration is imperative. We will never be content to sit back as observers while others take the risks and are rewarded with new discoveries. Exploration can take many forms, but, probably more than anyone else, NASA exemplifies our spirit of exploration. 
There was a time, earlier in our Nation's history, when Alabama and everything west of the Appalachians comprised the frontier. Today, space is the frontier. Since its inception 40 years ago, NASA has been charting the path in this new and exciting territory. 
On October 7, 1958, just one week after it came into existence, NASA formally approved Project Mercury to send a man into orbit around the earth, investigate his capabilities and reactions to space and return him safely to earth. Project Mercury produced genuine American heroes, like the late Alan Shepard and then-Lieutenant Colonel John Glenn. 
On May 25, 1961--shortly after Alan Shepard's suborbital flight, and months before Senator Glenn became the first American astronaut to orbit the earth in February of 1962--President Kennedy set a high mark for the young space program. Speaking to a joint session of Congress, he established a national goal of landing a man on the moon and bringing him safely back to earth, and this was to be accomplished before the decade was out. 
As we all know, the nation and NASA were up to the challenge. On July 20, 1969, an Apollo lunar landing craft carrying Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin touched down on the surface of the moon. That remarkable achievement stands as one of the proudest moments in American history, and one of the greatest achievements in the history of mankind. 
Since Apollo, NASA's accomplishments have been legion, in aeronautics as well as space, in unmanned exploration as well as human space flight. While it is hard to match the thrill of the first moon landing, the expansion of scientific knowledge flowing from NASA's later programs has truly been historic. 
As we look to the future, NASA cannot, and would not, rest on its laurels. Within the first few months after its 40th Anniversary, NASA will launch the STS-95 science mission, with Senator Glenn on board, will launch the first U.S. element of the International Space Station, and will launch its next great observatory, the Advanced X-Ray Astrophysics Facility. 
Following close on the heels of those missions will be the first flights of the X-34 technology demonstrator and the X-33 reusable launch vehicle prototype, as well as the launch of the U.S. Laboratory Module for the Space Station. 
All of this is scheduled to occur before this millennium closes. With proper support from the Administration, the Congress and the public, NASA will continue to lead the world in exploration well into the next millennium. 
I am proud of the role that my home state has played and continues to play in the space program. Even before NASA was formed, Dr. Wernher von Braun and his team of rocket scientists with the Army Ballistic Missile Agency in Huntsville were developing new rocket systems. A modified Jupiter-C rocket, developed by von Braun's team, answered Sputnik by placing the Explorer I Satellite into orbit on January 31, 1958. 
This is a remarkable picture taken at the ABMA Fabrication Lab in Huntsville in 1959. Shown here are the original seven Mecury astronauts, who are touring the facility with Dr. von Braun. From left to right we see: Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, John Glenn, Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, Deke Slayton, and Dr. von Braun. 
In 1960, 4000 employees of the ABMA in Huntsville were transferred to NASA's control, and Dr. von Braun became the first Director of the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center. Von Braun and the Marshall Center would be responsible for the Redstone rocket, which lifted Alan Shepard into outer space, and for the giant Saturn V rocket, which propelled Apollo 11 to the moon. 
Marshall Space Flight Center is still NASA's center of excellence for space propulsion, as well as NASA's lead center for Space Transportation Systems Development and for Microgravity Research. Companies and universities in Alabama also continue to play important roles in the space program. 
So I have reason to be proud of Alabama's contributions. But universities, corporations, and NASA installations throughout the country play important roles in the space program and in space-based research. Our whole nation can be proud of our accomplishments in space, and in NASA's important aeronautics research. 
We have succeeded because we are willing to take risks. And we have been unwilling to quit when we encounter difficulties and setbacks. 
The tragic Apollo fire cost the lives of three brave astronauts. But we persevered, and the Apollo program made giant leaps for mankind. 
During launch in 1973, the Skylab space station sustained damage that threatened to render it useless before it ever was put into service. Creative engineering salvaged that very important program. 
The Challenger explosion in 1986 was a terribly painful event. We all mourned with the families of those brave explorers. But, following that tragedy, NASA was able to regroup, and has since safely flown 65 Space Shuttle missions, with a tremendous harvest of scientific results. 
Perhaps it is this knack for overcoming adversity that makes NASA so special. Space is a harsh environment, and setbacks are inevitable. The risks are real. But NASA has done an extraordinary job of coping with the difficult situations that they have confronted. Many times the people of NASA have turned potential failures into remarkable successes. 
Now, as we stand on the threshold of a new century--indeed, a new millennium--our whole nation can be proud as we look back on NASA's accomplishments in its first 40 years. And we can be optimistic as we look ahead. 
Optimistic that our spirit of exploration is alive and well. Optimistic that we will continue to see tangible and intangible fruit from our investment in space. Optimistic that our children's lives will be richer because we dare to reach for the stars. 
Mr. President, I congratulate NASA on its 40th anniversary. I look forward to continuing to work hard to support this program in the future. Unfortunately, the administration's budget for the last 4 years has shown a net reduction in funding for NASA. I have spoken on that before. The budget we approved this year represents a small reduction again this year over last year's budget for NASA. I think it is time that we recognize our character as a nation, that we not cut NASA, that we recognize that it symbolizes who we are as a people. We should recognize that NASA symbolizes our best and highest instincts as a nation, and that we ought to be space explorers as Lewis and Clark explored the frontier, and as we have explored the seas and so many things. 
Mr. President, I want to again say how much I have been honored to serve with astronaut Glenn, Colonel Glenn, and Senator Glenn. He has been a high representative of this Senate. We cheer him on again as he goes forward to his next flight 36 years after the first.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would also like to offer remarks that I have prepared as we celebrate today the first balanced budget in 30 years. I had occasion to be elected to the Senate on a number of issues, but none more important than a commitment to work for that goal just 2 years ago. 
I remember when I first got here, Secretary of Treasury Rubin was testifying before the Judiciary Committee on the question of whether we needed a balanced budget constitutional amendment that would mandate that we balance the budget. He said we did not. He said they had a plan that would balance the budget by 2002. 
I was new. I had been told that Secretary Rubin was quite a skillful witness and that I should be careful. I said, `Mr. Secretary, that is a nice promise you made. But the truth is you won't be here in 2002 as Secretary of the Treasury, will you?' Without hesitating, he said, `Well, I haven't talked to the Vice President yet.' But I was left with a thought that, well, President Clinton would not be here constitutionally as President past his two full terms, and that he could not make a promise that we could balance the budget long after he left office. 
So I just say that to say that less than 2 years ago there was great doubt in our country and among our public policy leaders that we would, in fact, be able to balance the budget. 
This Congress has stepped forward and has made some tough decisions. It has worked with the administration. It has put caps on spending that are holding. And we have now produced a balanced budget amendment with maybe a $70 billion surplus. 
When I traveled across the state two years ago during my campaign for the Senate, I learned that foremost in the minds of Alabamians regarding the future of our country was the economic legacy we as taxpayers were creating for our children. At the time, that legacy meant budget deficits as far as the eye could see. I believe that part of the reason why I was elected to the Senate was because of my promise to change that legacy by supporting a balanced budget, and to do so by cutting spending and eliminating fraud and abuse. 
Today, I am proud to witness as a Member of Congress, the first balanced budget in thirty years. It is an historic event much as Neil Armstrong's first steps taken on the Moon in 1969--the last year there was no budget deficit. 
As a result of this achievement, the American taxpayer is enjoying historically low interest rates on mortgages, car loans, and students loans. Those who could only dream of buying a home are becoming homeowners. Automobiles are more affordable than ever. And students with college loans are finding the burden of their debt lessened as they graduate and enter the workforce. 
Businesses are benefitting as well. Lower interest rates mean more money to invest in capital, and expanded capital means more jobs. The unemployment rate is at an historic low of 4.5 percent. The effects of this tight labor market combined with such low interest rates has meant returns to workers in the form of higher wages. Indeed, income for the typical American household rose at nearly twice the rate of inflation in 1997. 
There are many people that deserve credit for this historic achievement, but none more than the American people. It is the American people that created a mandate for a balanced budget by electing those of us to office who would make it their number one priority to put the country's books in the black. I am proud to be part of that mandate. It is a Republican Congress who responded to this mandate by producing a balanced budget and doing it ahead of schedule. If this responsibility had been left to the President, today we would have a $196 billion deficit, which he called for in his 1996 budget. 
But it is not enough to balance the budget just once. Now that we have achieved a balance, we need to maintain it. Interest rates don't respond to what the deficit is today. They respond to what people think the deficit is going to be in the future, and big hurdles remain before a future of balanced budgets can be assured. Today, we begin a new fiscal year with a surplus of $63 billion. Yet, hard choices regarding spending must still be made in order to preserve Social Security and Medicare, as well as cut taxes in order to keep the economy and families strong. 
It is a time to celebrate, and I think we should pause and be grateful. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I too am concerned about the tritium production decision and its future funding. My position over the last several months focused on the debate to retain the decisionmaking authority of DOE so that the Department might be free to make the most technically feasible, cost-effective decision to meet our national defense needs. I share the concerns of my colleagues about the delay of implementation and the need for adequate funding, and I am hopeful that DOE will include full funding for a tritium production source, not only in fiscal year 2000, but in the outyears as well.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning a specific land conveyance provision in the DoD Authorization Bill (section 2837). I am pleased that the conferees were able to make these technical, but necessary changes to the conveyance terms of real property from the Army's Redstone Arsenal to the Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission. 
Section 2837 of the Bill ensures that the future development of the U.S. Space & Rocket Center property previously conveyed by the Army to the appropriate agency of the State of Alabama will remain consistent with the long term master plan for the use of that property as agreed upon by the Center, Redstone Arsenal, and Marshall Space Flight Center, and that present financing arrangements and mortgages relating to new and existing facilities at the Space and Rocket Center are preserved, and appropriate coordination of further financing initiatives, mortgages and other debt society arrangements in accordance with the agreed-upon master plan is assured.

Mr. SESSIONS. I really appreciate Senator Leahy and his leadership as ranking member on the Judiciary Committee. I would suggest, with regard to juvenile justice, that we have not had a year of inaction, as the Senator said. There were 100 changes proposed, and most of those in an apparently futile attempt to gain the support of Democratic Members who have been using procedural tactics to block the consideration of that bill. 
The bill came out of the Judiciary Committee on a 12-6 vote, and with bipartisan support. Since that time, we have sought to gain additional support from the Democratic side. I have been a prosecutor for almost 20 years. I believe in this bill. It is not a political bill. It is a bill that provides resources and support and strength right to the local juvenile courts throughout America. It is in those courts where the real progress is being made in fighting juvenile crime. 
I see the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Ohio. A few months ago we had the opportunity to meet in Ohio with a juvenile judge, Judge Grossman, who allowed us to witness a model program in action. In this program the judges have the resources and the capacity to confront youngsters when they are first arrested for juvenile crimes, and the judges also have the option to do something effective to confront those children and to change them from the road of destruction on which they are too often headed. A community may have alternative schools. It may have boot camps. It may have intensive probation supervision. 
In Ohio, Judge Grossman has a truancy program with trials conducted in the schoolroom with the Judge present. These are the kind of programs that can actually deter juvenile crime in America. 
That is the heart and soul of this juvenile justice bill. I hope somehow, some way we can get a vote on it this time. It has been frustrating that we have not been able to do that yet. The National Juvenile Judges Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the Boy's and Girl's Club, and organization after organization have supported this piece of legislation. I don't think there is any group more interested and more professionally concerned than the National Juvenile Judges Association. They have spent a good bit of time analyzing it, and they support it. This bill certainly represents a very important step forward. 
I thank this body and I thank the Presiding Officer for his leadership on juvenile crime and juvenile justice. It is a matter close to my heart. The Presiding Officer is a former prosecutor who has given intensive leadership to that issue. 
The legislation we have today is a product of bipartisan compromise and a lot of hard work. I think it is an excellent bill and it will be a tragedy, indeed, if for partisan reasons we are not able to bring it forward. 
The House has acted on good legislation. If we can get our legislation passed, even in these last few days--I know the time is short--if we can get ours passed and go to conference and work together one more time, we could pass a bill that the people of this country would be proud of and would, in fact, allow us to intervene in the lives of kids who are going wrong and get them on the right track. Sometimes that takes tough intervention. Sometimes they need to go to a boot camp or detention facility or alternative school. 
We need to help encourage States to do that. Mr. President, I thank the occupant of the Chair for his time and his leadership on this matter.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was taken aback this morning after reading statements made by Vice President Gore that appeared in an article detailing the decision made by the Energy and Water Appropriations conference committee to eliminate Federal funding for the Tennessee Valley Administration's non-power programs. Funding for these TVA programs has been going on since TVA's inception. It has been pared down very much, year after year after year, until it has reached an amount that really can fund only the maintenance of the waterway, the dams, the flow of water, and reservoirs contained therein. 
The conference committee has determined and has decided that funding for these programs will be eliminated. I am extremely disappointed in that. I want to say a few things about this decision and how it came about, but first I want to comment on what the Vice President said in today's AP story. According to published accounts, Vice President Gore said he was deeply disappointed in these program reductions. Then he said, `The conference committee's action in zeroing out TVA is completely misguided, unjustified, unfair, and it seriously undermines TVA's important role in enhancing the Tennessee Valley.' 
That is what the Vice President said, `* * * completely misguided, unjustified, unfair, and it seriously undermines TVA's important role in * * * the Tennessee Valley.' 
I agree that the decision to eliminate this funding is unfair because for the first time the ratepayer, the Tennessee Valley power payers, will be asked to keep up a waterway, even though every other waterway in America is kept up by taxpayers, through either the Corps of Engineers or other agencies. This is a major change and I think it was an unwise decision. 
Mr. President, just 2 years ago this administration took action that directly led to this result. There has been debate for some time as to whether or not we ought to fund the Tennessee Valley Authority in this way. Two years ago this President and this Vice President, working through the Office of Management and Budget, which is a part of this administration, submitted a budget to this Congress that zeroed out nonpower funding for the Tennessee Valley Authority. The last time I checked, the Vice President was a part of this administration. 
Now, those of us who opposed the Administration's decision are in trouble. There was a debate about reducing TVA's funding. People took different sides on it. The chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority is a personal friend of the Vice President. The Vice President helped the current TVA chairman get his appointment and the Vice President consults with him regularly. Initially, the TVA chairman said he thought the Administration's funding reductions were a good idea and he supported the Clinton Administration's position. We asked him to reconsider. Chairman Crowell held hearings and studied the issue and came back and said he didn't think the Administration's position was a good idea after all; he changed his mind. 
What I am saying, Mr. President, is that we are `living in spin' in this city. It offends me. It is a matter of basic integrity. I am just a former prosecutor from Alabama. I haven't been in this body 2 years. Maybe you are supposed to become immune to these things. I am not immune to it yet. When the Vice President says, `It is completely misguided, unjustified, unfair,' and yet 2 years ago he submitted a budget to do the very thing he is now criticizing, it strikes me as somewhat unusual and unfair and unjustified for him to say that. 
The reason this funding failed and the reason the conference committee succeeded over my objection and over the objection of Senators Thompson, Frist, Shelby and others involved in the Tennessee Valley, was because of the impetus given to this effort by this administration when, along with their chairman of TVA, they supported proposed funding reductions 2 years ago. Once the Administration supported it and said it was a good idea--and were joined in this belief by the TVA leadership itself--it was almost impossible to change the decisionmaking momentum. I am disappointed. I remember that a little over a year ago we held a TVA caucus meeting with the chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Mr. Craven Crowell. During this meeting Mr. Crowell met with Members of the House of Representatives and with Senators who live in the area and who care about the Tennessee Valley. This meeting gave us the opportunity to come together and share information and discuss issues of importance regarding how to make TVA work better. I asked if he had discussed with the President of the United States, President Clinton, the zeroing out of funding for TVA's nonpower resources, and Mr. Crowell said yes. I said, `Have you talked with the Office of Management and Budget?' and Mr. Crowell replied, `Yes, I spend a lot of time with them.' Then I asked, knowing that the Vice President is from Tennessee and had previously been involved in TVA, `Did you talk with the Vice President about it,' and Mr. Crowell said the Vice President `knew about it.' 
So, now we have it. More spin in the Capitol. The President and Vice President personally engaged in recommending the zeroing out of this budget item 2 years ago and now they are coming forward to attack those who carried out what they recommended. In fact, the budget the President submitted has zero dollars for nonpower in the Tennessee Valley. 
Whatever happens with this issue and what we will do about it, I don't know. I continue to adhere to the belief that it is unfair to ask the people who live there to fund the waterway maintenance and upkeep--that is what we are talking about--when no other place in the country does it that way. The taxpayers, through the Corps of Engineers or other agencies, do that throughout the country. 
It shocks my conscience and doesn't enhance my respect for the credibility, integrity, and the honesty of the Vice President to have him make the kind of comments I quoted earlier. In truth, had the President and Vice President not supported reducing this funding 2 years ago, it would not be passing now. I think most people who keep up with the details of this situation know what I am saying is true.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kohl and Senator Durbin for their leadership and commitment on this issue and others. This is simply a matter of fairness. The Constitution of the United States authorizes the bankruptcy system and provides for Congress to establish uniform bankruptcy laws. That is a matter that is without dispute. All bankruptcy cases are held in Federal court. It is not too much to ask, since we set every other rule involving bankruptcy, that this body would consider the abuses that arise from the disparity in treatment of homesteads throughout the country. It is really a shocking matter. 
The New York Times has written about this on a number of occasions and has given some of the examples that are afoot. 
The First American Bank and Trust Company in Lake Worth, FL, closed in 1989, and its chief executive, Roy Talmo, filed for personal bankruptcy in 1993. Despite owing $6.8 million, Mr. Talmo was able to exempt a bounty of assets. During the proceedings, he drove around Miami in a Rolls-Royce and tended the grounds of his $800,000 tree farm in Boynton Beach. Never one to slum it, Mr. Talmo had a 7,000 square-foot mansion with five fireplaces, 16th century European doors and a Spanish-style courtyard, all on a 30-acre lot. Yet in Mr. Talmo's estimation, this was chintzy. He also owned an adjacent 112 acres and he tried to add those acres to his homestead. 
The court finally refused to allow this 112 acres, but he was able to keep his homestead, live in this huge house, and keep all this money that ought to have been shared with his creditors. Bankruptcy is to help people start over again. It is not to help them defeat their creditors and remain millionaires. 
There is example after example in this New York Times article. Talmadge Wayne Tinsley maintained his house during bankruptcy and then he sold his house for $3.5 million, using the proceeds to write a check to the Internal Revenue Service and another one to pay off the mortgage. That left him $700,000 after closing costs and other expenses were deducted from the proceeds. 
In other words, if you have a multimillion-dollar mansion and go into bankruptcy, you put all your money--except what is in your house--into the bankruptcy pot that trickles out to the people to whom you owe money. You keep the house. As soon as your bankruptcy is over, you can turn around and sell this multimillion-dollar house and live like a king. That is why people are moving to Florida and Texas on the eve of filing bankruptcy. 
I live in Alabama. We have a very low homestead exemption, but it is only 50 miles from my home of Mobile to Pensacola, FL. Somebody from Mobile could easily move to Pensacola, buy a huge beach home, and then defraud his Alabama creditors. 
Some think this is a State matter. Senator Kohl talked about this. They say it is an advantage to the State. But the truth is, 90 percent of the people who abuse this system on the homestead--90 percent of their debts are going to be debts in their own State. So really it is a situation in which we have some Senators who are supposedly protecting State interests, but really they are not. I encourage these Senators to think about it. They are not protecting State interests because what this does is allow a scandal to take place. The people who most frequent lose in this process will be the lenders in their own States. That is just not fair. I believe the Bankruptcy Commission has listed this as one of their top priorities for reform. 
I can see how some Senators may not really be familiar with the bankruptcy process and might think they want to preserve their State systems. But bankruptcy is a classical Federal matter. It is set forth in the Constitution as a Federal matter. All bankruptcy cases are handled in Federal court, not State courts, and the bankruptcy court sets all the rules in almost every category. This is just one that we have, by tradition, allowed to be nonuniform. As a matter of fact, it has been challenged in the Supreme Court, on the basis that the nonuniformity violates the Constitution.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I do respect the concern of the Senator from Florida. As a Federal prosecutor for almost 15 years in Alabama, which is part of the 11th circuit, of which Florida is a part--the 11th circuit, I have come to admire and be extremely impressed with the workload and work ethic of the Florida Federal judges, as well as the Alabama Federal judges. Both groups have very high caseloads, higher than the national average. I think probably the middle district of Florida, and maybe the southern district of Florida, are two of the top districts in the country in so needing additional judges. The middle district of Alabama, as you noted, has one of the very highest caseloads. 
I would share, this bankruptcy bill actually reduces the workload for Federal district judges a bit by not having them handle appeals from bankruptcy. That is the only thing it really affects for Federal district judges, because bankruptcy judges are separate. 
I would just want to advise the Senator from Florida, I share his concern, but I have been working with Senator Grassley, who chairs this subcommittee involving courts and administrative matters. He has been studying this. We have been having some hearings from judges, particularly courts of appeals. But we have not, in depth, analyzed this problem yet. I know Senator Grassley intends to. 
I would like to share some things. If a business had a court like the middle district of Florida that not only has a heavy caseload--it has complicated, big drug cases, international cases--they would probably look at the D.C. circuit that has 15 judges and they average 259 cases per judge instead of 855 in Florida and they might decide the taxpayers--or their business--would be better served if we shifted some from places that are not so busy to those that are more busy. I hope we will be able to analyze that, because a Federal judgeship, once you approve it, is a lifetime appointment. They get it for life and it costs $1 million a year for each Federal judge. What we need to begin to look at is some of those circuits that need to shift some judges to high-work districts. We could do that over the years. I think Senator Grassley is committed to this. I am on that subcommittee so I am concerned about it. If we do it right, we can improve justice with a minimal cost to the taxpayer. I think that is what we are called to do and I thank the Senator from Florida for raising the problem.

 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to speak to you about Jim Solomon, who is retiring from his position as head of the Alabama Attorney General's Opinions Division after 35 years of service to the state of Alabama. 
This division fields legal advice requests from all over the state of Alabama, with the majority of the requests coming from local government officials having various questions concerning ambiguities in state laws. While opinions are not legally binding, they are used as guidelines by the various entities in developing public policy. Therefore, correct interpretation of Alabama laws are essential to the smaller communities and agencies that do not have a legal staff. Mr. Solomon's contributions to this effort have been extraordinary and should be noted. 
I had the honor of working with Mr. Solomon during my term as the Attorney General of Alabama. He was an outstanding employee who believed in service above self. He never strayed from this work ethic during his 19 years in that office. He served as a role model to others and was someone who could always be counted on regardless of the job or the circumstances. His administrative and supervisory abilities were superior and he was greatly loved by those with whom he worked. One of his most impressive achievements was the indexing of all Opinions from 1979 forward, making it possible for the public to have access to them on the Internet. 
During Mr. Solomon's employment in the Opinions Division, he was responsible for writing approximately 8,000 Opinions for state and local officials. One of the most memorable opinions caused the previously closed state legislative committee meetings to open to the public. 
Jim Solomon is more than a great public servant. He possesses in rich measure the qualities that made for a great citizen, a strong churchman, a faithful family man and a good friend to many. He sets high standards and a good example for all of us. 
Mr. President, I appreciate being able to make these brief comments to my fellow colleagues because it is important that Jim Solomon be recognized for his years of outstanding service to Alabama.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this Feingold amendment is directly contrary to the purpose of the bill that Senator Grassley has worked so hard for. It requires no fee for filing under chapter 7, where the debtor wipes out all his debts. However, the amendment does require a fee under chapter 13, where the debtor pays back a portion of his debt. Therefore, it would encourage filings under chapter 7, when we believe more people should file under chapter 13. 
This Congress has considered this issue before and rejected it. The National Bankruptcy Commission just completed a long study of bankruptcy and did not call for the elimination of this fee. The United States Supreme Court in 1973 squarely held that it is constitutional. The bankruptcy system should discourage frivolous filings. 
Furthermore, this amendment provides no standard for the judge to decide who in bankruptcy ought to pay and who ought not to pay. And, in addition to that, it would clog the courts with multiple hearings regarding who should pay the $160 filing fee. In addition, bankruptcy law currently allows filing fees to be paid in four installments. When a person files bankruptcy, they are able to stop paying all of their debt. Debtors are able to pay the filing fee because all other obligations have been tolled under the automatic stay. 
This amendment will result in additional court hearings that distract the bankruptcy court from its primary purpose. This practice will be encourage filings under chapter 7 when filing under chapter 13 would be more appropriate. People who can pay a portion of their debt ought to be accountable for that amount. 
I believe that this amendment will cost millions. In fact, based on the number of filings last year, we could be talking about $100 million in costs. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Idaho for sharing this information with us. I have, of course, in the course of my tenure as Senator in the last 2 years, had some of the same experiences in Alabama with plans for managing Federal lands. I believe we can do a better job of it. I thank him for sharing that with us. 
This morning, the President has appeared at the United Nations and spoken to that body. While he is there, I hope he will take the time to take a second look at his proposal to build a new United States mission office at the United Nations. 
The Environmental and Public Works Committee, on which I serve and which deals with public buildings, had hearings last week and was asked to approve a resolution which would allow funding to be provided to design a new Federal building to house 
the U.S. mission to the United Nations. The Clinton administration's proposal makes clear that frugality and respect for the taxpayers' money is not a part of this plan. 
The current building, which is just 40 years old, is located at 799 United Nations Plaza, just across the street from the U.N. building in New York. The prospectus, the proposal, of the General Services Administration, who had managed the building of the new structure, requests our committee to approve a plan that would call for the demolition of the existing building and the construction of a new building which would be the most expensive office building per square foot the U.S. Government has ever built. 
I asked Ambassador Burleigh and the representative from GSA about this. They did not dispute my assertion that this would be, in fact, the most expensive office building in history. According to the General Services Administration, the U.N. mission building total project costs for the 141,000-square-foot building would amount to $53 million, or $378 per square foot. 
However, this estimate does not tell the whole story. The rest of the story is that there is another part of the Federal Government that will be contributing to this situation. The State Department is seeking an additional $24 million to spend on security, telecommunications, and the overall State Department oversight of this construction. These additional costs will bring the total project costs for this United States mission--which is really an office building--to the United Nations to at least $77 million, or a whopping $548 per square foot. 
To put $548 per square foot into perspective, consider that the Islip, NY, courthouse, complete with all kinds of security features to keep judges and juries and defendants separate within its halls, came in with a total project cost of $262 per square foot, and that was extraordinarily expensive. 
The Foley Square Court House in New York City, accused by many to be grossly overpriced and a waste of taxpayers' money, has a record project cost of $440 per square foot. 
Now, courthouses are somewhat expensive. They are and should be august buildings. Courtrooms have to have high ceilings. You don't want a big courtroom looking like a little office space. You do need to have some marble, good paneling, big courtrooms. Every judge needs a courtroom to try the case and do the people's business. So courthouses are not really good comparisons to an office building because they ought to be more expensive. But this $548 exceeds any Federal courthouse expenditures we have. 
Now, they say, this is in Manhattan and real estate is expensive there and that explains the cost of this building. But that is not so because we already own the land. This land was given to the United States for the U.S.-U.N. mission office by the Rockefeller family many years ago. So we have no real estate costs in this project.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have seen a lot of home runs hit lately--McGwire, Sosa, Griffey and company--but I think the Senator from Iowa has hit a home run. He is bringing to this Senate body his deeply held values arising out of his Midwest background about responsibility and integrity, making a system work like it ought to work, and standing up with courage and challenging those who would abuse the system. 
I think sometimes Congress passes laws that make it easy for people to abuse the system. Senator Grassley is taking the lead as the prime sponsor for this bill, with Senator Durbin, to correct some imbalances. I have been honored to have served on the subcommittee with him and the other members of that subcommittee and to see a bankruptcy bill come forward that actually improves the bankruptcy process while at the same time not denying those who need bankruptcy the right and opportunity to file bankruptcy as is provided for in our Constitution. 
With regard to these attorneys' fees and to one of the provisions that would be eliminated by Senator Feingold's amendment, I would like to make a couple comments. 
First of all, the Feingold amendment would say that if somebody filed under chapter 7--that is, straight bankruptcy that wipes out all of your debts--and they were not substantially justified in that circumstance, then the trustee would have to file a motion to object and have a hearing and be paid for out of his funds. And if he prevailed, it would go into chapter 13, where the person filing bankruptcy would at least have to pay back a substantial part of his debts on a monthly basis in a payout plan, which we need more of in this country. 
But the point is this. If the lawyer was not substantially justified in filing his client under chapter 7, and we had to conduct a court hearing to get the case transferred to chapter 13 because of his error, then who ought to pay? Under the Feingold amendment, the people who loaned money to the debtor would pay for the cost of getting the case transferred, instead of the lawyer who filed it. 
It doesn't just say the lawyer was in error. It said he was not `substantially justified' in filing. 
The judges know who these lawyers are. They see them come before the courts all the time. The judges are going to give the lawyers a fair shake on these matters. They are not going to hit them every time a case is certified from chapter 7 to 13. But, if the attorney was not substantially justified in filing the case under Chapter 7, the debtor ought to pay. There is no free lunch. Somebody will pay. 
I think the Senator from Iowa is correct. The Feingold amendment does undermine the integrity of the system. It takes the burden off of the lawyer, allows him to freely file wherever he wants. There is no burden on him to file it under the right act. 
Once again, this is a historic bill and a good bill. I wish we could do some additional things which I believe are important. However, it does many, many things that are important and will improve a bankruptcy system that is out of control. It is to Senator Grassley's credit that at a meeting with Members of the other party he agreed to a long list of amendments to be debated; I think 16. We need to move this bill. I thought we were down here this afternoon for people to offer amendments; they would offer them and debate them so we could vote on them and get on with this bill. 
I have been in this body less than 2 years now, but it seems to me there are people who just don't want anything to pass. They want to go into November and say, `The Republicans don't want to pass any legislation. They have a majority. We can't get legislation passed.' 
If people have a right to present amendments and won't come to the floor, how will we get the bill up for a vote? It is almost a filibuster in secret--an underground filibuster. 
I have been on Senator Grassley's subcommittee and I care about this bill. We are interested in approving the bill if the amendments are good, and we need to oppose the amendments if they are not good. I think it is time for people who say they want good legislation to improve justice in America to present amendments. Let's get on with this legislation. The House has acted. It is time for the Senate to do our job. The result will be something good for America. 
It was not a partisan bill in committee. It had overwhelming support in the subcommittee and came out of the full Senate Judiciary Committee 16-2, Democrats and Republicans alike joining in this amendment. I don't know why we aren't able to proceed and bring it to a vote and pass it. We have the kind of bill that will help this country. We ought not wait any longer. It is time to pass it. 
I just note for the record that the Presiding Officer is a member of the Judiciary Committee and has been very supportive of this legislation and helped work hard to improve it. I thank the Chair for his leadership and skill as an attorney to contribute to this debate. 
I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, with regard to the Feingold amendment that deals with the waiver of filing fees for those who file bankruptcy, I think we need to be very cautious about that amendment. It has very serious implications. It has been considered by this Senate numerous times and rejected. 
It has been the argument that this is somehow unfair and denies access to the court system. Courts themselves have denied this argument repeatedly. In fact, the United States Supreme Court has rejected this position. Fees run from around $110 to $160. By that time, the filer would have already hired a lawyer, probably for much more than that. 
I have here an ad of a lawyer in Texas who says: `Bankruptcy can be a smart financial move.' He does not say that bankruptcy is a way to take care of unacceptable debts that you have no chance of paying. This is the what we used to think bankruptcy was for: to help those who, through various circumstances, have found themselves hopelessly in debt. This man says: `Bankruptcy can be a smart financial move.' 
It can be a smart financial move. You can legally--under the current law--defeat legitimate debts. You can just walk away from them, as this man says `For $350 total.' And the truth is, that is why we have increased filings of these kinds of advertisements in phone books, in newspapers, in magazines, in the yard sale publications that are passed out free in this country. 
These people go to their lawyers and they quit paying all their debts, and they then file for bankruptcy. Virtually every court filing in America requires a fee. And this is a reasonable fee. This fee has so been upheld by the courts. Somebody will pay for the cost of these filings, if it is not going to be those who use this system, then the taxpayers will pay for it. We are talking about a large amount of money and a drain on the system. Also, it would create a large number of court hearings, adding to an already crowded docket. 
I am a critic of our court systems on occasion, but I must say that the bankruptcy courts have, done an outstanding job, Mr. President, in handling an ever-increasing caseload. The caseload has doubled. We have not had a doubling of the judges, but they have used computers, they have used staff people, they have used sophisticated measurement techniques, and they have been able to keep up with their caseloads without a massive expansion of the number of bankruptcy judges. 
If bankruptcy courts are going to have a hearing on everybody that comes before them to determine whether or not there is any way they can pay their filing fee, then we are going to have to add severe costs to the system and more overloading. Judges, along with lawyers and clerks representing people on both sides will run up expenses that could, in fact, exceed the real cost of the filing fee in this matter. 
I understand the sentiments behind this amendment. It is something that has been considered for years, rejected consistently, and upheld by the courts. It is a road we should not go down. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to express my appreciation for the remarks of the Senator from West Virginia, and to take this moment to repeat again to him how much I appreciated his remarkable address earlier this week in the Old Senate Chamber in the majority leader's Lecture Series on the History of the Senate. He had the largest crowd I can remember. He had the rapt attention of virtually every Senator as he shared with us the great traditions of this body. Of course, we know that he has written a three-volume history on the U.S. Senate. On Fridays, I am often in the Chair that the Presiding Officer is in today, and I had the occasion to hear him address this body. 
I have written two letters congratulating Senators on speeches, and they have both been to Senator Byrd. I remember one of his speeches talked about education. He referred to our textbooks as `touchy, feely twaddle.' Too often, I think, they don't have or possess the power of the great historians to uplift, causing us to think and dream about heroic acts. He shared with us on one of those occasions his experience in the two-room schoolhouse where he grew up. I thought then of my grandmother who taught in a one-room schoolhouse. I remember the schoolhouse as I was growing up. Although it has been torn down now, I remember in her library--I don't know how she obtained it--was Macauley's `History of England,' Gibbon's `The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,' Shakespeare, and other great literary works. She shared those with the elementary schoolchildren in those schoolrooms. 
I am of a belief that they were richly educated in that one-room schoolhouse. There is something more significant than color pictures and videos in transmitting what it is that we are about as a people. 
I taught in the sixth grade 1 year, and we used what they called Basil Readers. They wrote stories in little pieces, and at the end of them were a lot of questions, and in each story they would add new words. It was all scientifically done, you see. It was to teach them vocabulary and things of that nature. But the children hated them and would not read those books. And around the classroom--it was an old class school--there were a lot of books like I had in my schoolroom--Daniel Boone, the old bluecoat, the Hardy Boys, Tom Swift. And so I started encouraging them to read those books, and they loved them because they were stories that had some meaning and some adventure and showed people in situations which required courage. 
At any rate, I say to Senator Byrd, thank you for sharing your opinions with us. You can have a $500 textbook, but if it has no moral message, no meaning to it, does not uplift the spirit and no one wants to read it, then that textbook is not worth very much. Too often I think that is the problem with modern education. 
I, again, say how much I appreciate the Senator's remarks and the Senator's leadership in this Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his comments. I do share his views about teachers. My grandmother, in her first job--and I have a photograph of the class--had a real rough looking group of poor kids, no doubt. But in that group was an individual who may have been somewhat inspired by her and who went on to become a U.S. Congressman, Frank Boykin, a man of some note. 
I always claim that whatever he learned, he learned in that first through sixth grade schoolroom when she taught there. 
So I think teachers do inspire us. Good teachers understand and are knowledgeable and learned people themselves, and they can then share that. Sometimes I think we spend too much time on process rather than on substance. 
I again express my appreciation to Senator Byrd for his leadership of this body, this Senate, for reminding us on a regular basis of what we are about, our heritage here, and calling us to our best and highest instincts. 
Thank you, Senator Byrd.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there are a number of problems that have contributed to the increase in bankruptcies in this country. We are now considering what I believe to be a historic and exceptionally fine bankruptcy bill. It came out of the Judiciary Committee with a 16-2 vote, demonstrating overwhelming support from Democrats and Republicans. This legislation is something that we need to pass. But in some ways, the filing of a bankruptcy petition is the cleaning up of spilled milk. The milk has already been spilled, and it is difficult then to have any kind of fair and just determination or allocation of assets, and many problems arise from it. 
What we need today is more people who manage their money well. The generation that grew up during the Depression, like my father and mother, knew how to manage their money. They were cautious. Maybe they didn't make great sums of money and great investments, but they took care of themselves and their families through frugal living--and I mean frugal living. In my background, oftentimes it was very tough for us to fund the things that we felt we would like to have. However, what we have is a generation that has not been taught how to manage money. 
Today, more people have credit available to them. Frankly, I am not one of those who says the problem is that you can get access to credit. It would be a terrible thing in this country if you could not get a credit card, if you had to have a $40,000-a-year income before anybody would give you a credit card. A credit card is a very valuable thing for a person on a low income when they are trying to work and take care of their families. When they have a flat tire or a $400 car repair bill and they don't have $400 in their pocket, they can use a credit card to pay for it now and the pay it off over a period of months. This way they would not have to deny their family food, or not be able to get to work because of an automobile that he does not have the money to fix. Those are the kinds of things that are good. 
I don't see how we need to be critical of the fact that many credit card companies are offering cards. For the first time, credit card companies are beginning to get competitive. I have been very displeased with the high rates of interest some of these cards charge. For the first time now, they are soliciting business and offering lower interest rates. I think that is a good thing, also. 
But, fundamentally, we get into trouble because we don't have enough discipline and ability to manage the debt that we face. The way to deal with bankruptcy, fundamentally, is to educate the public on how to manage money. So this bill, for the first time in history, provides debtor education. It provides it both before filing and before you can be discharged from bankruptcy. 
I was pleased to offer the consumer credit counseling amendment. I was very pleased, and thrilled, actually, that it received so much support and was made a part of this bill. 
Let me just say this, Mr. President. I live in Mobile, AL, and I began to talk with people I know and respect about debt matters. I served with and go to church with an individual who is a bankruptcy administrator in Mobile. I know some of the bankruptcy judges. I have spent time talking with them about the problems with bankruptcy. Mr. Travis Bedsole and I both taught the same Sunday school class together over the years. We had some heart-to-hearts about what we really ought to do that would help people. When you have the ads that you see in the newspapers and on television, `Come down, and, for $350, we will wipe out all your debt,' that may work just like that advertising lawyer says, but it will not leave that debtor with a better understanding of how to manage his money. 
What I found was that there are alternatives to bankruptcy. Mr. Bedsole and I went to meet Sandra Dunaway in Mobile, who has a credit counseling agency. Families, married individuals, people in trouble, go to credit counseling agencies. Then, counselors sit down with the people who need assistance and help prepare a household budget; the lawyers don't do that. They look at all their debts and interest rates and figure out a way to save interest rates. 
Credit counseling agencies even have the ability--because of their prior relationships with banks and credit card companies and other financing companies--to call those institutions and say, `This person is in credit card debt; they are paying 16 percent interest to you. We believe we can work them through this if you will cut your interest rate to 7 percent.' They can actually reduce payments in various ways through negotiations with creditors. Often, creditors will cooperate with that. Then they help the debtor develop a family budget. Sometimes they will have them put their paycheck into the credit counseling department's account, and the counselor will pay the checks to the creditors and give the family what is left over for their normal needs and make sure they have enough to meet their household needs in that fashion. 
If they can't absolutely work their way out of this debt crisis, then they advise them to seek an attorney and file for bankruptcy. What we have discovered is that this sytem works. They tell me that there are a number of different things that are at work here. One of them is gambling. Many people are filing bankruptcy today because of the proliferation of gambling. They are addicted to gambling, and they are losing large sums of money gambling, and their families are suffering from it. So sometimes the way to help a family is to make sure they are connected with Gamblers Anonymous or some other State agency or private organization that can help those addicted to gambling. Sometimes there is a drug problem or an alcohol problem in the family, and these credit counseling agencies, who are United Way agencies, for the most part filled with people who care about the individuals, in a service mentality, not just to get the money and file bankruptcy, but help them go to Alcoholics Anonymous or to drug treatment and get in contact with mental health agencies if there is a mental health problem in the family, 
and seek other forms of assistance that are already available in the community and then help that family develop a plan to get through this financial crisis. 
It is a good thing and a lot of people see these ads: `Bankruptcy Can Be a Smart Financial Move'--from $350 and up. This ad has another thing in there, by the way. `Divorce, $300, including court appearance.' `Injuries, sexual harassment at work, call us. $350.' So they test that. They have a paralegal administrative assistant who meets with the person and they fill out all the bankruptcy forms. The lawyer may never even see them. He takes the forms. It looks OK. He takes them down to the court, files the forms, and, boom. They go to bankruptcy. There has been nothing done to deal with the fundamental problem that causes them to be in the circumstance they were. So credit agencies are really good. People do not realize it. They are in almost every city and midsized town in America. Credit counseling agencies are readily available. 
This bill says before you file bankruptcy we require that you go by and talk with a credit counseling agency. But before you commit yourself to the lawyer and filing of the bankruptcy and paying his fee, go talk to that credit counseling agency. You just may find that they have the ability to help you work through this thing, that they will help you get some creditors to withhold demands of payment, allow you to get caught up, help you set up a budget, and help you figure a way to get a side job, or to do the kind of things that most families do to work their way out of debt. When they do that, it can actually strengthen the family. 
Mr. President, there are some very dramatic numbers on this. But it is a major reality that a very large number--in fact, I think the highest number of divorces in this country are caused by financial disputes and arguments over finances. So this can help strengthen families and hold families together. 
I am a real believer in credit counseling. It convinced me. I spent several hours talking with them about precisely how they do that. We got a number of people from my church together. We met three or four times. We want to develop a program that helps train people even more in depth about how to manage their property and finances as well so that bankruptcy won't be facing them. 
Some have said that this amendment was opposed by the Federation of Credit Counselors, a national federation that has crediting standards, and that sort of thing. But that is not true. We have met with them. This amendment has been refined so that it has, I think, broad-based support by now virtually everyone. I am convinced that it has the potential for the first time to reduce the ever-increasing number of bankruptcies being filed, and for the first time they will have the government move more people from a strictly legal situation into a situation in which people care about them personally, who will be working with them personally, who confront their problems that exist within their family, and to help them figure a way out of it. I am really excited about that. It does not require a judge to order this to happen. If there are no legitimate or effective credit counseling agencies in the local communities, the amendment would not apply. But I am confident that in most areas it would apply. 
Another thing this new bankruptcy bill does that is excellent is it requires that those who file bankruptcy complete a financial management course prior to receiving their discharge from bankruptcy. This is going to put a new burden on the bankruptcy courts. But many of them have already moved in this direction and are working in this direction. 
I believe we owe a responsibility to those who had a circumstance in which they were unable to meet their debt to give them some training and education in how not to come back again. The truth is we have found a very large number of repeat filers in bankruptcies. Some districts have reported that 40 percent of their consumer bankruptcies are repeat filers. We know that it comprises more than 10 percent nationally. This problem will not go away if we don't do something to confront them in this process when they are seeking this relief. We want to confront them with their difficulties and help them establish a way to avoid coming back to bankruptcy. 
That is the kind of thing that I think would deal with the fundamental problem of debt in America. 
Mr. President, I believe that the Grassley-Durbin bankruptcy bill is an excellent bill. I believe that the 16-to-2 vote that it achieved coming out of committee is a strong testament to its fairness and objectivity and its ability to improve the bankruptcy court system. 
I believe for the first time we will be reaching out to these individuals and families who are in credit difficulties in helping them change their lifestyle and helping them find ways to deal with the problems--sometimes the fundamental, root causes of their financial difficulties so that they won't have to face this problem again; in fact, perhaps to be able to live in a family that is not always squabbling over money, that maybe does not break up because the family has figured out a way to handle its resources in a wise and good manner that would benefit children and the entire family. 
Mr. President, I believe that we are on the cusp of the opportunity of a great bill. I thank the Members of this body who have worked so hard to achieve it. I believe that we will pass it, that it will be law soon, and that this Nation will benefit from it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have spent most of the morning talking primarily about the bankruptcy bill that will be before us. We have done a lot of work on that bill, and there are some complicated and difficult issues involved. People have raised many objections and questions. The managers have done an outstanding job in trying to confront those objections and questions and tried to modify the bill, often on the spur of the moment, to deal with the potential objections. I have supported that. I have supported the managers' amendment that deals with many of these things. But there are a number of issues that still perhaps need more evaluation. 
I think one of the things we need to discuss is a mandate that we have now in the bill which tells the credit card companies a lot of new information that they must provide on their financial statements, including how many months a person would need to pay at the minimum payment before the credit card debt would be fully paid off. That may be a good idea, but I wonder, Have we actually asked these private companies how difficult that is going to be for them? Will we get the kind of benefit from it that we hope to get? Will it be worth the additional numbers that are required to be put on the form? Have was asked them how much will it cost? That cost, of course, will ultimately be passed on to the consumers. 
Some of those financial statements have become so complicated that you hardly know how to look at them when you get them. It may be that this is the kind of amendment we want to have. But I did want to suggest that, regarding this requirement that we have added without any hearings having taken place, we might need to ask the conferees to look at it. There may be a number of other issues of like note that need to be looked at in conference as well. 
Fundamentally, I believe the managers' amendment is a healthy thing, and I certainly support Senator Grassley in his efforts to move this bill forward.

Mr. SESSIONS. For the information of all Members, the majority leader advises that the Senate will reconvene on Monday at noon and begin a period of morning business until 2 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the bankruptcy bill. Members who may still offer amendments to the bankruptcy bill under the consent agreement of September 11 are encouraged to come to the floor during Monday's session to offer and debate their amendments. 
It is the leader's intention to complete action on the bankruptcy bill by early Tuesday afternoon, so it is hoped all Members will have offered and debated all amendments by that time. 
Members are reminded that a cloture motion was filed today to the committee substitute to the Child Custody Protection Act. Therefore, under the provisions of rule XXII, Members have until 1 p.m. on Monday to file first-degree amendments regarding child custody. As a further reminder, there will be no votes during Monday's session, and the next votes will occur beginning at 2 p.m. on Tuesday, September 22. Members will be notified how many votes will occur on Tuesday when that information is available.

Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. 
I thank Senator Grassley and Senator Durbin for the great work they have done in building bipartisan support for this bankruptcy bill. I think this is a historic step forward in bringing integrity and fairness and efficiency to the bankruptcy system. It came out of the committee with a 16-to-2 positive vote, and I think that reflects the strong bipartisan support this bill has. 
With regard to Senator Feingold's concerns about this provision, it is not for punishment of a lawyer who files these bankruptcy petitions. It simply defines the standard of care they ought to adhere to. We are always having the plaintiff lawyers tell us that they cannot do anything to reduce the standard of care on the part of private businesses. For example, they argue that we must not lower the standard of care for doctors because it might result in a patient or user of their product being injured or somehow being harmed. Nothing can reduce that, but yet at the same time the bar will take as much protection as they can get for anything they do in their professional capacity for which they were hired. 
Bankruptcy lawyers are not mere clerks, although the truth is, for those of us who know what is going on, most of the bankruptcy filings in America are done by lawyers who run bankruptcy mills, who advertise in phone books and newspapers and on television and radio, which just a few years ago lawyers could not do. In fact, there is some indication that the dramatic rise in bankruptcy is derived more from attorney advertising and the encouraging of people to file bankruptcy than any other factor. Particularly this appears to be true in light of the fact we have more bankruptcies in a time of strong economic growth and prosperity in this country. 
So I say to you, these lawyers have to comfort to some standard of care. 
What does Senator Grassley's bill say? It says they ought to be substantially justified in filing their bankruptcy under chapter 7. That is all. What is bad about that kind of standard? And if they are not substantially justified, what happens? 
Take for example, a person with a $100,000 income, and let's assume someone sues that person for an automobile accident and wins a $25,000 judgment against them. Although the judgment need not be that high, it could be any amount that the person does not want to pay. So they go to their lawyer and ask him how they can get out of paying it, and he says `file bankruptcy.' This will wipe out the debt, although he could have paid it on the income level he has. 
When the case comes to the bankruptcy court, they file under chapter 7, which would eliminate all debts. The chapter 7 trustee objects, and they hold a hearing. They present evidence, and they say: `No, you should go into chapter 13 because you do not qualify for chapter 7.' And then the judge must go further. Under the Grassley version, the judge must find not that the lawyer made a mistake but he was not substantially justified in filing the petition under chapter 7. Then he can assess the attorney the cost of that hearing--not huge amounts of attorney's fees, just the cost of the hearing that had to be held on the complaint of the chapter 7 trustee. 
Let me ask you--it comes down to this--who pays? Who pays for the expense of having to challenge this chapter 7 petition which was not substantially justified? Under Senator Feingold's proposal, it would be an administrative expense. That sounds OK, but we know in this country that there `ain't no free lunches.' You have heard that saying. Somebody always pays. Who pays, in this case, the administrative expense? The people who pay will be the ones who are owed money, the creditors, the ones who have not and probably will not be paid all they are owed, and it comes out of the money that goes to them. They pay for the lawyer filing a petition that is substantially unjustified. 
When we come down to the choice of who ought to pay, I say the lawyer ought to pay. He ought to be sure of what he is doing when he files the petition. He should know where it ought to be filed. I do not think that presents a conflict of interest. I understand that you could conjure that up as some theoretical possibility, but the truth is, under ethical rules of practice today, a lawyer cannot file a complaint he does not believe to be justified. He is required to do some preliminary work before he files it. 
So I do not believe that this would be contrary to the standards that are required currently of lawyers in what they do. And, again, it requires the action of a judge. And a bankruptcy judge knows these lawyers. There is usually a small group of lawyers that file the overwhelming number of bankruptcy cases in their courts, and many are not going to be unfairly abusing these lawyers. However, when a judge sees one who is consistently filing chapter 7 petitions that ought to have been filed in chapter 13, and his trustee has to have hearings and challenge it, and there are not sufficient facts to justify it, then he is going to have the opportunity under this bill to assess some costs against that attorney. 
This is not going to bankrupt the attorney. I know of attorneys in Alabama who are running advertisements, who are making $1,000 per bankruptcy case and filing 1,000 cases a year. They are making big bucks off this system. Maybe they are justified in doing that, but they ought to on occasion, when they make the point to go to great expense to hold a hearing, have the trustee challenge what they have done, and then find out they are not substantially justified--they ought to pay. 
I hope we will keep the Grassley amendment. The other alternative is to keep the present standard of assessing costs against an attorney, and that is the standard of frivolousness. That is a very high standard, and the net effect of the frivolousness standard is that nobody will ever recover, because it is just very, very difficult to meet that standard. 
The bankruptcy judges are not going to abuse these attorneys. It will give the bankruptcy judges a little leverage, a little power to say to these attorneys who are filing cases recklessly without enough thought, causing the creditors to lose money and otherwise abuse the system, that they can bring a little integrity to and have some watchfulness over the system and maintain discipline on the lawyers who practice there. 
I understand the Senator's concern about it, but I do not see this as an extreme position at all. I think it is quite consistent with the bankruptcy court. I believe it will help, as Senator Grassley said, make sure people file their petition right the first time. If it is chapter 13, they ought to file in chapter 13, not in chapter 7 on a theory that, well, we will just have a hearing and maybe we will win or maybe they won't object. We need it filed right the first time so we will have fewer proceedings to transfer the action. That is the purpose behind this and I think the Feingold amendment would undermine that purpose. 
I thank the Chair for this time. I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
The effect of this will be to require mandatory lending at no possible profit for a credit card company. We have 6,000 credit card issuers today. They are all providing different services; some charge a fee and you have to pay monthly, others don't. It is just not right for us, without a hearing, to even impose on a credit card company a duty to lend money in a way in which they will never be able to make a return. 
I don't think we need to be entering into wage-and-price controls. We have a very vigorous free market, and, for the first time, interest rates are beginning to come down because we do have a lot of credit card companies competing out there. I think we ought not to intervene at this time. This is an unwise amendment. I understand the motivation behind it. It is not appropriate, and I oppose it strongly at this time.

Mr. SESSIONS. I know this is a good-sounding and popular-appearing bill, but I am not one who enjoys going to banks and going in banks. Over the years, I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to obtain the cash I need on a daily basis from ATM machines. In fact, it allows you to carry less cash in your pocket, and you can find ATM machines everywhere. They are exploding to every corner of America. Businesses have them. Grocery stores have them. And they cost money--$30-, $40-, $50-, $80,000 to put in one of those machines. 
So it has been a remarkable, wonderful advancement for the people of America, that they can obtain money on virtually any corner of a city, at their grocery store, at their bank, at their gas station, and so forth. This has been a wonderful advancement. 
It seems to me particularly odd that we would say that a bank which is servicing someone who is not their customer, who does not have an account at their bank, and yet they might have spent $50,000 to put in this ATM machine, cannot charge a fee for it; that someone can use their machine without being able to charge a fee. It seems to me that would be an unreasonable thing. I think most banks don't have it free for their own customers. 
I wish to make a number of points. While this fee, I don't suggest, would eliminate all ATM machines, I think it is quite reasonable to suggest that it would eliminate marginal machines, and as we know when we take money out of an ATM machine, it pops up on the screen how much the fee is. So if you are at a grocery store and you have your own bank machine down the street, but you would like to get your cash in the grocery store and they are not going to service you but for $1.50, you do have a choice. You have your choice of going to your bank or going to a machine that may charge less. 
I hope and expect that as we have an expansion of machines, we may well find some of these fees will begin to drop rather than increase, and that has been the pattern in free enterprise since its beginning. So it seems to me that what we are suggesting is that on a bankruptcy bill, where at least with regard to this committee that deals with bankruptcy we are tacking on a credit card banking issue that was not part of the markup on this bill, it could jeopardize the bill and not be relevant to what we are considering. 
I note that the Banking Committee on July 30 on a bipartisan 11-to-7 vote rejected this amendment. They considered it in some detail, and that committee, after careful consideration, balancing the great utility and advantage of having ATM machines at virtually every corner versus the cost of it, have opted in favor of allowing the continued expansion and convenience of more and more machines. I do not think there is any doubt that the growth in availability of machines will end and, in fact, it is likely that we will have a reduction in the number of machines, therefore reducing convenience. 
Many bank machines are totally dependent on access fees, and many of these are particularly convenient to small businesses and small grocery stores. Many new ATMs in rural and other low-volume, high-convenience sites operated by nonbanks will be economically unfeasible. They will be closed. They will not exist. You simply have to be able to make a profit if you are going to provide a service. Nobody is going to invest $30-, $40-, $50,000 if they do not have any prospect of a return. We know that. We talk about the big banks, but it is not always big banks that are involved. 
Mr. President, I believe that on this bankruptcy bill, we ought not to be dealing with banking issues and credit card issues. Those are matters that ought to be held in those committees and, in fact, they have been considering it. I urge the Members of this body to wait for another forum, another time to deal with this issue and reject this amendment because it is not good economics. It is not good public policy to limit the expansion and the convenience and accessibility of ATM machines. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his excellent remarks in pointing out a lot of people age 18 to 21 are not in college. I just had two children graduate from college, and I still have one in college. I believe a credit card is a good thing for them to have. Almost every college student is going to have a credit card. The fact that we have some competition in the credit card industry--they are offering lower rates and less charges if you will use their credit card--that is good. We have needed that. 
In my opinion, the biggest complaint about credit cards is they charge too much interest. Those rates have been driven down because of competition. There are 6,000 credit card companies, and they are sending out mailings, and they are encouraging people to use their credit cards. 
What is bad about that? 
What troubles me is we are saying if you want a young person to have a credit card, they may have to get their parents to sign as a cosigner and be financially responsible for their debt. That doesn't seem to me to be fair or correct. Maybe a parent says if you want to get a credit card you can, but it is your debt to pay, not mine. The requirement we are debating now would prohibit them from getting a credit card under those circumstances. 
What about young persons whose parents are deceased? 
The Federal Government should not be stepping in and telling a credit card company you can't take a chance on a young person, or that you have to get the parent to cosign before giving a young adult a credit card. This seems unhealthy to me. I am sure it is true that credit card companies like to get young people accustomed to using their cards and hope they will use them throughout their career. I don't know that there is anything wrong with that. 
Mr. President, a 20-year-old who may be temporarily unemployed may find a credit card to be very valuable. Suppose you have to drive to a job interview and the guy down at the car inspection place says your vehicle emits too much pollution and you have to spend $400 to fix it; or your tire blows out and you have to have $75 to get the car towed and another $50 to put a tire on it. A person may not have that cash in their pocket at times such as these, when they really need it. That is why credit cards are a good thing. 
Credit cards have been helpful in many ways for citizens in America. The problem is with people who abuse them and who don't show personal discipline. We all know that is a problem. We need to encourage personal discipline, not have the Federal Government telling a young person they can't have a credit card unless their parent agrees to pay their debt.

Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I would first like to congratulate the Senator from Wyoming, Senator Enzi for his amendment and his work on this issue. In his comments he has laid out a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the problem and has stated plainly and with integrity and insight exactly how it is we ought to deal with it. 
Let me try to briefly share some thoughts I have on this matter. I was attorney general of the State of Alabama. In this capacity I was one of 25 attorneys general who signed, just over two years ago, a letter to the Secretary of the Interior indicating to him our firm conviction and legal opinion that he did not have the authority to enter into compacts with Indian tribes in the manner detailed in the proposed regulations he drafted. Let me tell you why that is very important. 
Alabama has one recognized Indian tribe, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, a very fine group. Chairman Tullis of that tribe is a friend, and I have known him for many years. We had occasions, when I served as Federal U.S. attorney, to work on a number of issues, and I have always admired his commitment and work. 
He has at that Indian tribe a large bingo parlor. They make a considerable amount of money on it. Under Alabama law the tribe has the ability to build a horse racetrack or a dog racetrack. 
But under the law the tribe does not and has not been given the authority by the Governor of the State of Alabama to build a casino. Alabama has debated this repeatedly, and the casino advocates have failed. 
Let me provide some further background on this Alabama example. In Alabama, the Poarch Creek tribe has about 2000 members, and it owns about 600 acres of property. It has been recognized for less than 30 years, and it is a small tribe. But they own property, near both Mobile, AL, where their primary location is, and also near Wetumpka, Alabama. The city of Wetumpka is near Montgomery, AL, and is roughly 180 miles away from Mobile. The tribe would like to build casinos outside of Mobile and outside of Montgomery and Birmingham, AL, in the little town of Wetumpka where they have property. 
Do you see the significance of this? If the Secretary of the Interior can override the opinion of the people of the State of Alabama and give this Indian tribe the right to build casinos on their land, then they could build at least two, maybe three casinos in Alabama and would, in fact, abrogate the considered will of the people of the State who have consistently rejected casino gambling. 
It is just that simple. This is not an insignificant matter. We are talking about giving the Secretary of the Interior, who is now under investigation by a special prosecutor for campaign contributions arising out of his approval of one Indian tribe's activities with regard to gambling, the unilateral authority to override the considered opinion of States all over this country. If this amendment doesn't pass we are talking about the Secretary of the Interior having the ability to enrich selected tribes by millions or hundreds of millions of dollars overnight by the stroke of a pen. 
That is a powerful thing. You can raise a lot of campaign money with that ability to do such a thing. I do not think it is healthy. The attorneys general association, the National Association of Attorneys General, steadfastly opposes the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Interior that would give him this ability, and strongly supports the Enzi-Sessions amendment. Allowing the Secretary to have this kind of power is wrong. He does not have the constitutional power to do it, first, in my opinion, yet he persists in suggesting that he does and is moving forward with regulations that appear to suggest that in fact he will. 
So what is the first thing that is going to happen if the Secretary's regulations are enacted? Lawsuits are going to spring up all over the country attacking his authority to do this and cost all kinds of money. And we are going to continue with litigation involving it. I think ultimately he is going to lose. But what we are saying is, let us not go down that road; let us not do that. 
Let me show you what the midsized city of Wetumpka feels about this issue. Wetumpka is a wonderful town. I have a number of friends there. This is what the mayor, Jo Glenn, wrote me. She writes this:  
Our infrastructure and police and fire departments could not cope with the burdens this type of activity would bring. [That is a casino.] The demand for greater social services that comes to the area around gambling facilities could not be adequately funded. Please once again convey to Secretary Babbitt our city's strong adamant opposition to gaming facilities. 
The City of Wetumpka support this amendment. Additionally, the Montgomery Advertiser states in an editorial written opposing the Secretaries proposed regulations that: 
Direct Federal negotiations with tribes without State involvement would be an unjustifiably heavy-handed imposition of authority on Alabama. The decision whether to allow gambling here is too significant a decision economically, politically, socially to be made in the absence of extensive State involvement. A casino in Wetumpka--not to mention the others undoubtedly that would follow in other parts of the State--has implications far too great to allow the critical decision to be reached in Washington. Alabama has to have a hand in this high-stakes game. 
Let me note that others have expressed similar objections to the Secretary's proposed regulations. Attorney General Robert Butterworth of Florida and Attorney General Gale Norton of Colorado have written expressing support for this amendment. My successor as Attorney General of Alabama, Bill Pryor, who is a brilliant lawyer, Tulane graduate, editor-in-chief of the Tulane Law Review, and a fine legal scholar--says: 
Again, I strongly support the proposed amendment [Enzi-Sessions]. I have no confidence that the Secretary listens when the states tell him that he lacks the power to override their Eleventh Amendment immunity and that he operates under an incurable conflict of interest when he proposes to act [himself] as a mediator. The proposed amendment is necessary to stop further action on the Secretary's part. 
His opinion is shared, as I mentioned, by the National Association of Attorneys General. A number of other attorneys general have written me to express that same position as well. 
Mr. President, I say again, this is not a matter of theoretical debate now. We are beyond that. It is a matter of real public policy. And if you allow every Indian reservation in America to overnight, or step by step, tribe by tribe, after having to wine and dine the Secretary of the Interior and sweet-talk the Secretary of the Interior and the President and maybe making campaign contributions, to induce him to approve gambling, then we are going to have one of the most massive erosions of the public's ability to set social policy within their State we have ever seen. This is really a major event. 
Senator Enzi's proposal is reasonable. I am proud to be a cosponsor with him on it. It simply delays this thing so we can make sure we are doing the right thing. 
As to Senator Domenici's problem, I think that will need to be dealt with specifically and not as part of this amendment. But I believe we cannot allow this amendment to fail. The Governors, the attorneys general, groups like the Christian Coalition, and others, support this amendment, because they recognize the negative consequences that arise from allowing the Secretary of Interior to exert this sort of power. 
I again thank Senator Enzi for his leadership. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I add my compliments to Senator Abraham from Michigan for his outstanding work in crafting this professionally drafted, constitutional, and well-done amendment. 
There was a recent article in the New York Times by an abortion doctor who admitted to doing 45,000 abortions. He said in that article that parents ought to be consulted in these circumstances. He said that, when someone--often some young man--takes a very young girl across a State line to a State where abortions don't require parental consent, he is jeopardizing the health of that young girl, because the parents won't even know to watch out for her health. Having had the abortion a long distance away, the girl won't be able to return to the abortion clinic for follow-up. The parents won't be watching their daughter's health and the complications that can arise. The doctor said that pro-abortion forces do themselves a disservice when they oppose such legislation as this. I think that is plainly so from a medical point of view. I think it is plainly so from a family point of view. Young toughs who have impregnated a young girl ought not to be able to avoid their responsibility by secretly taking her away to a distant place, without the knowledge of her parents. This is basic. 
I was a Federal prosecutor for nearly 15 years, and during that time we had what we call the Mann Act. It prohibits the interstate transportation of a female across a State line for the purpose of prostitution or other immoral purposes. That is a law that has been upheld repeatedly by the Supreme Court. This bill will be upheld by the Supreme Court. It is consistent with American law. I am amazed that we can't even get the bill up for a vote and that there are people opposing it. 
I thank the Senator from Michigan for his leadership.

Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator McConnell, and I thank all Members of the body for this excellent debate on a very important issue. I suggest that there are different views about what is noble and fair and of the highest order. A jurist at one time said that to talk of justice is the equivalent of pounding on the table; everybody seems to say that their view is just and fair and wonderful. But I think there are a lot of competing principles here, and I would just like to share a few comments on this subject. 
I ran in a Republican primary, had seven opponents, two of whom spent over $1 million of their own money, and the total that those seven opponents spent was some $5 million. My opponent in the general election spent about $3 million, the Democratic nominee. But when you figure it on 4 million people in Alabama, that is about $2 per voter. 
A number of the expenditures--and it irritated me at the time--were these stealth advocacy ads that have been referred to. Groups ran ads that tried to claim they were advocacy ads but in fact were aimed at me and trying to drive my numbers down and to help their candidate get elected. It irritated me, and when I got here I was irritated with some of the campaign laws. It struck me as somewhat unfair that a man could spend $1 million but I could not ask anybody for more than $1,000. So I was pretty open to reviewing that. 
Since I have been here and had the time to do a little thinking about it, talking with Senator McConnell and others, I have become pretty well convinced that we do not need to deregulate the institutional media, allow them to run free doing whatever they want to, and just tell groups of people, even if I don't agree with them, they can't come together, peaceably assemble and raise money and petition their Government. 
That is a fundamental first amendment principle. The right to assemble peaceably and petition your Government for grievances is a right that is protected by our Constitution. In no way can we abridge freedom of speech. We have a number of cases dealing with that. 
The particular Snowe-Jeffords amendment that we talked about has been touched upon in a famous case from Alabama. NAACP v. Alabama, in 1958, clearly established that groups have a right to assemble and they do not have to reveal the names of individuals who have contributed to them. 
They said: Well, we don't want to demand that of everybody, just if you run a campaign ad 60 days in front of a general election. Only then do we want to know who gave you money; only then do we abridge your right to free speech, because we are abridging it by saying you can't express yourself unless you tell who gave money to your organization only within 60 days of the election. That is the only time we want to do it. 
So, Mr. President, I would ask, when do you want to speak out? When do people become concerned and energized about issues? I believe in my State, for example, that we had abuse of the laws of Alabama, and we had too many lawsuits and uncontrolled verdicts, and we needed tort reform. The trial lawyers of Alabama are a very aggressive group. A small group of them contribute huge sums of money. I saw recently where about seven plaintiff law firms, relatively small law firms, had given some $4 million to political campaigns in the last cycle. They spent $1 million--some of these were stealth advocacy ads aimed at me. They ran one ad against a Supreme Court Justice, the skunk ad that was voted the dirtiest ad in America.

Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator. 
We have a robust democracy. People have their say. I am inclined to think this obsession with eliminating the ability of people to speak out freely in an election cycle is unwise. It does threaten the robust nature of this democracy. 
I recall last year we had 30 Members here who voted to amend the first amendment to the Constitution so they could pass this kind of legislation. 
I think at least they were honest enough to propose a constitutional amendment to amend the first amendment, which I thought was stunning. 
But at any rate, my time has expired. I just wanted to share those comments. I thank the Senator from Kentucky. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of Senator McCain from Arizona. He is a true American patriot, an academy graduate, a former fighter pilot, a prisoner of war, a person who has been a leader in this body in matters of defense. A few days ago, a Senator from the other side, Senator Lieberman, made a seminal address on the need for morality, integrity and honesty in public leadership, and by the President in particular. 
Senator McCain's remarks, in my opinion, are equally as important. He has said some things, as a conscience of this body, on defense matters that we ought to listen to, and I am hearing it repeatedly from people I know in the military services who are concerned about the erosion of our national defense. I join with him in those concerns. I appreciate him sharing it with us, and I hope he will continue to speak out in this body as eloquently as he does on these important issues.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Child Custody Protection Act. Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan has previously spoken on this matter, just a few minutes ago. I have been honored to be a cosponsor of that legislation with him from the beginning and to participate in a number of different activities that he has led to try to call this legislation to the attention of the people of America, and to do what we can to see that it is brought up for a vote in this body, and to pass this legislation. 
It appears to me that this legislation would be difficult for most anybody to oppose. The issue of abortion has divided our country for many years now. But the issue we are considering today is not whether abortion should be legal or not. The Supreme Court, in my opinion, erroneously took that issue away from the people, ripped it out as a matter for the democratic process, and decided and declared that the Constitution prohibits the limiting of abortions, except in certain circumstances. 
But even the Supreme Court has made it clear that it is proper for a State to declare that an abortion should not be performed on a minor child unless the parents are consulted. Certainly, they have to be consulted about minor surgery--and they are consulted by their school principals and teachers if they are even given Tylenol. To perform an abortion without parental consent is a very dramatic interference in family and parental relationships that many States have decided to protect. Even our Supreme Court, which has ruled erroneously, in my opinion, in a number of different ways on this issue, has approved that. 
We have now discovered that there is a problem. We have discovered that people are taking children across State lines, from one State where parents have to be notified--third parties are intervening in the family relationship and are taking children across to another State that doesn't have that law, for the purpose of having an abortion performed on them. 
In my view, the right of parents to be involved in these major decisions affecting their minor children is a fundamental thing and ought not to be lightly transgressed. State parental consent and notification statutes are an important protection for fundamental parental rights. Let me say that the issue before us today is not whether States should have such laws--some do, some don't--the issue before us today is whether we will allow these important and clearly constitutional State laws to be circumvented. 
The purpose of this bill is simply to preclude some third party from trampling on the rights of parents by advising a minor child to have an abortion, and then assisting them by taking them across a State line to a State where they can have one. 
This legislation before us today would forbid a third party from transporting a minor child across the State line for the purpose of an abortion, without the parent's knowledge or consent, in order to evade compliance with the law of the State where the parent and child reside. This is hardly a radical or extreme proposal, and the bill is necessary. It is constitutional and it is carefully and narrowly drawn. 
Senator Abraham has done a superb job in drafting this legislation. He has listened to those who have expressed concerns about it, and he has constantly revised and improved it. It is an exceptionally fine piece of legislation, in my opinion. 
Mr. President, let me say that I believe this bill is necessary. In the Judiciary Committee hearing we had, we heard horrible stories. One involved Joyce Farley's 13-year-old daughter and one involved Eileen Roberts' 14-year-old daughter. In both cases, these young girls were secretly transported across the State line by adults seeking to hide the fact of the pregnancy from the children's parents. In both of these cases, these young girls were taken from a State that had a parental consent statute to one that did not. In both of these cases, the young girls suffered serious complications from these legal, but botched, abortions. 
Parenthetically, Mr. President, let me state that recently in the New York Times there was an op-ed piece by a former abortion doctor who, according to the first paragraph in the article, had performed 45,000 abortions. He said that, for a number of reasons, parents ought to be involved in these decisions, and that parental notification laws are correct, and that the pro-abortion forces undermine their own efforts and their credibility when they oppose them. He pointed out that children should be consulting with their families for these kinds of situations. 
And from a medical point of view, he pointed out that when a child is transported a long distance to a medical center to have an abortion, perhaps she has not had good adult advice as to whether or not that is a good doctor or clinic. When she goes there, she is then returned at a long distance to the home of her parents. 
Many times, he noted, there are complications. Parents need to be aware and to be watching the child to help her if complications occur. And he said return visits to the abortion clinic for checkups are little done when a child has a long distance to go back to the clinic. So for health and medical reasons, he believes that children ought to consult with and have the approval of their parents before they obtain abortions. Of course the laws of each of those States--and the Supreme Court rulings--require that there be an option for a child who is pregnant to go to court and get an order for an abortion without notifying a parent. So there is an option, required by the Supreme Court decisions. 
Mrs. Farley testified that her daughter was taken out of state for an abortion by one Rosa Marie Hartford. Ms. Hartford was actually the mother of the 18-year-old young man whose statutory rape of the then-12-year-old girl is what caused the pregnancy. In other words, the woman was trying to cover up the criminal activity of her son. The son later pled guilty to statutory rape. 
The attorney general for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania testified concerning his efforts to prosecute Mrs. Hartford under state law for interfering with the custody of a minor. Those efforts may or may not ultimately prove successful. Attorney General Fischer testified concerning the difficulties of pursuing such a case under state law, and strongly recommended passage of this bill. 
This issue does not involve a few isolated cases. An attorney for the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, has acknowledged this. Attorney Kathryn Kolbert stated, and I quote: `There are thousands of minors who cross state liens for an abortion every year and who need assistance from adults to do that.' We have seen several examples of abortion clinics which openly place advertisements in the yellow pages in nearby states that have parental consent statutes. These advertisements proudly proclaim: `No parental consent.' 
Thus, these clinics are openly encouraging the evasion of state laws, and something needs to be done about it. Because of the interstate nature of this problem, a Federal solution is required. 
This bill is constitutional. As I have stated earlier, the Supreme Court has upheld the types of state parental notification and consent laws that this bill would help to bolster. It is specious to suggest that this bill would unduly burden the right to an abortion. The bill does nothing more than prohibit the evasion of constitutional state statutes. 
This bill is a valid and appropriate exercise of Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause. 
I was a Federal prosecutor, Mr. President, for nearly 15 years. A long-term Federal statute is the Mann Act. It has for many years--many years back, I think, since 1913--prohibited the interstate transportation of women or girls across State lines for prostitution or other immoral purposes. That is a Federal law. The constitutionality of the Mann Act has been upheld by the Supreme Court since the early 1900s. It is a very close analogy to the Child Custody Protection Act, which would preclude the transporting of minor girls across State lines to evade State parental involvement laws. Any constitutional objections to this bill, in my opinion, would be without merit and would certainly fail. 
Also, this bill is very narrow in its scope. It does not prohibit interstate abortions. It does not invalidate any state laws. It does not establish a right to parental consent for residents of any state that does not already have a parental consent law. It doesn't even attempt to regulate the activities of the pregnant minor herself. It only reaches the conduct of outside parties who wrongfully usurp the rights of parents that are guaranteed by state law. 
Some suggest that the bill should be narrowed further, to exempt the interference with parental rights, if the adult is a relative of the child, they could interfere with the parents' rights. I would disagree with that. 
This bill would not prevent the minor from seeking counsel from an aunt or grandmother or anyone else. It would prohibit aunts and grandmothers from violating the rights of the child's parents by secretly driving the youngster to another state for an abortion without telling the parents. I personally wonder whether it might be worse to have a grandmother or an aunt interjecting themselves in between the parent and the child, than to have some stranger do it. The result is the same. It is the same. It is the parent who has the responsibility, who brought the child into the world, and who has raised the child. The destructive impact on the family could be greater in that case. 
In any event, the grandmother isn't the parent, and the aunt isn't the parent; and neither relative nor stranger should have the right to circumvent parental involvement statutes. 
If a well-meaning grandmother wants to be helpful, in most situations she should encourage the child to confide in her parents. In the rare circumstances where that would not be appropriate, and the child is intent on obtaining an abortion, the judicial by-pass procedure could be used. 
That is, a child could go to a court, and the abortion could be authorized by the judge. The child could go to court in those circumstances. 
In summary, this bill is narrowly crated, it is well written, it is necessary, and it is constitutional. The House of Representatives passed this bill with a strong bipartisan majority of 276 to 150. I urge my colleagues to do likewise. 
We need to ensure this bill receives a vote on the merits. We are apparently going to have to invoke cloture to even get it up for a vote. There is a strong determination--I consider it an extreme commitment--to support anything that favors abortion by too many Members of this body. 
This is a reasonable bill. This is a fair bill. It is an appropriate action by the Congress of the United States involving interstate commerce. As a Federal prosecutor, I prosecuted those who transported stolen motor vehicles--ITSMV, Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor Vehicles, stolen property, lots of those kinds of cases. This is one type of case that is quite appropriate for us to legislate on. 
I hope that every Member of this body will vote for it. It ought to pass overwhelmingly. It is good public policy. 
I, again, congratulate Senator Abraham for his determined and skilled legislative leadership in crafting and presenting this outstanding piece of legislation. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

At 10 a.m., a cloture vote will occur on the child custody bill. If an agreement can be reached with respect to the bankruptcy bill, then the second cloture vote with respect to the bankruptcy bill will be vitiated. If an agreement cannot be reached, a second cloture vote would occur at approximately 11 a.m. At the conclusion of the two votes, the Senate can be expected to resume the Interior appropriations bill. Therefore, additional votes can be expected during Friday's session of the Senate.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to join Senator Hatch in expressing my admiration and respect for Senator Grassley and the members of his committee who have worked hard on this bankruptcy reform legislation. It has obtained almost universal support. It passed the committee 16 to 2, and it reflects a good step in our public policy. 
As Senator Grassley says, the current liberalized bankruptcy law discourages personal responsibility, that is, it makes it easy and even encourages persons to avoid their responsibility. That is not good. A Harvard professor has written a book which talked about how during the first 150 years of this Nation's existence every law that came up for consideration was judged on the basis of whether it made our people more responsible and better citizens. I think that is a goal we have lost sight of in recent years. What we need to do is make sure our legislation sets standards that call people to their highest and best ideals and not dumbing them down and encouraging them to cop out, to take the easy way out, to avoid their debts when there is no real justification for it. 
Most people may not understand, but a person making $70,000 with $30,000 in debts can walk into a bankruptcy court in America, at any place, at any time, and file for bankruptcy. Even though he would be perfectly able to pay off those debts, he can wipe them all out. This is true even if, just a few months before, he or she had signed a promissory note to pay those debts. This behavior vitiates contracts, and it vitiates responsibility. 
So I think, based on the fact that we have had a doubling of bankruptcy filings in the last decade and we have seen a 60 percent increase in bankruptcy filings since 1995, we do have a problem in this country. This is not driven by the economy, because we are in good economic times. In 1997, however, we now know that $40 billion in consumer debt was erased by bankruptcy filings in this country. 
Where does that debt go? Who pays that debt? What happens to it? It is passed on to the other American citizens who are in debt but who pay their debts, who pay their credit card bills, who pay their bank notes. They have to pay higher interest rates, to the tune of $400 per family per year, to balance out some of these people who are filing for bankruptcy but do not deserve it. Many people, a majority of those filing, do not abuse bankruptcy. But a significant number are abusing the bankruptcy laws, and we ought to do something about it. 
There was a recent article written by former Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen, former Democratic Vice Presidential candidate, and former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. This is what he said: 
With growing frequency, bankruptcy is being treated as a first choice rather than a last resort, as a matter of convenience rather than necessity. 
He goes on to note: 
A rising tide of bankruptcies will sink all ships and hurt those who need credit the most, those who have to borrow money. 
People do not understand--and many in this body do not recognize--that many who have done well, such as a family making $30-$40-$50,000 a year, will have debts. When they have a car payment that comes up, if they have an $800 balance on their credit card, those interest points make a difference to them--whether they pay 15 percent or 18 percent or 19 percent interest. 
As former Secretary of the Treasury under President Clinton, Senator Bentsen, said: 
In the United States, we believe that through hard work anyone can become a success. America's bankruptcy laws reflect a fundamental element of our Nation's entrepreneurial spirit. Their intent is to ensure a fresh start for those who try and fail, and they form an important thread in our social safety net. But when some people systematically abuse the system at great expense to the rest of the population, twisting the fresh start into a free ride, Congress must step in and tighten up the law to protect those who unfairly bear the cost. When it comes to bankruptcies of convenience, this time has come. 
So I agree; it is a bipartisan issue. Senator Grassley has worked diligently to gain the broadest possible support. This bill came out of the Senate Judiciary Committee 16 to 2. A virtually unanimous vote on a bill of this kind is unusual and should be noted. 
Why is it necessary? I want to mention a few things that are in the bill, and then I want to comment on the unusual and unfortunate circumstance we are in now in which the minority party is attempting to block even consideration of the bill that so many of their own members have already supported in committee. They in fact filibustered the bill before it could even come to the floor. People say this is a do-nothing Congress. Maybe they are trying to make it so. This is a good bill. It has been worked on for several years. It has been improved and refined. It has very broad support, and we ought to pass it. 
These are some of the things it does: It allows creditors, those who are owed money, and panel trustees to participate in the review of the debtor's decision to file a chapter 7 instead of a chapter 13. 
Most people do not realize that when you go to file bankruptcy, you have two choices, if you are a normal consumer who is in debt. You can file under chapter 7--wipe out all your debts and not have to pay anything. Your money goes into a pot and is divided up on a proportional basis to creditors, and you walk away free and clear. This permits a fresh start, which is a great American tradition. We are not trying to eliminate that at all. 
But there is another tradition, too. That is the tradition of chapter 13, which in fact was first created in my home State of Alabama, in Birmingham, and it is still a very popular alternative there. It provides the option for a debtor who wants to try to pay back his debt to do so. The Court approves his plan, and he pays a certain amount of money into the chapter 13 fund, and it is distributed to his debtors. They give up the interest rates that they have been charging on it, and at least they get something back out of it. And this person is able to be discharged without having filed for bankruptcy because the debts have, in fact, been honored. 
This is a procedure that I think ought to be encouraged. What we are finding is that in some areas of the country almost nobody files chapter 13. But it is a high filing issue in Alabama. People want to pay their debts, and they are taking this option. 
So what this bill says is that if a person has $100,000 per year income and he only owes $30,000 and he wants to file chapter 7, this will give the creditors a chance to object and say, `Judge, we think you ought to review this. He doesn't need this bankruptcy. Why should he be able to walk away from his debts when people who are making $30,000, have three kids, and are trying to get by by the skin of their teeth are paying their debts? Why doesn't he pay his?' 
I think that is fundamental, and we need to get away from this automatic deal in which the filer has total power to choose whether or not he files under 7 or 13. 
The bill also requires consumers to receive information concerning credit counseling before filing. Many people do not know that there are tremendous credit counseling centers in almost every community in America. These persons help the families. This differs from when a debtor goes in to see a bankruptcy lawyer who simply has his secretary asks the person to fill out a form. The debtor may not even see the lawyer; the lawyer has probably hundreds of these cases. The secretary has you fill out a form, and he files a bankruptcy, and he hardly even talks to the client. That too often happens. 
In credit counseling, the person sits down with the credit counselor. They go over their income. They talk about how they can pay that off. Maybe the banks or the credit card companies would reduce their interest rates if the person could make regular payments and not go into bankruptcy. They help them deal with problems in families such as gambling addiction. I have been talked to credit counseling people across this country. They are telling me that gambling is a big factor driving bankruptcy filings. Maybe Gamblers Anonymous would be the right thing for them. 
Maybe there is a mental health problem, depression in the family or other things that these people who are not sophisticated in finance did not know would be available to them to help them overcome their debt problem. So I think that would be a great thing. It is not going to eliminate huge numbers of filings, but I assure you, I believe we will have a number of families helped by this personally, maybe marriages saved. And it will help them develop a plan to pay off this debt and avoid the stigma of bankruptcy. It would be a good thing and is an important part of this bill. I am confident of this because on my study of this issue. I offered an amendment to this bill which was adopted. 
The bill also requires, during bankruptcy, that people who do declare bankruptcy participate in a debt management class. We found in some districts as much as 40 percent of the bankruptcy filings are by people who filed bankruptcy before. We need to educate them on some basic principles of how to manage their money and hopefully they will not come back again and other debts will not be abrogated. 
This legislation would require debtors to provide more financial information, including tax returns. It provides for random audits requiring referrals for possible criminal prosecution. I was a Federal prosecutor for 15 years and we formed a bankruptcy fraud task force to deal with this problem. The truth is that there are very, very few bankruptcy fraud prosecutions in America. This is Federal court. We expect people to be truthful in what they submit, and those who are not honest must suffer criminal sanctions, or the word will get out among the bankruptcy lawyers that it doesn't make any difference and that nothing will ever happen to you if you are not candid and truthful in filling out your statements. 
It also allows creditors to represent themselves; that is, people to whom money is owed can go down to bankruptcy court to represent themselves without a lawyer. The Presiding Officer here today, Senator Grassley, felt very strongly about that provision. And the truth is, it is a key issue. If you have a $500 debt owed to the garage, the furniture store, the jewelry store, or whatever, you may spend that much on a lawyer to go down there and represent you. What kind of relief is that, if you cannot go yourself, if you have to spend more on collection than what you collect? Senator Grassley has been very steadfast in believing that we need to change that situation. It is a good step in this bill, because most of these matters are not that complicated. All you really need is a verified claim from the person who is owed the debt. 
So I believe this bill represents a major step forward. It is a bill that seeks to lift our standards as Americans to encourage people to pay their debts if they are able to, to train and educate them so they will not get in financial trouble in the future. That is something we ought to do, to perhaps reduce this ever-increasing spiral of bankruptcy filings. 
It is a good bill. I am disappointed, shocked, and really stunned that we are now at a point where we cannot even get the bill up for debate and we have to deal with a filibuster and we are going to have to have a cloture vote on whether or not we even consider this legislation. It is not controversial. It is good legislation. It is carefully crafted. It is good for America. It is good public policy. It calls people to a higher standard, eliminates abuse and fraud and criminality, and ought to be something that will go through this Congress with the most minimal objections. 
I do not know what politics are behind the objection here. Sometimes I think it is just a desire to keep this Congress from passing anything and utilizing every rule and technical objection that can be made to frustrate the normal working through of good legislation. At any rate, I believe we will prevail on this motion, we will get the bill up, and I believe it will pass in this chamber as it did in the House, and then we will have done something good in this Congress: We will have reformed a bankruptcy system that is out of control.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to thank the distinguished Senator from Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his outstanding leadership in juvenile justice and juvenile justice reform, as he mentioned, and the other issues that come before that committee. The distinguished chairman is a great constitutional lawyer and a great champion of law and order. 
I came to this body less than 2 years ago. I was a prosecutor for over 15 years in my professional career. I have found myself with the opportunities and challenges of being the chairman of the Youth Violence Subcommittee. I made up my mind that we were not going to play politics, and that we were going to produce a bill that would have a practical impact and effect in a way that would reduce juvenile crime in America. That was the goal we set out to accomplish. 
We developed some excellent ideas and have worked with the Democratic members of the committee continuously. The committee, on a 2 to 1 vote, with bipartisan support, has cleared this bill and brought it to the floor. I must say that I am extremely disappointed to learn today that there will be no limit on debate on this bill. 
The majority leader, Senator Lott, has a lot of important pieces of legislation, and I have asked him to keep this bill alive, to keep it up on the agenda so that we can have a vote on it. We want to vote on it. But we cannot spend all of our time on this legislation, but we do not have cooperation from the other side. We had 8 weeks of debate on this legislation in committee, and I consider it to be the most significant juvenile crime legislation maybe ever, certainly in the last 20 years. 
As with most meaningful pieces of legislation, there have been some disagreements, so we worked hard, as Senator Hatch said, time and time again to make this bill more palatable to Democratic Senators. We modified it in several important areas. These modifications are in the bill and would be part of the consent agreement if we could get it today. 
So I am deeply disappointed that the minority party has rejected the unanimous consent proposal and in effect has jeopardized once again our ability to pass a strong, effective juvenile justice bill which would strengthen the juvenile system and actually reduce juvenile crime. We worked in good faith with the minority and the changes we made were designed to further accommodate them. The changes were painful and frustrating to me, and I hated to include them, but I did so in the hope that we could gain the kind of bipartisan support that would ultimately lead to passage of the things that most of us who have studied this legislation believe are critical. I am disappointed that we have not achieved that end. 
There are several important things I want to mention that are in the bill. There is a $2.5 billion block grant program to strengthen the State juvenile justice system. The money goes directly to the States. And 75 percent of the money has to go to the counties where the juvenile courts are, where the juvenile judges are overwhelmed, where they have no juvenile halfway houses, detention centers; they do not have money for drug testing. We need to strengthen that activity so that that juvenile judge, when a young person comes before him or her charged with a crime, the judge has the resources and the capacity to intervene effectively in that child's life. And if the judge intervenes effectively, they can perhaps change that child's direction, which is oftentimes on the road to destruction--put them on the right path, help get them off drugs by drug testing, place them back into school, get mental health treatment if that is called for, and obtain the family counseling that is so often necessary. 
According to a New York Times front page article on juvenile justice, the Chicago court system spends 5 minutes per case. How can a judge work with that kind of caseload and workload? How can a judge work with insufficient probation officers, insufficient detention space for the serious offender, insufficient halfway houses, or with boot camps for those who deserve it? How can they effectively turn the tide? They cannot. And that is what is wrong. But I have a sense that all over America cities and counties are coming together, demanding that we do something about juvenile crime. 
We have spent a tremendous amount of money on adult crime. We have tripled and quadrupled our bed spaces in adult prisons. We have spent very little on juvenile crime, when that has been the No. 1 crime growth area in the country. This bill will encourage more spending to correct that situation. For the first time, it will set up a recordkeeping system that would maintain the secrecy of juvenile records from the general public but would make these records available to law enforcement officers. Right now they are not, amazing as it sounds. To get records on a child, law enforcement officers have to go out to each and every juvenile facility in the country. They cannot get them from a national crime information center. 
Drug testing is a critical event in effectively diagnosing a young person's problems. What we require is that youngsters who are arrested for crimes be drug tested upon their arrest. We fund that testing by giving the States money. Then the judge can know whether this child's criminality is being driven by a drug problem or not. And if it is, they can require drug treatment. 
It is an absolute tragedy that we are not able to pass this bill today. Judge Eric Holder, Washington, DC, who wants drug testing of everyone, said it is absolutely essential for a judge to know whether the kids and adults coming before the court have a drug problem. 
Mr. President, this bill is a professionally crafted bill. It remains, in my opinion, an effective, solid, progressive step of historic proportions to assist our State and local communities to effectively deal with the growing problem of juvenile crime in America. Based on my experience of over 15 years, I know that passing this legislation is the right thing to do. We must continue to work to get a vote on this bill. I will continue to listen to any suggestions for change. Senator Hatch has continued to keep the doors open for discussion so that we can proceed with this bill. 
Frankly, I believe something is happening here, and I am just going to say it. The bankruptcy bill came out of the Judiciary Committee 16 to 2. It is an absolutely excellent bankruptcy bill. It is not radical in any way and has tremendous bipartisan support, however, we come down here today and the Democratic minority members oppose even bringing it up for consideration. The juvenile justice bill comes out of committee with a 2 to 1 vote and the minority objects, a filibuster, and refuses to agree to a rational compromise on debate. 
It appears to me that the members of the other party are obstructing legislation. For some reason, they do not want good legislation to pass. We ought to be working on these bills. If there is a legitimate difficulty, let's deal with it. I am willing to do so. But it is time for us to pass good legislation. I don't think it is right for people to go around talking about a do-nothing Congress when we produce good legislation, bring it to the floor, only to have the minority object under the rules of this body. The rules are legitimately utilized, but the other side ought to be held accountable for obstructing good legislation. 
So, again, I am disappointed that we could not get this agreement. I believe that we have an outstanding juvenile justice bill and I have been honored to work with Senator Hatch and others on the committee to produce it. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, which I have drafted to address a matter which is of growing concern in my state. In particular, my constituents who live and work in the coastal communities of Alabama have voiced serious and legitimate concerns about the validity of recently issued National Marine Fisheries Service regulations which threaten to reduce the total allowable catch of red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico this year. The red snapper stock in the Gulf of Mexico is a very important economic asset for my state and, in fact, serves as a major economic linchpin for many of these coastal communities. I believe that my bill presents a reasonable solution to ensuring the long-term viability of the snapper stocks while also ensuring continuity and economic stability for individuals and communities who are so reliant on the income that commercial and recreational snapper fishing provides. Additionally, I feel that this bill could provide relief for persons in the shrimp industry, who feel that they have been unduly and unfairly burdened by NMFS regulatory requirements. Mr. President, I would also like to stress that this bill would assist all Gulf Coast communities that rely on the red snapper as an asset and I would hope that my colleagues who are hearing the same concerns from their constituencies will join with me in support of this bill. 
Mr. President, I will have more to say about this bill in the future. For the sake of brevity, however, I would simply like to highlight some of the features in my legislation. To begin with, it maintains a total allowable catch of 9,120,000 pounds for each calendar year 1998 through 2001 which is to be allocated according to the current 51% commercial and 49% recreational split. The intent of this language is to provide certainty to our coastal communities by establishing a total allowable catch quota for this time period which cannot be lowered. The bill also provides that release of this quota cannot be conditioned upon the performance of bycatch reduction devices over the 1998-2001 time period. Additionally, the legislation maintains the current minimum size limits, and maintains the National Marine Fisheries Service's recently established 4 bag limit. My bill also requires the Secretary of Commerce to immediately review existing turtle excluder devices to see if they can be certified as bycatch reduction devices in the hopes that, if they can be so certified, shrimpers will be spared the cutting of an additional hole in their nets. Finally, my bill will also require a future study of bycatch reduction efficiency to be undertaken by the Secretary so that snapper management techniques can be based on accurate, and scientifically sound, understanding of the role that bycatch reduction devices can play in our efforts to continue to strengthen the replenishing snapper stocks. In my view, this bill adds clarity and stability to a situation that has been needlessly complicated over the past several years, and will allow both the regulators and the regulated community an opportunity to `catch their breath' as we determine the proper steps to take in resolving this ongoing debate.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce `The Collegiate Learning and Student Savings Act' a common sense piece of legislation which will help more than 2.5 million students afford a college education. 
This legislation, cosponsored by Senators Bob Graham, Mitch McConnell and Paul Coverdell, will allow private colleges and universities to establish prepaid tuition plans and allow a family's investment in ALL state or private tuition savings and prepaid plans to be tax-free. 
Let me take a few minutes to discuss the concept of prepaid tuition plans and why they are critically important to America's families. 
As a parent who has put two children through college and who has another currently enrolled in college, I know first-hand that America's families are struggling to meet the rising costs of higher education. In fact, American families have already accrued more college debt in the 1990s than during the previous three decades combined. The reason is twofold: the federal government subsidizes student debt with interest rate breaks and penalizes educational savings by taxing the interest earned on that savings. 
In recent years, however, many families have tackled rising tuition costs by taking advantage of pre-paid college tuition plans. These plans allow families to purchase tuition credits years in advance. Thanks to innovative programs already established by 17 states, like my home state of Alabama, parents can actually lock in today's tuition rates for tomorrow's education. 
Congress has supported participating families by expanding the scope of the pre-paid tuition plans and by deferring the taxes on the interest earned until the student goes off to college. 
My legislation, modeled after the efforts of the House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer and Senator Coverdell's efforts on the `A+ Education Accounts' bill, will make earnings in state AND private education pre-paid plans completely tax-free. 
Currently, most of the interest earned by families saving for college is taxed twice. Families are taxed on the income they earn and then again on the interest they earn through savings. On the other hand, the federal government subsidizes student loans by deferring interest payments until graduation. It is no wonder that families are struggling to save for college and instead are going heavily into debt. This trend must not continue. 
In order to provide families a new alternative, `The Collegiate Learning and Student Savings Act' will provide tax-free treatment to all pre-paid plans for public and private colleges and universities. This would place all savings plans and all schools on an equal playing field. 
This bipartisan piece of legislation would not only provide American families with more than $1 billion dollars in much-needed tax relief over the next decade, but would also help control the cost of college for all students. In fact, the track record of existing state pre-paid plans indicates that working, middle-income families, not the rich, benefit the most from pre-paid plans. 
Mr. President, It is erroneous to assume that tuition savings and prepaid plans benefit mainly the wealthy. In fact, the experience of existing state plans indicates that working, middle-income families benefit most. For example, families with an annual income of less than $35,000 purchased 62 percent of the prepaid tuition contracts sold by Pennsylvania in 1996. The average monthly contribution to a family's college savings account during 1995 in Kentucky was $43. 
Prepaid tuition plans must become law. The federal government can no longer subsidize student debt with interest rate breaks and penalize educational savings by taxing the interest earned by families who are trying to save for college. Both public and private prepaid tuition plans should be held equal by the federal government and must be completely tax free. If these goals are achieved, the federal government would be providing families the help they need to meet the cost of college through savings rather than through debt. 
Mr. President, American families accumulated more college debt during the first five years of the 1990s than in the previous three decades combined. Recognizing that this trend cannot continue, several states have established tuition savings and prepaid tuition plans. Now, a nationwide consortium of more than 50 private schools, with more than 1 million alumni, has launched a similar plan for private institutions. These plans are extremely popular with parents, students, and alumni. They make it easier for families to save for college, and the prepaid tuition plans also take the uncertainty out of the future cost of college. 
`The Collegiate Learning and Student Savings Act' eliminates the double taxation that exists on interest earned through the programs and ends the disparity that currently exists between public and private colleges. 
Mr. President, I would like to thank the cosponsors of `The Collegiate Learning and Student Savings Act', Senators Graham, McConnell and Coverdell, for their assistance and dedication to this issue.

Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I want to say a couple things that I think are very important. I think this amendment is much more important than it may appear to some who probably will be casting their vote on it. We are a great Nation, the greatest Nation in the history of the world. This body, this Senate, has traditionally been involved in American foreign policy and American national defense. We are spending a very large sum of money on this mission which is ill-defined and provides little immediate benefit to our Nation. Other nations which have a far clearer and more direct interest in it are contributing far less to it. 
This mission has exceeded $10 billion, money which comes from the American taxpayers. We went through a BRAC process, a base-closing process of which the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Oklahoma, who is here today, are all quite aware. We saved $9 billion. We spent more than that already on Bosnia, an operation that has very little vision. The President has articulated very poorly and inadequately, in my opinion, any justification for an extended mission with no end in sight. 
As the President said in remarks earlier, it was a political decision to move into this area of the world. Therefore, it is a decision quite appropriate for this body to respond to. I say it is time for us to confront the issue, demand some answers, require the President to be responsible, and assert our rightful role as a U.S. Senate in American national defense. I am, frankly, disappointed that a Senator would move to table and cut off debate on this issue. 
I think we ought to say a lot more about it, and we ought to have a lot of time talking about it, not be cutting off this debate. Maybe some of them have made up their minds, they think they know what is best for everybody else here, but I am not so certain they do. So I don't know. 
I do not have much time. I know others do. And we are going to have the vote on the motion to table shortly. And I just feel very strongly about it. We have a role in this world, not to be the policemen. We have ballistic missile defense. We have chemical, biological weapons. We have strategic capabilities that we must fulfill. We cannot just drift into this without a clear understanding of our mission. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks on the family impact statement amendment offered by Senator Spencer Abraham earlier today. It is an amendment that I supported last year. I think it is a very, very important signal and an important event for this Government. 
I rise today in strong support of this important amendment and to voice my complete disagreement with antifamily action taken by President Clinton. 
In 1997, President Ronald Reagan, recognizing the importance of the American family and the need to be aware of the negative impact that Federal laws and regulations can have on the family, signed Executive Order 12-606. The purpose was to ensure that the rights of the family are considered in the construction and carrying out of policies by executive departments and agencies of this Government. 
Mr. President, even though we are faced with a staggering increase in out-of-wedlock births, rising rates of divorce, and increases in the number of child abuse cases, apparently President Clinton does not believe that considering the impact of regulations on families is good policy. 
Much to my dismay, on April 21, 1997, President Clinton signed Executive Order 13045, thus stripping from the American family any existing protection from harm in the formulation and application of Federal policies. 
President Reagan's Executive Order 12606, placed special emphasis on the relationship between the family and the Federal Government. President Reagan directed every Federal agency to asses all regulatory and statutory provisions `that may have significant potential negative impact on the family well-being. * * *' Before implementing any Federal policy, agency directors had to make certain that the programs they managed and the regulations they issued met certain family-friendly criteria. Specifically, they had to ask: 
Does this action strengthen or erode the authority and rights of parents in educating, nurturing, and supervising their children? 
Does it strengthen or erode the stability of the family, particularly the marital commitment? 
Does it help the family perform its function, or does it substitute government activity for that function? 
Does it increase or decrease family earnings, and do the proposed benefits justify the impact on the family budget? 
Can the activity be carried out by a lower level of government or by the family itself? 
What message, intended or otherwise, does this program send concerning the status of the family? 
What message does it send to young people concerning the relationship between their behavior, their personal responsibility, and the norms of our society? 
The elimination of President Reagan's Executive Order 12606 is just the latest in a series of decisions that indicates the Clinton administration's very different approach to family issues. From the outset of President Clinton's first term, it became clear that his administration intended to pursue policies sharply at odds with traditional American moral principles. White House actions have ranged from the incorporation of homosexuals into the military to the protection of partial-birth abortion procedures, to opposing parental consent in cases involving abortion for minors. 
Mr. President, many have suggested it is community villages, in other words government, that raise children. But really it's families that raise children. Families are the ones who are there night and day to love, to care for, and to nurture children. 
Many bureaucratic regulations produce little benefit, but can have unintended consequences. The examples are too numerous to mention. 
What our amendment will do is to require the `regulators' to stop and take a moment to think through their regulations to make sure that, the most fundamental institution in civilization--the family, is not damaged by their actions. This is a reasonable and wise policy. 
Mr. President, I find it very odd that of all the Executive orders that exist, President Clinton would reach down and lift this one up for elimination. This body should speak out forcefully on this subject and I am confident we will. The families of America deserve no less. 
This amendment is a sound and reasonable piece of legislation which will restore a valuable pro-family policy that had been established for 10 years. 
I urge all my colleagues to stand united, Republicans and Democrats, to show that the preservation of the family is not a partisan issue. Our voices united will send a loud and certain message to the President and this Nation that we consider family protection to be one of America's most important issues and we will not accept decisions that mark a retreat from our steadfast commitment to our Nation's families. 
Mr. President, I strongly believe that American families must be considered when the Federal Government develops and implements policies and regulations that affect families. Therefore, I am honored to be an original cosponsor for this amendment, which will reinstate the Executive order of President Reagan. 
I would like to thank my colleagues, Senators Abraham, Faircloth, Hutchinson, for their dedicated work and help on this issue. 
As we know, there is some dispute and controversy and concern in this body concerning the President's proclivity to utilize executive regulations to carry out various policies that he wants to carry out. He eliminated this regulation of President Reagan by his own Executive Order, and in fact has stated and reflected his view that the American family is not at times jeopardized by the actions of this Government, and special watch and attention is not necessary to that. 
I just want to say this. Governmental policy in this country ought to consider what is good, wholesome, and healthy. The American family represents the finest opportunity to affect the growth, health, well-being, the mental attitude, and the lawfulness of a young person. Healthy families tend to raise healthy children. It is not always so. It is not always so. Families that have trouble raise good kids a lot of time, and families that are personally good have troubled children. 
But fundamentally and historically we know, and there has been much data in recent months and years--you remember the article, `Dan Quayle Was Right.' So we know that there is a general consensus today that a healthy family is important. 
I think it was a bad signal. I think it is sad that in this entire monumental bureaucracy of this Federal Government that involves $1.7 trillion in expenditures every year, you don't have to give special concern to your actions with regard to how they might impact the American family. 
I think in that regard the President made a serious error, and he sent a signal to this great Government and those who work for him within the executive branch that they don't have to give special scrutiny to it. I believe it was a mistake. Senator Abraham's amendment would restore that. 
I thank Senator Campbell for his interest and concern on these issues and for giving me a few moments to make these remarks. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Ohio, Senator DeWine, for offering this important amendment. 
This amendment will maintain in force the current law restricting Federal funding for abortions to cases of rape, incest, or life of the mother. 
This amendment would leave in place the restriction on Federal Employee Health Benefit Plans which prevents those plans from paying for abortions except in the case of rape or incest, and when the life of the mother is in danger. 
The principle here is simple: Should the taxpayers, regardless of whether they are pro-life or not, be forced to pay for abortions? 
Make no mistake about it, abortions provided under the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program would be subsidized by the taxpayers. Although employees are charged for the health plan they elect, a significant portion of the cost of those plans is offset by the Government using taxpayer dollars. 
Therefore, by participating in a health plan, employees who oppose abortion are effectively subsidizing abortions when they pay their health insurance premiums. If the major health plans all fall in line and start paying for abortions, employees who are morally opposed to abortion are put in a very difficult position. 
There are millions of Americans, myself included, who feel very strongly that abortion is the taking of an innocent human life. It is unconscionable to ask taxpayers to subsidize elective abortions. 
Whatever your position on abortion is, this is one point we should all be able to agree on. 
Congress has consistently agreed that we should not ask taxpayers to promote a policy, in essence, of paying for abortion on demand by a Federal employee. 
This is the same amendment that was accepted by voice vote during the debate for fiscal year 1998 Treasury-Postal Appropriations; accepted by this body during the debate for fiscal year 1996; and in fact, this is the same language that has been supported by a bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives from 1983 to 1998. 
Madam President, I will just say this. People in this country can disagree about the sensitive issue of abortion. The laws are as they are. Some people like them, some people don't like them. But with regard to the question of whether or not taxpayers ought to be required to fund abortions, this country and the law and the vote of almost every State and this Congress has been not to fund that, and not to take taxpayers' money from individuals who feel very, very deeply and personally about this issue and expend that money to eliminate life. That is not a choice that we believe this Congress ought to make. We ought to prohibit it as part of this legislation. Maybe we won't even need a vote on it. But if we do, so be it. I think it will pass again this year, as it has. 
Again, I appreciate the work of the Senator from Ohio for reestablishing this year this important principle.

Mr. SESSIONS. I rise in support of this proposal by Senators Hutchinson and Brownback, the proposal so eloquently supported by the majority leader, Trent Lott. He is exactly right, in my opinion. 
I was at that first press conference when this proposal was announced. I believed in it then and I believe in it now. The Internal Revenue Code with 7,500 pages and over 800,000 words, has grown each year and continues to grow. We cannot ask the American people to read thousands of pages before they pay their taxes. We cannot ask them to pay hundreds and hundreds of dollars to have accountants do their tax returns, returns they used to be able to do themselves. It is simply not fair, and it is not right. 
As I recall what a good tax is supposed to be, if there is a good tax, according to the textbooks, it is a tax that is understandable. It is a tax that is predictable in terms of revenue. I would say that is one thing our Tax Code does, it produces a very large but predictable supply of revenue. But a `good' tax is also supposed to be easy to collect and is supposed to be perceived as fair. I would say it is only in the predictability of revenue that our Tax Code acceptable. Otherwise, it is really on unacceptable terms that revenue is raised to fund this great Government. 
A few months ago, last fall, Dick Armey and Billy Tauzin from the House of Representatives came to my hometown of Mobile, AL, to have a debate about the Tax Code. Mr. Armey is in favor of a flat tax, and Mr. Tauzin, a consumption tax. The place was packed, standing room only. They announced it on the television and on Sunday night people came out from all over. They were fascinated and asked questions. They were energized by this debate. I am told that everywhere Mr. Armey and Mr. Tauzin go people are there in record numbers; they are interested in this issue, and they care about it. 
For days after the debate in Mobile, people came up to me, and this is the question they asked: Jeff, can we really do it? Is this something we can do? And my answer to them was: Absolutely, we can do it. There is no reason under this Sun that we cannot pass a simplified Tax Code. We must be able to say to the American people, the people who elected us, that we can produce a Tax Code that is simple, fair, easy to understand, and produces a steady revenue. And whether it is a flat tax or a consumption tax or some combination of both, we need to focus on this issue in Congress. 
By passing a deadline, with 4 years to go, we will set a date that will force us to confront this issue and respond to the wishes of the American people. Having run for office just recently, in 1996, I know the American people are confident the Government is going to have money to run itself. I also know they want tax reductions. With the recent surpluses, they want more than they wanted just a few years ago. But what they really want is a Tax Code that is simple and fair, and we can give that to them. We need to make a commitment to that end. And if we do so, I believe that people in this country will appreciate it very much. 
I favor this proposal. The American people are fed up. It will help make this country competitive because we will not have wasted all this time and effort collecting taxes. Instead, we will spend it developing new and improved products in our businesses and industries in America so that they can continue to be competitive in the world. 
I appreciate this opportunity to speak. I salute Senators Hutchinson and Brownback and all others who support this amendment, and I look forward to being a part of the reality of eliminating the Internal Revenue Code as we know it today.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I had occasion to study this issue previously, and there is a serious question this country is facing. I believe the Supreme Court has given attention and careful review to it. I believe they are very, very sensitive to the national interest in having minority citizens, minority groups be able to rise and succeed in our Nation. At the same time, I think the Supreme Court is troubled by a policy that, in effect, says you have a preference simply because of the color of your skin. In fact, I think that they have said Adarand could violate the Constitution of the United States. 
That is a serious matter. I believe the Adarand decision is well decided. I believe in my judgment, and I don't claim to be a Supreme Court Justice, but in my judgment the present statute that we passed is in violation of Adarand. But, regardless of that, the President has said that he can cure the problems of Adarand through regulations and they intend to issue regulations that would avoid this conflict. I am not sure that is possible. It may be. But what I hear the Senator from Kentucky to say is we are not here to debate that issue again. We are simply saying that if this law, and the regulations imposed by it, violate the Constitution of the United States, before we pass it we ought to set up a system in which there can be a prompt review by the courts to judge on that. 
That is all this does, it seems to me. I salute him for suggesting at least one small step that will reach a final conclusion of this matter. 
Before the Senate Judiciary Committee we had hearings on this matter. We had the lady who was married to the president of Adarand Corporation. She testified how they had suffered because of the set-asides in the transportation law. I think it is a serious question. If it is outside the Constitution, they ought to have an expedited review. 
I think the Senator from Kentucky has proposed a reasonable, fair amendment. I think any of us ought to be able to support that. I thank him for doing so, and I look forward to continuing this healthy debate about how we ought to disperse the benefits in this country, what standards should be applied, and how our goods and services ought to be dispersed. I suggest they should not be dispersed on the basis of the color of one's skin. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Yes, the Senator is quite correct. It does apply to a number of different circumstances. Some of those circumstances, I suggest, probably are constitutional. Many of those things may be required. Certain parts of it may not be. I suggest, with regard to those that may not be, let's go on and not have it take 3 years to get up through the court system. Let's have a review so there can be a prompt determination of what would be legitimate and what would not be.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to say how much I have appreciated the opportunity to work with Chairman Hatch. He is an outstanding leader, a terrific lawyer, an outstanding constitutional scholar, and a champion for bringing order and discipline to ending crime in America. There is no one here who has contributed more over the years to that effort than Senator Hatch. And his advice and friendship, as we have gone forward, has been very, very helpful to me. 
Mr. President, let me just say this. I am going to go right to the heart of this matter. I came here to work on juvenile crime after serving as a Federal prosecutor for 15 years and attorney general of Alabama for 2 years. I care about juvenile crime. I have studied it. I have talked to juvenile crime experts--prosecutors, probation officers, judges--who have worked with it on a regular basis. 
I have concluded that we have a juvenile justice system that is overwhelmed by the flood of more and more cases, more and more serious cases. According to a New York Times article, in Chicago they spend 5 minutes per case. That shows you what is happening in America, around the country. 
You talk to police officers in every town and they are frustrated by what is happening in juvenile justice. They tell me, `Jeff, we can't do anything to them, and they know it. They are laughing at us.' I have heard that all over. It is not the fault of the judges. But it is really the fault of all of us who have allowed the adult criminal justice system--and rightly so--to be strengthened significantly. 
We have gone to three times as many adult people in jail, for example, as we had just 18 years ago. And now we have had very little increase in the number of youngsters who have been detained under any kind of detention program than we had before. And we have had the most serious increase in the most violent type criminal activity by that younger group. 
So what do we do about it? They say we need a balance between prevention and law enforcement. And I agree with that. What we want to do--and my amendment does--is seek to have balance. 
Look at this chart. We have $4.3 billion dedicated to prevention programs in this budget already. That is what this Government is spending. This is from a study done by the General Accounting Office that was just completed in May of this year. We found that there is no money dedicated solely for juvenile law enforcement--unless perhaps we count the money that was funded in the block grant that I am supporting today from last year. Otherwise, there is none. I think we need to think seriously about what we are doing. 
Under this bill, this appropriations bill, the amount of money that was to be expended for the block grant program to increase and support juvenile justice in our local communities to help our States do that--we have gone from $250 million in last year's budgetary authority, cut to $100 million this year. 
In addition to that, in the program that the President has supported, we have gone from $20 million to $95 million. I want to share with you what that program spends the money on. This is the prevention program that has gone from $20 million to $95 million in this year's budget. 
It says it is to provide juvenile justice system programs for children, youth, and families, these things: Recreational services. Now, that is No. 1 listed on the plan--recreational services. I am for recreation, but I am not sure in a juvenile crime bill, in an effort to fight crime, we ought to be promoting recreation. 
Tutoring and remedial education. I am going to show you here in a minute a list of 129 programs that are filled with those kinds of activities. What we do not have is any help for our juvenile judges and probation officers and drug treatment personnel in the court systems. 
Here is the third one: Assistance. This is what it says: `Assistance in the development of work awareness skills.' 
That is on what we are spending $50 million. I don't know what that means. 
Child and adolescent health and mental health services. We have a host of those already funded by this Government. 
Alcohol and prevention programs. We have that pending legislation right now to a tremendous degree, and we already have programs spending moneys on that. 
Leadership and development activities. Now, I don't know what that means. 
Finally, teaching that people are and should be held accountable for their actions. I agree with that. But how do you teach people to be accountable for their actions if you arrest a youngster in a household burglary and he is taken to the police station and released that very night and sent home and nothing happens to him? Is that the way you teach it? I say that is what they are hearing. That is what people are hearing and that is what you will find if you talk to your law enforcement officer. 
What are we already funding in this governmental program? We are spending $4 billion in 129 programs for at-risk delinquent youth, according to the General Accounting Office. Here, under Department of Treasury, gang resistance education and training projects, $8 million; juvenile justice delinquency prevention and mentoring, $4 million; juvenile justice prevention allocation of the States, $70 million. 
Under Department of Labor, employment and training research and development projects; job training for the homeless demonstration program; and so on and so on, program after program after program, designed with good intentions to deal with kids who are at risk. 
Now, let's go back to square one. Let me tell you what I think ought to be done. Who are the most at-risk children? Those are the ones who are going to court now. According to a Newsweek article, 70 percent of the young people who murder someone have taken a gun to school previously. That is a stunning number. What that says does not surprise me in the sense that most of the young people in America who are committing serious crimes--the armed robberies, the assault with intent to murder, the murders, the rapes--have been in trouble with the judge and the courts before. They have been there before. If the courts are spending only 5 minutes to deal with them, no wonder they are coming back time and time and time again. 
As Senator Hatch said, our goal must be to make that first brush with the law the last. How can we do that? That is what we are saying. What should this Senate do? I am telling you, based on my experience and the hearings we have had for the last 2 years, what we need to do is strengthen the juvenile justice system. That is what we need to do. 
Now, that does not mean you put people in jail every time they get caught. It means when you arrest them, the first thing you should do is drug test them. Is this criminality being driven by drugs? If it is, then we ought to have them in a treatment program. They ought to be drug tested and monitored to make sure they get off drugs. That is the first thing you do. If this is the third, fourth, or fifth offense and they have committed a serious crime, they ought to be detained. We cannot continue to allow repeat offenders to run at large, even though they are 16 or 17 years of age. 
There was a murder in Montgomery, AL. Three youngsters killed a night watchman. I called the police department to ask about the prior record of those offenders. This is what they told me: 7, 7, and 15 prior arrests. That is what they had, each one of them. One 7, one 7, and another 15 prior arrests. They were still on the street. The revolving door was still operating and they murdered somebody. We would have done them a favor had they been detained, sent to an alternative school, sent to a boot camp. Perhaps we could have intervened in that lifestyle and stopped that murder from occurring. As it is, they were certified as an adult, will now be convicted as an adult, and sent off to an adult jail for a very long sentence. Who benefited from that? 
The reason is that juvenile court system in Alabama, and all over America, is overwhelmed. Our bill provides an incentive grant to the States for the purposes of strengthening that. It will give those juvenile judges the authority they need to crack down on juvenile crime and to change that life direction that is heading in the wrong direction, to the right direction. 
Let me tell you what this money can be used for. It will be used for programs to enhance prosecution and confinement of juvenile criminals as part of the graduated sanctions proposal. Everyone, on both sides of the aisle, agrees that we need graduated sanctions. When you are caught for one offense and you do another one, you go up a punishment level. The sanction is a punishment increase. That sends an important message that crime does not pay. 
It would fund programs that require juvenile delinquents to pay restitution to victims of juvenile crime. It would fund programs that require juvenile offenders to complete school or 
vocational training. That is what our proposal would do. It would require juvenile criminals to pay child support. If they have a child, they ought to be supporting that child. There would be programs to curb truancy. We need to get these kids back in school promptly. As soon as we can identify truants, they need to be apprehended and sent back to school before they get so far behind that they are hopelessly behind their contemporaries. 
Programs need to be designed to collect, record, and disseminate information on their criminal history. It would provide drug testing, programs for antidrug youth programs and the like. It would have a serious habitual offender program. It would have programs targeted toward youth gangs, and the construction and remodeling of short-term facilities for juvenile offenders. You have to have someplace to put them or you are just releasing them the very day they are caught. That is what is happening. They are being released the day they are caught. We need more juvenile facilities so there can be some detention. This would allow the States to apply for a grant, for matching money, to have detention facilities, alternative schools and boot camps and whatever they think is necessary to strengthen their court system. 
As a policymaker, recognize we have a limited amount of money. How do we apply that money most effectively? Who do we use it on? We use it on, I suggest, those people who are already coming into contact with the criminal justice system. Routinely, they are being arrested in America today for the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, tenth time, and nothing serious has happened. The reason is we have not given enough attention and support to those juvenile judges, those prosecutors, those probation officers, who are out every day trying to change lives. If we can strengthen that group, that is what we should do. 
Now, I am not opposed to general programs, after-school programs. I am not opposed to alternative schools. In fact, I would support those. Our proposal and our need today, the most critical need, is to identify those young offenders who are heading to a life of serious criminality, who have the potential to kill somebody, maybe your son or daughter, maybe my son or daughter. We see in the headlines every day young people committing those kinds of crimes. 
The answer to it is to find out who is capable of that at the earliest possible stage and do something about it. Most of those are going to be coming through the juvenile court system. In that juvenile court system, most good ones--and I have visited them around the country; they have mental health treatment, drug treatment, counseling, incarceration, alternative schools, evaluations to determine whether or not they have learning disabilities and those kinds of problems--try to get those children on the right road. 
That is where we need to spend our money if we want to reduce serious juvenile crime. Spending it on every child in America in after-school programs may be a good decision for America to pursue but we have not had hearings on it and analyzed it. 
But it is an education function, primarily. This bill--our effort, our block grant--is designed to assist the juvenile justice system in performing their function of identifying and confronting those young offenders when they first brush up against the law, and to make sure that first brush is their last brush. 
If we do that, we will be investing our money wisely. I submit that the program that is in this bill that I just shared with you is vague, unspecific, and does not deal primarily with the kids that we need to deter from crime; and taking the money from that program and shifting it to this block grant and increasing it will focus our resources on the kids that need it the most. 
I yield my time.

Mr. SESSIONS. I enjoyed listening to the Senator. I think he suggested something that, maybe indirectly, he didn't mean to. 
First, I want to say I am aware of and respect and appreciate what the Senator has done over the years on crime prevention and law enforcement. But the Senator is not suggesting, I don't think, that any one of these programs is targeted for reduction in any fashion by this amendment, is he? This amendment would simply take a new program and not increase it as much as my colleague and others may prefer to, but none of these programs is threatened. It is not a block grant of any existing programs?

Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I have had an interesting time listening to the Senator from Delaware with his remarks about the purpose and intent of our amendment. I think in that regard he is in error. And I think we should talk about that. 
First of all, the Fraternal Order of Police, whom he quoted, and the Boys & Girls Clubs, have supported the incentive block grants. I certainly agree that prevention, intervention, and enforcement are the keys to the effort to reduce juvenile crime. 
And what is intervention? The experts are telling me--mental health workers, drug abuse people, judges, probation officers whom I have talked with at great length--tell me the most effective point of intervention is when a child has been arrested for some sort of offense, taken to the juvenile court, and answers to the judge and the probation officer. His parents are involved. And if that child is found to be involved with drugs or other psychological or emotional problems that may be involved, that is the single best time to intervene and to prevent them from future criminal conduct that not only makes victims out of innocent young children, who are most often the victims of other juvenile offenders, but also prevents that child perhaps from heading down a life of crime that would leave them serving long periods of time in prison. 
And the Senator says these programs that I have cited are not prevention programs. 
I find that really stunning, to say a homeless youth program, a program designed to deal with homeless youth, isn't a crime prevention program. It surprises me to hear him say that. 
Mental health programs, he suggested, are not prevention programs. Or children who are victims of abuse as a child, programs that deal with that certainly are prevention programs. By the way, our amendment does not affect any of these programs. They all continue. 
The Foster Grandparent Program, I suggest, is a way to prevent children from being involved in crime. Art for Youth--that is what the art people tell me, `We need more programs to help these young people express themselves,' and that would help prevent them from a life of crime. At-Risk Youth Program, certainly those are prevention programs. I just say we have many prevention programs. 
In fact, we have none dedicated to law enforcement. The fact that the Department of Justice spends several billions of dollars on law enforcement should not be in any way considered to have an impact on youth crime, because the truth is the Federal Government does not deal with juvenile criminals. They probably prosecute less than 100 a year in all the Federal courts in America, certainly less than a couple hundred. It is just not done. Juvenile crime is dealt with in the State systems. That is where we have the crisis. That is where we need to do something about it. 
The Senator from Delaware is most eloquent in advocating after-school programs. For who? Under what circumstances? How much will we spend on them? Which agency should administer that? I suggest without any hesitation that the Department of Justice doesn't need to be the agency handling an after-school program. That ought to be done through the educational establishment.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand the Senator's concern, passion, and emotional commitment to that problem of 14 million kids, after school, many of whom are unsupervised. I understand that. 
But I believe if we are going to have an after-school program that doesn't distinguish between at-risk kids and others, we are talking about billions of dollars, tens of billions of dollars, an amount of money of which our program doesn't even scratch the surface; we are talking $50 million, is what we are talking about. How can we best use that $50 million in some sort of vague, generalized program? 
Let me read to you again what this statute would dispense under the grant for prevention programs: for recreational services, tutoring programs, assessment in work awareness skills. JJTPA, the job program for youth, isn't that a prevention program, $1 billion spent on that? Certainly tries to help young people who are out of work and who have never worked before get a job. That is a prevention program. We are spending $1.1 billion on that. 
What we need to do is deal with the youngsters who are coming into contact with the juvenile justice system. If something isn't done about it, they are going to murder somebody or they are going to end up committing an armed robbery and having to serve 20 years, because they are certified as an adult because they committed a serious crime at age 17 and they have to go off for 20 years. Had we had a juvenile justice system capable of intervening early--at 12, 13, 14 or 15, when they are being arrested again and again--they wouldn't be down there. 
I have been there. I have talked to juvenile probation officers and judges who have dealt with this on a daily basis. I am telling you, the Juvenile Judges Association in this country endorses this block grant program wholeheartedly. They know that is what we need to do. We need to be dealing with the kids who are most at risk, the ones already coming into contact with juvenile justice. 
This plan to spend $50 million more on this program is political. That is what it is. It is a political game. We are going to create a confrontation on the floor and we are going to say we care about children, we want to prevent them from crime, and we are going to spend more on all of these programs; this wide open deal--it has no goals, no standards, no real teeth to it--spend the money on anything in the world. That is on what we want to spend our money. Everybody who has any support 
for the law enforcement community doesn't like kids, doesn't want to see them change, doesn't care about prevention. All you guys want to lock them up. 
Some children need to be locked up. I just told the Members of this body about the three kids who murdered a night watchman--7, 7, and 15 prior arrests for those kids. They would have been better, that night watchman and his family, would have been better if the court system had enough resources to intervene effectively at that point in time. 
That is not mean. That is not unkind. That is not a kind of response that is insensitive. You simply cannot allow repeat, dangerous young offenders to be released time after time after time with nothing more than vague programs like this to deal with it. 
Do you think that juvenile judge who has given his life to dealing with kids, do you think that juvenile probation officer who has been working with them all of his life, doesn't care about them? Do you think they are not going to try to craft a program that would help those children? I am telling you, that is what is happening in America where there is sufficient resources for it. Some of them have to be incarcerated. 
One of the greatest success stories is in Boston, MA. You have heard about the Boston Miracle. They did two things. They targeted their resources. A professor from the University of Maryland advised the Department of Justice, `If you want to reduce crime, target your resources on the groups and the people who need it the most, primarily those who have been arrested.' But in Boston they took the high crime communities, the areas where there were gangs, they confronted the gang members and told them if they did not change their lifestyle, they would be prosecuted. The judges backed them up. They locked up those who were the leaders and the others quit being so active. The murder rate plummeted. It was dramatic what they had done. 
My staff member went there and visited with them in Boston. She said, `Do you have a place to put them when they violate probation and curfew,' and they said, `Yes, that was a commitment on behalf of the community.' 
So we are giving resources to the juvenile justice system to set aside the kind of detention facilities, alternative schools, safe houses, whatever they feel is necessary to be able to remove that kid, discipline them for repeat offenses, and change their lifestyle. 
But it is important they not be left on the street, leading a bunch of other kids down the wrong path. If you get rid of the main leaders, a lot of the other kids will cease to be involved in a life of crime. 
What kind of a message does it send if the police arrest a youngster for the fourth time for an armed robbery or a car theft and nothing happens to him? What kind of moral message is that? This prevention grant program they want to spend $50 million on says one of the goals is to teach that people are and should be held accountable to their actions. Well, I agree with that. We are not saying that the first time a youngster gets in trouble they need to be certified as an adult or sent off for a long period of time, but they need to be confronted seriously. They have to have a serious confrontation with their own immoral, illegal act. Their parents need to be involved in that. They need to have counseling programs, drug testing, drug treatment, and other activities and programs designed to insist that they get on the right track. 
Judges and drug treatment people tell me that it is extraordinarily helpful when a person who has violated the law is under the gun of the judge. In other words, he can say you will go to that treatment program. We are going to drug test you. I expect you to stay drug free. I expect you to be back in school. I expect you to be home at night. In Boston, I expect you to follow the curfew I am going to give you. 
Boston has a curfew. They call it Operation Night Light. 
And street police officers go out and knock on the door at 8 or 9 o'clock, or whenever the curfew is, to see if that youngster is there. If he is not there, something happens to him or her. They don't just forget it. That is not happening all over America. What is happening all over America--and I was there for 15 years as a prosecutor--is they come in and meet their probation officer. Some of them have family meetings for 2 or 3 weeks; they meet with parents and try to turn them around. But because of lack of resources, they say `your curfew is 9 o'clock,' but they don't check. Nobody is checking on these children. They do what they want to, basically, unless they get caught on another offense. 
If we want to prevent crime, if we want to intervene--and intervention is one of the legs of this way to defeat crime, according to the Fraternal Order of Police--if we do that effectively, we can begin to change people. For those who want change, they simply cannot be allowed to travel in the community and threaten the lives and health of other people with impunity. We have to have spaces to put them. Our bill provides matching money that States can use, if they choose, to expand their detention capacity. And it doesn't have to be bars; it can be any kind of facility that would allow the judge to detain them and not allow them to just walk free--although some of them need to be locked up behind bars. 
Let me share this number with you. Since 1980, adult prison space in America has more than tripled. Adult crime has been dropping now for some time now to a significant degree. I am convinced that one of the reasons for that is because we are doing a better job of identifying the repeat dangerous offenders, and they are serving longer periods of time. They are not corrupting others around them, and they are not out on the street committing crimes. Many repeat offenders--we know, according to a Rand study--commit as many as 200 crimes per year. You may say that is ridiculous, they don't commit 200 crimes per year. Well, that is four burglaries a week. Many commit four in one night. These repeat offenders commit a substantial amount of the crime in America. And the same is true with juveniles. We simply have to identify those, and some of them are going to have to be incarcerated. 
But while we were tripling the adult prison space in America, let me share this with you. In 1978, there were 56,000 beds in juvenile detention facilities in America. In 1994, during a period when violent juvenile crime has more than doubled--I am talking about armed robbery, assault with intent to murder, murder; those kinds of things were doubling and more than doubling during that period, and we had gone on from 56,000 to 61,000 bed spaces by 1994. 
Do you see what happened? We poured our resources into adult criminality and we made a big impact. But we didn't respond appropriately to juvenile crime. We did not expand our commitment there. We did not give the judges and probation officers the resources needed to intervene effectively, to monitor these youngsters who need close monitoring, because they are on the edge and they can go either way. They didn't give them those resources, and as a result, juvenile crime continued to go up, while adult crime was declining.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are beginning to see a modest reduction in juvenile crime--although many experts are telling us that, with the demographics of more teenagers being in the crime-prone years, in the next few years we can expect those numbers to edge back up. I think one reason is that since 1994 States have begun to focus on juvenile crime and commit more resources to it. It is beginning to have an affect. 
It is a myth and not true that we have no ability to affect crime. That is not true. Somebody said that we are going to end up putting everybody in jail. Well, everybody doesn't rob; everybody doesn't burglarize. We ought to do something serious to everybody who commits a serious crime. If we do so promptly and effectively, with wisdom, in a smart way, we can affect the crime rate, and we can make the lives of Americans safer. We ought to do that. 
To me, there is no higher function of a government than to make its citizens safe in their communities, on their streets, in their homes, and where they go to work. What higher function could a government have than that? We have failed in that regard. I have seen it, and I have talked with the judges. That is why the Fraternal Order of Police, the Judges' Association, and the Boys and Girls Club support this project. 
Our proposal--unlike the one set forth in the statute already, in which they are adding $50 million--is targeted to deal with criminality. Their proposal, again, is for leadership development activities, recreational services, teaching that people are and should be accountable for their actions. Well, there is nothing wrong with those goals, but that is not a very good crime proposal, in my opinion. I have been there. I have prosecuted crimes, I have dealt with every aspect of it. That is not the way to deal with crime. That is not targeted at all. That says you can spend the money on any doggone thing you want to spend it on. 
Our proposal--the block grant proposal--was developed along with the support of Senator Biden from Delaware and others. And we had input and discussions with the ranking member from Vermont on the Judiciary Committee. Everybody had some input. They may not agree with everything in it, but it is focused on crime prevention, intervention and enforcement. By the way, the Senator from Delaware mentions $1 billion in prevention programs. He admits that. We only have $100 million in this enforcement program. 
By the way, also in this bill the chairman has brought out is a new $220 million for a safe schools initiative. It is designed to build partnerships in the communities between police and schools and to try to make schools safer. That is $220 million in new money in another program designed that way. What we have left out, I am telling you--I can't tell you how strongly I believe this; I know it in my heart--what we are leaving out is the greatest engine for reducing juvenile crime, and that is the juvenile court system. They are the ones that are innovating at the most basic level, when kids are out of control. They have the capacity to effectively order them to do things they don't want to do, and to monitor those orders if we give them the support necessary. 
So if we put the money into the block grant program, it would enhance prosecution and define opportunities to effectuate the bipartisan agreement that we have to support graduated sanctions or increase levels of punishment for repeat offenders. It would provide for short-term confinement for those who need it. Some do. It will also provide for the incarceration of violent repeat offenders for more extended periods. Not all the money would be for that; only 40 percent would be for that. 
It would provide moneys for programs that require juvenile delinquents to pay restitution. It would provide programs to require juvenile offenders to complete schooling in vocational training. Is that a prevention program, or not? Is that a program that doesn't care about kids, or not? Does anybody deny that we need to have some children go into custody of some fashion? I doubt that. It has programs to require young juveniles to pay their child support. They ought to support their children. They bring them into this world. 
Programs to curb truancy. The Senator from Delaware says we need to do something about truancy. I agree, absolutely. Truancy is a key signal that a child is out of control. School systems, police departments, and others ought to have an intensive effort to identify truancy at the earliest level. 
His bill, if they want to put $50 million more in, doesn't have anything about truancy in it. The program I support does. It provides programs that seek to curb truancy by name. Then it has programs to collect records, drug testing of youngsters, juvenile crime prevention programs, and night curfews. Antidrug programs could be funded under this. 
We have programs to deal with habitual offenders; programs targeted at youth gang members, trying to break them up; and programs to train law enforcement officers, juvenile judges, prosecutors, probation officers, and other court personnel in how to better deal with children. 
We have $50 million on the table. That is what we have--$50 million sitting there. Do you want to put it in this bogus program that has no standards, can be spent for anything, or a program carefully crafted, carefully crafted to identify those youngsters who need help, and get it to them in a way that will reduce crime? 
I am sorry if I feel strongly about it. But I have been involved in it for a long time. And I have worked hard on this committee. I am absolutely convinced that this is a valid program. We have many prevention programs. This has much of a prevention aspect to it. But what we don't have any money for is to strengthen our enforcement aspect. 
Mr. President, this is a critical issue to me. It is the overlook aspect of crime in America: How can we most effectively intervene and change the lifestyle of these youngsters? Too often they are coming in for vandalism, petty theft, maybe for burglary, maybe for a household burglary, a car theft. And they come in and get involved in some other serious crime, are treated as an adult, and sent off for 15 years in the slammer. If we could have intervened for the first offense or two effectively, sometimes they might have been well served if they had been sent to jail or detained a few days. If we had intervened effectively there, we would have fewer crime victims and less need for housing for a youngster who became a career criminal and ended up serving a long time in jail. 
Mr. President, that is the purpose of our amendment. I believe it meets all the standards for prevention, and for enforcement, and for intervention. I think it is the right way to go. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk recently about more and more gun laws, more and more complicated and esoteric, having less and less ability to protect the safety of the American people. 
Let me tell you we have some outstanding, effective gun laws on the books now that allow people who are felons to be prosecuted for possessing a gun, that allow the prosecution of people who carry a gun during a felony to receive 5 years without parole, consecutive to any other offense. 
Look at what this administration that is always talking about gun prosecutions has done. In 1992, when they took office, there were 7,048 `triggerlock prosecutions' of serious gun offenders in this country; now, 1997, 3,765. It has plummeted that percent. 
What they need to do is enforce the laws they have and quit worrying about passing laws that are not very relevant and not going to have any impact on crime in America. I think the American people need to understand that. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to say a few things about grand juries. I spent 15 years as a Federal prosecutor working with grand juries on a regular basis. And people say, `Oh, it's a secret proceeding.' Well, would you rather have your witnesses have to go and testify in open court? 
You see, the purpose of a grand jury is simply to determine whether there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed and whether the defendant probably committed it, to set that case for trial. It is a protection. Some say, `Well, just let the prosecutors indict and eliminate the grand jury because the grand jury will indict a ham sandwich.' I heard that here today. Grand juries will not indict a ham sandwich. 
You have to present evidence to them sufficient for them to understand the charge; and the evidence that is presented is before they will return an indictment and set the case for trial. At trial, the burden of proof is not `probably committed a crime'; at trial the burden of proof is `beyond a reasonable doubt'; to a moral certainty sometimes the judge charges the jury. So that is where the trial takes place. 
Now, I recall a line by Justice Macklin Fleming in California. He said, `Perfect justice is not achievable in this life. In the pursuit of perfect justice, we destroy what justice is achievable.' 
Well, I just say that an obsession with everything becoming more and more complicated is not the history of our Nation and its criminal law. The founders of our country realized you needed a trial and that people who are accused of crimes ought to have a chance to present their defense fully before a jury of 12 citizens, with their lawyer there to argue, debate, object, and do everything possible to defend that client in that trial, but there ought to be a vehicle to decide whether a case should go forward. They decided it was better for the defendant and for the witnesses when a charge is brought by virtue of a grand jury investigation before citizens of the community, if the testimony is taken in secret, so that if the evidence is not sufficient, the public may never even know that the individual was under investigation and his reputation would not be stained. 
I submit to you that sometimes grand juries will not indict. And also, in the course of an investigation, a prosecutor may discover, as his witnesses are called and put under oath, that the good case he thought he might have had was not sufficient. Many times I have pulled a case after presenting evidence before a grand jury because I was not confident, and the grand jury wasn't confident, that there was enough evidence to proceed to indictment. Sometimes I presented grand jury indictments to a grand jury and thought there was evidence to indict and a grand jury declined to do so. That is the power and privilege they have been given under our laws in this country. 
Based on my experience, the grand jury system certainly is working. It has served us well for 200 years. I think we ought not to, this late night, without any debate or without any analysis or without any hearings, alter this historic principle, which I believe protects citizens from embarrassment as well as unfounded charges. 
I have to suggest and note for the Record, Mr. President, that the Department of Justice strongly opposes this Bumpers amendment. They don't think it is the way we ought to be going now. I share that feeling, and that shows that both I, as a Republican Senator, and the Department of Justice agree on this. I think we are making a big mistake to go forward at this time without having considered precisely what we are doing. 
There are a number of important reasons. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee has stated quite a number of those in his excellent legal way, demonstrating his legal skill and analysis of important issues that come before us. He has made that point. I will not take any more time on it. I feel very, very strongly about this issue. I think it would be a colossal error for this body, without any hearings, to change this historic principle, because I will tell you, it will tie the grand jury in knots. You will have another adversarial hearing. You will have two trials instead of one. It will not further the ascertainment of truth, which is the purpose and nature of a grand jury. 
I know others need to talk, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are a Nation of explorers, a Nation of discoverers. Our people see ourselves in that light; the world sees us in that light. 
Unfortunately, for the last 5 years, the great agency of this Government that epitomizes our explorative nature--NASA--has seen a cut in its budget--for 5 straight years. They have reduced personnel by 25 percent since 1993. This is a tragic event. The President's budget this year had a cut of $180 million. The committee restores most of that, but it still represents a $33 million cut again this year. 
We need to put an end to that. We need to get back into exploring our solar system and our galaxy. That is who we are as a people. We need to increase the funding. This bill would first have level funding, and then get us on the road next year to increased funding. The money as an offset would come from that portion of the AmeriCorps program that pays people to volunteer. It has been zeroed out in the House, and it is a good offset.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to express my sincere appreciation to my good friend, Senator Bond, from Missouri, who is managing this bill in a magnificent fashion, and the ranking member, the distinguished Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski. She is a true friend of space and NASA. Under the leadership of these two distinguished Senators, the subcommittee has done an excellent job in crafting this important piece of legislation. 
But, this bill provides funding for a variety of important Federal agencies, and a number of areas in this bill are of special interest to me and my constituents. However, today I would like to confine my remarks to the issues involving NASA and its funding and budget. 
First, I congratulate this Senate for its strong support of the International Space Station. On July 7, a few days ago, this body voted by a 2 to 1 margin to continue this Nation's commitment to research in space. The first assembly flights of the space station are only a few months away. When it becomes operable, the space station will provide a unique microgravity laboratory that will far exceed any capability that has been previously available on the space shuttle or the Mir Space Station. Advances in medical and pharmaceutical science that result from space station research alone, may ultimately justify our national investment in the space station. Shuttle-based research is just beginning to demonstrate the enormous potential of using the microgravity environment for research into pharmaceutical products, and other aspects. Important developments in physics, materials science, life science and other fields through the space station research are not only possible, but probable in the future. 
Furthermore, perhaps more important, the space station represents a bridge to further human exploration in space. The willingness and foresight of this Congress to take a long-term view to keep the United States involved in manned exploration of the universe is important. 
Since its establishment in 1958, NASA has been a tremendous force for scientific and technological progress in this Nation. In addition, NASA has been a source of inspiration for literally millions of people, myself included, who were captivated by the dream of exploring the frontiers of space. Despite its great record and strong public support, however, NASA is laboring under the weight of several successive years of significant budget cuts. 
For fiscal year 1999, the President proposed giving NASA less than $13.5 billion, which is far less than 1 percent of the national budget. This would mark the fifth year in a row that NASA's budget has been cut, in terms of real dollars. If we consider the further reduction in buying power caused by inflation during this 5-year period, the significance of these cuts become apparent. To make matters worse, the administration's budget estimate for fiscal year 2000 contemplates almost $200 million in additional budget cuts to NASA. The cuts in the President's budget request are all the more disconcerting in that they come in a year in which the President is proposing increases for almost every other civilian research and development budget as part of what the administration calls the 21st Century Research Fund. 
Let me ask, can any agency symbolize to our people, and to the world, the discovering, adventuring spirit of America better than NASA? The administration, and this budget, appear to suggest differently. If the administration wants to build a bridge to the 21st century, then NASA must be one of its trusses. It simply does not make sense for our dynamic, high-tech Nation to keep cutting NASA's budget year after year. 
I share the concern expressed by the National Space Society. They wrote recently: 
NASA's potential to be a world leader as we move into the next millennium will be compromised by a lack of Administration interest in space exploration. 
That is a serious comment and we ought to think carefully about it. The low priority put on the space program is evident when you compare the President's budget submission with the budget projections for NASA from past administrations. This chart makes the comparison. 
In 1991, a very distinguished panel studied space, the Committee on the Future of the U.S. Space Program. They projected what we ought to be spending to keep NASA at the level at which they thought it should be. It went all the way up to almost $60 billion by the year 2003, and would be at $37 billion next year. Right now we are at $13 billion in this budget. 
In addition to that, according to the FY 1993 budget submission that was projected to carry out through this time period, we would have substantially more money in the NASA budget. Indeed, this year shows us $8 billion below the budget submission that was projected in 1993 for NASA. That is a significant reduction. During this whole time, the total reduction from the budgetary projections for NASA total $27 billion. So they have had basically a flat and declining budget at a time they were projected to go up significantly. I think those are matters of great importance. 
Norm Augustine, the Chairman of Martin Marietta, saw the need for NASA budgets which would rise by 10 percent a year through the end of the decade. We have not kept up with his vision for America and the Commission's vision for America, and we must do better about that. 
Let me ask this: How has NASA coped with these large budget reductions that they sustained? In my view, they have done very well. Under the leadership of Administrator Dan Goldin, NASA has made `Doing more with less' not just a slogan, but a reality. Administrator Goldin has pushed his agency over and over again to do things better, faster and cheaper. The results at NASA, in my opinion, have been remarkable. They have done a good job. Mr. Goldin told me several weeks ago that `business as usual' does not count anymore at NASA. 
I am sure all of my colleagues recall the fascinating Mars Pathfinder Mission. Just 1 year ago, Pathfinder, on July 4, with its little Sojourner rover, was busy exploring the surface of the red planet. 
Most of my colleagues probably recall also the Viking mission in 1976. The Viking spacecraft landed on Mars, took photos, and was the first mission to scoop up and analyze Martian soil. Viking was a remarkable success. It cost over $3 billion, however, in today's dollars, and took about a decade to develop. It was about the size of an average car. By contrast, the Mars Pathfinder of last year took a quarter of the time to develop, it cost less than one-tenth as much, and it was a fraction of the size, yet produced remarkable results, catching the attention of the world. I am told the Internet site, NASA's Internet site, received more hits during that period of time than any other site in history. 
So this chart summarizes what has been accomplished in terms of Mr. Goldin's goal of faster, better, and cheaper. 
As to cheaper, the average spacecraft development cost has gone from, in fiscal years 1990 to 1994, a cost of $600 million, down to $175 million in the period fiscal years 1995 to 1999, and they expect it to be at $85 million. That is the kind of progress we like to see. It makes space exploration much more viable in today's world than it was. 
The average development time in terms of years: In fiscal year 1990 to 1994, a new mission took 8.3 years; in 1995 to 1999, it is now at 4.4. It will go to 3.5, and 3.1, under their efforts. 
With regard to flight rate, that is the number of launches they are able to conduct per year--in 1990 to 1994 there were just 2. In 1995 to 1999 they have gone up to 9. In fiscal year 2000 they expect to have 13; and, in 2004, they expect to have 16. That is good. They are doing what this Congress has asked; that is, to do more with less, to explore space and to make the kind of progress that makes America proud. 
Mr. President, during this time since 1993, NASA has cut its number of employees 25 percent. I recall a time 3 years ago when I became Attorney General of Alabama and I faced a budget crisis of enormous proportions. The first day I took office, we made a major decision. We had to terminate the employment of one-third of our people. We worked hard, we did a lot of different things, and we were able to continue the productivity of that office; and begin to build on that as time went by and have a better office. 
NASA has done what we have asked them to do. There is no other agency, I believe, in this kind of research and exploration that has had that kind of employment cut in the last 4 or 5 years. They have done well. They are doing more in less time at less cost and at the same time with less people. I think it is something we ought to be proud of and we ought to celebrate. But we ought not to keep taking advantage of them and always cutting their budget because they are performing as we encouraged them to do. 
With regard to space flight by humankind, they have continued to work on that, and it is difficult, but they have reduced the cost of space shuttle flights by 42 percent between 1992 and 1997. That is what we like to see. They are working to cut those costs even more. 
The conclusion we draw is that during a time of tight budgets, NASA has been doing better than could be expected, and they responded to this Congress' challenge. Certainly, up to a point, budget challenges can be healthy for an agency. They force some critical self-examination, and they result in some positive changes. 
We have heard that the periodical giving of blood makes a person strong, but if you give more than a pint and more blood and more blood, it begins to weaken you. I believe NASA is lean and healthy and strong now. It is at a good point, and we need to strengthen it now and allow it to flower and grow and continue its great scientific exploration. 
The budget request for 1999 increases other civilian and research development agencies. Almost all of them, whether it is the NIH or National Science Foundation, received substantial budget increases, but not NASA. The administration proposes increases for all the major agencies in VA and HUD, but not for NASA. For fiscal year 1999, the administration has requested less than $13.5 billion, a reduction of $183 million from last year's budget. 
Fortunately, Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski restored $150 million of that cut, and that leaves NASA facing a $33 million cut for fiscal year 1999. That is just not acceptable for this Nation. This is not a huge amount, but it is an important principle. 
Our history, our heritage, our character as a nation is that we are explorers. We believe in discovery and reaching out beyond our homeland and exploring this universe. That character is at stake if year after year we keep cutting our exploration agency. 
That is why I am proposing this amendment. It would add $33 million in funds for NASA for fiscal year 1999. That would bring it up to level funding--that is all--but it would be a statement, an important message by this Congress, that the day of cutting their budget more and more will end. 
We are supposed to have offsets for that, and we have worked hard at that. There is no way you can have a pleasant experience when you talk about finding funds for an offset. 
I have noticed, and it is well known at this time by the Members of this body, that the House committee has terminated the AmeriCorps budget, zeroed it out. We have over $220 million in this bill's funding for AmeriCorps. The whole program is about $400 million. 
If we take $33 million from that, we are talking about less than a 10-percent reduction in that budget. That will probably happen in conference committee because, as I said, the House committee has zeroed out the budget, and we expect it to be less. This may be and does appear to be a perfect place to find the funds we need to maintain the NASA spending at the level of last year. In the future, we need to work to increase that budget to identify the kind of programs that will be exciting and worthwhile in this Nation and in this world. 
Of the $33 million in additional funds provided by my amendment, $20 million would go to NASA's aeronautics, space transportation, and technology line item, which includes the Reusable Launch Vehicle Program. It will also provide funds to accelerate research in advanced space transportation technologies. 
Additional funds will also be available for NASA's important aeronautics programs and many other projects. It will have $13 million for additional funding for NASA's science and technology programs. It will provide them the kind of affirmation and support they need. 
I thank our distinguished subcommittee chairman, the Senator from Missouri, and our ranking member, the Senator from Maryland, for their efforts in restoring much of the money that was cut from NASA's budget by the President's budget request. While the amount of money is not large in terms of this Senate's overall budgetary concerns, it is significant and it sends an important signal. 
Adoption of my amendment will send an important message, a message that says that NASA's programs are significant for the future of this country and its citizens and that this Congress is not going to be a party to continued reductions in support for space exploration. That is not what we ought to do. We ought not to worry about it when we have well below 1 percent of our budget going for this project. 
Next year's budget submission from the President will literally take this Government into the 21st century. I call on President Clinton to demonstrate true leadership by proposing an increase in NASA's budget. The President's plan to cut additional millions from NASA next year is not acceptable. 
Last year, on this floor, I made a speech proclaiming my conviction that we must continue to be a nation of explorers. At that time, I stated the following:  
Space is a key to the image and the future of this Nation in the 21st century and beyond. We must have national leadership, keen vision, clear-cut goals and a strong commitment from this Congress and the Congresses to follow. We must be willing to pay the price necessary to realize our dreams and the dreams and goals of our children. 
That was true last year, and it is true today, and it will continue to be true. We are a nation of explorers. This is how the world sees us. It is how we see ourselves. All over the world on July 4 last year, people watched Pathfinder on Mars. The Internet lit up like it has never lit up before. There were record high levels of inquiries. Let's not allow this great achievement to slip away from us. Let's not give it away at this point in time. We have to make a decision as we stand on the threshold of the next millennium. It is no time to be timid; it is no time to fall back. We are on the verge of some of the world's greatest accomplishments in science and space and technology. NASA will play a key role in that. 
Mr. President, that is why I ask for support for this amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Chairman Hatch for his outstanding work on this very important issue that deals with a constitutional right that is as fundamental as our right to free speech. The Constitution says that the Government cannot take somebody's property without paying just compensation for it. Let me repeat that. Property cannot be taken without it being paid for. 
Too often in America today, we have government agencies that would like to take control of someone's property, but they don't want to pay for it. So these agencies take property through the use of regulations and laws. Sometimes their actions are legitimate. For example, zoning regulations are often perfectly legitimate rules that we have to have if we are going to live together. But there often reaches a point in which the actions of a municipality, or a county, or a State, or a Federal Government--which is primarily what we are dealing with here--can, in fact, take the beneficial use of that property without offering any compensation for it. That is wrong; it should not happen. 
This bill is a modest, very reasonable step. Senator Hatch has compromised and worked with those who have different views, and he has crafted a bill that is logical, reasonable, realistic, and that will protect our Constitutional property rights while not doing anything that would deny our ability to protect our environment. To me, it is clearly wrong to say that passage of this legislation would in any way restrict the environmental rights in this country. So I join in support of it. I think it is outstanding legislation. It simply provides a mechanism to protect our cherished fifth amendment constitutional rights.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I intended to come to the floor today, along with Senators Bob Graham, Mitch McConnell and Paul Coverdell, to offer an amendment to the Higher Education Act that would have helped more than 2.5 million students afford a college education. 
I would like to particularly recognize the outstanding efforts of my good friend from Kentucky, Senator McConnell. He has been a true champion of this issue for quite a number of years. Senator Bob Graham of Florida has done an outstanding job of guiding and helping us work on this amendment and handle it in the proper way. His advice and leadership have been crucial in gaining the support for this amendment that we think is necessary for its passage. Let me take a few minutes to discuss the concept of prepaid tuition plans and why they are critically important to help America's families. 
As a parent myself, who has put two children through college--I just had my second one graduate in May, and another one is currently in college--I know firsthand that America's families are struggling to meet the rising cost of higher education. In fact, American families have already accrued more college debt in the 1990s than during the previous three decades combined. The reason is twofold: The Federal Government subsidizes student debt with interest breaks and deferred payments and penalizes educational savings by taxing the interest that accrues on those savings accounts for college. 
In recent years, however, many families have tackled rising tuition costs by taking advantage of prepaid college tuition plans. These plans allow families to purchase tuition credits years in advance. Thanks to innovative programs already established by at least 17 States, like my home State of Alabama, parents can actually lock in today's college tuition rates for tomorrow's education. 
Congress has supported participating families in this effort by expanding the scope of prepaid tuition plans and by deferring taxes on the interest earned when students go off to college. 
Recently, thanks to the hard work of Senator Coverdell and several Members of the House of Representatives, including Chairman Bill Archer, a provision was included in the Coverdell A+ Educational Accounts bill, which would make all earnings in all prepaid tuition plans tax free. That is, interest that accumulated on the savings would accumulate without having to be taxed. 
Unfortunately, President Clinton has promised to veto that bill on his opposition to several other unrelated provisions--provisions that I think are excellent, but the President has made clear his intention in that regard. 
Due to his anticipated veto, more than 2.5 million students and their families planning to take advantage of prepaid tuition and savings programs over the next decade will be denied the ability to invest in their children's education using tax-free interest income. 
Our amendment, modeled after Chairman Archer's and Senator Coverdell's efforts during the A+ Educational Accounts conference committee, would have made earnings in State and private prepaid plans completely tax free. 
Currently, most of the interest earned by families saving for college is taxed twice. The parent is paying taxes on it when he earns it. Then they set it aside in the college account--even the prepaid tuition accounts--and they have to pay taxes on the interest that it earns. On the other hand, the Federal Government subsidizes student loans by deferring interest payments until after graduation and sometimes giving low-interest rate loans. So it is no wonder that American families are having a hard time saving for college and instead are having to go heavily into debt to finance college at a later time. This trend must not continue. As a matter of fact, it is not good public policy. 
Mr. President, let me take a few minutes to make a very critical point. I had an opportunity this morning to review a standard student education loan agreement, which belongs to one of my staff members. The loan, which was used to pay for the final 2 years of his college education, was $13,674.02. My young staffer is currently 25 years old. After the roughly 15 years it will take to pay off his loan, at which time he will be 40 years of age, he will have paid a total of $13,171.64 in interest alone. Mr. President, that will bring his total payment for his 2 years in college to $26,845.65; that is nearly double the original loan balance. This is the Federal Government's only option, the only way it provides help to families to pay for their children's education. 
So in order to provide families a new alternative, the Sessions-Graham-McConnell-Coverdell amendment would provide tax-free treatment to all prepaid plans for public and private colleges and universities. This would place all savings plans and all schools on an equal playing field. 
This bipartisan amendment would not only provide American families with more than $1 billion in much-needed tax relief over the next decade, but would also help control the cost of college for all students. In fact, the track record of existing State prepaid plans indicates that working, middle-income families benefit the most from these prepaid plans. 
Prepaid tuition plans must become law. The Federal Government can no longer subsidize student debt with interest rate breaks and penalize educational savings by taxing the interest earned by families who are trying to save for college. Both public and private prepaid tuition plans should be held equal by the Federal Government and must be completely tax free. 
If these goals are achieved, the Federal Government would be providing families with the help they need to meet the cost of college through savings rather than through debt. Indeed, as a nation we ought to be reviewing all of our laws and all of our public tax policies to make sure we are encouraging savings rather than encouraging debt. Too often our policies have been just the opposite.

Mr. President, I simply say with regard to the letters that have been introduced, those are letters to me from the Independent College Association and from the several other groups, such as the American Council on Education, that say the steps referred to in this amendment `would make prepaid tuition plans more widely available and more attractive for families. By doing this, families will have a strong incentive to begin to save money for college when their children are young. And, as with any investment, saving early is vitally important.' 
That is the American Council on Education, dated July 9, referring to this amendment. 
The National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities is likewise supporting this amendment. They say, `On behalf of the over 900 independent colleges and universities that make up the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, I want to express our appreciation of your efforts. 
`We agree that students and families who want to utilize prepaid tuition plans should be allowed to dedicate those funds to the institution of their choice' to be able to compete on a level playing field. 
The College Savings Plans Network has likewise supported this proposal in a letter to Congressman Archer dated July 2, 1998. 
The National Association of State Treasurers has adopted this resolution. Many State treasurers have formulated this legislation in the State--in fact, the Alabama State Treasury, and former State Treasurer George Wallace, Jr., is the one who passed the legislation in Alabama for the prepaid tuition plan. 
Also, The Heritage Foundation has supported this effort. 
Exhibit One AMERICAN COUNCIL ON EDUCATION, 
Government and Public Affairs, Washington, DC, July 9, 1998. 
Hon. Jeff Sessions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
Dear Senator Sessions: I am writing with respect to the amendment on prepaid tuition plans that you hope to offer when the Senate considers S. 1882, The Higher Education Amendments of 1998. 
In recent years, states and private sector organizations have begun to offer prepaid tuition plans designed to encourage families to save money for higher education. The American Council on Education supports these efforts. We believe that your amendment would enhance these plans in two important ways. First, it would exclude from federal income tax the value of the plan when the student enrolls in higher education. Second, the amendment would allow private colleges and universities to establish these initiatives. 
These steps would make prepaid tuition plans more widely available and more attractive for families. By doing this, families will have a strong incentive to begin to save money for college when their children are young. And, as with any investment, saving early is vitally important. 
We understand that there may be a jurisdictional problem with your amendment and we hope that this can be satisfactorily worked out. If it proves impossible to fix the jurisdictional issue, we will work with you to ensure that your plan is enacted this year. 
We are enormously grateful for your leadership on this issue of such importance to families and colleges and universities. We look forward to working on it with you. 
Sincerely, TERRY W. HARTLE, Senior Vice President.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I know there has been some brouhaha this afternoon about not being able to debate a health care bill, and I came down here earlier today to talk about the bill we were on, the VA-HUD bill, an extremely important piece of legislation that was set regularly on this agenda. Amendments were being offered to it. Everybody has known for some time that we were going to be dealing with health care and managed care and HMOs and that sort of thing. It is certainly going to be coming up on our agenda when the time is right, and everybody will have full opportunity to debate that issue. I hope we do. I expect we can make some improvement in our health care policy in America. 
But the bill that we were on was important. I submit it was a political act by people in this body to derail where we were going, to introduce onto the VA-HUD bill this kind of massive change in agenda to try to create a debate on health care when this body was on another item. That is what the majority leader is for, to try to set agenda in a rational way. He has done that. We are going to be on health care later, but we should have stayed on the bill that we were on.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am disappointed the administration has seen fit to reduce NASA's budget by $183 million this year. Frankly, I think it ought to be increased. I would like to share a couple of thoughts about that with the Members of this body and the people who may be listening. 
From 1983 to 1992, NASA's budget went up from $7 to $14 billion. That is less than 1 percent of the national budget in this country, but that was a significant increase. During that time, they made two planetary launches. In the last number of years, that budget has seen a significant reduction. In fact, according to a committee that was formed in 1991, a committee on the future of space formed by President Bush, they had the expenditures for NASA going up to as high as $40 or $50 billion. As it turned out, under the previously agreed-upon budget for NASA, we should be at about $16 or $18 billion. In fact, that budget has been cut every year, and over the last 5 years they have sustained a $27 billion reduction in what was projected for their budget even under our last budget agreement. 
People say, `Jeff, that is just numbers; it doesn't mean much.' NASA has cut its employees since 1993 by 25 percent. They have cut their employees 25 percent. There is no agency in this American Government that has done a better job of producing more for less than they have. 
In fact, the fiscal year 1994 budget for NASA was $14.5 billion, and the fiscal year 1998 for NASA is $13.6 billion. 
During this same time, they have been sustaining these substantial losses in income. They are now making planetary launches one every 10 weeks. Whereas they used to do two planetary launches in 9 years, they are now doing them one every 10 weeks, even though their budget is down and employees are down 25 percent. They are doing some remarkable things. 
Last July 4, the Martian lander landed, and we saw those vivid photographs that were shipped all over the world. The American people and the people of the world stood in amazement as we saw the actual ground of the planet Mars. It was an exciting time. My family and I watched that in our home with amazement and pride at what this country had accomplished. 
Let me point this out: 20 years before, we had done another Martian landing. We had not had one in 20 years. The Martian landing 20 years before, in actual dollars, cost 10 times as much as the one last year. They were able to accomplish this landing last year for one-tenth of the cost 20 years before. 
This is the kind of achievement that is important for our country. The whole world watched it. Mr. Dan Goldin, who directs the NASA program, told us that they had more hits on their web site from around the world than they even had in the United States. It was by far the biggest single time of people tuning in to the NASA web site from all over the world. 
The world was watching America. We are the leader in space. We need to remain the leader in space. We are a nation of explorers. That is our heart and soul. That is our national characteristic. We have explored this Earth pretty well. We are now exploring the heavens. We need to continue forward with that. 
Sure, the space station has gone over, but from the numbers I have just told you, even though the space station has cost more than it should--and a lot of that is involved with trying to work with the Russians, who have not been very effective in fulfilling their portion of it, and we need to evaluate that--everything else they have been doing has been doing more for less. 
We are going to be able to continue to have repeat launches at less cost and more success and highly technical launches that can bring us the kind of science and improvements in our life that can benefit the entire world. This is the kind of thing with which America needs to be involved. I am excited about it. 
I wish we were still on that bill. I had some things to say about it. We are going to handle health care as we go down the road, but I think it is important for the people of America to note that we moved off that bill because the other party sought to change the agenda that was set, to go off on an entirely new tangent, attaching to this bill an entirely different subject matter that requires a great deal of debate and discussion. That was not the appropriate thing to do, and the majority leader did the only thing he could, which is pull down the bill. 
Mr. President, I thank you for this time, and I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, for accepting my amendment which ensures the dual track strategy the Department of Energy (DOE) is currently pursuing for tritium production will remain in place. Acceptance of this amendment ensures the Secretary of Energy will have the flexibility to make the best decision based on a careful review of the cost, technical, schedule and policy issues associated with each of the tritium production options. 
In May, during the House National Security Committee's deliberation of the FY '99 Department of Defense (DOD) re-authorization bill, an amendment offered by Congressmen Markey and Graham was accepted without a roll call vote. Their amendment (Markey/Graham amendment) would preclude the Secretary of Energy from selecting a commercial light water reactor for the production of tritium. The Markey/Graham amendment, if passed into law, would force the Secretary of Energy to select the Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT) by eliminating the option to produce tritium using a Commercial Light Water Reactor (CLWR). The APT is the only other option currently available to the Department of Energy. The results of this action would, in my opinion, require the Secretary to select the highest risk and most expensive option to produce tritium--a decision which could saddle the taxpayers with a $14.5 billion debt. To put this in context, $14.5 billion is more money than the states of Alabama, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Virginia, Rhode Island, Idaho, Oklahoma, Mississippi and New Mexico combined will receive during the next five years under the recently passed TEA21 transportation bill. 
The White House, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of Defense and the Citizens Against Government Waste have all written letters in opposition to the Markey/Graham amendment in the House-passed bill, which would prevent the Department of Energy from making the best decision on tritium production. 
In a Statement of Administration Policy to House National Security Committee dated May 20th, 1998, the Administration voiced its concern over the amendment to the House DoD re-authorization bill and stated: 
`The Administration strongly opposes . . . amendments . . . to prohibit the use of commercial light water reactors for the production of tritium; by eliminating the least costly, most technically mature option under consideration by DOE. Tritium production in commercial reactors is not inconsistent with U.S. non-proliferation policy'. 
Furthermore, in a letter dated June 23rd, 1998, the Secretary of Energy restated the Administration's position: 
`The Administration strongly opposes this amendment and any amendment that prejudges departmental decision making within the dual track strategy. A careful and deliberate review of cost, technical, schedule, and policy issues associated with each option is essential to meet our security needs most economically and reliably'. 
And finally, in a letter provided to me June 25th, 1998, the Secretary of Defense stated: 
`DoD opposes the amendments for three reasons. First, if the amendments were to become law, DOE would require an immediate additional investment of nearly $250 million to accelerate the development of APT. The long term impacts of the amendment are far more significant. The life cycle cost of APT could be as high as $8.8 billion. The life cycle cost of the Reactor option could be as low as $1.6 billion. Thus, the amendments could mandate an unfunded liability of up to $7.6 billion . . . Second, the amendments would likely increase the cost of the DOD Stockpile Stewardship Program. 
Finally, this amendment seems to be predicated on the assumption that the use of commercial reactors is inconsistent with the US non proliferation policy. It is not. The DOE will forward shortly a completed interagency report that concludes the non proliferation policy issues associated with the use of a reactor are manageable and that the DOE should continue to pursue the reactor option as a viable source for future tritium production. . .Therefore, I urge you to oppose amendments which would prohibit the Reactor production of tritium from being considered as an option. Passage of any such amendment would place the Defense Authorization bill at risk'.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, under current law, the Department of Energy has been going forward with a dual track process to decide on the technology selection of tritium. DOE is to choose the best option to produce tritium based on cost and merit. The House-passed Markey/Graham amendment, eliminates DOE's decision-making authority and would put the national defense at risk by relying on an unproven technology. The Markey/Graham amendment is fiscally irresponsible and would prevent the Secretary from making a merit-based decision. 
Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen which is used in all nuclear weapons of the United States. It has a relatively short half life of 12.3 years and must be replaced periodically as long our nation's defense relies on nuclear deterrence. 
In 1993, Congress required the Secretary of Energy to submit a report to Congress with a schedule to produce tritium to meet our defense needs. Later that year, the Secretary submitted a report indicating that under START II, tritium production would need to resume by 2009. However, since the START II treaty has not been ratified, as is now the case, the DOE has stated tritium production needs to begin by 2005. 
On December 6th, 1995 the Department of Energy issued a Record of Decision to pursue a dual-track approach to produce tritium. This process was recommended by the President's Nuclear Weapons Council. The first option is to use the services of a reactor to produce tritium. The second option is to design, build and test a particle accelerator at Savannah River to drive tritium producing nuclear reactions. Both options would be required to produce tritium by the 2009 deadline, but only the reactor option could meet the 2005 deadline. The DOE is scheduled to announce its choice for tritium production by the end of 1998. 
The Department of Energy needs to pursue the dual-track option for the production of tritium. The Markey/Graham amendment prevents the DOE from making their decision, and ties the Secretary of Energy's hands, throwing competition out the window and saddling the American taxpayer with a huge $16.7 billion dollar debt. 
Mr. President, the House-passed Markey/Graham amendment to the Department of Defense re-authorization bill sole sources the Secretary of Energy's options for tritium production and forces the Secretary to select the least reliable, highest cost option--APT. Even the DOE's Accelerator Production of Tritium program managers suggest the accelerator may not be able to produce enough tritium to fulfill our defense needs according to a June 8th, 1998 DOE letter in response to my technical questions regarding the accelerator program. 
The CLWR option to produce tritium is a proven technology which allows the US to maintain its nuclear preparedness. It uses safe, reliable technology at no net cost to the DOE. In fact, the reactor option to produce tritium could actually net the Federal Government a $2.4 billion profit over the forty year life of the program. 
In contrast, the Accelerator needed for APT is estimated to cost $5.4 billion just to complete. There is no mechanism to ever recapture these costs. In addition, an Accelerator, of the size needed to fulfill our defense needs, would require a tremendous amount of electricity to operate. The annual operational costs of the Accelerator are estimated to be between $120 - $180 million per year. Using the latest inflationary factors developed by Office of Management and Budget of 2.2% and the $180 million annual operating cost estimate put forth in the May, 1997 Congressional Budget Office report titled Preserving the Nuclear Stockpile Under a Comprehensive Test Ban, the life-cycle operating costs for the Accelerator Production of Tritium would be a staggering $11.356 billion over forty years. In total, the operations and maintenance costs, coupled with the cost to complete construction of APT could top $16.756 billion. 
The Commercial Light Water Reactor option to produce tritium will cost only $1.9 billion--an investment which will be paid back and generate additional revenue to the Treasury in excess of $2.4 billion over the forty year life of the reactor. It would provide the government with a free supply of tritium and generate revenue through the generation and sale of electrical power. 
The APT will require 2,600,000 megawatts-hours of power each year to operate. This is the equivalent of the electricity requirements of a medium size city like Huntsville and Decatur, Alabama. The power required to operate the APT will result in increased emissions of sulfur, carbon, particulate matter and ozone creating gases and serve to work against our efforts to clean the environment. 
According to data collected by the Edison Electric Institute, even today's cleanest fossil fuel powered electric plants will emit between 4 million and 9 million tons of carbon; 17,000 and 42,000 tons of Sulfur Dioxide (major contributor to acid rain); and between 870 and 7,100 tons of Nitrous Oxide (major ozone contributor) per year just to generate the same amount of power as the emissions free reactor option to produce tritium. Clearly, the reactor option is the preferred choice for the environment. 
To maintain our country's nuclear preparedness under the only signed and enforceable treaty, START I, the Department of Defense needs a production capacity of at least 3 kilograms of tritium per year by 2005. The cost estimates on the APT provided by the Department of Energy, at my request, suggest the accelerator, if its experimental technology were to work without failure or shutdown, may only be able to produce 1.5 to 2.0 kilograms of tritium per year. This is not enough to maintain our nuclear arsenal. 
The earliest the APT will be able to produce tritium is 2007 which could cause the Department of Defense to dip into our Tritium Reserve Stockpile to maintain our readiness. The Reactor option can produce tritium using safe, reliable, certified technology by 2003. 
Mr. President, can we afford to risk our national security on this unproven APT technology for our nuclear arsenal's tritium needs by eliminating a safe and reliable reactor technology so casually? 
In closing, Mr. President, my amendment will ensure the Secretary of Energy retains the ability to carefully review each of these options and select the one which will best serve the tritium needs of our nation's nuclear arsenal. 
I urge my colleagues being appointed to the conference committee on the DOD re-authorization bill, to support my amendment, which preserves the integrity of DOE's decision-making process. We can ill afford to decide the fate of our nation's security on the floor of Congress. Let's allow the nation's top experts in this field to make their decision based on the careful considerations of cost and merit regarding both options. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I had 13 years in the Army Reserve and went through a basic training program. It was a very worthwhile experience for me. I played football. I have been to basic training, and basic training is worse and tougher. Anybody that survives that has my admiration. 
I have had the opportunity through the years to serve with some outstanding women soldiers, the kind of soldiers that you respect and are capable and have great ability to contribute to the mission of the unit. It is something that I think is a major part of American military life and we should not be changing. 
I understand there is a lot of talk about separation and use of the word `segregation' based on gender. But it seems to me that Senator Brownback's amendment simply says that in basic training these soldiers, men and women, shouldn't be housed together. I think that is a reasonable approach and something that comports with my sense of what makes sense, my sense of what I understand the Senator to be saying, and I think it is the right idea. 
Some might say it is the responsibility of the NCOs and the officers to maintain moral control over the soldiers. When they are in such a mixed environment, the officers and NCOs can't maintain control over these young people. They are in a circumstance that is a different world; it is a whole different environment they are in. Things that they would have thought to do under other circumstances may not be done under these circumstances. 
I say we have separate barracks. It seems to me if we are going to separate the 14 percent of the soldiers that are women within existing barracks, it seems to me you are converting whole floors that would otherwise be half used. For example, most of the barracks I was in had 20 people on one floor and 20 on the next. So I suppose a few people would be on the second floor and the bottom floor would be full. That is the way they were traditionally done. 
I don't see how it would be any cost to have separate housing for women in which women could have the support of their NCOs under those circumstances and men could have separate housing. I think both parties would benefit from that. 
The commission did a lot of work. We have been talking about a new commission. I point out that we had one. Senator Nancy Kassebaum-Baker and others did a thorough job. They talked to over 1,000 trainees, 500 instructors, 300 first-term service members, and 275 supervisors. I don't know who the chiefs of staff and Secretary of Army is talking to. I don't know, maybe they are talking to too many people in the Pentagon. But those commissioned, the ones in power to make a decision, went out and talked to soldiers, trainees, 1,000, 500 instructors--the drill instructors out there with these men and women on a daily basis, and this commission unanimously reached a conclusion that separate housing would be preferable. They also concluded that separate training would be preferable. 
As a matter of fact, I tend to agree with that based on my experience. But that is not before the Senate today. That is not what Senator Brownback is calling on us to do today. 
Senator Brownback is suggesting that what we ought to do is have separate housing, a readily achievable thing, I suggest. 
I agree with the commission based on my experience and the study I have done, that separate housing will decrease disciplinary problems, it will reduce distractions during the training process, and as the commission found, will be of marginal cost to the Department of Defense. 
I am pleased to support this amendment. I think it is time that this body raised our concerns. There are many problems that are occurring. Senator Brownback has eloquently discussed those. We hate to talk about the problems that are occurring, but they need to be discussed. I think it is the right thing. 
I yield back my time to the Senator from Kansas, and I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I am honored to have the opportunity to make some remarks on the occasion of this nomination. First, I want to say how much I respect both of the Senators from Hawaii. I believe that they take very seriously the nomination of a U.S. district judge, and I believe they have sought to fulfill their responsibilities well in that regard. 
Having been a practitioner in Federal court myself--full-time as a U.S. attorney for 15 years, and another 5 years or so in private practice--I have a deep feeling about the judiciary, what it needs to be, and the standards it ought to uphold. I believe it ought to be a disinterested applicator of the law, regardless of politics, ideology, and those sorts of things. I believe we ought to look for nominees that do that. Both for my respect for the distinguished Senators from Hawaii and my respect for this nominee make it difficult for me to stand here and suggest, as I will, that we ought not to confirm this nominee for the Federal bench. 
I have no doubt that she is a person of integrity and character. But I want to share some concerns that I have about this nomination, and why I think it ought not be confirmed. 
Also, let me express my respect for the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. There is no finer constitutional lawyer in this body than Senator Hatch. He is a man of integrity and ability. He works hard every day in our committee to make sure nominees are given a fair shake, and that the nominations are moved along at a steady pace, as they continue to do. I know that he considered carefully the problems that this nominee had before he agreed to vote in favor of this nominee. I know he respects the opinion of both Senators from Hawaii. 
I note that the committee voted 12 to 6, with six Senators voting against the nomination. I think that suggests that there was a genuine unease by a considerable number of the committee with regard to this nominee. 
It is impossible to know for sure what anyone will do on the bench. This nominee may turn out to be a very restrained and rigorous judicial nominee and judge, consistent with some of the great judges in history. But we have to look at the nominees' backgrounds and the positions they have taken over the years to try to analyze how they might perform on the bench. 
The Senate is given under the Constitution the power to advise and consent with the President. These nominees are lifetime appointees. They will serve throughout their entire life making decisions day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year. And, as Senator Hatch said, they are not accountable to the people. It is really the most anti-democratic aspect of our entire American government, but I support it. I am not in favor of electing Federal judges. I therefore believe it is our responsibility to give careful thought to those to whom we give that position. 
First, let me note one thing. It does appear that the district of Hawaii is in need of a judge. Their caseload is 700 weighted cases per judge. It is a heavy caseload. We have a judicial circuit in Alabama that has a higher caseload, and it is, indeed, a high caseload. I am sure another judge is needed to do that work. I know all of us are active in various activities. And I think it is appropriate that we be asked about those activities when we are nominated for a position like this. 
What do we know about this nominee? We know that she was a voluntary member of the American Civil Liberties Union for a number of years--may still be--and was an active member of the board of directors and a fundraiser for the Hawaii ACLU during 1995 and 1996. 
During that time, the Hawaii ACLU took a number of positions. I am certain that as a board member she did not sign those pleadings, and maybe did not personally conduct in-depth research. In fact, I think she suggested she has not researched each one of these issues. But I think it is appropriate for us to ask about those positions, as we did on the committee. She did not disavow any of them. 
In 1996, in Hawaii, an ACLU executive or administrator stated, `The laws that discriminate based on sexual orientation are as reprehensible as laws that at one time protected segregation.' 
The point of that discussion was testimony on the recognition of homosexual marriages. And, in fact, the ACLU official was taking the position that Hawaii should take on the question of affirming, ratifying, respecting, and acknowledging homosexual unions. He was suggesting that those who would oppose it would be the same as those who opposed integration. 
I would have to say that is outside the mainstream of law. As attorney general of Alabama, I had the occasion to have my staff do some research on this. We found no place in the history of America that any State or government agency ever recognized a homosexual union. It is not recognized, to my knowledge, any place in any culture in the world and reflects an odd and historically 
inaccurate view of the law. But that was the organization's position, of which she was a board member and a fundraiser. 
In 1995, the ACLU opposed legislation that would have required HIV testing for persons indicted for sexual crimes. I would suggest that there is an extreme anxiousness and justifiable concern about these kinds of activities. 
When a person is arrested for a sexual crime and there is a victim that may have been infected with HIV, I think it is perfectly appropriate for a judicial authority require as a condition of the suspect's release that person to be tested to see if they have passed on such a horrible disease to the victim. 
Also, I suggest that we have a large number of people in the ACLU active in opposing all drug testing. That is a very, very important matter of public interest. It is unfounded in constitutional law and at least in most properly applied cases of drug testing. We will have more drug testing in the future, because we are concerned about young people and others who are using drugs. 
In 1995, the ACLU in Hawaii, of which this individual was a board member and fundraiser, opposed an ordinance that banned overnight sleeping in parks. 
We have learned in recent months pretty clearly that it is important and necessary for a city and police departments to take control of their streets. We learned in New York that the panhandlers and those who are in the parks can, in fact, undermine public safety. Mayor Guiliani in New York has taken great leadership in that regard, and has substantially driven down the crime rate in New York. 
It is small matters like this which sometimes turn into much larger matters. This is the kind of frustration that cities and counties and police departments around the country feel when they are challenged about the steps they have to take to preserve public safety. 
In 1965, the Hawaii ACLU, of which this nominee was a board member and fundraiser, opposed drug testing in the workplace, saying, `The ACLU opposes random and indiscriminate drug testing in the workplace, not only on privacy grounds but also because such drug testing does not detect current impairment.' 
Madam President, one of the most beneficial acts that has been done to fight drugs in America, in my opinion, is drug testing in the workplace. A businessman who cares about his employees, who sets a high standard, who wants to eliminate theft, who wants to reduce accidents, who wants to protect the health of his or her employees sends out a clear message that drug use is not acceptable in their company, and they drug test fairly and objectively. The tests are very reliable today and make the workplace safer by protecting the lives and safety of employees, eliminating and reducing crime and theft by the employees, and avoiding injury to those who come into contact with those employees. Furthermore, they also encourage employees to stay drug free. You are encouraging them by insisting on a high standard. And perhaps that employee when they go home will tell their wife or husband who suggests that they might use drugs, `No, we shouldn't do it. I am going to be tested at work.' 
Drug testing has been a great success. But it has been a long, hard legal fight. In case after case, the ACLU position has been rejected. 
I must admit, as a person who has been involved in the fight against drugs, that it concerns me that our nominee is a person who was a board member of an organization that voluntarily went out and tried to obstruct workplace drug testing. 
In 1995, the Hawaii ACLU opposed another common occurrence in America, the very popular minimum sentence in criminal cases. State after State after State has followed the Federal law that says that under certain circumstances, crimes with certain prior convictions will be punished with at least a minimum sentence if convicted. And that process has worked; I believe it has helped us identify repeat offenders, to lock them up for longer periods of time, and I am confident that that is one of the primary reasons we have seen a reduction in crime among adults. We are doing a better job of identifying serious, repeat, violent offenders through these `three strikes you're out' laws and mandatory sentencing laws, and it is no small concern to me as a prosecutor, a Federal and State prosecutor, that our nominee for this position has supported the position of the ACLU that mandatory minimum sentences ought not to be approved. 
In addition, the Hawaii ACLU has opposed a Federal Stop Turning Out Prisoners Act and the Community Notification of Sex Offenders Act. Those are some of the positions that they have taken during the 1995 period in which this nominee was a member of the board and a fundraiser. Now, when asked at our confirmation hearing if there were any policy positions of the Hawaii ACLU that she disagreed with while on the board of directors, Ms. Mollway answered, `I cannot think of any.' 
Now, I believe that is a sufficient basis for a Senate Member to have a serious concern about this nominee, and that is why at least six members of the Judiciary Committee cast a `no' vote. We respect those who have nominated her; we respect her; but we have serious concerns about her nomination to the Federal bench. 
In addition, in recent years the ACLU has taken other positions that are outside the mainstream of legal and current American thought. They oppose the death penalty. They oppose three-strikes sentencing laws around the country. They oppose school vouchers for sectarian schools. They have opposition to V chips in televisions to screen out violence. They oppose voluntary labeling of music albums as to their content. They support the legality of partial-birth abortion. They support the constitutionality and use of racial preferences and oppose some of the laws that eliminate that. And they support the decriminalization of drugs; that is, the legalization of drugs. 
Such positions are not mainstream thought in this country. That is not mainstream law that is being advocated. They have done some good things over the years. They have taken some positions that were courageous and were proved to be right and furthered our country, but this nominee in the last few years was an active member of an organization that took some of the positions I just mentioned, in court. 
Now, I have voted for an ACLU member, maybe more than once, to be confirmed, but I want to share some other things that concern me and affect my decision, and I hope other Senators will consider this as they decide what standard they will use when they consider whether to consent to this nomination. 
This nominee will be a district judge within the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that includes Hawaii, California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Arizona, Nevada and Alaska. Over the years that circuit has been recognized as the most liberal circuit in America. It has also been recognized as a court that has been out of touch with mainstream American law. In the last term of the U.S. Supreme Court, the Supreme Court reviewed 28 cases that arose from the ninth circuit, and of those 28 cases, they reversed 27 of them. This has been a pattern over quite a number of years. 
Just last month, the ninth circuit became the first circuit in America to rule that the Prison Litigation Reform Act is unconstitutional. That was passed by this Congress. It was a magnificent act to eliminate this repetition of appeals by prisoners that have clogged courts for years, and I have seen it personally, and so many of them are extraordinarily frivolous. But it was carefully considered by this body. Every other circuit that has addressed this issue has upheld the constitutionality of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, including the 1st circuit, the 4th circuit, the 6th circuit, the 8th circuit, and the 11th circuit. They have upheld it as constitutional, but once again the ninth circuit is out of step with that group. 
Recently, in the last month or so, the Supreme Court harshly criticized the ninth circuit for granting a habeas corpus petition--that is, a petition by a prisoner--that had overturned the death sentence of a convicted rapist and murderer. In reversing this conviction, the ninth circuit opinion reversed a conviction that had gone to the California Supreme Court four times, that had gone to the U.S. Supreme Court two times. The defendant had been on death row for well over 10 years and there was little dispute about his guilt or innocence. And so the Supreme Court really was frustrated by this. This was a midnight stay of execution, within 24 or 48 hours of the carrying out of this death penalty case that had been on death row for years and was reversed by them. 
Some would say, as Ms. Mollway did, I will follow the laws. Sometimes we have to wonder what the law is in the ninth circuit. We know that they have been extraordinarily sensitive to death penalty cases beyond, in my opinion, rationality. We know that in many cases the court-appointed attorneys' fees in death cases in California or in the ninth circuit have exceeded $1 million for the court-appointed attorneys to defend those who have been charged, since the appeals go on for years and years. And, as I recall, the amount of money spent on that in the ninth circuit matches all the other circuits in America in expense. 
So we have a problem with that, and we need judges who know what the law is, who make every effort to guarantee that the innocent are found innocent, their convictions reversed if need be, and are given a fair trial. That is absolutely guaranteed by our Constitution and should never be denied. But, Madam President, when you have these kinds of appeals, it makes a mockery of the law, it undermines the public respect for the law, it places the courts in disrespect, and I think this circuit is rightly criticized for that. 
Recently, the New York Times referred to the ninth circuit as `the country's most liberal circuit' and noted that it was viewed by a majority on the Supreme Court as `a rogue circuit.' 
I would say that is a serious matter. I believe, based on this nominee's background, her positions on issue after issue, her activities with the ACLU in Hawaii, that we have indications that instead of being a part of a renaissance in the ninth circuit, to improve the ninth circuit and bring it back into the mainstream of American law, that she would, in fact, be more of the same: the same liberal, activist, anti-law-enforcement mentality that has gotten this circuit out of whack with the rest of the Nation. 
District judges are not circuit judges; I don't mean to suggest that they are; but they are part of the circuit. It was a district judge recently who ruled the California Proposition 209, the civil rights initiative that would eliminate racial preferences, violated the Constitution of the United States. Fortunately, a panel of even the ninth circuit unanimously agreed that was not correct and the court found there is no doubt that Proposition 209 was constitutional. And the Supreme Court refused to reverse that--in effect, affirmed that decision. 
So I would just say to my distinguished friends from Hawaii, we do need to be careful about what is happening on our benches. We do have, in certain parts of this country, courts that are going beyond the traditional role of judges, going beyond the traditional role of courts. It is breeding a disrespect, it is undermining law enforcement, it is delaying the carrying out of justly imposed sentences, and we need to make sure that we do something about that. I, for one, have stated publicly for some time now that I feel a special obligation and a special concern to look at the nominees for the ninth circuit, to make sure that those nominees are going to be part of a solution to this problem rather than part of the problem. 
Based on my analysis and my sincere belief about it, I have concluded that I should vote `no,' and I will urge my fellow Senators also to vote no. 
This nominee is a person of quality and intellect, but I believe she is not the right nominee at this time for this position. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for his legislation, which I am pleased to support. 
I suppose it is round four in this battle. This is the fourth vote we will have had on it. I think the Senator from Washington has attempted in good faith to deal with some of the complaints that have been raised about capping attorneys' fees. 
Our last vote was at $1,000 an hour. He has come in and said, well, if you establish certain things, and you started early, and you worked hard on this and are one of the people who really deserve credit for this litigation, you could get up to $4,000--that is up to $4,000. So it should not be criticized as a guarantee of $4,000 per hour. I think these judges would decide on that. But he caps it at that amount. For other people who were involved less in the case, it would be capped later. 
And to my good friend, the Senator from Minnesota, he talked about the Minnesota perspective. I believe Minnesota has been at this some time. They worked a number of hours on this case. They would be paid at least $2,000, and I believe up to perhaps $4,000 per hour for their work, depending on how much the judge were to give them. I think that is a very generous legal fee. As a matter of fact, it goes beyond what I would consider within the mainstream. 
As a matter of fact, I was just called off the floor a few minutes ago and met a group of young people from my home State. And I asked them if they thought $4,000 an hour--how would they feel about that to pay an attorney for doing legal work. And they did not think I was serious. They thought it was a joke. Talking about $4,000 an hour--that is a lot of money. So I think we have to deal with this. 
Let me talk briefly about the fact that Senators on the other side have suggested, well, we have an arbitration process. The arbitration process is not between the people who are paying the fees or the defendants in the litigation. The arbitration process is between the plaintiffs, which in this case are the States represented by the attorneys general, and their attorneys, the plaintiffs' lawyers, the attorneys. And what it says is, if they are unable to agree; that is, the attorney general and the lawyer he hired and who agreed to a certain fee, if those two are unable to agree with respect to any dispute that may arise between them regarding the fee agreement--regarding the fee agreement--then the matter goes to arbitration, then the matter goes to arbitration. Under the fee agreement, they are talking about a 25 percent, 20 percent, 15 percent contingent fee, which would enrich these lawyers to an extraordinary degree. 
What the Senator from Washington has understood--and I think his legislation recognizes--is that a lot of the attorneys in this litigation have done little or no work. A few of these cases were started early on; a lot of legal work was done; a lot of attorney investment and time and some personal funds were expended on behalf of this litigation. And that is one thing. 
But as the time went by, other States joined. Many of them joined in a matter of weeks or a matter of months before the settlement by the tobacco companies was offered. Those lawyers now want to walk in and claim 25 percent of what is being paid in, and they worked only a very few hours on this case. 
Some of these lawyers, it has been estimated, according to a professor from Cardozo Law School, are to receive as much as $92,000 per hour--$92,000 per hour--unless something is done about it. So I think we have to act now. We have a responsibility to act. And I am certain of that.

Mr. SESSIONS. With regard to the Florida case, the trial judge found it was unconscionable, as I hope this body finds these fees are unconscionable. But that case has been reviewed at a higher court and that opinion has been withdrawn. 
So we don't know yet whether the lawyers in Florida will get $2.8 billion that they request or not. In fact, Mr. Montgomery, the lead attorney in the case, said he fully expects to be paid what his fee agreement said. He expects to prevail. He says he has a contract. 
How can we violate contracts? We violate contracts all the time in this body. We are telling the tobacco companies they can't advertise. Many of them have advertising contracts extended for years. We are changing the whole way of doing business about tobacco. Everything about the tobacco business is being changed by this legislation. It is a comprehensive legislation in which we deal with almost every aspect of it. One of those aspects ought to be how much these fees should count for. 
I was in Alabama recently to see one of the finest and biggest industrial announcements in the history of the State and one of the largest in the country. Boeing is going to build a rocket plant near Decatur. It is 50 acres under one roof. They told me with great pride that the cost of that building and facility and land and construction would be $450 million. We are talking about attorneys in Florida asking $2.8 billion, five or six times that much, five or six times the cost of one of the largest industrial announcements in America by one of the world's largest corporations. That is the extent of the fees we are talking about in Alabama. The general fund of the noneducation budget is less than $1 billion. These attorneys are asking for more than that. 
As a matter of fact, a professor from Cardozo Law School estimates that it will make 20 to 25 attorneys in America billionaires. I had my staff check. I believe the Fortune Magazine that rates America's richest people, the world's richest people, listed 60 billionaires in the United States. This litigation, unless we act, could create 20 more billionaires, many of whom have worked less than a year, maybe even only a few months, on the cases with which they are dealing. 
Now, I am not against a contingent fee. I support that concept. But the attorneys and the attorneys general have come to the Congress and asked us to legislate. The plaintiff attorneys have and the attorneys general have asked us to comprehensively review this entire process and litigate on it. This is an unusual type of case because we have never seen these kind of moneys before and we have never seen these kind of fees before. 
It is perfectly appropriate for us to contain them. As the Senator from Washington said, we limit fees to $125 an hour in equal access to justice cases. Appointed criminal attorneys in Federal court get paid $75 an hour. I think $2,000, $4,000 an hour is enough. It will make them rich beyond all imagining, just that alone. If they haven't done any work on the case and don't have any hours into the case, they ought not be made any more rich than they are.

Mr. SESSIONS. I am glad to answer that. First of all, if 
we don't cap it at $4,000 an hour, we are likely to end up as in Texas at $92,000 an hour. A judge has approved that fee in Texas. It is going to go through. So certainly this is better than nothing. 
No. 2, the fee is capped at $4,000 an hour. A judge must consider the skill, the expertise, the commitment, and the value of the contribution of that attorney. Some flunky in the firm isn't going to be paid $4,000 an hour. The lead lawyers, the ones who have demonstrated the greatest skill and leadership and effectiveness, would have the opportunity to reach that high but no higher. 
So it is certainly a step in the right direction and preferable to nothing, although, as you well know, I was very supportive of the $1,000-per-hour cap.

Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct. But the suggestion that judges are going to somehow guarantee that these exorbitant, as you indicated, unconscionable fees will not occur is not clear from that case because the judge has, in fact, affirmed that case. 
The Governor, George Bush of Texas, is doing everything he can to resist the payment of those exorbitant fees, but he has not yet prevailed. We don't need to have litigation in every State in America. We ought to comprehensively legislate this legislation with all of the others in this case.

Mr. SESSIONS. Let me respond with a question. Does the Senator from North Dakota believe there should be no cap on the attorneys' fees? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-sessions-al-14-19980616</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. SESSIONS. I understand that, but the point clearly is this is a cap of $4,000 per hour. It is not a guarantee of $4,000 per hour. I preferred a cap of $1,000 per hour. The Senator from North Dakota opposed that. So we raised the figure now. I don't see how anybody can complain about this cap. 
As to this arbitration agreement, it either does one of two things: It either violates the contracts and, therefore, the legislation written by the Senator from North Dakota has, in fact, undertaken to override the fee written agreement between the attorneys general and their plaintiff lawyers; or it does not. 
I am afraid, however, that it doesn't do what the Senator from North Dakota suggests, because the way I read it, the only complaint that can be made is when the attorney general disagrees with the amount of the fee with the lawyer he hired. The exact language is: 
With respect to any dispute that may arise between them regarding the fee agreement, the matter shall be submitted to arbitration. 
So, I am not sure that this arbitration agreement has any impact whatever on attorneys' fees. The only thing that would happen is some judges may find it unconscionable and just refuse to enforce it. That is obvious to us, that many of these agreements are unconscionable and ought not to be enforced. 
With regard to the Florida fee where the judge held it to be unconscionable, those lawyers have worked a pretty good while on that case. They have done a pretty good amount of work. 
The lawyers in Mississippi and Texas have put in a lot of work. The lawyers in Minnesota have put in a lot of work. But there are quite a number of States where the attorneys have done almost no work and they expect to receive a billion dollars. A lawyer, Mr. Angelos, who I believe owns the Baltimore Orioles, had a 25 percent agreement with the State of Maryland. After the case collapsed and they agreed to pay the money--and I don't know how long after he filed the lawsuit, but he certainly wasn't one of the early hard workers on the litigation--he agreed to cut his fee in half to 12.5 percent. That was real generous of him. As I read that in the newspapers, that was a billion dollars. That 12.5 percent was over a billion dollars. And he has done almost nothing. 
These are fees the likes of which the world has never seen in history. The amount of work that went into obtaining these fees is minuscule in many cases, and as we are going about tobacco legislation, we simply ought not to allow it to happen. I can't say how strongly I believe that is true. No bill should come out of this Congress that does not have a realistic cap on attorneys' fees. To do so would be to dishonor the taxpayers of this country. And to argue, as some have, that it is being paid by the lawyers or the tobacco companies, and therefore not paid by the citizens of the country, is likewise an improper and unacceptable argument. 
The truth is that any way you look at it, it is money paid by the tobacco companies to settle the lawsuit. It is sort of unwise and unhealthy, in my opinion, for it to be structured this way. Well, the plaintiff lawyers who are representing the State of Alabama, or the State of Mississippi, say: State of Mississippi, you don't have to pay my fee; I will just take my fee over here from the tobacco companies; they will pay it. 
Well, one of the classic rules of law is that a person who pays your fee is the one you have loyalty to. It creates an impermissible conflict of interest, in my view, between the attorney and his true client--the State--that he is representing. So sometimes they argue that it doesn't count because it was paid by the tobacco companies. That is bad from an ethical point of view, in my opinion. It is also an unjustified argument, because the tobacco company doesn't care whether the money they pay goes to the attorneys' fees or to the State, they just want the lawsuit to end, so they will pay some of it over there and some over there. They just say, `Tell me where you want me to pay it, State of North Dakota, and I will write the check. Do you want me to write a billion dollars to the attorneys? I will do it. Or I will write you a check for $4 billion. Whatever you say.' It is just money to settle a lawsuit to them. Certainly that billion dollars could have been put in for health care, tax reductions, and other good things. So that argument, to me, is very unhealthy. 
In the history of litigation throughout the entire world, we 
have never seen the kind of enrichment possibilities that exist for attorneys as it exists in this case. With regard to the Florida case, although the trial judge found it unconscionable and he tried his best to eliminate it, his opinion has been withdrawn and is not the final court opinion. The attorney who stands to gain the money still asserts he hopes to get those fees exactly as he was promised. With regard to Texas, a judge has approved a $2.3 billion attorney fee already. I don't know if Governor Bush can succeed in turning that around or not. He is doing all he can to do so, as well he should, 
because when you consider how much Texas could use $2.3 billion, as any State could, he ought to resist the loss of that revenue for the people of Texas. 
I think the Senator from Washington has worked hard on this amendment. He has listened to the objections from the other side, and he has sought to draft a piece of legislation that would meet those objections. It pays a little more than I think is necessary, but it would have a significant impact in containing the most unconscionable fees that are likely to occur in this matter. I think he has done a good job with it. It certainly does not mandate $4,000-per-hour fees. A judge has to justify those kinds of fees in a finding. That should mean that young lawyers who may have just done basic background work, or a little research and other types things, won't be paid $4,000; only the very best will. 
I think it is a good step forward. We will now see who wants to pay these attorneys a legitimate wage for their work. This is a legitimate wage for their work. I expect that we would have bipartisan support for Senator Gorton's amendment. It is a good amendment. It is a generous amendment for the trial lawyers. It rewards them to a degree that is unheard of for their work. I don't know of any fees I have ever heard of at $4,000 per hour. It ought to bring this matter to a conclusion. Again, I don't believe we will have any legislation on tobacco that does not contain a limitation on attorneys' fees, and that certainly represents my opinion. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Would the Senator recognize that the language that he quoted starts off and says, `attorneys' fees as approved by the court in such action' and `any attorneys' fees shall not exceed the per hour rate of . . .' Then there is a set of criteria for the judge to consider what the hourly fee should be. I suggest that very few will justify reaching that rate. But whatever, it will be decided by judges on a case-by-case basis. 
As the Senator suggested, he believes that some cases are different. This allows flexibility. 
Would the Senator not agree with that?

Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate very much the conviction and hard work done by the Senator from North Carolina on this important issue. It is not a political issue, although I think it could become one as time goes along. It is a question of right and wrong. It is a question of just how rich persons can get with the money that should be available to benefit children and the health care of Americans. 
So I think we have an issue of great importance. I think the Senator from North Carolina is also correct when he says that we came here a few days ago and we talked about a $250 per hour containment of attorney fees and they said that was not enough. So we have attempted, again, to come up with a bill that will pass muster in this body, that will have support from both sides of the aisle, Democrats and Republicans, with the kind of fees that nobody can object to, that are rational and just and fair and quite generous, and will, in fact, make multimillionaires out of many, many lawyers. 
I do not believe and I resist the suggestion that this capping of these fees in this litigation is somehow an attack on attorneys and an attack on the contingent fee contracting in general. It has nothing to do with that. It involves only tobacco litigation--tobacco litigation and legislation that was brought to the U.S. Senate. And we were asked to pass legislation on it. It spun out of litigation. It certainly has not been completed. None of the verdicts have been affirmed on appeal. Other cases have just gotten started. And we in the Federal Government are about to pass legislation that could, in fact, terminate all of that and bring it all to a conclusion. The trial lawyers who had contracts, some of whom have done little work, on a contingent basis, now want to be paid billions of dollars in fees. Perhaps 20 or more attorneys will receive $1 billion in fees. 
I would just like to point out how much $1 billion is. This Nation spent $450 million last year on diabetes research. The Alabama general fund budget for the entire State, apart from education, is less than $1 billion. 
So we are talking about huge sums of money by any standard, the kind of money that we have never seen before. These are the largest fees ever awarded in America, many of them for litigation only a few months old. It is `unconscionable,' as a judge in Florida has said, and it cannot be allowed to continue. 
I hope this very generous legislation that allows the lawyers to state their case for up to $1,000 an hour in fees will be the kind of amendment in which everybody in this body could join. 
I want to note why someone could not feel comfortable with that. 
Let me share with this body a report from `20/20' that was done recently involving the Florida litigation. This will explain how that litigation prevails, just how much was involved, and how much the attorney gets out of it. It began with Hugh Downs. This is what he said.  
What is your time worth? How does $7,000 an hour sound? That's what some lawyers want to be paid for their work on Florida's suit against the tobacco industry. Each and every one of them could become a millionaire many times over just from this one case. So did they really earn their fee? 
John Stossel tells us about it. 
John Stossel: `The children are supposed to benefit * * *' 
You know that we have heard a lot of talk about children and helping children. Let me ask this question: Will allowing an attorney to become a billionaire help children? Could that money be used for other antismoking programs, or tax reductions for the American people? It certainly could. 
John Stossel: `The children are supposed to benefit from new money from antismoking programs. And later the Governor invited in some children and dummied up a check to celebrate the first $750 million payment. But now it turns out that the Florida taxpayers may not get as much of that money as they thought because Florida's lawyers are in a legal battle over how much money they should get. Montgomery says they deserve $2.8 billion. That's right, billion. He doesn't exactly need money. This is his multimillion-dollar house in luxurious Palm Beach right next to the ocean. The house is so huge, it looks more like a palace. Even his Rolls Royce and his Bentley live in a garage that's bigger than many houses. Montgomery got this rich suing car makers and hospitals and insurance companies.'  
The interview with Bob Montgomery was right there at his house. He describes his lawn. 
So this is my putting green, and this is my sand trap. And what I do is I have these balls, and this is where I drive them: 
John Stossel: `Out into the water.' 
Bob Montgomery: `Out into the water.' 
John Stossel: `The inside of the house is even more grand. Montgomery has a vast art collection.' 
Ladies and gentleman, we are talking about a lot of money. We are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars, not just $1 million. One million dollars is a lot of money. 
A million dollars. It is an American dream to be a millionaire. We are talking billions, a billionaire. 
Mr. Stossel goes on. He talks about how they were selected. How do people get selected to file these lawsuits? Did they bid on it? Did they go out and say what lawyer will take this lawsuit and what kind of rate will you give us and let's evaluate the best bid? 
Stossel. Friendship starts to explain how some of these private lawyers were selected and ended up with a contract that says each is now entitled to hundreds of millions of dollars. It began four years ago when Levin came up with a scheme to use Florida's legislature to make it easier to win a suit against big tobacco. 
They interviewed Mr. Levin, a fine lawyer. I had occasion to meet the man, a skilled attorney, and he was very, very frank about what happened. 
Mr. Levin: I took a little known statute called a Florida Medicaid recovery statute-- 
This is his exact quote-- changed a few words here and a few words there, which allowed the State of Florida to sue the tobacco companies without ever mentioning the words `tobacco' or cigarettes. The statute passed in both the--the House and the Senate. No one voted against it. 
John Stossel. Well, did people know what they were voting for? 
Levin: No. And if I had told them, they'd have stood up and made a--you know, they'd have been able to keep me from passing the bill. 
John Stossel. This made the suit much more winnable?

Mr. SESSIONS. Well, you have asked an absolutely important question. Those who have been opposed to this legislation have had their integrity questioned and it was suggested that they are bought by tobacco. I have somewhere in this stack a little chart that indicates something about political donations. 
From the years 1990 to 1994--I want the Senator from Texas to understand this--plaintiffs' lawyers in three States--my State and your State being two of the three--Alabama, California and Texas, spent $17.3 million on political contributions. During that time, the Democratic National Committee, in all 50 States, spent $12.4 million. During that time, the Republican National Committee, in all 50 States, spent $10 million. During that time, big oil in Alabama, California and Texas spent $1.7 million. I know oil is a big industry in Texas. They only spent $1.7 million in Alabama, California and Texas, whereas the trial lawyers spent $17.3 million. The automobile companies in Alabama, California and Texas spent $3,500. 
That shows you what has happened here. I suggest that we need to rise above special interests. I believe every Member of this body has an obligation to his constituents--to that secretary, to that waitress, to that gas station operator, to that farm equipment dealer--if he takes their money and increases taxes, to not give it away to people who live in mansions who practice golf by driving their golf balls out into the ocean, and that is what we are talking about. 
There are a number of other things that I can mention, but I see the Senator from Texas is here. I am pleased to yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. And he referred to the proposal in the bill dealing with attorneys' fees. I say it is, at best, ambiguous, and it is a testament to the drafters, in my opinion. I am not sure what it means, but it says this: If the attorney involved is unable to agree with the plaintiff--that is, the attorney general--with respect to any dispute that may arise between them regarding the fee agreement, then they can go to arbitration. 
Now, what does that mean? When you go to arbitration, you have a fee agreement. You are talking about the agreement. Now, some argue, well, this agreement allows the arbitrators to go around the fee agreement. To that I would say, if so, then the legislation already provides for the undermining, going around the agreement. You can't have it both ways. 
But I submit to you that it is particularly interesting. The arbitration panel is composed of three persons, one chosen by the plaintiff, which is the attorney general; one chosen by the attorney, which is the plaintiff's lawyer; and those two choose the third one. Those are the people who entered into the agreement. What kind of agreement is going to come out of arbitration from that? 
Let me just say that the $2.5 billion for four lawyers in Texas equals about $500 million each. That is more than we spend each year on diabetes in the United States. That is the kind of money we are talking about--$2.5 billion. 
Let me make a couple of other points. The arbitration clause, as I pointed out, is ineffective and totally a sham, in my opinion, and will not protect the taxpayers. Of contract rights, they say 
you can't violate a contract. And this I say would be the principle we are dealing with: A person who signs a contract can keep the U.S. Congress or any other agency from passing a law that conflicts with that contract. It is just that simple. 
That is the traditional law of America. We do it when we alter the minimum wage. Nobody has been crying that the tobacco companies' contract to run advertising is going to be terminated by these things. When Congress legislates comprehensively, it can legislate on matters involving contracts. It is done every day. And I remind the Members of this body that, under the Equal Access to Justice Act, the top fee is $125; under Criminal Defense Attorneys, they are paid $75 per hour. I think this fee is particularly generous, Mr. President. I will share this with the body. Everybody has been talking about how much this body is influenced by tobacco contributions. I want to say I didn't take any contributions from tobacco, and I do not take tobacco contributions. But this is instructive about the influence and the involvement of trial lawyers from 1990 to 1994. And I submit they have been more heavily involved in recent years. But we have these numbers. 
Plaintiff lawyers in these States: Alabama, my home State, Senator Gramm's State of Texas, and California, gave $17 million. During that time, the Democratic National Committee in all 50 States gave $12 million; the Republican National Committee in all 50 States gave $10 million; big oil in Alabama, California, and Texas gave $1.8 million. 
I don't consider that determinative of this issue, but I would just say this. I think some people need to ask themselves some serious questions about public policy. If they care about children, if they care about fairness and justice, if they care whether or not they tax a waitress $1,000 a year for her cigarettes, should we be turning that money over to lawyers who are making $92,000 per hour? I submit it is unconscionable, it is something that should not happen. It is a matter of the greatest importance to this body, and I ask that this amendment be supported.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is an important bill, legislation that I hope that this body can reach an accord on. The Coverdell-Craig amendment on drugs is not a way to undermine the bill but a way to improve the bill. 
Drug use among young people is the No. 1 concern of parents, according to authoritative polling data. We have a bill that has gone from $360 billion to, some say, $750 billion in income to the U.S. Treasury. It would be a tragedy were we not to take this opportunity to do something about the drug abuse problem that continues to increase at extraordinary rates, particularly among young people in America today. 
I serve as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Juvenile Crime. I have had the occasion to deal with the drug abuse problem in that capacity. I also had the occasion, for 15 years, to be a Federal prosecutor and 12 years as U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Alabama. During that time, I was actively involved in the Mobile Bay Area Partnership For Youth, the primary drug-fighting organization which was later added to the Coalition for a Drug-Free Mobile. We worked on a monthly basis with the leadership in our community to do what we could do, as citizens within that community, to reduce drug abuse in our schools and among young people. 
I learned some things during that process. I learned that what you do makes a difference. I was proud to have served under the Reagan-Bush administration as a Federal prosecutor. During that time, I observed a continual decline in drug use, according to the University of Michigan study that tested high school seniors, among others, every year for 20 years. It is probably the most authoritative and respected study in America. It showed that, for the 12 years under Presidents Reagan and Bush, drug use went down every single year, something I was extraordinarily proud to have been a part of. President Reagan and Mrs. Reagan sent a message down to every federal agency to cooperate in efforts to reduce drug abuse, because we cared about young people; we did not want them to be hooked on drugs. And it worked. Those who said the drug fight was a failure were wrong; we were making progress. 
When President Clinton was elected, I sensed, and told my friends and professional acquaintances who were involved in this area, that he was making some very serious mistakes. When you go on MTV and you joke about whether or not you inhaled, saying, `Maybe I wish I had,' that sends a message to young America that something has changed, that the moral-based unacceptability of drug use message that had gone out consistently for over a decade was now changed; there was going to be a new day. I recognized it then, and so did professionals. This was bad. The drug czar's office, the office that Bill Bennett used so effectively to continue to drive down drug use, was gutted. It is only recently that we have shown the need for the drug czar's office to be strengthened again and for General McCaffrey to begin to stand up to some of the inertia and bureaucracy in this Government to make a clearer point about the problem of drug use. 
So, I just say that this is an important matter. It would be unfortunate, indeed, if, in our concern here, as part of this tobacco bill, which is to help the youth and health of children, we didn't also focus on drugs. It is the No. 1 concern of parents, and well it should be. 
I would just say this. In general, there are a number of other amendments we need to talk about with regard to this tobacco bill. I have been intimately involved in the attorneys' fees matter. We need to vote on that again. As far as I am concerned, I will not support a bill that does not limit the incredible fees that attorneys stand to gain. So we need to have a discussion about that. We have an attorney in Miami, FL, according to John Stossel on `20/20,' who hits golf balls out into the ocean from his 
beach-front mansion when he practices his driving. That is just indicative of how wealthy they have become from this litigation. He expects not millions, not tens of millions, not hundreds of millions of dollars, but billions of dollars. They want $2.8 billion in attorneys' fees in Florida. 
They say, `A judge can decide this.' A judge has already approved $2.3 billion in attorneys' fees to the firms in Texas. This is extraordinary--a billion dollars. To give an indication, the general fund budget of the State of Alabama is less than a billion dollars. This is the kind of fees we are talking about paying. 
So I think we are going to have to talk about that some more. There is a provision in this bill that allows for $8 billion to be paid out `to victims who win lawsuits, smokers who win lawsuits.' They can go to this fund, run by the tobacco companies, and they can get money up to $8 billion, and then they are cut off. That is a terrible plan, because some States are going to have laws, traditional laws, that will probably not allow smokers to win at all. Other States may allow them to win. One jury may give $10 million, another nothing--`You smoked; it warned you on the package when you smoked; you should not recover.' We are going to have aberrational justice of the most extraordinary nature. It is going to be like the asbestos litigation, in which there are 200,000 pending asbestos cases today--200,000--and no more than 40 percent of the money paid by the asbestos companies actually got to the victims of asbestos. We are creating the exact same process with this legislation. 
So I have an amendment, Senator Jeffords and I do; we will be introducing it--to create a compensation fund and let the Secretary of Health and Human Services, under certain guidelines, distribute the money promptly to people who are in need. If you have lung cancer from smoking, your life expectancy is a matter of months. You don't need to have 2 years of litigation before you get any compensation. If you are entitled to it, you ought to get it promptly. We would have awards within 90 days and without attorneys' fees. We don't even need attorneys under those circumstances. 
So there are a lot of things we can deal with. We have a huge tax increase, and how we are going to reduce some taxes in the course of this will be important also. 
So there are a lot things we need to talk about. We have 17 programs, $500 billion, $600 billion, $700 billion in new income to the Government. We ought not to pass this lightly. It is just going to take some time to go through it. I am chagrined that the Democratic leader would feel we ought to cut off the opportunities to debate and improve this bill. 
As I said, I have spent some time wrestling with the drug issue over the years. It is a matter about which I feel very deeply. I gave a lot of my personal time to it. I have worked with civic leaders. I have worked with juvenile judges. I have worked with mental health officials. I have worked with treatment officials and other people. I brought in national experts to my district. I have met with them and talked with them. When I was U.S. Attorney, I chaired a national antidrug committee for the Department of Justice and had a lot of concern about it. 
Let me share with you a few thoughts about what we ought to do. 
We have--and Senator Coverdell has done an outstanding job on this legislation--agreed to a particular amendment that I suggested, the parental consent drug testing provision. It is a provision that allocates $10 million to be available to schools. A school will have to ask for it. It will be voluntary for the school. They will establish a program to drug test within that school. Parents will have to consent for their children to be drug tested. If they do not want them tested, they do not have to allow them to be tested. 
I will talk about that for a few minutes and explain why, if we really care about children, this is a tool which I believe has a potential to do more than any single other thing I know of to reduce drug abuse in America. 
We have talked about it a lot. We tell our children we do not want them to use drugs and it is dangerous, but we do not do the things that allow us to know whether or not they are using drugs. Dr. Laura tells us we need to confront our children and be honest with them and find out whether or not they are using drugs. Sometimes you can't always take what they say at face value. Drug testing is a tool for parents, it is a tool for teachers, and it is a tool for people who love children, who care about them. If you love them, if you care about them, you want to know whether or not they are undertaking bad habits. 
It is disclosure. It is truth. It is confrontation. It is what the psychologists and psychiatrists call intervention. They will not use a positive drug test to prosecute somebody or to otherwise send them to jail or invoke the criminal law. That is prohibited by this legislation. What it will do is allow that parent, that teacher, that principal to know that this child has a problem and it could get worse. If we intervene early before addiction occurs, we have a much better chance of changing those life habits. 
I don't know if this program will work--maybe it won't work--but my experience, and it has been over a number of years, tells me that it will. Let me tell you why. 
A number of years ago in the early 1980s, the captain of a Navy aircraft carrier spoke before a civic organization of which I am a member. He told us that less than 2 years before, over 60 percent of the sailors on that ship, in his opinion, had tried an illegal drug within the past few months--60 percent on that naval ship. He said since they began a rigorous program, `Just Say No. No Drugs in Our Navy,' and drug testing, that was down to 2 or 3 percent, in his opinion, in a matter of 2 years. 
Some people were kicked out of the Navy, true, but not that many. Most of them who had a clear message of what they were expected to do, what kind of standards they were expected to meet and that those standards were going to be enforced, met those standards. Were their lives better? Was the quality of life on a naval ship better when people were not using drugs than when they were? I submit it is much better. And, in fact, I believe if you go back and study what has happened in our military, you will find the great upsurgence in quality and strength of our military coincides with the time we took a strong stand on drugs and removed drugs from the military. In fact, the military has some of the lowest drug use statistics of any group in the country. That was progress. That was good. That is the kind of thing that makes life better. It makes better soldiers, it makes those soldiers 
better family leaders, better parents, better with their lives and community activity. I say that is important. 
I talked to a man who ran a work release center in my hometown of Mobile. He told me this story. They had 16 members on a work release gang, and they received approval to do a blind testing of those members for drugs. They had not been doing it that much. They checked them. Fifteen of the 16 had used drugs, they tested positive for drugs on a criminal prison work release program. 
When they began to test regularly, drug use went down dramatically. They had discipline--not harsh discipline--but they had discipline for those who did not stay drug free, and it worked. Are those work release people better off because somebody cared enough to test them, to stay on them, to discipline them when they failed? Yes, they are. 
Jay Carver, who we brought to my hometown of Mobile, ran the drug testing program in the District of Columbia for many, many years. It was the largest, most effective and efficient drug testing program in the world, I suppose, certainly in America. He said he had people who were testing positive, who had drug problems, tell him they wanted to stay on the program even after their time on it was off. Why? Because it helped them stay off drugs, and they wanted to stay off drugs. That discipline, that testing and reporting, helped them stay drug free. 
Prison guards--we have had problems with drugs in prisons, and there has been a small number of prison guards over the years who, it has been discovered, were using drugs and also bringing drugs into the prisons. Drug testing among prison guards has caused a big step forward in reducing drug use in prisons. 
Police departments, fire departments, transportation personnel, private companies and businesses all testify to the great increase in productivity that occurs when you eliminate drugs in those departments. I say to you that drug testing has proven to be effective in reducing drug use. 
A lot of people have discussed whether or not it can be done in schools and whether or not it is constitutional. I personally believe it is. Certainly it is if parents agree, and if schools voluntarily attempt to offer it as a program, I think we will find perhaps that because certain schools are showing dramatic improvement in reducing drug use, others may want to do it in the future. And if the program doesn't work, well, we will have learned that, too. I suspect if it is properly run, we will have significant drug use reduction, and maybe as the years go by other schools may want to try it and we can develop a more comprehensive program that will improve the fight against drugs. 
Mr. President, let me mention a few things that are important. Why do we want to talk about drugs when we are talking about tobacco? Why? Well, this is all about children and their health. Let me share with you some statistics. 
Some say, `Well, you are just being political; you are just talking about Presidents Reagan-Bush versus President Clinton,' but we ought to know these factors. I predicted to the people I dealt with that the policies of this administration were going to undermine the successes of President Reagan and Mrs. Reagan's `Just Say No to Drugs' program. I see it happening. Let me show you what has happened according to unchallenged statistics throughout this country. 
For eighth graders, the portion using any illegal drug in the prior 12 months has increased 71 percent since the election of President Clinton. It has increased 89 percent among 10th graders; 57 percent among 12th graders. That is use of any illicit drug. It has increased that much in this period of time, following a time when it had been going down. 
Marijuana use has accounted for much of this increase, and its strong resurgence among eighth graders is obvious. Use of marijuana in the prior 12 months by eighth graders has increased 146 percent since 1992. Yes, tobacco is important, but now we have an indication of why parents say drugs are their No. 1 concern. 
Since the year President Clinton was first elected to office, among 10th graders the annual prevalence increased 129 percent, and among 12th graders, 76 percent since 1992. 
This is something we ought to have talked more about in this country. I do not think the American people fully understand that policies do have impact, that leadership does count. If you are sounding an uncertain trumpet, then you have a real problem. 
I remember the first drug adviser to President Reagan before you had a drug czar. Dr. Carlton Turner was from the small county in Alabama where my mother is from. I got to know him and watched him. He came to our community and he talked about the drug issue at a civic club, my Lions Club. 
While he was there, somebody raised their hand and mentioned a rural county. He said the No. 1 cash crop in that county is marijuana, `ha, ha, ha.' Dr. Turner jumped down that person's throat. He said, `I don't want you ever laughing about drugs. This is very, very dangerous.' He had a Ph.D. and had studied marijuana. That was his field of study. He said, `We should never be laughing about it. This is a serious matter. We, as a nation, need to send a clear, unequivocal message of intolerance to drugs, and we need to stand by it. And you, as leaders in your community, need to do the same.' 
I thought that was a very good message. I never forgot that. That was in the early 1980s. 
We started joking about, `I wish I'd inhaled.' We have more drug use references in rock music, more drug use references on television and in movies than we had before. That is bad. It is one of the things I think is driving this increased use. 
Daily use of marijuana, according to the survey, continues to rise by even younger and younger people. More than 1 in every 25 of today's high school seniors is a current daily marijuana user, according to the PRIDE study, which is a good study--that is an astounding statistic--with an 18.4 percent increase since only last year. 
While only 1.1 percent of 8th graders used marijuana daily in 1997--1 percent is a lot of 8th graders using drugs. That is 1 out of every 100 that are daily users. That still represents an increase of 50 percent since 1992. 
LSD has increased. That is Dr. Leary's `get high' drug. It has increased over 52 percent. It has increased 50 percent among 8th graders since 1992. 
More than 1 in 20 seniors in the class of 1997 used cocaine this year, a 12.2 percent increase over last year. That is cocaine, a highly addictive drug. Crack-cocaine use has continued its gradual climb among 10th and 12th graders. 
Since 1992, annual cocaine use is up 87 percent for 8th graders, 147 percent for 10th graders, and up 77 percent for 12th graders. Those are big increases. That is a real societal problem. That is why parents listed it as such a high priority with them. 
So I want to say to those who express their concern about tobacco and its damaging health impact on children, they are correct. But as you know, marijuana, Mr. President, is, I think, 40 times more carcinogenic than tobacco. It is a highly carcinogenic drug, in addition to the adverse effects such as habituation and other problems. 
We know, for example, learning skills go down when marijuana is used. Kids grades drop, and they lose their motivation to work. That is a characteristic of marijuana use that ought not be dismissed lightly. It is a very serious drug. 
So I just say this, Mr. President--I see the Senator from Arizona has returned to the floor, and I know he has many things he would like to say--but I salute Senator Coverdell for his outstanding effort to improve this bill with a tough antidrug initiative. It will be effective. I believe the one part of it that I have discussed mostly today, the part that allows drug testing for those high school students, whose parents agree to it, could be a turning point in our effort to reduce drugs among 
teenagers, to make their lives healthier and richer as time goes by. 
My experience, as a Federal prosecutor and as chairman of the Youth Juvenile Crime Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, convinces me this is the right course for us to take. I hope that we will continue to pursue it. I hope this amendment will be made a part of the bill, and I know it will strengthen it. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to say thanks to those who have gone before us. Monday marks the 130th year of our country's official observance of Memorial Day. It is a day America dedicates to remember all those who fell in defense of this country. On Monday, many across the land will bow their heads in silence for a few moments and remember the patriots of our past. 
There is no way to measure the impact on the lives of those who have lost someone to war. Certainly on this Memorial Day, many will mourn the youth and joy of loved ones lost. This is a day for the heroes, known and unknown, who died on the field of battle so we might be free. Mr. President, I salute every soldier, airman, marine, coast guardsman, merchantman and sailor who put themselves in harms way and who forfeited their lives so that members of future generations would have the opportunity to stand in this chamber, on a day like today, and speak without fear. 
I have never, nor do I ever wish to know, the fear and suffering that many of these brave men and women surely experienced. It has been said and I would agree, that it is best we leave the understanding of their sacrifice in God's hands--only He can truly know the full measure of what was lost and what was gained. Our responsibility is to acknowledge their sacrifice--to remember that it was made and the reasons for which it was made. Monday, Memorial Day, is the day that our country should unite in one spirit to remember those who purchased the freedom we and our loved ones enjoy. 
Former President James A. Garfield, at the first national Memorial Day observance, said `we do not know one promise these men made, one pledge they gave, one word they spoke; but we do know they summed up and perfected, by one supreme act, the highest virtues of men and citizens. For love of country, they accepted death, and thus resolved all doubts, and made immortal their patriotism and virtue.' 
We should all pause with great gratitude on Monday and look to the future with the greatest of expectations for what the 21st Century holds for us, our children, and our children's children. Our fallen patriots gave everything they had to extend freedom beyond the reach of most of our lifetimes. Mr. President, Memorial Day is not only about remembering the men and women who made the Supreme sacrifice while defending the American way. It is about acknowledging and protecting the ideals they died for, so that their sacrifice shall not have been made in vain. 
Brave Alabamians have been among those who have fought so valiantly and are among the hundreds of thousands who died in World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Lebanon, Panama, Grenada, and the Persian Gulf. They deserve our deepest respect and honor. God bless these fallen heroes. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, is there an order of procedure, informal or otherwise?

Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for summarizing many of the very significant restrictions that will be placed on the tobacco companies if they participate in the settlement. 
But I really do believe, and can say with great confidence, that we are not dealing with a question of immunity when an industry agrees to pay $750--$70 billion in payments to subject itself to many other controls and limitations. That is not immunity. And in fact, they have agreed, in addition, to pay $8 billion into a fund that would be available for individual liability lawsuits--each year, $8 billion. It goes up according to the cost of living index. 
So I just say, this is a remarkable settlement. And it reminds me of the case in which the client sues and gets everything he wants but he still wants to keep suing because he wants to get a drop of blood. 
Now, let me say this. I am not a defender of tobacco. I do not take any money from the tobacco industry. I believe it is a very damaging product to people's health. I know that as certainty as I am able to know anything. I oppose its use. I believe anything we can do particularly to keep youngsters from getting involved in tobacco is good, because it is more difficult for them to quit once they start, and they become addicted quicker at a younger age. It is a very insidious product, and we ought not to do anything that would undermine our effort, that I think has bipartisan support, to deal with smoking in America. 
Let me talk about this subject on a broader basis. And I think our Members ought to consider this on both sides of the aisle. It is above partisan politics. In my view, the law is too much with us late and soon. We have too much litigation. Courts are clogged all over America with more and more lawsuits every day. People cannot get speedy justice. Cases are backed up. Costs have increased. And it is not a pretty sight. 
As policy-setting Members of this Government of the United States, it ought to be our goal to reduce that litigation, to do what we can to obtain justice in ways that do not require citizens of this country to expend extraordinary sums of money over long periods of time for only modest gain at the end of it. That is a principle in which I believe deeply. 
I have been a practicing lawyer all my career. I served as a U.S. attorney for almost 12 years, and I practiced law in private practice. 
Let me just mention the asbestos litigation situation. Asbestos caused a number of different diseases that have resulted in large payments by the asbestos companies. This was handled, in the normal litigation of America, in the torts lawsuits that have been filed. Over 200,000 of those lawsuits have been filed and concluded, 200,000 more are pending, and it is estimated there may be another 200,000 filed. 
Now think about that. That is 600,000 lawsuits, perhaps more, having to wind their way through the court system, with lawyers, and fees, and costs, and expenses. According to testimony we had before the Judiciary Committee by one expert who studied this matter, less than 40 percent of the money paid by these asbestos companies actually got to the victims, the people who were suffering disease because of their exposure to asbestos. Just think about that. Less than 40 percent of the money they paid actually got to the victims of asbestos disease. 
I think that is unacceptable. That is an unjustifiable event. It does not reflect credit on the legal system, and it does not, even more so, reflect credit on the Congress and the Senate of the United States, because we should have legislation that can deal with that in a more efficient way. 
So I just say, I am troubled by the prospect that we will allow litigation to spring up all over America, that we can have a fund there to pay it, that we will have not 200,000 smoking suits, as they had in asbestos, but perhaps 500,000, 800,000, a million, several million lawsuits filed--tens of hundreds, maybe thousands in every community in America, large and small, where lawsuits will be filed, clogging the dockets of the courts, taking up weeks to try, and incurring great expense. It seems to me we can do better than that. I am certain that we can do better than that. 
What happens when a lawsuit of this nature is filed? And I have to agree with Senator Gregg from New Hampshire: This bill is not effective in what it intends to do. It needs to be amended. And Senator Jeffords from Vermont and I will be introducing legislation on this bill, an amendment, that will distribute moneys that are paid in a fair and equitable manner, with the minimum of cost and the quickest possible turnaround time, 
so the people who are ill can receive compensation which they deserve, receive it quickly, without even having a lawyer. 
Under the court system approach, just turning over tobacco lawsuits to litigation throughout America, we are talking about individuals having to hire attorneys. The Wall Street Journal has already noted that attorneys--I believe, in Detroit or Chicago--are advertising for tobacco clients now. They are already advertising for clients so they can file lawsuits. Traditionally, they will charge at least one-third, probably more of them will charge 40 percent of the recovery on a contingent fee basis. That means 40 percent of the money paid out by the tobacco company won't go to the victim, but will go to the attorneys. In addition to that, there will have to be trials, court costs, jury costs, deposition costs, medical costs, expert witness costs, and great delays. 
Before you can get any money out of this bill, you have to have a final judgment. Normally that would mean a judgment by the supreme court of the State, which may be 2 years or more in the offing. The result of that, I suggest, for people who are suffering from lung cancer is that many of them, unfortunately, would not live to see any recovery. 
The Senator from New Hampshire is also correct that it appears under this bill the tobacco companies decide who gets paid. I don't know how that came about, but it indicates they pay whoever they want to pay and that counts toward their payment into this fund. That is not a rational way to see that injured people get paid. They should not be required to do that. It will also cause a race to the courthouse because you don't get any money until you have a final affirmance of your judgment, and only then can you come to the tobacco company and get your payment. 
We should not be put in a situation in which two equally deserving claimants have filed a lawsuit and one wins and he has a fast court system and he gets into the fund and gets his money first and another one takes a long time before he ever gets his final judgment, before he gets money. We are creating a system that will be aberrational. 
It will be aberrational in a number of other ways. Some States will be favorable to these kind of lawsuits. Some States will not. Maryland has already changed its law to make lawsuits against tobacco companies easier to file. Other States may do that. Traditional defenses such as assumption of the risk and contributory negligence may be vitiated by legislation or court rulings, and lawsuits will move faster and more successfully in one State, whereas another State that adheres to traditional rules of law may not allow cases to move forward at all. It may be unsuccessful wholly in one State. Indeed, we could have one or more States virtually bankrupting the tobacco industry themselves if they were to have unfettered litigation cases of this kind. 
As a person who has practiced law for a long time, who has been in court on a consistent basis, I can tell you that the prospect of hundreds of thousands, maybe a million tobacco lawsuits being filed, burdening the judges and courts to a degree they have never known before is not a good thing. The taxpayers pay for that. Some will say it is a free-market deal. Just let people file their lawsuits and the government is not involved in it. The courts are the government. Courts are the government. The taxpayers are paying for the judges, the jurors, the clerks, the court reporters and everybody that manages a courtroom, and the courtrooms in which these cases are tried. The taxpayers are intimately involved in that. 
We can do a lot better than this. I just say we cannot allow a repeat of the asbestos litigation situation. We cannot, as Members of this body, allow a situation to occur in which less than 40 percent of the money paid out actually gets to the people who are victims of the crime. They will say, well, in this bill they have arbitration over attorney's fees. I have heard that. So I have gone back and read the legislation. This is the arbitration: If you are unhappy with the agreement you have with your attorney, 
 you can go to an arbitrator. The attorney gets to name one member of the panel, you get to name one, and those two select a third. But if you have a standard agreement with them on a one-third or 40 percent contingent fee basis, 40 percent of what you recover goes to the lawyer if you have that kind of an agreement. That is what the arbitrators are going to affirm. They are not going to undercut written contracts between attorneys and clients the way this thing is written. 
So there is no protection here to substantial fees being paid to attorneys in all of these cases. We know it will take years for them to be concluded. There will be a race to the courthouse to get judgment. Some States will allow suits to proceed. Others will not. Some people will draw a favorable jury, win a big verdict, $100 million; somebody else will have a jury that is more conservative and renders no verdict, zero verdict. This is not the way we ought to do it. 
On this legislation, we begin the process of establishing a sane and rational method of distributing the funds that ought to go to those who have been injured by tobacco. However, the problem with it is it does not go nearly far enough. This is a classic mass tort situation. The greatest mass tort situation, perhaps, in the history of mankind in which millions of Americans have smoked for a long time and they have hurt and damaged their health because of it, and as a result of that they now want to seek compensation. 
First, let me say something. I have to be very frank. No individual person has succeeded in a lawsuit against a tobacco company, primarily because of the traditional rules of law that say if you undertake a dangerous activity and you are injured in that, you cannot sue somebody and ask for compensation because of it. The way this bill is written, I believe the likelihood is we will have more States like Maryland amending their law, more pressure on judges and juries to get around the traditional defenses to these kind of activities, which is somewhat dangerous, because what about the liquor companies and cirrhosis of the liver or other kinds of diseases that come from other kinds of products. Is there no barrier to that anymore? 
I will say we have a major mass tort situation. We ought to deal with it in a comprehensive manner. We should not allow an unfettered lawsuit flood to dominate the American court system, resulting in some people winning large verdicts, others getting nothing, delay, people dying before they have any recovery. 
Senator Jeffords and I will be introducing a bill that will say if you have a serious disease and have been disabled because of your smoking, you can file a claim and within 90 days you can be paid. You will not even have to have an attorney. We will limit the cost to 10 percent and we will dispense the moneys based on the seriousness of your disease, the seriousness of your disability and whether or not it is connected to smoking. That is the kind of thing we can do. We can use this money that the tobacco companies in this litigation demand that they pay--$8 billion a year--and we can use that to compensate in a prompt and fair way those who have been injured. To do otherwise is just not a good way to do business. It will enrich lawyers, it will burden the courts, and it will guarantee an irrational distribution of funds to those who have been injured and minimize the amount of money actually getting to those who deserve to be compensated. 
I will say that I do believe that this amendment should not be passed, that the payment of $755 billion, the agreement to give up certain constitutional rights such as free speech and advertising is the kind of settlement that is justifiable and proper under the circumstances. We would make a historic step forward for America if we can develop a way to ensure that those who are injured in a mass injury-type situation such as this are compensated in a realistic and prompt way. I believe we can do that. For these reasons, I must ask my fellow Senators to vote no on the Gregg amendment. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is, indeed, an important issue. We have heard a lot today about validity of contingent fees. Historically, contingent fees have not been favored by the law. They have been scrutinized. Lawyers ethically were supposed to take fees on a paying basis unless the person could not afford to hire a lawyer--but we have always affirmed a contingency fee basis. I am not here to criticize that. I am not. This legislation in no way would stop private attorneys from going forward with contingent fee arrangements with their clients. As an attorney, I have filed cases on an hourly fee basis and on a contingency fee basis. I don't think there is anything wrong with that and I don't mean to suggest there is. 
But in the history of litigation, in the history of America, in the history of law, in the history of the world there have never been fees equivalent to the ones we are talking about today. They go beyond anything we can imagine. These fees are beyond any payments that have ever been known in the world of law. I call them the mother of all attorney's fees. This is a serious matter. 
The attorneys general of the United States have come to this Congress, this Senate, and they have asked us to approve a settlement, to add things to it, to review it and comprehensively deal with this matter. So one of the things that we have to deal with is attorneys' fees. 
Under the Constitution, the Congress is empowered to regulate. We do it when we enact a minimum wage. A person has a contract with somebody at $4 an hour, and we say the wage ought to be $5 an hour; that contract is vitiated. We have a lot of containment of attorney's fees in America. 
Indeed, with regard to Social Security cases, there is a limitation on attorney's fees. With regard to the Criminal Justice Act, the limit is $75 an hour. Under the Equal Access to Justice Act, attorney's fees are limited to $125 an hour. Limitation of attorney's fees is common. We have had a number of research papers written on fee limitations. A professor from Cardozo School of Law has written comprehensively on this legislation and says it is, indeed, constitutional. 
To illustrate the amount of money at issue in these cases, I would like the people of this country and the Members of this body to think about this: The yearly general fund budget for the State of Alabama is less than $1 billion. In Texas, a judge has approved payment of $2.3 billion to a handful of lawyers for this litigation. They approved that kind of fee. 
In Florida, attorneys are still battling to obtain $2.8 billion in fees--that is two thousand eight hundred million dollars--two thousand eight hundred million dollars. That is absolutely unconscionable, as a judge in Florida said, and as anyone who has any sense of decency ought to understand. We have been asked to pass legislation dealing with this health care problem and try to do something about teenagers and smoking? We have a right to pass legislation dealing with attorney's fees. 
Let me share something with you. People may not understand exactly how all of this has occurred. I have a transcript of a recent 20/20 program about the Florida attorney's fees debate. Let me share some of what was said in that program. The segment is entitled, `What A Deal.'  
Hugh Downs. What is your time worth? How does $7,000 an hour sound? That's what some lawyers want to be paid for their work on Florida's suit against the tobacco industry. Each and every one of them could become a millionaire many times over, just from this one case. 
So, did they really earn their fee? Well, John Stossel tells us how the lawyers came to demand a king's ransom for their work. 
John Stossel. The children are supposed to benefit from the new money for anti-smoking programs. And later the governor invited in some children and dummied up a check to celebrate the first $750 million payment. But now it turns out that Florida's taxpayers may not get as much of that money as they thought because Florida lawyers are in a legal battle over how much money they should get. 
Montgomery, the plaintiff's lawyer in the case, says they deserve $2.8 billion. That's right--billion, says Stossel. 
He (referring to Mr. Montgomery) doesn't exactly need the money. 
This is his multimillion-dollar house in luxurious Palm Beach right next to the ocean. 
The house is so huge, it looks more like a palace. Even his Rolls Royce and his Bentley live in a garage that's bigger than many houses. Montgomery got this rich suing carmakers and hospitals and insurance companies. 
Bob Montgomery. So this is my putting green, and this is my sand trap. And what I do is I have these balls, and this is where I drive them. 
John Stossel. Out into the water? 
Bob Montgomery. Out into the water. 
He has so much money, he doesn't worry about his golf balls. He hits them out into the ocean. 
John Stossel. The inside of the house is even more grand. Montgomery has a vast art collection. 
Another attorney, Mr. Fred Levin, defends the fees. 
Fred Levin. It was contracted. 
John Stossel. So who made this contract? 
Fred Levin. Well, the State did. It was a valid, legitimate contract. 
John Stossel. Fred Levin helped the governor put the deal together. 
You're a private lawyer? (Asked of Mr. Levin.) 
Fred Levin. Right. 
John Stossell. What are you doing there? Just giving advice? 
Fred Levin. Well, yes. 
John Stossel. Friendly advice? 
Fred Levin. Yes, I was a--I'm a good friend of the governor's. 
John Stossel. Friendship starts to explain how some of these private lawyers were selected and ended up with a contract that says each now is entitled to hundreds of millions of dollars. It began four years ago, when Levin came up with a scheme to use Florida's legislature to make it easier to win a suit against big tobacco. 
Fred Levin. I took a little-known statute called a Florida Medicaid recovery statute, changed a few words here and a few words there, which allowed the state of Florida to sue tobacco companies without ever mentioning the word `tobacco' or cigarettes. The statute passed in both the house and the senate. No one voted against it. 
John Stossel. Well, did the people know what they were voting for? 
Fred Levin. No. And if I told them, they'd have stood up and made a--you know, they'd have been able to keep--keep me from passing the bill. 
John Stossel. This made the suit much more winnable? 
Fred Levin. Oh, God. It meant it was a slam dunk. 
John Stossel. And who would get to be the lead lawyer on this slam-dunk offense? 
Fred Levin. Initially, I was assuming that I would be bringing the case. But then they said, `Fred Levin's going to make all the money.' 
John Stossel. Fred Levin's doing a scam here. He's changing the law so he can get rich. 
Fred Levin. So I went to the governor and I said, `Listen, let me help you get a group of lawyers together, our dream team, and I'll get out.' 
Mr. Montgomery suggests that if he lost the case, he would have been out $500,000. He probably has that much invested in all of his automobiles in this mansion he has. He suggested his cost was $500,000. 
John Stossel. Am I missing something here? The controversy has become, should the dream team get billions from the 25-percent deal they have with the State or from arbitration? My question is, why do private lawyers get so much of the State's money in the first place? When this construction company got the contract to replace this Florida bridge, they had to compete against other construction companies. There was competitive bidding. To win the job, they had to show they were qualified and submit the lowest bid. All States have such rules to prevent politicians from funneling projects to their friends. But that's not what happened with the lawyers. Here, Fred Levin called some friends. You picked the dream team. 
Then Mr. Stossel discussed how the deal was negotiated and the fact that Mr. Levin and the Governor were close, riding in the same car together. 
Then Mr. Stossel asked Mr. Levin why the Governor was spending the night at this trial lawyer Montgomery's house. 
Fred Levin. Well, when he's in Pensacola, he sleeps at my house, so-- 
John Stossel. That week, Levin threw a big party. His estate's so big he buses the guests in from where they've parked their cars. The Governor came, of course. 
And they talked about how the Governor's guests had raised a lot of money for him. 
As Professor Lester Brickman of Cardozo Law School said: 
It's an outrage. It's more than greed, it's a scam. 
John Stossel. Law professor Lester Brickman, who's an expert on legal fees, says it's not right to hand such a lucrative-fee case to a friend. 
This is the issue we are talking about today. I was attorney general of Alabama when this litigation was being suggested. I had groups of trial lawyers come to me and ask me to file the litigation. We had meetings and we discussed it. They wanted a contingent fee, as I recall, 25 percent of the recovery. 
I remember saying, `Well, some of the States are moving along fine in this litigation. If they win, I assume Alabama will be able to win with our own staff. I don't believe we need you to represent us.' 
They said, `Well, you don't just hire us, you can hire some of your law firm friends, too. You can cut them in on the deal.' That was one of the things they suggested to me. 
I said, `We're not hiring lawyers for friendship. We're not hiring lawyers to pass out funds to people we want to give money to. If we need a lawyer, we'll hire a lawyer.' I didn't do so. 
Basically, what I had predicted came true. When the end came, the tobacco companies settled all over America. Some States had hired lawyers on a contingent-fee basis, lawyers that may have only worked a few weeks or months, and then began to come in and claim 25 percent of $2 billion, $3 billion, $15 billion. This is supposed to be fair and just? I submit that it is not. 
My good friend and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, expressed real concern that we ought not attack contingency-fee contracts, as these contracts benefit people who cannot afford to hire lawyers on an hourly basis. I don't intend to undermine normal contingent-fee contracts, and nothing in our amendment does that. 
I think everyone needs to know that this McCain bill that the administration has approved and signed off on, and the trial lawyers, I suppose, have signed off on, calls for a panel of arbitrators. It consists of three people: The Castano plaintiffs; I understand one of them may get $50 million out of this litigation. Plaintiffs would have one member on the arbitration panel. The other members of the group would be the manufacturers and the attorney general. They get to pick the second one. 
But you see, there is a problem there, because the accord really is between the manufacturers and the attorneys general and the plaintiffs' lawyers. I submit that they are not defending the best interests of the people--they signed those contracts together. 
In this situation, the plaintiff lawyers have placed themselves in--and I don't know any other way to say it--a conflict-of-interest position. When the tobacco companies agreed to settle, they went to the lawyers on the other side and said, `Now, let's talk about your fee. We won't pay all the money to the State and let you be paid by the State, because that would look bad. We'll just have a little side agreement, and we'll pay your fee, and it won't come out of the State's money.' 
The attorneys general agreed to that. So the attorneys general are in on the agreement. And the plaintiff lawyers are in on the agreement. And the tobacco companies are in on the agreement. Anybody who knows anything about economics and thinks realistically about this matter will know there are not two separate pots of money. 
The attorneys' fees and the recovery by the States are all payments by the tobacco companies to get these people off their backs. The tobacco companies do not care whether lawyers get the money or whether the children of the State or the children of the United States get the money. They are not concerned about that. They want this litigation over. 
So this is what we have. The more you pay the lawyers, the more likely they may be to compromise the interests of the State and the children. Every dollar that goes to them is a dollar that would not go to the children. 
The third member of this arbitration panel is picked by the plaintiffs and the manufacturers and the Attorney General. So you have more of the same. This is not an effective arbitration panel. It is a stacked deck. I am not sure some of the people who defended this panel have fully thought that through. We will need to talk to them about that. But this is not an acceptable panel. 
Some people say, `Well, Congress can't undermine contracts.' We limit the minimum wage. And Florida has limited attorney's fees--at least so far they have tried to. People on the other side say, `Well, it's not so bad. Florida limited their attorney's fees contracts. So if Florida can limit that contract, why can't we limit their fee?' But in Texas they did not. In Texas a judge has approved $2.3 billion in attorneys' fees. 
I will point this out to you: I have a recent article about the owner of the Baltimore Orioles making over $1 billion from these attorneys' fees, $1 billion--B-I-L-L-L-I-O-N--$1 billion. I suspect he probably is making more off the lawsuit than he has made on all of his other investments. 
Do you know how many billionaires there are in the United States according to Forbes? I had my staff check. There are about 60. I wonder how many new billionaires these attorneys' fees will make? Who will pay for this wealth transfer? Who will be making more Montgomerys with multimillion-dollar mansions on the beach, who hit their golf balls out into the water because they have so many they don't care, and have world-renowned painting collections? 
I am not weeping at all over the poor state of these attorneys. I think it is time for us to have a clear policy about what we ought to pay. This body voted last year that $250 was a fair wage for them to be paid per hour, and I think it is, too. I support this amendment.

<TEXT>
Mr. SESSIONS. I will share a few thoughts as we discuss this thing. I think the feelings are strong on both sides. 
I suggest that Federal action is appropriate here because the States have asked for a comprehensive settlement of this matter. The legislation that we have proposed is a comprehensive piece of legislation. It involves where the money goes. We don't agree with the States on everything that they say, and we will be doing things differently in a number of ways. It will represent the consensus of the House and the Senate and the President, if he signs it. 
I think it is perfectly appropriate for us to deal with the problem of just how much these litigators make. When you have a young lawyer taking on a big company and winning a contingent fee verdict and making some money off of it--we are not trying to undo that. We are talking about a massive effort, nationwide, that has resulted in incredibly huge profits or windfall attorney fees that ought to be contained by the very nature of this. We have a right to legislate that. 
Whereas at this stage Florida has reduced the attorney's fees that were to be awarded of $2.8 million, one of the lawyers, I think, is still contesting that, and they may not prevail. Or if they do, it is just proof of the fact that courts and legislative bodies have the power to deal with excessive fees in this kind of circumstance. 
Finally, they say, well, there is an arbitration panel in this agreement. I must tell you, the configuration of that panel is unacceptable. It is unacceptable for two different reasons, really. It is unacceptable, No. 1, because it doesn't even come into play unless the attorney involved is unavailable to agree with the plaintiff. The plaintiff is the attorney general or, I guess, representing the State, of the people. I am on page 438 of the agreement. It says you can't have arbitration unless the attorney involved--that is, the private plaintiff lawyer--is unable to 
agree with the plaintiff--that is, the attorney general who employed that attorney--the attorney general, with respect to any dispute that may arise between them regarding their fee agreement. 
Why, this is the fox guarding the hen house. These are the same people that agreed to the fees. We don't have a good thing there. 
Then, when it talks about submitting it to arbitration, the makeup of the panel shall consist of three persons, one of them chosen by the plaintiff--that is, the attorney general--one of them chosen by the attorney--that is, the plaintiff's attorney--and one of them chosen jointly by the two of them. That is who is making the decision--the same people that got us into this fix. I submit that is not an effective arbitration panel and it is not something that at all deals with the seriousness of the problem. 
Lester Brickman, when he was interviewed on `20/20,' the professor from Cardozo Law School, made these statements: `These are politicians involved who are stroking the backs of lawyers because lawyers have stroked their backs before and may yet stroke their backs again. So I think the public perception here, which is probably pretty accurate, is that it smells.' 
I want to make one more point. I think this is really important. I can see how that could be of confusion. The Senator from Massachusetts says there really are two pots. This is fundamental when you think about it. It is not two pots. There is one pot of money; that is the tobacco companies; and they will pay it over to get rid of this lawsuit. And they are willing to pay as much to the lawyers to get them to agree to the settlement. It is not a healthy relationship. It is not a healthy relationship. And the suggestion that the tobacco company can go over here to the side and enter into a side deal with the lawyers who are supposed to be representing the State and the people to pay their fee, and that is not going to affect the overall settlement, is not sound thinking. It is the same money, and every dollar they agree to give is one dollar less that goes to the people and victims of smoking. 
I believe the present proposal is not effective at all. I object to it. I believe the Senator from North Carolina has a proposal that will fix this matter. It will be a generous fee for these attorneys. They worked on it for 4 years, and they have 10,000 hours. They get paid $250 for every one of those hours. That is perfectly generous. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to mention a few things. 
First of all, attorneys' fees do affect the settlement because it is money otherwise available to be paid by the tobacco companies that could be used for health of the children and the good things this bill seeks to do, for that money is directly usable for good things, and it ought not to be given away in unprecedented windfalls for attorneys, many of whom did little work. 
I know the distinguished Senator from Minnesota said that his lawyers did a lot of work. And I think that is probably true. Perhaps the Minnesota attorneys have done more work than any other group of attorneys in the country. And they were paid, I believe, $450 million. That is not $2.8 billion. That is 5, 10 times what they made. So they did a lot of work in Minnesota, and they are going to get fees far less than this settlement would call for. 
People say we should not mess with the contracts. But the other arguments from the people opposing the Faircloth amendment are: Don't worry about it. Florida reduced their fees. Although Texas hasn't yet, they may yet. And there are arbitration policies to reduce fees. 
So they are already admitting it is appropriate to reduce these fees. And as was noted, we contain fees for doctors and lawyers and every other kind of litigation--on many other kinds of litigation in the country. And we are comprehensively dealing with a health problem that is significant. 
Now, we are here setting about to pass legislation to control abuses by tobacco. And I submit we can control abuses by attorneys. 
Let me make one more important point. With regard to this litigation, States have the right to opt out. They are not required to be bound by this and, therefore, the 10th amendment, in my opinion, would not be implicated. They could opt out and not be bound by this agreement. 
But they have sought our legislation to comprehensively deal with this in a fair way. And that would call upon us, I submit, to contain the abuses of the attorneys fees. 
Mr. President, I conclude my remarks at this time and recognize Senator Enzi from Wyoming, who I understand wishes to make remarks, unless our time has expired and you want to go back to your side, which you should be entitled to.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are looking at a situation that is literally intolerable. It is not acceptable to have these kinds of fees. I know contracts were entered into, but nobody expected it to break the way it did. We have law firms in States that literally did only a few weeks' worth of work; States are going to recover billions of dollars, and they are going to get 15, 20, 25 percent of that recovery. We already have provisions in this bill, agreed to by the President and the trial lawyers and the members of the other party, to contain some of these fees in a poor and ineffective way. I say if we can do it that way, let's do it straight up. Let's have a fair fee per hour: The more hours you work, the more money you get paid. We have evolving all sorts of contracts in this case and abrogating them, and we can certainly make a rational agreement on attorneys' fees. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. 
Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the Religious Liberty and Charitable Donation Protection Act of 1998. It is an honor to work with my good friend from Iowa on this important piece of legislation, and I thank him for his leadership on this issue. 
In an important 1970 Supreme Court case upholding tax exemptions for churches, Chief Justice Burger spoke of the Government's relationship with religion as being a relationship of `benevolent neutrality'. It seems more and more that the Government's `benevolent neutrality' is becoming harder to discern, often being replaced with what appears to be `outright hostility'. 
A good example of this is found in Federal bankruptcy law. In the 1995 case of `In re Tessier,' a couple filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13. Out of their net monthly income of $1,610, they proposed to continue making contributions to their church in the amount of $100 per month. This couple had deeply-held religious convictions about donating to the church as part of the exercise of their religious faith. They proposed spending only $200 per month on food, and nothing on entertainment, recreation, health insurance, life insurance, cable television, telephone, or even electrical utility service. Nevertheless, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that during the 5 year duration of their Chapter 13 plan, this couple could not make the proposed contributions to their church. This was in spite of the fact that the Court would probably have allowed them to spend that sum of money on entertainment or recreational expenses. 
The matter of pre-bankruptcy contributions to a church or charity is also a matter of much concern. Several courts have actually interpreted the bankruptcy law to require churches to refund donations made to them in the year prior to a debtor filing bankruptcy. In making such rulings, the courts hold that donations to the church are `fraudulent conveyances'--that is, by giving the money to the church without (according to the courts) receiving something economically valuable in return, they are defrauding their creditors. In reality, there is no fraud involved. And of course you can imagine the potential burden on small churches that may be just getting by financially--churches that have done nothing wrong--to find that they are required to repay a year's worth of contributions received from a faithful contributor. 
The Grassley-Sessions bill is a commonsense bill that would clarify the Bankruptcy law to ensure that our courts will no longer make the sort of rulings that I have described. 
Under our bill, contributions of up to 15% of a person's income, or a higher amount that is consistent with an individual's past practice of giving, will not be considered fraudulent when made during the year prior to filing bankruptcy. Consequently, innocent churches and charities would not have to repay such contributions. 
Secondly, our bill will allow debtors under Chapter 13 repayment plans to make charitable contributions of up to 15% of their income. If bankruptcy law allows for spending on recreational expenses while under a Chapter 13 repayment plan, it should also allow an individual to tithe to their church or make reasonable charitable contributions. 
Mr. President, this is an important bill which will help to restore the Government to its rightful position of benevolent neutrality toward religion. It will provide necessary legislative guidance in an area of bankruptcy law that has gotten off track. I urge my colleagues to join with me in support of this legislation. 
Mr. President, I am honored to support this legislation. Senator Grassley has done an excellent job in identifying an unfair component of the Bankruptcy Act. If an individual pays money to a nightclub, a casino, or to any other recreational activity whatsoever, that person who received the money does not have to give it back to the bankruptcy court. If they had given money to a charitable enterprise or a church, they could be required to give it back. And in chapter 13 where an individual pays out their debts on a regular basis, the courts have denied them the right to give money to charitable institutions as part of their regular payments while at the same time allowing them substantial amounts of money for recreational expenditures. We think that is unfair. We think this bill is a sound way to correct that problem. 
I am honored to work with Senator Grassley and support him in this effort.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am very, very reluctant to rise in opposition to this conference report as it is presently constituted, and in support of the motion to return this legislation to the conference committee. I believe, however, that returning this legislation to the conference committee is the proper and appropriate thing to do. Having said that, I feel that there are some marvelous provisions contained within this bill. For example, agricultural research is very important, and this legislation will strengthen and improve the work being done to advance this field. Similarly, crop insurance will be made sound under this legislation. Both are matters of critical importance to me. 
I do not believe that sending the legislation back to the conference committee to fix this bill's entitlement expansion in the Food Stamp Program will kill this bill or extraordinarily delay it or in any way jeopardize the fundamental reforms that are contained in it. Sending the bill back to conference simply reflects routine business practices in this Senate. 
Under this legislation's expansion of the food stamp entitlement, 250,000 new people will be added to the food stamp rolls. In my last campaign, I talked about the fact that the President had committed to undermining the welfare reform bill that was passed several years ago. These provisions have proven that statement to be true. This bill expands from 5 to 7 years the amount of time noncitizens can draw food stamps. It is an expansion of that policy, and it is the kind of expansion I think is not justified. Will we next year come back for 10 years? Will it be 15 years? What will be the next revision? 
There will always be pressure for us to expand and expand and expand. I think we have to show some integrity and some fortitude on this issue. And so, with great reluctance, I have to say to the distinguished chairman of the committee and the members of that committee that I cannot vote for this bill. I cannot vote for it because I told the people of Alabama I was not coming up here and voting for the undermining of the welfare bill that was passed last time. I cannot justify this expansion of the Food Stamp Program. So if we cannot send it back, I will be forced to vote no. I will hate to have to do that. I think supporting this motion to recommit the bill is the best way to address this issue. 
I thank the Senator from Texas for his leadership and courage in raising this important issue, because we have to get to a point in this country where we can contain our spending tendencies, and if we do not, we will never maintain a balanced budget. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Senator from Nebraska, Senator Roth, and others for introducing an outstanding bill. I know they have worked hard and dealt with a number of difficult issues. This is, I am sure, a good-faith effort to involve the union in the process. But the truth is, as we have had a chance to look at the law, it just won't work. Senator Fred Thompson has made the point eloquently and clearly. His amendment is the only way we can handle this circumstance. We should not, and must not, agree to allow a clear conflict of interest to be waived, according to the Office of Government Ethics. If the Office of Government Ethics were to decide this issue, a waiver would not be granted. It is because such a fundamental conflict exists that we should not expect it to. 
The truth of the matter is that if you sit on the Government Oversight Board and are also a paid union representative, you are being paid by two masters. You can't serve two masters. That is a paid position. It is not a union member serving on the board but a person whose salary is paid by an outside group who is not part of the process. 
I know many people would like to involve an employees union representative in the IRS restructuring effort. I support this idea. There are many ways a union representative could be involved in the process. I have had many friends over the years who have been members of the Treasury Union. I think they do a good job and help to contribute positively to our Nation's Government. But this is a powerful board that sets administrative rules and principles throughout the agency. 
I would suggest that the waiver is not of some ethics rule, it is a waiver of the Criminal Code of the United States of America. At least four sections are implicated. It is quite possible that if this union member were to participate as a board member, he would be in violation of perhaps four different criminal codes--statutes. To ask us in this legislation to just blithely waive these statutes, would be a mistake and unwise and would undermine the Office of Government Ethics ability to effectively manage and uphold ethics in government. 
I was a Federal prosecutor for almost 15 years. I serve on the Senate Ethics Committee. I understand what my colleagues are trying to accomplish. But this waiver is unprecedented, according to the Office of Government Ethics. That means that this has never been done before--that the U.S. Senate, in a legislative act, has never granted exemption to one person from the Criminal Code of the United States. It is something we ought not to do. 
I urge my colleagues in this body to vote yes on this amendment. 
I yield what time is remaining.  
Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.

Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator very much. 
Mr. President, I would like to first congratulate Senator Roth and his committee on their effort to reform the Internal Revenue Service. I think they have made great progress, and the bill is to be greatly praised, is long needed, and I am delighted to see where we are discussing this matter. 
I do, however, feel that it is important to join with Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, who spoke earlier this afternoon on his proposal to not waive applicable conflicts of interest laws with regard to individuals who sit on the IRS Oversight Board. I do not believe this is the appropriate thing to do. I believe we need to deal with this forthrightly. It should not be allowed to happen. 
Mr. President, I spent almost 15 years as a Federal prosecutor. I prosecuted criminal cases on a regular basis. I personally tried judges and public officials for fraud and corruption. My office did many of those cases. It was an insidious thing as it occurred. 
We have crafted over the years a series of laws that are designed in such a way that those laws protect the public from conflicts of interest and other types of unhealthy relationships that would put that person in office in a position in which his total fidelity is to anything other than the government which he represents. That is what we are looking for. Somewhere in the Book of Ecclesiastes the preacher said `A bribe corrupts the mind.' A conflict of interest corrupts the mind. The person is torn. You cannot serve two masters. You can only serve one master. A member of a board of the oversight of the Internal Revenue Service ought to have a clear mind with one motive, and that is to improve and enhance the effectiveness of that institution which is fundamentally necessary. At least under the present Tax Code it is necessary. 
So I believe this is an important matter. I would like to share with the Members of this body the Code sections of the law that would apparently be violated and could potentially clearly be violated by an appointment of the kind suggested here; that is, a member of the Internal Revenue Service Union on the oversight board. 
This is suggested in this fashion: It follows under the rubric of bribery, graft, and conflict of interest in the United States Code. It is title 18 U.S. Code, section 203. It makes it a crime to seek himself or agree to receive any compensation as an agent or attorney for a third party when a person is working as an officer for the Federal Government. 
We are talking about appointing a member to the board representing the Federal Government helping us to develop an effective Internal Revenue Service while at the same time receiving compensation as a union official in an organization that may well have a conflict of interest with the Internal Revenue Service. They are advocates. There is nothing wrong with that. Union members are advocates. Their commission, their heart and soul is committed to getting the maximum return for their members. It is not the same interest as a member of the board should have, which is in the public interest. You can't serve two masters. 
I suggest that is a potential violation of the law if this member were to be on the board. It is not theoretical. We are talking about real conflict. 
Section 205 of title 18 of the Criminal Code makes it a crime for any Federal employee to appear as an agent or attorney on behalf of anyone in a proceedings to which the United States is a party. 
In other words, you can't have a Federal employee of the Government appearing in an action against the Government. Frequently the union is contesting with the Government. So now we have a person on one side of the lawsuit supposedly having his responsibilities solely to the best interest of the public of the United States at the same time being paid to represent his union members who may well be standing against what that interest is. 
Title 18 of section 207 makes it a crime to make certain communications to an official of the Federal Government on behalf of any other person if the communications are made with intent to influence. 
It makes it a crime to make certain communications to an official of Government on behalf of any other person if they are made with the intent to influence. This section is a dangerous section for any board member who is an officer of the union. It was designed really to deal with post-employment communications. But in this instance he would obviously be making communications both ways. 
Title 18, section 208, is the general conflict of interest provision for the United States. It makes it a crime for a Federal employee to participate `personally and substantially' in any way in a matter where he himself, his family, a partner or others have `a financial interest.' 
This individual is paid by the union. It is in his financial interest to do the best bargaining he can, the most money and benefits he can for his union members. Yet he is serving on the offer side, the board, that is supposed to be protecting the public interest. 
I would say, first of all, that I see there is a real danger that this member, if appointed as suggested, would in fact be in violation of any one or perhaps all four of those criminal statutes. If any of these violations are committed--and there are penalties of up to 1 year in jail for violation of them, and if any of them were done willfully the penalties go up to 5 years in jail, and are a felony. What is willful? It is knowingly and with intent to violate the law. I would say, first of all, we have four potential violations of criminal law by this appointment. 
The Finance Committee to its credit recognized there was a problem. Well, they should have. There is a problem. And it is not theoretical. It is very real because the member they want to put on this board has a conflict of interest. 
They say, `Well, let's just change this law. Let's pass as part of our bill a proposal to exempt them from it, and just say it won't apply to this nominee to the board. And that would solve all of our problems.' Well, I wish it were so simple that we could do that. You can call a cat a dog but it is still a cat. You can say there is no conflict of interest but it is still there under these circumstances. That is what the law was passed for. 
I think we need to give some real credit to the Office of Government Ethics. 
Mr. President, I serve on the Senate Ethics Committee. We hear complaints periodically. Many of them are not well founded at all. But we go over them one by one. Staff people analyze them. We read the Code and we see if we have a conflict of interest. If we do, we deal with that. A lot of Senators have been severely damaged because of founded ethics complaints against them over the years. 
But I would just say to you that it is important for this institution to make sure that what we are doing is consistent with the highest possible standards of ethics and law in this nation. 
The Office of Government Ethics took the extraordinary step on May 1st of writing a letter dealing with this special project; this very special thing. This is what they said. 
First of all, they said the criminal conflict of interest laws should not be viewed as impediments to good government. What does that mean? Criminal conflict of interest laws should not be viewed as an impediment to good government. In other words, what they are saying is the criminal ethics laws are for good government. They are not trying to stop good government. They are trying to stop conflicts of interest that lead people in the position that they cannot effectively carry out their duties. 
They go on to say--I am quoting directly--these laws `are there for a purpose and should not be waived for mere convenience.' 
Mr. President, I totally agree. I know it sounds like, well, we just have a problem. This is just a technical thing. We can just pass this law and exempt this board member from it, and that will be the only board member on the Commission exempt from the ethics law, the only one, but we will just do that because, well, it is convenient. We would like him to be on the Board, and we will just waive the ethics law. But you can't do that and expect it to go away. There is a conflict of interest that the law legitimately was set up to prohibit to make sure that we have an uncorrupted individual on that board. A member who does not have influences on them financially or otherwise that would cause them to do acts that are not in the public interest. I believe very sincerely that we have to deal with this issue and that it will not go away. 
We must not do this. It would be a downward slope, a retreat from high standards of ethics--actually, a retreat from basic ethics. This isn't some gray area; this is flatly prohibited by present criminal law for which you can get 5 years in the slammer. U.S. attorneys are prosecuting people who do these kinds of things with these kinds of conflicts. To pass a law to say everybody else has to adhere to them except for one individual because he or she is special is a big mistake. 
I can see how people may have not thought it through. I hope all Members of this body will give it most serious thought. It would be a mistake for us to blithely go along and think this waiver of the ethics law is just a mere technicality and see it as somehow an impediment to good Government. As the Government Ethics Office said, it is not an impediment to good Government; it is good Government. And it is put there for a purpose and should not be waived for mere inconvenience. 
Mr. President, I certainly know that the members of this committee, the Finance Committee, who worked so hard, are determined to reform the Internal Revenue Service. I know they want to do what they can. I know they want the influence of the IRS's members who have insight into how this enterprise ought to be operated. They have some good insight, and they have made some good, constructive comments to this legislation. But there are other ways, as the Government Ethics Office suggested, to allow them to have input. There are other ways to allow them to be able to shape any kind of rules, regulations or reforms that are made. There are ways to do this without giving up the fundamental principle that a man or woman can only serve one master, not two, and should not be holding public office with a clear conflict of interest. 
I thank the Chair. I urge my fellow Senators to vote against this proposal.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, with regard to my raising the question of bribery as being the same in principle as what we are discussing here, I would like to make a statement. Maybe I was misunderstood. I would like to just say that, fundamentally, we are waiving the applicability of sections 203, 205, 207 of the United States Criminal Code. The bribery section is section 201 1. 
As a matter of principle, I just wanted to make the point that what we are being asked to do here is to waive the criminal law of the United States with regard to this particular individual, and the Ethics Committee has said it is unprecedented. That means this body has never done this in its entire history. This is a legal mistake. I am not here concerning myself with the individuals who make up the board. I am here because it was called to my attention that this problem existed. I am a former Federal prosecutor and a member of the Ethics Committee of this body, and I believe this is a legal mistake--a legal mistake we should not make. That is why I am making my comments now. I am very sorry to interrupt the Senator from New York, but it was important to clarify the record, I thought.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to begin my remarks this afternoon by recognizing and applauding the efforts of my colleague, the distinguished Senior Senator from Alabama, for all of his efforts in working to ensure that the Supplemental Appropriations bill produced by the conference committee includes badly needed relief for our home state of Alabama in the wake of the terrible natural disasters that have occurred over the past month. Senator Shelby has worked tirelessly to see to it that this document includes assistance for those communities that have suffered so much in the wake of the recent spate of floods and tornadoes that have so severely struck our state. In his position as a member of the Appropriations committee and as a conference to this bill, Senator Shelby has been a true champion for the interests of his constituents. It is fitting and appropriate that his work be generously acknowledged. 
I would also like to take this opportunity to recognize the efforts of the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and to thank him for all of the assistance he offered during the conference negotiations over the disaster provisions in the bill. It is very likely that without the support and the leadership provided by Senator Stevens, we would have been unable to secure funding for the town of Elba, Alabama. Elba has recently been devastated by flooding caused after rain swollen rivers forced the town's levees to give way. Thanks to Senator Stevens' generous support, this bill contain $5 million in funding to help repair Elba's levee. I can not begin to express how much Senator Stevens' willingness to go to bat for this small Alabama town means to this Senator. 
Finally, I want to thank my good friend Senator Bond of Missouri for your willingness to work with Senator Shelby and myself to ensure that the increased money that this bill provides for Community Development Block Grants will get to those who are direly in need of them. The supplemental bill contains $130 million in Community Development Block Grant funding. This funding, which is important to communities seeking to recover from devastating events, like those events my state has recently suffered through, needs safeguards to ensure that it ultimately reaches those areas where it is most desperately needed. It is imperative that the Department of Housing and Urban Development makes these grants really available to areas within Alabama that have suffered from these natural disasters. Over the last few weeks my office has been receiving requests from communities throughout the state, communities such as Birmingham and Elba, Geneva, Brewton and East Brewton, all asking that these funds be made available to them so that they might begin the difficult task of rebuilding. Senator Bond, your willingness to help work to ensure that this funding gets back to the devastated areas within my state is very generous, and I appreciate your commitment greatly. 
Mr. President, this supplemental bill goes a long way toward beginning the healing process for the citizens in my state that have recently had to shoulder such a heavy burden. I have personally visited the sites in my state that were the hardest hit, and I can assure you that the scope of the devastation and the scope of the personal, human toll these disasters have taken is beyond my ability to adequately convey. This supplemental disaster bill is a good bill, a solid bill and I look forward to securing its passage so that the relief provided within can be begin to get back to the people of Alabama.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business until the hour of 12 noon. At noon, the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider the treaty on NATO enlargement. It is hoped that Senators will come to the floor to debate the treaty and to offer amendments. As a reminder to all Members, a rollcall vote will occur this evening at 6 p.m. on the confirmation of the nomination of Scott Fleming to be Assistant Secretary for Legislation and Congressional Affairs at the Department of Education. 
As a further reminder, a rollcall vote will occur on the State Department reorganization conference report at 2:25 p.m. on Tuesday, April 28. This will not necessarily be the first vote of Tuesday's session, and the Members will be notified of an updated voting schedule. 
Also during this week's session, the Senate could be asked to consider the supplemental appropriations conference report, if available from the conference committee. 
In addition, the Senate could be asked to consider, possibly under a brief time agreement, the Work-Force Development Act. A couple of amendments are expected to be offered, and, as always, Members will be notified as the schedule becomes clearer later in the week. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished Senator from Georgia in a brief colloquy to discuss extending to all private college prepaid tuition plans the same tax treatment that public college prepaid plans receive. 
Currently, 16 states, including my home state of Alabama and the distinguished Senator's state of Georgia, have established prepaid tuition plans that allow resident families to lock in today's tuition rates for tomorrow's education. Income taxes on the accrued interest in these accounts are deferred until the account is cashed in to pay for college and these taxes are paid at the student's tax rate, which is typically lower than that of their parents. 
Mr. President, as valuable as these plans are, however, there are drawbacks. Specifically, the plans typically cover only in-state public universities. Therefore, if a student decides to attend an out-of-state school or even an in-state private school, then the savings accrued in the prepaid plan are less valuable because states typically redeem only the principal and some nominal interest to account for inflation. 
Mr. President, as my good friend from Georgia would agree, this places private schools at a distinct disadvantage vis-a-vis their public counterparts.

Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the Senator's comments. I would like to ask the Senator from Georgia further, to clarify for me, that under this legislation, H.R. 2646, the A+ Education Savings Account Bill, is there no provision in the bill to place private college prepaid tuition plans on equal ground with public prepaid tuition plans?

Mr. SESSIONS. I would just like to convey to my good friend from Georgia, that I was prepared to offer an amendment to his bill that would remedy this inequity, by providing private schools the same fair and equitable treatment as is currently provided to public institutions of higher learning. 
However, it is my understanding that the Senator from Georgia plans to work with the Senate Finance Committee Chairman, Senator Roth, and our other colleagues during the conference on this bill to fix this disparity and provide a level playing field for private universities and colleges. Is this a correct characterization of the Senator from Georgia's intention to do so?

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise this evening to congratulate the United States Army Reserve on its 90th anniversary and to recognize the contributions of my good friend Strom Thurmond who served in the Reserves for 36 years. 
Many of you know Senator Thurmond's distinguished record in war and in peace and the contributions he has made to this institution. He, like the thousands of soldiers in the Army Reserves today, is an example of the best in America. 
Some years ago, I was a Judge Advocate General (JAG) officer in the United States Army Reserve. I served for thirteen years in one of our 82 Alabama Reserve units and organizations, located in one of 19 cities and in 24 Reserve Centers spread across Alabama. Today, Alabama is home to approximately 7000 Army Reservists representing nearly 3 1/2 % of the total Army Reserve Force. I am particularly proud of the fact that we have the 81st Regional Support Command and the 87th Division (Exercise) headquartered in Birmingham, a unit which commands and controls soldiers in a number of surrounding southern states. 
Like any major element of the Armed Forces, America's Army Reserve has a great history. Let me share just a small portion of that history: Created by statute on April 23, 1908, first of the Federal reserve forces created by Congress, a trained and ready force of citizen soldiers bringing relevant skills into the military, an integral part of today's global power projection strategy, a force which deploy's 20,000 reservists to 50 countries annually, a force which has mobilized and deployed 70% of the reserve forces to Bosnia for Operation Joint Guard, a force which contributed over 90,000 soldiers to Operation Desert Storm, one of which was my Chief of Staff, Armand DeKeyser, and a force which is found in all 50 states, U.S. territories, in Europe and in the Pacific region. 
Mr. President, we have much to be proud of in America tonight. We can add to that list the United States Army Reserve whose birthday we quietly celebrate. Happy Birthday to the men and women of the Army Reserves. Men and women who quietly man the ramparts of freedom. You are always there when America needs you. For this act of selfless devotion, we as a nation ought to be truly grateful.

Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to offer some comments in support of this sense-of-the-Senate resolution regarding the elimination of the marriage penalty. Marriage is an institution to be venerated, and our public policy should affirm marriage and we should have laws that treat married couples on an equal basis with those that are not married. That is the fundamental principle of fairness. 
The fact is that under our current laws, married couples suffer a financial penalty when it comes to taxation. In fact, married couples pay often substantially more tax than they would pay if they were not married. 
For example, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office found that 42 percent of married couples face a marriage penalty under the current tax system. The Congressional Budget Office also found that the average tax penalty amounts to $1,380 per year. That is a $100-a-month tax penalty on people who choose to be married rather than those who choose not to marry. As a result of that, we are taking more of their money to in fact subsidize people who are not married who receive those benefits. 
I think some people have suggested this is in fact a realistic cause of people not to marry. For example, in 1970, just .5 percent of the couples in the United States were not married. By 1996, that number had risen to 7.2 percent. 
So, Madam President, I would say that this is a very important debate. And I will not belabor the subject. This is a matter that has been the subject of much debate, with much intellectual and financial study, and the conclusion of these numbers is plain and obvious. Under our current tax system, married couples are being subjected to an unfair financial penalty. This is a matter that this Senate must address. 
It may be a bit late this year to make those changes. I wish it could have been done this year, but it is a change we are going to have to make. We are going to have to eliminate the circumstance in which a married couple is penalized for being married. It is not just, it is not fair, not appropriate, and it is unbecoming of the laws of the United States. 
So, Madam President, I support this resolution and yield the floor. 
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am very proud of the excellent comments that have been made by a group of distinguished Senators today regarding this amendment. It is not an itty-bitty matter; it is a very serious matter. And it reflects a reevaluation by this body of the priorities we are placing on helping families raise children. It reflects a change in what we have been doing, because we have been, in fact, subsidizing one form of child care, a form of child care used by only a few American families, and have been taxing all the other American families to support that one form, which is institutional public day care essentially. And I do not believe that is good policy. 
As Senator Coats mentioned earlier, mothers want, if they are given a choice, to be at home with their children, for the most part, during their formative years. We know that. Scientists and people also, who have studied this, have concluded that it is better for them to be at home, when they can. So we need to subsidize and support equally all forms of child care, if we do so, and we ought to do it in a way that allows parents the choices that they prefer. 
All right. Let me just mention, first, the background on which we are operating. This is from the census report, the last census report. This is titled: `Patterns of Child Rearing for Children Under Age 5.' 
The mother is not employed; the care is by the mother in the home--almost 50 percent; 48 percent of mothers with children under age 5 raise them in their home. The President's proposal in current law provides no benefit for those families--zero--even though they may be giving up substantial income because the mother has been in the workplace before and chooses to stay at home because they believe, after prayerful thought and concern in the family, that this is the best way to raise their children. We ought to affirm that. We ought not to penalize that by taxing the decision to support this decision. 
The mother is employed, and the child is in a group day care preschool program--16 percent. That is what we have been subsidizing. That is the group we have been subsidizing. You 
have the mother who is working, but the child is taken care of by a nonrelative, somebody in the home. Maybe it is a nanny who comes and stays in their home and takes care of the children because parents feel, where possible, they would like their children to grow up in their home and have the stability and the confidence that comes from that kind of environment. And 11 percent do that. They get no benefits under this proposal. 
The mother is employed and the care is by a relative, an aunt, a mother, a grandmother or sister. They are taken care of. That is 13 percent. They have no benefit under the current law or the President's proposal. 
The mother is employed--employed--and the care is by the father or the mother--12 percent. 
For all of these, only this group gets compensation. That is not good policy. This Congress, this Government in America ought to adopt public policy that in fact encourages our highest and best choices. We ought to do that, and I think we can do that. 
Now, to point out the unfairness of it, look at this chart. This is where a husband and a wife are employed, both of them employed, one may not be full time. Their average income is $57,000. 
Where there is a dual-earner family, both husband and wife work and are employed full time, their average salary is $64,000. 
But where you have a single earner, a husband is employed and the wife not employed, and the husband may not be employed full time--and many do not have full-time jobs; they cannot get them--their average income is $38,000. 
Where the husband is employed and the wife is not employed, the husband is employed full time, the average income is $42,000. 
You see the difference. We are subsidizing this choice. We are not subsidizing this choice where parents stay at home. That is not good public policy, and I think we need to change it. 
I congratulate Senator Smith, who just spoke, because he is asking us to consider what we are going to do to eliminate this imbalance. I think he has thought the matter through, and he has come up with some conclusions that he has put in legislation to which this body needs to give serious thought. 
Of course, this resolution basically does not suggest a solution to the problem. It just says we are going to set a policy here to change the way we have been doing business. I think we ought to affirm parents who, after prayerful, careful, serious thought among themselves, conclude that it is best for their children to forgo a second income and stay at home. I think we ought to affirm that with public policy. 
Finally--I know my time is about up--this is a matter of significance. I have been delighted to see Senators calling our office the last 2 days wanting to sign on as cosponsors of this amendment. While I was on the floor yesterday, three Senators asked me could they join as a cosponsor of this amendment. It has broad bipartisan support--Democrats and Republicans. I hope we have a unanimous vote on this issue. 
But what I want to say is this: Do not sign on as a cosponsor, do not vote for this resolution, if you are not prepared to back it up by votes on the floor when we start 
setting tax policy and we start appropriating funds. If you are not prepared to support this philosophy, do not sign on because that is what erodes public confidence in America. 
We talk a good game, but when the chips are down we often find reasons not to follow through on our commitments. I believe this is good public policy. I believe it is a resolution that sets the tone for this Congress. The House has passed a similar resolution, 419-0. I think that says something. I believe this body will be virtually unanimous, if not unanimous. After that, we are going to have to talk with Senator Smith and other Members of this body to figure out a way to implement that policy. 
It is a challenge to all the committees that are going to be dealing with these issues. They are going to have to reflect this view. I hope that they will. If they don't, we need to stand up and say we are not going to pass or support legislation that is not consistent with this resolution that treats all parents equally. 
Mr. President, thank you for the time. 
I thank my fellow Senators for their support for this resolution. I believe it is a great step forward in improving child care and development in America. Thank you, and I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. With regard to the amendment we have been discussing this morning and the fact that families are choosing to give up a second income in order that they may have a parent stay home with their children in the early, formative years, I want to share a few thoughts with this body. 
As I traveled my State last month and I discussed this issue, time and time again families would come up to me after my remarks and say, `Thank you for saying that. We made that exact decision in our family. My wife had worked, and she decided she wanted to stay home with the children while they are young. It costs us a lot of money. We don't regret it. We are glad you have considered us raising children and you believe we ought to have a fair shake in that regard.' 
My wife taught school for 4 years. When we had children, we made a decision she would cease teaching. I was able to have a decent income and take care of the family. We were not rich, but that was a decision we made, and we were very glad we did that. In fact, we probably would not have qualified for benefits under this program because this would be a program favoring lower income people. 
Additionally, I wanted to share some numbers with the Members of this body. According to the most recently available data from the Census Bureau, a dramatically different picture is showing up than the one many would project. The facts show that although day care use did increase rapidly through the 1980's, the increase in the use of day care has come to a halt. The percentage of children under age 5 with employed mothers nearly doubled from the mid-1970's through 1998, but in subsequent years maternal employment remained fixed. In 1994, the last year recorded by the Census, the percentage of 
preschool children with employed mothers was still 52 percent, the same as it was in 1998. 
My personal observations of the people I associate with, that my children have gone to school with, are that people are questioning the mentality that it is always best for both parents to work, and they are making different decisions. It is time for us to have Government policy that reflects that. I am very pleased with the bipartisan support this amendment is receiving. I think it reflects a serious reevaluation on behalf of this Congress on how to spend money in aid of children. I solicit the support of all Senators for this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think the issue before the Senate as we debate the budget resolution is how to set our priorities as a nation. Where do we want to spend our resources? Are we expending our resources in ways that strengthen our American Republic and the people who make it up? Are we using resources in a way that will strengthen families? And are we using resources in a way that undermine families or at least undermine the freedom of families to make choices they believe are important in their lives? 
I have just introduced an amendment which expresses the sense of Congress that the Federal Government should acknowledge the importance of stay-at-home parents and should not discriminate against families who decide to forego a second income in order for a mother or father to be at home with their children. The resolution is nearly identical to the House resolution sponsored by Representative Bill Goodling, chairman of the Education and Work Force Committee, which passed the House of Representatives on February 11 by a vote of 409-0. 
President Clinton has proposed spending $21.7 billion over the next 5 years in new Federal child care programs. Although the money the President is proposing to spend will benefit parents who use business and institutional day-care providers, it will not assist the single largest provider of child care in this country, at-home parents. The President's plan does provide us with an opportunity to think seriously about this subject and see if we can provide a better way to help parents raise their children. 
I believe this resolution is critically important. It provides this body with an opportunity to discuss and debate our Nation's focus on the issue of child care: Should our Government continue to promote and fund child care programs designed to give middle-class parents who hire others to care for their children tax cuts or other benefits while at the same time denying relief to parents who make sacrifices so that one parent can remain at home to care for their young children? 
It seems unfair to me that we tax families who sacrifice outside earnings to ensure that one parent is home with their children while subsidizing families in which both parents work. In fact, the statistics show that when both parents work, they have a higher income. So in fact we are taxing those with a lower income to subsidize decisions of those with a higher income. 
Studies show that most parents would prefer to work less and spend more time with their children if they could afford to do so. By subsidizing only nonparental care for our children, our Government is pushing many families in a direction they do not wish to go. More parents are staying home. They are choosing to forgo extra income. These private, personal, and family decisions are being reached on long-term moral, religious, and educational considerations. Good decisions by parents in these matters benefit our Nation, and they should be affirmed by governmental policy, not undermined by governmental policy. 
As I traveled my State over the last recess and talked with people raising this issue, people would come up to me after meetings, and they would say: `Jeff, we agree with you. We both used to work. Now only one of us works. We prayed about it and we know we are going to have to get by with less money. But we decided this is the best for our family.' 
I don't denigrate in any way families who choose for both parents to work. I don't ask that we diminish support for the single parent who works. I just say, Mr. President, it is time for this body to join the House and to send a message to America and a statement to the President and to the rest of this Government that we believe that those parents who stay at home to raise their children ought to be affirmed also. They also should receive benefits, and they ought not to be the chumps in this process. Because they are giving of themselves with great sacrifice to raise the next generation of Americans who will lead this country. 
Make no mistake our economy is in great shape. This Nation is strong and vibrant economically. The one threat I see that could undermine that strength is for us to undermine the values that we pass on to our children. That our work ethic is reduced, that our moral discipline and integrity as a people is undermined. These qualities are strengthened when families can spend those formative years with their children in a close relationship. Psychiatrists and psychologists refer to it as `bonding.' During those first years, it is important for a parent and a child to bond in order for that child to develop confidence and a sense of self-worth that can only be gained in many instances from that relationship with their parents. We have many difficult societal problems, and none are more important than developing properly the next generation of leaders. 
I just say this, Mr. President: Our Nation can never rise higher than the individual quality of the citizens who make it up. And what are those qualities that make us a great people? It goes beyond mere education. It goes beyond how much money we make or how smart we are. It really depends on a willingness to cooperate, to work together, on whether or not we have high ideals, whether or not our children are raised with hope and a vision for progress, whether or not they have integrity, good discipline, a work ethic that will allow us to be competitive in the world. We need to strengthen our families as they endeavor to raise the next generation of leaders. 
Now, Mr. President, last year, we passed a budget that wonderfully provided a $500 per child tax credit to families in this country--one of the finest steps we have taken in many years to actually help families. This allows them to keep money that they could spend as they wish. A family of three could, in effect, have $120 extra each month, tax free, not taxable, a tax credit that they could use for their children. This extra money may mean buying shoes, textbooks, or the extra money it takes to go to a movie or on a school trip. These families are able to make their own decisions about spending. That was a wonderful step in the right direction. It did not discriminate against those families 
who work or those who choose not to have both parents work. It was an equal, across-the-board benefit, something that was good. I think now we need to make this additional statement by this body: That we expect in the future to treat all parents equally. The amendment makes a number of points, Mr. President, and I will share those briefly. I don't know what my time is, but I don't want to go over.

Mr. SESSIONS. All right. Mr. President, the resolution notes a number of things. It notes that, whereas `a recent National Institute for Child Health and Development study found that the greatest factor in the development of a young child is `what is happening at home and in families.' 
That is something all of us have known instinctively, and we believe that our public policy has not affirmed that effectively. Our resolution would move us in the right direction. 
It goes on to note: Whereas, 
as a child's interaction with his or her parents has the most significant impact on the development of the child, any Federal child care policy should enable and encourage parents to spend more time with their children; 
nearly 1/2 of preschool children have at-home mothers and only 1/3 of preschool children have mothers who are employed full time; 
a large number of low- and middle-income families sacrifice a second full-time income [by their own decision] so that a mother may be at home with her child; 
the average income of 2-parent families with a single income is $20,000 less than the average income of 2-parent families with 2 incomes; 
only 30 percent of preschool children are in families with paid child care and the remaining 70 percent of preschool children are in families that do not pay for child care, many of which are low- to middle-income families struggling to provide child care at home; 
child care proposals should not provide financial assistance solely to the 30 percent of families that pay for child care and should not discriminate against families in which children are cared for by an at-home parent; 
any congressional proposal that increases child care funding should provide financial relief to families that sacrifice an entire income in order that a mother or father may be at home with a young child. 
Therefore, it be resolved that the Congress of this United States recognizes that: 
many families in the United States make enormous sacrifices to forego a second income in order to have a parent care for a child at home; 
there should be no bias against at-home parents; 
parents choose many different forms of child care to meet the needs of their families, such as child care provided by an at-home parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, parent, neighbor, nanny, preschool, or child care center; 
any quality child care proposal should include, as a key component, financial relief for those families where there is an at-home parent; and 
mothers and fathers who have chosen and continue to choose to be at home [with their children] should be applauded for their efforts. 
Mr. President, the purpose of this resolution is not to suggest that we do not need more relief for families. We need relief for families where both parents work or where the only parent works. They need relief. But we ought not to discriminate and be biased against those parents who sacrificially choose to spend the time they believe is necessary for their child to develop emotionally, morally, religiously, and ethically. 
That is a good thing for America. It is a good thing when 
parents can and are willing to spend their time with their children. Public policy should affirm that choice, just as it affirms other choices that parents make or feel compelled to make. I would suggest that this is a matter we ought to support aggressively. I believe it is a matter that will help set the tone for our budget process as we go forward. It will send a signal to those on the committees who will be considering legislation to see what we can do to strengthen our ability to care for children, and I believe this resolution to be quite significant and representative of a marked change in the direction that we have followed before. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dodd be added as a cosponsor to this amendment. He called our office before I had a chance to add his name to the sponsors of this resolution, among whom are Senators Lott, Shelby, Enzi, Faircloth, Helms, Nickles, Grams, McConnell, Lieberman, Brownback, Inhofe, Craig, Hutchison, Frist, Coverdell, Ashcroft, Abraham, Mack, DeWine, and Coats, and others are being added as we go along.

Roy's untimely death on February 11, 1998, at age 49, cut short his career and deprived his wife Anita, his son Matthew, and his daughter Gabrielle of a loving and devoted husband and father. 
Roy was the friend of thousands, and I was pleased to call him a personal friend. In addition, I knew him well as a professional prosecutor with whom I worked on a regular basis during the years I served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama. 
Service to his country as a Marine captain demonstrated his love for country, but it also caused him to develop, during his service time, a form of hepatitis that damaged his liver and which ultimately resulted in his having to undergo a liver transplant operation. 
There were high hopes for the success of the operation. He seemed to be doing well when there occurred a sudden turn for the worst, and Roy was gone. 
After nearly 18 years of service to Bibb, Dallas, Hale, Perry and Wilcox Counties, Roy had made plans to retire from his post as district attorney and to commence the practice of law with his brother Robert W. `Robin' Johnson II in his beloved hometown of Marion. And they also have law offices in Birmingham and Washington, DC. 
I am pleased today, Mr. President, that his brother Robin is here today to hear these remarks about my good friend, his brother, Roy Johnson. As his long-time chief assistant, Ed Greene said, `Everything seemed so bright for him.' His death was truly a shock to me and to many. 
Roy had great pride in his circuit and the people in it. He loved them deeply. He worked tirelessly on their behalf. The fourth judicial circuit is located in the heart of Alabama's Black Belt region--a beautiful area of the State in which the people know not only their neighbors, but they know the grandparents and grandchildren of their neighbors. 
E.T. Rolison, Jr., supervisory U.S. attorney in Mobile, AL, noted, `Roy did as much for law enforcement coordination as anyone I have [ever] seen in my 25 years with this office.' And this was a high compliment from Mr. Rolison, who served for many years in the U.S. attorney's office and worked hard to further coordination between local, State and Federal law enforcement agencies. 
Mr. Barron Lankster, himself a district attorney in nearby Marengo County, and an African American, noted that he had commenced his career in Roy's office. Mr. Lankster said, `He fully integrated his office when he took over and treated everyone fairly and equitably.' 
A graduate of Tulane University and the University of Alabama School of Law, Roy was prepared intellectually and professionally for the broad demands of his work. He loved history and he loved the wonderful Antebellum home in which he lived. The home was located right on the parade grounds at Marion Military Institute, an excellent military school. MMI, along with Judson College, have played a key role in making the town of Marion an extraordinary academic and intellectual community. 
Roy's love and support for Marion Military Institute was deep and longstanding. Certainly, his career in the U.S. Marines helped shape his belief that we must have a strong national defense. I remember with delight the occasion when Roy's fellow marine, Col. Ollie North, was under great attack in Washington. This was before Colonel North's rebuttal that turned the tables on his accusers a bit. But Roy spoke out for him then. He served with him in the Marines, and he spoke up at a time of great unpopularity. I congratulated him later when it turned out that Colonel North had turned the tables a bit on that circumstance. He stood by his friends. He was indeed forever true. 
During the mid-1980s, we worked together on the prosecution of three individuals for voter fraud in Perry County. The prosecution caused a great deal of furor locally and nationally. During that time I came to appreciate Roy's cool head, his innate decency, his legal skills, and his character. 
Despite political pressure, this marine never wavered. He stood firm for what he believed to be right, and did so in a fair and just manner. The bond which we developed in that case was never broken. 
There is much more that can be said about this educated, caring, fair, strong, loyal and kind son of the South. Certainly he was big in stature and big in spirit. 
I am confident that if we were able to accomplish a fully accurate analysis of the many contributions he made to his judicial circuit and his region, the most significant would be his skill and determination during a period of rapid social change. He helped provide equal justice to all and conducted himself and his office in a manner that reflected fairness to everyone. 
His leadership and his strength of character provided a framework which allowed for the development of harmonious relations between the races. Sometimes there would be periods of good feeling and sometimes there would be periods of tension and conflict. But whatever the situation, Roy stood firm and strong for justice and contributed mightily to the historic changes that have taken place in this region. 
Roy loved Marion. He loved the Black Belt and the people who lived there and the people he represented. I know he is pleased that his strong and effective chief deputy, Ed Greene, in whom he placed such trust over the years, has been appointed to complete his term. I have the greatest respect for Ed's ability and have enjoyed working with him over the years, and I compliment Governor Fob James for his wise appointment. 
I have been honored to know Roy Johnson. He was a superior public servant, an outstanding prosecutor. And I thank the Chair for allowing me to place these remarks upon the record and to express my sincerest sympathy to his fine family for the great loss they have suffered. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, a few comments on another subject.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, another Senator in this body made some very strong criticisms of the special prosecutor, Mr. Ken Starr. Judge Starr was appointed to that office some time ago. In recent months he was asked to continue his investigation into matters involving the Monica Lewinsky situation and to the possible obstruction of justice. 
It happened this way: Mr. Starr presented information to the Attorney General of the United States, Janet Reno. He told her about the circumstances and what he knew and the evidence that had been obtained. She agreed that a special prosecutor should be appointed. They then went to a three-judge court, and the three-judge court, as the law requires--Federal judges, all with lifetime appointments, above politics--those three judges commissioned Kenneth Starr to be an investigator of this circumstance. He, therefore, has been directed by a court. He accepted that responsibility. As a result of that, he has a duty to perform. 
Now, Mr. President, I know that the Chair has served, himself, as attorney general of the great State of Missouri. I have served as attorney general of Alabama. And I served almost 12 years as a Federal prosecutor, a U.S. attorney. I have prosecuted a great many public corruption cases, fraud cases, white-collar-crime cases. They are not easy. The people who have committed those kinds of crimes do not desire that they should be caught. They do not make it easy that they should be apprehended. It would be their preference to be able to get away with whatever they may have committed. 
Now, many say Ken Starr as special prosecutor has a duty or responsibility to get someone. I assure you, that is not true. I assure you, with all confidence, because I have served in the Department of Justice with Mr. Starr and I know his reputation, that he has absolutely no desire to get anyone. But he has been commissioned, he has been given a mandate, he has been given a responsibility to find out what the facts are. Sometimes that requires issuing subpoenas. If you do not get the facts, you have not conducted an investigation, and you have violated your responsibility and the requirements that have been given to you. If you do not interview the secretary sitting outside the office about what went on there, what kind of investigation is that? What kind of investigation is that? That would be like no investigation at all. 
What about this circumstance--some say that his attempt to question the mother of Miss Lewinsky is somehow wrong. Congress makes the laws of the United States. I was a prosecutor for nearly 17 years. I know how the law is written. There is no grant of immunity or protection for a mother for confidentiality of 
communications under these circumstances. It is not there. 
If the Senator from Vermont or other Senators in this body want to change the Federal law to create a protection for that, let them introduce the legislation. Let us have it out right here. Let us discuss it. But that is not the law. 
So we have, in the special prosecutor, an individual who is supposed to gather the evidence he can legally gather. Presumably he believes the mother of this young lady has information that she ought to give, and he has every right to ask for it. In fact, to fail to ask for that information would be a failure of the responsibility that has been given to him by the courts and laws of this country. 
There are a lot of other things being said, such as why would you dig into his books? I saw a report recently about an individual who was charged with poisoning someone. This is not hypothetical but it is an example, I think, of why subpoenas sometimes are issued. Under the subpoena the authorities discovered and uncovered a book the individual had describing how to make poisons. 
I had an occasion to personally prosecute, a number of years ago, a doctor. He was the subject of two national television movies and a book. In the course of that, we discovered a book that he had on deadly poisons and how to commit murder. It was relevant to our case, and it was introduced in the case. 
So I do not know what it is that Mr. Starr issued that subpoena for. He cannot defend himself. He cannot run in here and say, `Oh, Senator, let me tell you why we did that. Your remarks are unkind. They're unfair. I had a specific reason for issuing that subpoena. Let me tell you what it is.' He can't do that. So he is a victim of these kinds of complaints by those who want to undermine his ability to do the job he has been commissioned to do. 
I am really troubled by this. I am very, very troubled that we in this body, and, in fact, the President of the United States of America and his staff, are systematically trying to intimidate and undermine the legal and moral authority of the commissioned special prosecutor. To my knowledge, that has never happened before in our country. 
If there is nothing to hide, why not let him do his job? They say, why doesn't he finish? If they would be more forthcoming, he would have already been finished. How can you finish when people refuse to give testimony? They claim executive privilege and therefore make you go to court to obtain court orders, which takes months to get, to argue over these issues. 
The President committed early on that he would be forthcoming, that he would give all the evidence, and the truth should come out. But, as so often occurs with this President, we are finding that not to be the case. 
Mr. President, I will just conclude and say that, if nothing else, we need to respect the rule of law. That great hymn, `Our Liberty is in Law,' that is the American form of government. We respect the rule of law. We do not use political power or other efforts to undermine that rule. We trust our system to work. We have multiple opportunities to appeal if the system goes awry at any stage. Ultimately we have to accept that. And if we respect it and give ourselves to it with integrity and ability, I think we can get just results. 
We may not ever know the full truth in this circumstance. That is not Mr. Starr's responsibility. Mr. Starr's responsibility is to get as much truth as he can get. He can find the truth within the rule of law. So it is really discouraging to me to see when a subpoena is issued to any institution for a specific piece of information, it is to be compared to some fishing expedition. Because I assure you, that is not true. I assure you that that subpoena would not be issued unless there was a sound basis for it.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this President has not defended his actions on the basis that this is a private matter; `it is something between me and my wife and consenting adults,' and that sort of thing. 
He has denied these allegations flat out, and he has placed in dispute, under oath, contradicting statements. 
So now we have a mess in this country, and it is a direct result of the actions of the President of the United States. He has gotten himself in a situation in which his statements directly contradicts that of other people's statements, under oath. That is a matter that is not going away lightly. 
I will say what is offensive to me and is of concern to me: He has embroiled the Office of the Presidency in this matter. He has used the power, the staff, the people of his office to defend himself and to entwine them into this affair. He has, therefore, during the course of this activity, in my opinion as one Senator--and I had no intention to speak this morning on this subject, but it has been troubling me for a long time--I think he has dishonored the Presidency in that regard. He has not handled it properly. I wish it were not so. It is not good for this country. It is not the right thing for us to have to be going through today. 
There is no one who has any responsibility for it but the President. If he thinks he can go around and claim that is the fault of the person who has been commissioned by an objective Federal court to investigate his activities instead of the President--that is what he is suggesting--then that is not accurate. I am very troubled by this matter. 
I think what we need to do is simply to allow the special prosecutor to do his job. He may well find there is evidence of wrongdoing. He may find there is no evidence of wrongdoing. He may find there might be some evidence of wrongdoing but there is insufficient proof to bring charges. I don't know what will happen. I hope we get it over with. I hope the President will cooperate. But I think we need to be respectful of the legal process in this country and not attempt to undermine it, because we don't undermine a part of it without undermining all of it. 
Every day, by a prosecutor in America, young people are being tried for drug offenses and other offenses, and they have to accept the workings of that system. Police accept the workings of that system. Mothers and fathers accept the workings of that system when their children are charged with a crime. It is a painful, horrible, difficult time for all, but we have to respect the rule of law. I am very, very troubled by those who, in my opinion, make comments and suggestions to try to attack an investigation and, in effect, undermine the law by political power and political influence. This should not happen. I think it is a matter we need to talk more about in this body. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will immediately proceed to executive session for a rollcall vote on the confirmation of the nomination of M. Margaret McKeown to be United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit. 
Following that vote, the Senate is expected to begin consideration of the budget resolution. Under the statute, there are 50 hours of debate on the resolution. However, I hope we could yield a good portion of that time back. On Monday, if an adequate amount of time is yielded back on the budget resolution, then it would be the leader's intention to postpone any votes on Monday until Tuesday. As always, all Senators will be notified when that is worked out. 
Next week, in addition to completing action on the budget resolution and the Coverdell A+ education bill, we may also take up and finish the emergency supplemental appropriations conference report, if available. Colleagues are warned in advance that next week will be a hectic week as we work toward the Easter recess. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for yielding me time. 
I rise to endorse the comments made by Senator Enzi. In 1996, I was the attorney general of the State of Alabama, and I was one of the 22 attorneys general that signed the letter that Senator Enzi mentioned earlier. This letter, which was initiated under the leadership of Attorney General Bob Butterworth of Florida, was a 13-page letter discussing the legal reasons why the attorneys general believe that the Secretary of the Interior ought not to be setting the gambling policies for our various States. Why did we take this position? Because our review of applicable law revealed to us that there was no legal basis for the Secretary of Interior to act this way, especially in light of the important Seminole Tribe v. Florida case decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1996. 
The issue of tribal gaming is a matter of extreme importance. My home state of Alabama has consistently rejected casino gambling in the State. We have one small Indian tribe that owns several pieces of property in the State. If that tribe were able to go to the Secretary of the Interior and obtain approval to build casinos on their property, we would soon have three major, active casinos in the State of Alabama bringing with them all the problems that are associated with casino gaming. The tribal reservations are extremely small, however they would impact the community to a great degree. 
As the Senator from Wyoming so eloquently said, it is the States who will bear the burdens and the responsibility and the consequences of having the Secretary of Interior impose gambling on them. The Secretary of the Interior should not be imposing tribal gaming decisions on the States. In the past, the Secretary had indicated that he would prefer not to intervene in these matters. If that is so, then he certainly should not oppose this legislation that would prohibit his ability to unilaterally decide state gaming issues. I think this issue is a matter that we need to treat very significantly. 
Make no mistake about it, having been involved in the process, I learned something that is quite important, and that is just how much money is involved. When the Secretary of the Interior, one man, can look at one group of claimants, or favor one Indian tribe over another, and he can then select a group and say, `You can get a gambling casino,' he may have made that group hundreds of millions of dollars--I do not mean one million, I mean hundreds of millions of dollars--and another tribe may get nothing from that. The Secretary's ability to make one decision which makes certain groups rich and certain groups poor is one reason why the committee testimony concerning Mr. Babbitt's dealing with contributions tied to Indian gaming was such a dramatic, and unseemly, event. 
So I think that is not the way public policy and gambling policy ought to be set in America. It ought to be set on a rational basis by the people of the State who would have to live with that activity. I think Senator Enzi is correct. Similar legislation passed once before, I think, with consent. I hope that 
it will again. I believe we need to make clear that the people of our States will be the ones to decide whether or not gambling occurs. 
I would just like to share a quote from an editorial appearing in the Montgomery Advertiser last year. In this editorial the Advertiser, the newspaper of the capital of Alabama, says:  
Regardless of whether one favors or opposes legalized gambling on Indian lands, surely there can be little dispute over the legitimate interest of states in having some say in the matter, rather than having gambling instituted within their borders through federal-level negotiations. 
Respecting the role of states is fundamental to this issue, and Senator Enzi's amendment solves the problem of Federal intrusion created by the regulations put forward by the Secretary of Interior. I salute Senator Enzi for his amendment, and I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Utah, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for his leadership in this matter and in so many other matters. He is an outstanding legal scholar, an outstanding lawyer, a man of integrity, ability, and fairness who works extraordinarily hard to make sure everyone who comes before the committee has a thorough opportunity to express themselves and to defend themselves, and that others who have information to share are allowed to do so. 
I think it was an extraordinary event that he allowed a second hearing to be held for the Massiah-Jackson nomination. That was a very fair thing to do. I agree with the distinguished chairman that it is a good idea and a good thing that this nomination has been withdrawn. 
Ms. Frederica Massiah-Jackson has a number of problems with her nomination. I would just like to make a few points about the process and about her nomination. 
District Attorney Lynne Abraham, a Democrat in Philadelphia, who has served a number of years, and has also served on the judicial bench in Pennsylvania with Judge Massiah-Jackson, wrote us a letter saying that she had not opposed or commented on nominees of any kind before, but she wrote a letter stating she felt that she should do so on this occasion. 
Among other things, she said: 
This nominee's judicial service is replete with instances of demonstrated leniency toward criminals, an adversarial attitude toward police and disrespect toward prosecutors unmatched by any other present or former jurist with whom I am familiar. 
That was a letter written reluctantly and in sadness, but a letter I think she felt she had to share with us. Her opinion was shared by the District Attorneys Association in Pennsylvania, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the National Fraternal Order of Police. 
We were also presented a list of 50 cases in which we were given detailed statements of sentences and judicial rulings by this judge, prepared by district attorneys who had no obligation to do that but did so because they were concerned about it. Those cases have been around here for well over a month and have never really been effectively rebutted. So I think to say the newly uncovered twenty cases were somehow critical in this matter is not really accurate. I think the new cases were additional troublesome matters, but the whole list of cases previously submitted were quite troubling also. 
Just briefly, Madam President, while I am relieved that this nomination has been withdrawn, I think it shows fully why the Senate should carefully and thoroughly examine judicial nominees. Specifically, I thank Senator John Ashcroft, who is here today, and Senator Strom Thurmond for placing a temporary hold on this nomination after it was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by a 12-to-6 vote last fall. 
At that time, this nomination was moving toward confirmation last fall. It is a classic example of why the Judiciary Committee and the Senate as a whole should deliberately screen judicial nominees. President Clinton has suggested that the Senate should speed up confirmation of Federal judges. With all due respect, the Massiah-Jackson nomination demonstrates why the Senate should confirm Federal judges at a fair but careful pace. 
Judge Massiah-Jackson's nomination was reported out of the Judiciary Committee with approximately a dozen other judicial nominees at the end of last year. There was an effort to confirm these judges quickly before the year ended. Without Senator Ashcroft's and Senator Thurmond's temporary holds, this nominee would have been confirmed, I have no doubt. If this had happened, it would have been unfortunate, because many of Judge Jackson's 
unacceptable decisions had not yet been uncovered. 
In addition, as of last fall, the above-mentioned law enforcement organizations had not studied this nominee's record in detail. In fact, when Judge Massiah-Jackson's nomination was reported out of committee, none of these groups formally opposed the nomination. In fact, Senator Specter held a hearing in Pennsylvania to allow people to state objections. He gave them an opportunity to do so, but none came forth at that time. Without Senator Ashcroft's and Senator Thurmond's hold, this nominee would have been confirmed, in all probability, before her record had been adequately examined.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator McConnell. I say to Senator Smith, we appreciate your comments and thoughtful insight into this very important subject for our Nation. We want to do the right thing with regard to all of our citizens. We want to have a nation in which civil rights are protected and where 
everyone has an equal opportunity to participate in the American ideal. It is a very, very important issue. 
I thank Senator McConnell for developing the kind of amendment that will accomplish, I think, the legitimate goals of those who would like to see more opportunity in contracting Federal road contracts while at the same time protecting the great constitutional privileges that all of us in this Nation have a right to count on. 
I serve on both the Environment and Public Works Committee, from which this legislation came, and the Judiciary Committee. In the Environment and Public Works Committee, we had no hearings, took no testimony, did no study as to the advisability and the practicality of how these preferences work out in real life. 
For a number of years, I was a U.S. attorney and had the opportunity to prosecute criminal cases of all kinds and sorts. I have a distinct recollection of a case involving a minority individual who had gotten, I think, a $250,000 contract primarily because he was a minority. He was not the low bidder. He got the contract because of the preference set-asides in this highway bill. He promptly turned around and subcontracted the entire contract work to another contractor, presumably not a minority contractor, who did all the work and, in fact, there were false statements made in the course of this situation, for which he was convicted. But there is a lot of abuse in which people put up individuals as straw people just to take advantage of this provision. 
There are a lot of problems with the implementation of this act that I could talk about at some length. Fundamentally, I will say the bill is not good policy. It is not the kind of interference into the bid process that we ought to have in this country. But secondly, and most important, I will talk a few minutes about the fact that it is not only bad policy, but unconstitutional. 
We had hearings in the Judiciary Committee on this subject, both before the full Judiciary Committee and before Senator John Ashcroft's subcommittee. The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee has also had hearings on this, which is chaired by Representative Canady from Florida, who is an eloquent spokesman on this subject, who has come to see, with absolute clarity, the unconstitutionality and the unfairness of the racial set-asides that we now have in this bill. 
Let me say this: The McConnell bill is good. It is a good approach because it encourages new companies; it helps people get involved and get into business for the first time and gives them a lot of other advantages. We ought to do that. We ought to have outreach. We ought to have affirmative action. That is a good ideal for America. It is something that ought to be a part of our law insofar as it is appropriate to do so. But it is wrong to have quotas and set-asides. 
We first started affirmative action on March 6, 1961. That was when President John F. Kennedy issued this order:  
The contractors will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and treated during their employment without regard to race, color, creed or national origin. 
That is an ideal with which we can all agree. That is an ideal we can all support. It is something we ought to support and we ought to believe in in this Nation. But President Kennedy did not go as far as we have gone today, where we have actual set-asides that give preferences to one group of people on account of their race and denies a benefit or an equal opportunity to another individual on account of their race. That is what is objectionable about this legislation. 
Let me just say, how did we get to this point? I have, I think, an idea about how we got to this point. 
Most of us recognize and can remember that there was systematic discrimination against African Americans and other minority groups in this country as little as 30 years ago by law, in some instances. This was an unacceptable event. 
When the courts dealt with that, whether it was a police department or a fire department or a State agency, they would enter remedial orders, and they would put demands on those agencies to take immediate steps to make up for the explicit discrimination that had been suffered in that agency or department. The courts have always affirmed that. 
Somehow we slipped from these situations into generalized quotas as part of American law. That is a move which is not justified by policy or law, and the United States Supreme Court, and other courts, are beginning to make quite clear that it is unacceptable. 
The people of California, with proposition 209, spoke quite clearly as to their view about it, and the courts have promptly affirmed proposition 209, even though this administration and the President of the United States filed a brief saying it was unconstitutional. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that there is no doubt that proposition 209, which prohibited these kinds of quotas and set-asides, was constitutional. 
I think that we have to deal with this issue because it will not go away. 
I was present in the Judiciary Committee hearing when Mr. Pech, who was the chief operating officer of Adarand Constructors, testified. And I have done some research into the law. And I would like to share my thoughts with this body. 
The Constitution requires all of us, not just judges, to uphold the Constitution. We swore an oath, as is on that chart to do just that. I believe section 1111 of the ISTEA legislation is clearly unconstitutional under the Adarand Constructors, Incorporated v. Pena case, the landmark 1995, Supreme Court decision. 
Adarand involved the same program with the exact same language in this new authorization that was in the previous bill. That was the language the Supreme Court was dealing with and reviewed. In Adarand, the Court ruled all--all--governmental racial classifications, like the ones we have in this legislation, like the one it was considering in the Adarand case--the same language--are subject to the strictest judicial scrutiny. 
The Court held `federal racial classifications, like those of a state, must serve a compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to further that interest.'. 
It `must be narrowly tailored.' There must be a compelling interest. 
Now, some make the argument--and this is a matter we have heard a lot about recently--some make the argument that the Supreme Court did not strike down this program in Adarand. But I just say this. It did not uphold it, clearly. What they did was set a standard for the validity or invalidity of this program. And they referred the case back to the district court who tried it. And it gave that district court remand instructions. They remanded it, and they gave them instructions as to how they should evaluate whether or not this statute violated the Constitution. 
Justice Scalia, who was on the Supreme Court, wrote in his concurrence: 
[i]t is unlikely, if not impossible, that the challenged program would survive under this understanding of strict scrutiny, but I am content to let that be decided on remand [by the district court]. 
Based on the instructions and the law, as set forth by the Supreme Court, it was not surprising that on remand the Federal district court properly ruled, on summary judgment, that this program, this set aside program, was unconstitutional. They left no doubt about the constitutionality of this program. The district court stated: 
I find it difficult to envisage a race-based classification that is narrowly tailored. By its very nature, such a program is both underinclusive and overinclusive. 
Now, those are legal terms. Somebody might think, `What does that mean, `underinclusive' and `overinclusive'?' What the judge was saying simply: It is unfair. It overincludes people beyond who ought to be included; and when you do that, you underinclude people who have a right to be included in the bid process, and have a right to participate in these programs. 
That is the fundamental constitutional wrong. It gives advantages to people who do not deserve it; and it is a disadvantage to people who do not deserve to be disadvantaged. That is a fundamental constitutional principle. It will not go away. 
So the Court also enjoined, issued an order stopping the defendants from administering, that is, Secretary Pena, from administering section 1003(b) of the ISTEA. 
So I would say to anybody who looks at this matter fairly and objectively, without hesitation, there is no doubt that under the current state of the law, regarding this specific statute, it has been declared unconstitutional by the courts of the United States. 
Now, yes, they can appeal this district court ruling. But based on the plain holdings of the Supreme Court, which the 
district judge clearly followed in his opinion, I submit to you there is virtually no chance that it will be reversed. The Supreme Court of the United States cares about this issue. They care about making sure everybody in America has equal treatment. They want to see race relations in America improve, but they have studied it and they have thought about it. 
The courts have fulfilled their responsibility, in my opinion. And what have they thought? And what have they decided? Our federal courts have looked down the long road into the future, and they have asked themselves: Will this Nation be better served if we allocate goods and resources and contracts based on the color of one's skin? Is that a defensible policy for a nation to undertake? Can we do that? And they have concluded, no, you cannot, because when you do that you deny someone else an equal right to apply. 
Other Supreme Court cases have rendered very similar opinions. Bush v. Vera, Miller v. Johnson, Shaw v. Reno, and Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co. all have subjected Government racial preferences and classifications to the strictest scrutiny. In each one of these cases, the Court has found these racial classifications unconstitutional. 
Section 1111 simply reenacts, without change, the same statutory language that was invalidated in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena. Mr. President, section 1111 literally does not change one single word in the definition of `socially and economically disadvantaged individuals'. 
Both the previous ISTEA legislation and section 1111 refer to the exact same definition in the Small Business Act. This definition states--and I have the legislation here before me--it states that `contractors shall presume that socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, including Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, and other minorities or any other individual found to be disadvantaged by the administration under the Small Business Act, shall be presumed to meet the standard for socially and economically disadvantaged.' 
So that is statute--the problem is not regulations. Some would say `Well, you're quoting from regulations. They might change the regulations.' This is the Small Business Act. That is specifically referred to in this highway bill to define what `socially and economically disadvantaged individuals' are. And it gives a racial preference. It says that a black individual is presumed to be socially or economically disadvantaged whereas a struggling white businessman may not. 
So what we have here is an overtly racial Government classification. That is why the Supreme Court is concerned about it. Consequently, nothing in this reenactment does anything to strengthen the arguments that this section is constitutional. We, indeed, held no hearings on it. 
Moreover, there is no legislative record to support this racial classification. The Environment and Public Works Committee did not hear any testimony concerning the constitutionality of this section or the regulations promulgated pursuant to its identically worded predecessor. The only hearings we had were in the Judiciary Committee, as I mentioned earlier. 
Now, the Clinton administration suggests that the new regulations promulgated by the Department of Transportation somehow strengthen the case for the constitutionality of this provision. This, however, is a totally ineffective argument. Subsequent regulations simply cannot repair a statute that is, on its face, unconstitutional. It is difficult for me to see how anybody would argue otherwise. The courts have held--and I will read the opinion of the district judge here, the district judge, when he found this thing unconstitutional. He said: 
`The statutes and regulations concerning the SCC program are overinclusive, and they presume that all those in the named minority groups are economically or, in some act and regulation, socially disadvantaged. This presumption is flawed.' 
The Court held that both the regulations and the statute are 
unconstitutional. The statute is what the Supreme Court dealt with when it sent the district judge its instructions. 
Finally, some suggest that the Adarand v. Pena decision does not render section 1111 unconstitutional. They point to the language of Justice O'Connor when she wrote in the opinion:  
We wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is `strict in theory but fatal in fact.' The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and the government is not disqualified from acting in response to it. 
So they say, `Jeff, she just said what you say is not true. Adarand really did not close the door on this statute.' But, Mr. President, these advocates do not read the very next sentence in Justice O'Connor's decision where she immediately explains this quotation. Justice O'Connor's next sentence cites, as an example, a State governmental agency that had been found to have been engaged in `pervasive, systematic, and obstinate discriminatory conduct.' All Justice O'Connor says in this passage is that proven, widespread, systematic discrimination can justify `a narrowly tailored race-based remedy.' In other words, a limited racial preference can be constitutional as a remedy for a proven case of specific governmental discrimination. 
However, section 1111 is not a remedy for specific governmental racial discrimination. As I said earlier, there has been no determination in this case that the administration of the Federal Highway System is systematically and pervasively biased in its operation.

Mr. SESSIONS. Precisely so. The Senator from Kentucky is precisely correct. He has gone straight to the heart of this matter and I think makes a good point. 
You know, many of us go around, and we blame Federal judges for much of the litigation and problems and some of these ideas that many people say are liberal ideas. But in this case, I think it is the Congress that has been passing legislation that goes beyond its bounds and is being brought to task by the courts. 
So, fundamentally, I just further state that Environment and Public Works Committee made no findings, we made no factual analysis of the interstate highway program in order to determine there is some sort of systematic discrimination ongoing that ought to be corrected. In fact, I think a good argument can be made that the objectivity and fairness of the bid process is virtually above reproach. So there is just no basis for this. That is why it has no chance, in my opinion, of ever passing Supreme Court muster. And this Congress ought not be passing a bill that is bad public policy and is unconstitutional. 
Mr. President, I want to read a quote from Mrs. Valery Pech who testified on this subject. She is the wife of Mr. Randy Pech who owns Adarand Constructors. She is an owner herself, I believe. She said: 
We started our family-owned company in 1976 specializing in the installation of highway guardrail systems. In August of 1989, we lost yet another Federal highway contract on which we had submitted the lowest bid. Adarand lost this job and numerous others, past and future, not because of poor reputation, not because our price was too high, not because we limited our bid date, not for any other reason but one. Randy, as owner and operator of Adarand is a white male. We didn't like it. We fought the decision. We contracted a legal foundation to seek help. Six years later, in 1995, the Supreme Court ruled for us and against race-based decisionmaking in the Adarand Constructors case. 
Adarand is the only nonminority guardrail business in the State of Colorado. All our competitors are classified as disadvantaged business enterprises. Their status is DBE, and contracts are awarded based solely on the owner's race or gender regardless of whether or not they have suffered past discrimination. 
She lists those competitors that they compete against. She notes all of these contractors have been in business--her competitors are minority owned for over 10 years and have solid reputations for getting work done. These four competitors get 95 percent of their work by being low bidder in other than Government contracts; yet when they bid against Adarand for Government contracts, they get a preference and are able to get the bid, although they bid higher. 
Do you see the unfairness of it? These are strong competitive companies. One simply happens to be headed by a Hispanic and one is not. The one who is not gets hurt, and the other one has an advantage. That is why the polls of all racial groups feel that these are not fair and just preferences. 
Mr. President, I will not belabor the subject. Again, I want to congratulate the Senator from Kentucky for his leadership in coming forward with a remarkable proposal that gives opportunity, gives it affirmatively, reaches out to help disadvantaged, gives them a chance to be successful in getting Government contract work, but at the same time does not violate the Constitution. 
In conclusion, I have no doubt that this section is unconstitutional. It is neither supported by a compelling Government interest nor is it narrowly tailored. Therefore, I urge the Senate to consider Senator McConnell's amendment. I cannot in good conscience vote for legislation that I consider to be unconstitutional.

Mr. SESSIONS. First, I congratulate the Senator very much on this renewal idea and community empowerment. I had the opportunity to serve as a U.S. attorney and be a coordinator of a communities-based revitalization program known as Read and See in Mobile and Martin Luther King Jr. neighborhoods--a great neighborhood that declined dramatically over the years. 
What we did first was we had a big town meeting, a community meeting of the leaders and the people who live there. We broke up into discussion groups and we listed priorities. All 10 groups listed priorities that they thought their community needed most. First, I remember distinctly that every group listed crime. They wanted a safer neighborhood for their children and their families to live in. They listed programs where they wanted their churches to be stronger in helping kids. As I recall, I can't think of a single one that listed a preferential contract for businesspeople as a need for that community. 
Is that what the Senator was saying and suggesting, that we really need to deal with deeper problems than the kind we may be so politically engaged in now?

I think you are correct, Senator Coats, in how you are approaching this idea. I believe that we need to allow the people in our communities to develop plans for their own neighborhoods, to make them work, and we will get a lot better ideas than some of the programs that have been conjured up in this Congress.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this has been a great debate. I think about the abilities of those of us in this body to participate in unlimited debate, and I think it is a great thing. Great and free debate is a characteristic of American society. Unfortunately, people use the freedom and the money they raise sometimes to run negative ads. I certainly see nothing in McCain-Feingold that would stop that kind of activity from happening. But this is an important vote. As a matter of fact, I consider it a very fundamental and crucial vote for America. 
In my 1996 campaign, just over a year ago, in the primary, I faced seven Republican candidates. Two of them were multimillionaires, and two of those individuals spent $1 million-plus out of their own pockets to further their dream of being elected to this great body. They used most of it to attack me. I was attorney general, I was leading in the polls, and I took most of the brunt of that. Two other individuals in that race raised or spent themselves over a half-million dollars to attempt to put their message out to the Alabama people. I spent approximately a million dollars during that primary. I was outspent $5 million to $1 million in that primary. And then in the general election, there was also a very vigorous and contested general election. My opponent spent approximately $3 million, as I recall, in that race. 
One of the key parts of that race and one of the things that was most interesting and painful to me was that I was attacked and received a volume of attack ads from money that really was raised by the Alabama Trial Lawyers Association. You see, in Alabama, there is a contested, bitter fight over the attempt by many in the Alabama legislature to reduce the aberrationally high verdicts in plaintiff litigation in the State. It embarrassed the State and there was a bitter fight over it. 
The Trial Lawyers Association, which wanted to continue to file those lawsuits and receive those big verdicts opposed that legislation. It was bitterly fought over. Tort reform passed the house of representatives twice but twice it failed in the Alabama State Senate. My opponent was the chairman of the senate judiciary committee, where most of those bills died. He was also, himself personally, a plaintiff trial lawyer. He had a plaintiff trial lawyer lawsuit filed during the election. He was suing somebody for fraud during the election. That was an important issue. It was an issue that the people of Alabama needed to discuss and know about. The Trial Lawyers Association raised, I guess, what you would call `soft money' in the amount of around a million dollars to express their views and to oppose me because I took a different view. 
Earlier today, I saw somebody with a chart that had an ad similar to the ad that was run against me. It complained about an attorney general--obviously, in a different State--and it said, `if you don't like what he did, call his office and complain.' This was their attempt to get around some of the campaign expenditure rules and laws that existed in our country. We faced those ads and were frustrated by them. 
When I came here to this body, I was prepared to consider what we could do to fix that situation. Frankly, I was not happy with having such a sum of money being raised and used against me in my campaign. I have given it a lot of thought. I talked to the manager, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, and others. I have done some research. I have considered the Constitution and what I believe is fair and just and consistent with the great American democracy of which we are a part. Based on that, I have concluded that we must fundamentally recognize the primacy of the first amendment, which provides to all Americans the right of free speech. That includes the right to spend money to project your views, as the Supreme Court has said. To limit that is a historic event and an unhealthy event, in my opinion. 
They say, `Jeff, we are not trying to limit people's free speech; we just want to limit your speech during a campaign, just during an election cycle.' When do people want to speak out most if it is not during a campaign? Isn't it then that people are most focused on the issues and have the greatest opportunity to change the direction of their country? Isn't that when they want to speak out? It certainly is. If you want to limit free speech, I say to you that the last place you want to limit it, is during a campaign cycle. That would be terribly disruptive of freedom in America. 
Now, they say, `Well, it really doesn't interfere with the first amendment.' But I was on this floor, Mr. President, early last year--in March of last year, as I recall--when the Democratic leader and other Members of this body proposed--and people have forgotten this--a constitutional amendment to amend the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution, to justify their attempt to control free debate in America during an election cycle. It was an attempt to reduce the expenditures during that election cycle and give this Congress, incumbent politicians, the right to restrict their opponents' ability to campaign against them. I thought 
that was a thunderous event. 
I said at the time that I considered that a retreat from the principles of the great democracy of which we are a part--as a matter of fact, the largest retreat in my lifetime, maybe the largest retreat in the history of this country. And, amazingly, 38 Senators voted for it. You have to have two-thirds, and that was not nearly enough to pass this body. But I was astounded that we would have that. But at least those people who favored the amending of the first amendment were honest about it. They knew what they were attempting to do with election campaign finance reform, and that is to affect the ability of people to raise money to articulate their views during an election cycle and that a constitutional change was needed to effect such a change. 
So, Mr. President, I have a lot of issues that could be discussed here. I am not going to go into any others. I simply say that I believe this is a historic vote. I think it does, in fact, reflect our contemporary view of the importance of the right of free speech. We have had the American Civil Liberties Union and other free speech groups opposing McCain-Feingold because they are principled in that regard. But others who have, in the past, been champions of free speech curiously are now attempting to pass this legislation, which I think would restrict the ability of Americans to speak out aggressively and criticize incumbent officeholders and attempt to remove them from office and express their views in a way they feel is important. 
So, Mr. President, those are my thoughts on the matter. I will be opposing this legislation. As to the question of union contributions, dues being used against the will of the members, against their own views on political issues, I think that is something we could legislate on. Somebody said such a change would be a `poison pill' for campaign finance reform. Well, it is a poison pill to me. I am not going to support any campaign reform that is going to allow somebody's money to be taken and spent on political issues they may oppose.

Mr. SESSIONS. I spent 15 years in my professional career as a Federal prosecutor prosecuting full-time before Federal judges. I have had the pleasure of practicing before some of the finest judges in America. It is a thrill to have that opportunity, to have the opportunity to represent the United States of America in court and to utilize our Constitution, our laws and our statutes, and the logic that God gives us the ability to utilize, to analyze difficult problems. 
Many of us can disagree, but I do rise today in opposition to the nomination of Margaret Morrow to the U.S. District Court bench for the Central District of California. This is not an easy decision. These are not pleasant tasks for those of us on the Judiciary Committee and in this Senate to decide to vote against a Presidential nomination. But if we believe in that and we are concerned about that, our responsibility as Members of this body calls on us to do so. 
By all accounts, she is a fine lawyer and a good person. However, her writings and speeches which span over a decade indicate that she views the Federal judiciary as a means to achieve a social or political end. 
This nomination is all the more important when one considers that Ms. Morrow's home State of California has repeatedly been victimized recently by liberal and undemocratic Federal judges. 
Moreover, judicial activism has plagued her judicial circuit, the ninth circuit, like no other circuit in the country. 
Consider for a moment how big a problem judicial activism is on the ninth circuit. In 1997, last year, the Supreme Court reversed 27 out of 28 decisions rendered by the ninth circuit. In 1996, the Supreme Court reversed 10 out of 12 ninth circuit decisions. That pattern has been going on for decades. As a Federal prosecutor in Alabama, when criminal defense lawyers file briefs and cite law to argue their opinion or to suppress evidence or matters of that kind, they most frequently cited ninth circuit opinions because those were the most liberal in the country on criminal law. Frankly, they were not given much credit around the country. Most judges in the United States recognize that this circuit too often was out of step with the rest of the country. 
There are a number of factors that cause me to oppose the confirmation of Ms. Morrow. Chief among the factors is her skepticism, if not outright hostility, toward voter initiatives. In a 1988 article, Morrow criticized California's initiative process. In this article, she stated, really condescendingly, these words, `The fact that initiatives are presented to a `legislature' of 20 million people renders ephemeral any real hope of intelligent voting by a majority.' I suggest that that indicates a lack of respect for that process and the jealously guarded privilege of California voters to enact legislation by direct action of the people. 
She further criticized the initiative process with this statement: `The public, by contrast, cast its votes for initiatives on the basis of 30- and 60-second advertisements which ignore or obscure the substance of the measure.' 
At the time of her hearing, I found that Ms. Morrow's suspicion of initiatives particularly troubling because of two recent California initiatives, Proposition 187 and Proposition 209, the California civil rights initiative, both of which have been blocked by activist Federal judges in California. In fact, the judges in the ninth circuit have invalidated voter initiatives on tenuous grounds since the early 1980s. These decisions demonstrate the enormous power that a single sitting Federal district judge possesses to subvert the will of the people. Morrow's criticism of citizen initiatives reveals an elitist mindset characteristic of activist judges who use the judiciary to impose their personal values onto the law. 
Unfortunately, recent events have left me even more concerned about her disdain for the people's will as expressed in voter initiatives. Late last year, the ninth circuit effectively enshrined Ms. Morrow's view of initiatives into ninth circuit law. In an opinion striking down yet another voter initiative, term limits for California State legislatures, the ninth circuit held that Federal courts must scrutinize voter initiatives more closely than `ordinary legislative lawmaking.' This `extra scrutiny' is necessary, according to the ninth circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt and Betty Fletcher, because initiatives are not the product of committee hearings and because `the public also generally lacks legal or legislative expertise.' In the end, the ninth circuit invalidated the term limits initiative not because term limits are unconstitutional--because I submit to you they plainly are not unconstitutional--but because the two Federal judges did not think the voters fully understood what they were voting for. 
The ninth circuit does not need any more reinforcements in its war on the initiative process. The people of California are rightly jealous of their initiative process. They are frustrated that judges go out of their way to strike down the decisions they reach by direct plebiscite. 
We don't need to send them another judge, another leader on that court who would support the anti-initiative effort. 
Ms. Morrow's distaste for voter initiatives is not the only troubling aspect of her record. For example, in a 1995 law review comment, she wrote what can be interpreted clearly to me as a blatant approval of judicial activism:  
For the law is, almost by definition, on the cutting edge of social thought. It is a vehicle through which we ease the transition from the rules which have always been to the rules which are to be. 
I know she has suggested a view of that language that would indicate that she meant something like the practice of law, rather than the rule of law. But that's not what she said and, in fact, maybe she meant it to apply to both circumstances. In fact, I think that's the most accurate interpretation of it. She may well have been talking about the practice of law, but at the same time her approach to law, because that is what her language includes. It would suggest to me that this is, in fact, the language of a judicial activist. 
In a 1983 speech, she also made comments that suggest approval of judicial activism. In this speech, she quoted Justice William Brennan, the evangelist of judicial activism, stating: 
Justice can only endure and flourish if the law and legal institutions are `engines of change' able to accommodate evolving patterns of life and social interaction in this decade. 
Obviously, using the law as an `engine of change' is the very definition of judicial activism and is fundamentally incompatible with democratic government. 
Mr. President, it is a serious matter when the people, through their contract with the Government and their Constitution, set forth plain restraints on the power of the law, when the people, through their legislators in California, or through their Congress in Washington, pass statutes requiring things to be done one way or the other, and when a judge, if they do not respect that law, feels like he or she can reinterpret or redefine the meaning of words in those documents in such a way that would allow them to impose their view of the proper outcome under the circumstances. That makes them a judicial activist. I submit that these writings from her past indicate that tendency. 
Also, in 1983, the nominee strongly criticized the Reagan administration's efforts to restrict the Legal Services Corporation from filing certain categories of lawsuits. As many of you know, the Legal Services Corporation grantees--they receive money from the Government--have repeatedly filed partisan suits in Federal courts to achieve political aims. For example, the Legal Services Corporation has repeatedly sued to block welfare reform efforts in the States. Issues of public policy simply are not properly decided by litigation. The use of public tax dollars to promote an ideological agenda through the Federal courts is not acceptable. 
Of course, support for the historic mission of the Legal Services Corporation--helping the poor with real legal problems --is not the issue. What bothers me is Ms. Morrow's opposition to President Reagan's attempt to depoliticize the Legal Services Corporation and to direct it's attention fundamentally to its goal of helping the poor. But we had a very serious debate in America and I think, for the most part, it has been won; for the most part, Legal Services Corporation has been restrained. There are still problems ongoing, but I hope we have made progress, despite the very strong opposition of Ms. Morrow in her writings. 
So Ms. Morrow's intelligence, academic record, and professional achievements are not in question. However, her writings, published over the last decade, provide a direct look at her view of the law. That view, I must conclude, indicates that Ms. Morrow would be yet another undemocratic, activist Federal judge. 
One last point must be made. Unlike other judicial nominees, Ms. Morrow has not previously been a judge. Consequently, she does not have a lengthy judicial record for the Senate to review. In this situation, we must rely on her private writings and speeches to determine her judicial philosophy. This is not an easy or certain task. We must make judgments as to what is relevant and probative and what is not. In this situation, I have made such an inquiry and have decided to oppose the confirmation of this very able attorney. The Senate must fulfill its advise and consent responsibilities to ensure that federal judges respect their constitutional role to interpret the law. Consequently, I urge you to oppose this nomination. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the process of advise and consent in the U.S. Senate for judicial nominees is indeed an important one. We have had some tremendous debate already this afternoon. And we have had it on other nominees. The Senators that have spoken earlier today are outstanding Senators who deeply care about their work. And I respect them all.

I would like to say that whereas I concluded at the hearings that this nominee had these kind of tendencies based on what I saw, a majority of the committee did not agree with that, and we did not have the overwhelming amount of evidence that we have now. I say that in all due respect to the Senator from Pennsylvania. He had a hearing in Pennsylvania. These things did not come up at that time. I understand. I don't criticize the district attorneys and the police. They don't like to be involved in this. But I think they had to. They felt they had to come forward, and they did. I think it is time now for us to do our job. I wanted to say that in respect to the Senator from Pennsylvania.

 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my good friend from Arkansas, Senator Tim Hutchinson, in introducing the `Dollars to the Classroom Act'. This is a critically important piece of education legislation, of which I am honored to be an original cosponsor. 
The `Dollars to the Classroom Act' will send funds supporting roughly thirty one K-12 education programs in a block grant to states, with the requirement that 95 percent of these funds go to local schools. This is a very simple concept. We should demand that 95 percent of the Federal money we spend on elementary and secondary education must be spent in the classrooms of our local schools. That's it. 
Let me be clear about one thing. This legislation does not reduce the funding for the schools. Rather, it makes sure that the tax monies our citizens give for education actually makes it to the classroom. 
Mr. President, I served as a public school teacher. My wife served as a public school teacher. And let me say this, there is nothing more special, than the moment when a young student and a teacher connect in the classroom. Unfortunately, there exists a complex, confusing, paperwork driven federal system that too often hinders rather than helps the students. Mr. President, this bill provides the badly needed resources to not only enhance these magic moments between students and teachers but it also guarantees that every single student and every single teacher will have the resources needed to make this all possible. 
Mr. President, this is how the bill works. Instead of sending the education dollars through the usual bureaucratic gauntlet--paying the bureaucrats at the Department of Education and the state education establishments--individual tax dollars would go directly to the states in a block grant administered by the Governor. Local school districts, parents, teachers, and local school officials could then use those funds for education priorities they think are most important. Mr. President, this will allow parents and local education officials to decide how to spend these dollars. They would decide their schools' priorities and, most importantly, how best to allocate these funds. 
There is another important reason for this legislation. Federal education programs and their grant processes have become so burdensome many local schools are not even applying for funds. Often our local schools and school officials are forced to spend a significant amount of their Federal education tax dollars just to apply for these funds. 
Let me give you an example. The Mobile County Public Schools system, my home county in Alabama, which contains 65,443 students in grades K-12 was forced, on two different occasions, to hire grant writers at $50,000 a year just to help the school system apply for these federal grants. These grant writers were in addition to the many administrators, principals and teachers who are forced to dedicate their valuable time to filling out the paperwork associated with applying for these grants instead of educating the students of Mobile County. 
And there are countless other examples. The state of Ohio calculated in 1990 that over 50 percent of its paperwork burden was related to federal education programs, even though only 5 percent of its education revenues came from federal sources. 
A recent audit of the New York City public schools found that only 43% of their local education budget reaches the classrooms. 
A 1996 Heritage Foundation study of federal spending on elementary and secondary education found that only 85 cents of every education tax dollar sent to Washington, was returned to local school districts--that's school districts not local classrooms. 
According to the U.S. Department of Education, of the more than $15 billion allocated to its elementary and secondary education programs in 1996, over $3 billion went for purposes--like administrative overhead--rather than the real needs of local school districts. 
The Superintendent of the Mobile County Public School system, Mr. Paul Sousa, supports this legislation for one simple reason: this legislation dedicates valuable dollars to the classrooms and eliminates the bureaucracy that has placed a stranglehold on his principals, his teachers, and his students. And I would say to all my colleagues, the `Dollars to the Classroom Act' will help to eliminate these scenarios and require that 95% of all Federal education dollars be spent in the classroom. 
Mr. President, I would like to end my comments by sharing with you a quote from President Clinton, concerning this very issue. On March 27, 1996, in a speech to the National Governors' Association, the President stated: `We cannot ask the American people to spend more on education until we do a better job with the money we've got now.' Mr. President, I fully agree. We can not continue to spend billions of dollars on federal education programs that don't even reach our students. We must demand accountability for the federal dollars we spend on education. We need to know where our education dollars are going and how much actually gets to the individual classrooms in Alabama and across this country. 
The `Dollars to the Classroom Act' will provide the hardworking parents and students of this country the resources and the accountability they deserve.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have the honor to speak on this legislation sponsored by the distinguished Senator from Georgia. I so greatly admire him. I admire his principle, integrity, ability, and passion for this issue. I think it is an important issue, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution. We ought to recognize people who have made great differences in this Nation's history. I think President Reagan is one of those people. 
I thought I would take a very few minutes to tell a story that illustrates how deeply and how important President Reagan's life is to the American people and to the people of the world. 
In 1993, I went on a church trip to Russia and spent a week there. Our group went to a small city of 40,000 people that is located 5 hours east of Moscow in an area where very few Americans were allowed in over the years because it was a security area in the Soviet Union. We went to the town of Sovetsk. I was able to stay with another American in the home of a Russian businessman who was beginning to develop a business in Sovetsk. The first night we arrived they were going to celebrate the baptism of their daughter. A Russian Orthodox priest appeared in his great robes. The mother, father, and the grandparents had come in from the Ural Mountains, and it was a goodly group of people there. It was a marvelous ceremony as the priest performed that baptism. 
As we had dinner afterwards the priest told us that since perestroika, since the fall of the wall, he had baptized 18,000 people in that town of 40,000. He told us that before the wall fell he was not allowed to baptize people. He said he was not allowed to wear his robes, and that the Soviet Communist authorities moved him around 6 months or so at a time so that he could not really get to know his congregation and so he would be unable to build the kind of rapport that is necessary. He discussed how he could now wear his robes, how he could now walk about town, how he could now meet with the mayor, and how he was now respected in the city in public affairs. For this priest and his congregation, it was now a great time. 
At the conclusion of that discussion my host proposed a toast to Ronald Reagan `who made us believe in God again.' 
Mr. President, I don't know if they missed the translation. But the heart of that was very, very real. 
President Ronald Reagan helped shape this world. He helped free millions of people from a totalitarian state. He called the Soviet empire an `evil empire,' and evil it was. 
Before we went to Russia, we spent time with a college professor who had spent 6 months there. He said, `I used to teach that the United States and Russia were just like scorpions in a bottle. There is no difference between us.' Now, however, he says that after having been there and after having met with young Russian people he has changed his mind. In the words of that professor, `when I would talk in that fashion, the Russians looked at me like I was crazy. They said, `What are you talking about? You had all kinds of freedom. We had none. There was a great distinction between Russia, the Soviet Union, and the United States of America and the democracy that you have.' Today that professor 
has come to believe that those young people had it right. 
Ronald Reagan personified that. He personified the collapse of the totalitarian empire. He gave his life to it. He articulated it better than any man that ever lived. His was a Presidency both in terms of domestic policy and foreign policy that ranks among the highest order of American Presidents. 
I think he deserves this recognition. I think it is very fitting that it be done on his birthday. I think it is very fitting that we recognize him while we are still blessed with his presence. 
I want to congratulate the Senator from Georgia for his articulate explanation and promotion of this legislation. I am delighted and honored just to have this moment to share this story with the people in this body and the people in the United States because I think it says in a very real way that this man symbolized the American democratic free enterprise victory over the totalitarian atheistic Communist government. 
I appreciate the leadership of Senator Coverdell and thank him for yielding me this time.

Mr. SESSIONS. I think the Senator from Georgia is so correct. I think back on that example and I think that it really sort of symbolizes the difference between a totalitarian government where freedom is denied, where people are not allowed to worship, and are not allowed to be baptized, and the wonder of the democracy that we are blessed with having. 
I think also that it is fitting for us to recognize him in this manner. I have on my desk a plaque which is imprinted with one of President Reagan's quotes, a quote which I think is most appropriate especially as we discuss naming National Airport after him at this late point in his life. It says, `There is no limit what a man can do or where he can go if he doesn't mind who gets the credit.' 
I think it is time to give Ronald Reagan credit. This is a fitting tribute to him. I salute the Senator from Georgia for his efforts, and I support his steadfastness in that.

 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes today in order to lay out my reasons for voting against the Fiscal Year 1998 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill. 
Mr. President, when I was running for the Senate last year, there were two campaign promises that I made to the people of the great State of Alabama. First, I promised that I would work to reign in wasteful Washington spending and secondly, that I would work to bring Alabama values into the Washington public-policy debate. It was for these two simple reasons that I felt compelled to cast my vote against the Labor, HHS appropriations bill. 
The fiscal year 1998 Labor, HHS appropriations bill contained roughly $80 billion in spending for Washington social programs. This is an increase of roughly $6.2 billion from fiscal year 1997's bill. Now Mr. President, the average Alabamian, if they're lucky, sees a cost-of-living increase in their paycheck each year of around 2.8 percent. That's it, 2.8 percent. However, this bill increases Washington social spending by over 8 percent. That's an increase of almost three times the average Alabamian's yearly cost-of-living increase. That to me is unacceptable. 
I have spent many long hours looking through the merits of many of these programs. We have many good programs, with a proven track record, that need to be funded and supported. But Mr. President, the Labor, HHS appropriations bill we voted on also contained many social programs that are unproven or just too costly. The taxpayers of America deserve to know that their hard earned tax dollars are spent wisely. If we continue to raise spending faster than our economic growth--faster than the cost of living--then we are in danger of returning to the old tax and spend mentality that has nearly bankrupted this country. With great reluctance, I must vote `no.' 
There were several other provisions missing from this bill which also compelled me to vote against it. First, my tobacco amendment, added to the bill by the Senate on September 10, which would have limited any tobacco attorney's fees and required that all such fees be made public for inspection prior to the passage of any global settlement, was stripped during negotiations between the Senate and House of Representatives conference committee. These fees, in many cases, will be the largest fees in history and will be windfalls for these attorneys. These moneys would be better spent on health care for children. 
Second, an education provision, which I strongly supported, authored by my good friend from Washington, Senator Slade Gorton, was also stripped during the House-Senate conference negotiations. This amendment would have required the Secretary of Education to award certain funds appropriated for the Department of Education for kindergarten through grade 12 programs and activities directly to the local education agencies. This will allow them to use the funds for their greatest needs and reduce paperwork. I supported this amendment because I believe it is time to take control of our schools out of the hands of the well-intentioned individuals in Washington and instead put the control into the hands of the real experts--the teachers, principals, parents and the students of Alabama. Mr. President, this is another example of Government putting Washington values ahead of Alabama's values. The fundamental question is this: Will our children benefit more if Washington is in charge of their education or if their elected representatives are? Alabama values would support the local control of our schools while Washington values support the bureaucratic heavy handed federal control of our education system. 
Mr. President, in closing, let me say plainly I support many of the programs and services found in this bill. It was my sincere hope to have been counted among its supporters on the Senate floor. However in this era when families are struggling to get by, we simply must begin the process of controlling the growth of Washington spending. That is why I have decided to vote `no.'

 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to express my gratitude to the diligent work of our leaders in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee especially the chairman, Senator Chafee and ranking member, Senator Baucus along with the chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee, Senator Warner in crafting a comprehensive, 6 year transportation bill. The bill unanimously passed by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee makes progress towards building a more equitable formula for distributing Federal transportation funds to the States. It is unfortunate Congress did not have the opportunity to debate this bill during this session of Congress although I look forward to building upon progress made by the committee when the Senate reconvenes in January. 
The law which authorizes our Federal transportation program expired on September 30 of this year. Thanks to the competent work of Gov. Fob James, and Jimmy Butts, the director at the Alabama Department of Transportation, and Don Vaughn, Assistant Transportation Director, I was alerted early on that if Congress failed to act on passing a transportation bill, critical transportation programs such as Interstate Maintenance, the National Highway System, and needed bridge repair throughout Alabama would cease by December. In addition, the Federal Department of Transportation would have been forced to shut its doors and transportation contractors would have been forced to lay off workers as Alabama and many other States curtailed or ceased awarding of transportation maintenance and construction contracts. To avoid this crisis, the Senate has enacted a short term solution to allow transportation projects to continue by providing additional funding and increased flexibility of Federal transportation funds to States. 
The temporary transportation resolution passed by the Senate on Tuesday will allow Alabama access to $174,469,000 for critical highway programs. This amount represents half the amount of Federal highway funds Alabama was able to spend in fiscal year 1997. In addition, the Alabama Department of Transportation will have the flexibility to transfer funds between various transportation programs so that planning, maintenance and expansion can continue as a comprehensive, long-term transportation bill is passed by Congress early next year. Once a new long-term transportation bill is passed, the Secretary of Transportation will offset each State's fiscal year 1998 funding to reflect the funds used by each State as a result of this extension. 
Again, I would like to personally thank and congratulate Senator Bond for putting this package together with our leaders of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee, Warner, and Baucus. While many of my colleagues and myself would have preferred a long-term solution to our transportation needs, this short-term extension will allow Alabama and all States to continue their transportation planning, maintenance, and construction until a new, long-term bill is negotiated and passed hopefully early next year.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Bill Lann Lee nomination as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. He is a good man, a lawyer of skill and experience. He is the son of an immigrant who has worked hard and done very well professionally and financially. 
However, his nomination is in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Many of his positions are outside the mainstream of current legal thought, and I believe we need to reject that nomination. Regretfully, I intend to vote no when it comes up before the Judiciary Committee. 
There has been some discussion and comments made that there have been scurrilous attacks against him. I just want to say that is not so. Certainly it is not so from the Senators who are members of the Judiciary Committee who have considered this nomination. Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, came to this body earlier this week. He made a very long, professional address, delineating his concerns about this nomination and why he had decided to vote no. He talked about legal issues, professional issues, positions of importance, and that is the basis of our concern--not personal attacks. 
This position is a serious position. Mr. Lee has been treated respectfully. I have been at every hearing he has attended, and I have been at every hearing in which his nomination has been discussed. It has been discussed on a high level, according to the highest professional standards of this Senate. That is the way it should be. But his position is an important position, so it is necessary that we ask important fundamental questions and that we get answers from him, and then once we get those answers, it is our responsibility, under the advice and consent responsibility of the Senate, to make a judgment as to how we should vote. 
I want to say we must protect the civil rights of all Americans. We cannot, however, utilize civil rights laws as a tool to favor one group over another. We need to know what Mr. Lee thinks on what the issues are facing America. He is an advocate. We know that. I respect that. But we need to go beyond that. How deep is his advocacy? Can he take it away and can he be an objective and effective administrator of the civil rights policies of the U.S. Government, or does he maintain some of his advocacy views that are outside the mainstream of American legal thought? 
That is why, I submit, he has been asked a number of questions and why we have taken this seriously. 
This position has been vacant for 18 months. The President just recently submitted his nomination. Our committee has moved promptly to consider that nomination, and we brought it up last week for a vote. His supporters, perhaps fearing they did not have the votes, asked it be put over again for another week. I expect we will take that up Thursday of next week. Some have suggested that if there are not enough votes in the committee to confirm this nomination, that we ought to, regardless of that, send the nomination to the floor. 
As a new member of the committee, I thought we had an interesting discussion about that. The Members who felt they were on the losing side raised quite a number of questions and earnestly argued for their position. Of course, this is a decision that we can make, and we can make any decision we choose, and they cited a number of historical examples why we should do that. Senator Hatch has been a member of the committee for a number of years and delineated the history. There has been no Executive nominee--and this nominee would be part of President Clinton's administration--reported out of that committee other than with a favorable recommendation since 1953. 
In fact, a number of Democratic Senators on the committee were the very ones who just a few years ago voted not to send the nomination of Bill Lucas, an African-American who had been nominated by President Reagan to be civil rights chief--they voted not to send his nomination out. And they did the same with William Bradford Reynolds, another nominee of President Reagan, who was not sent forward, on their objection. 
Therefore, they took the position--and I think one that is quite proper--if they so choose and if our committee so chooses, that the committee makes a recommendation as to whether or not a nomination should go forward. 
Let me say there have been suggestions that scurrilous complaints and attacks have been made. I hate to hear that, but I say they have not come from our side. I say there have been some unwise and intemperate remarks by those who are supporting the Lee nomination in this U.S. Senate. They have, in effect, said, `Agree with us and you report out this nomination, or we will say you are against civil rights, we will accuse you of being against African-Americans, we will say you are against women, we will say you are against Chinese-Americans.' They would, in fact, play the race card. 
Sad to say, they have done just that. 
Mr. President, let me share with Members of this body and the American people some of the things that were said by Senators in this body about those of us who have concerns about this nomination. The Democratic leader had a press conference earlier this week, and he said, `The far right doesn't want the Civil Rights Division filled because they don't want civil rights laws enforced.' 
Now, I submit that is a sad thing to say. That is an extreme thing to say, that the chairman of our committee, Senator Orrin Hatch, who has worked hand in glove with this administration to confirm every nominee they sent forward for the Department of Justice, except this one. This is the only one he has objected to. It is extremely unfair to say that we don't want civil rights laws enforced because we want to question this nominee and we believe he is outside the mainstream of current legal thought. 
Senator Kennedy said, `It's wrong for Republicans to hold him hostage to their anti-civil-rights agenda.' I'm for civil rights. I believe in that. The other Members do. We just need to talk about what we really mean by the words `civil rights.' Do civil rights mean equality for all as we traditionally thought? Or do we go to a new definition of civil rights that means preferences and advantages to one group or another group because of the color of their skin? We are not against civil rights. Senator Kennedy went on to say, `It would be an outrage for a small band of anti-civil-rights Republican Senators to bottle up this nominee. A vote against Bill Lee is a vote against civil rights,' he said. 
Another Senator, Senator Boxer said, `By opposing Bill Lee, I think the Republicans are sending a signal to every minority in this country, to every woman in this country, that, frankly, they don't believe in equal opportunity for everyone.' 
That hurts me, Mr. President, to hear a Member of this body make such an extreme statement as that. 
I really think it was unnecessary and goes beyond what ought to have been said. We can disagree whether or not this nominee ought to be confirmed. But I think we ought to all respect each other's views and opinions more than that. So I am concerned about that. 
Another Senator, Senator Mikulski, was also aggressive in her remarks. This is how it was reported in the Washington Times the other morning on the front page:  
Congressional Democrats, in a bid to save the nomination of a Chinese American as assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, yesterday accused Republicans of racism. 
`I don't think the United States Senate should be a forum for attacking Chinese Americans,' said Senator Mikulski. `We don't want Bill Lann Lee to be the Anita Hill of 1997,' she said. 
This is what the paper reported: 
Just after finishing leveling fire, the Maryland Democrat walked over to Senator Edward M. Kennedy and said under her breath, `I hated to do that, but we had no choice.' 
I am glad at least to know that she was reluctant to make those comments. I think she well should have been because I intend to take, and every member of this committee intends to take, this nominee seriously. We need to give him a fair hearing. He needs to be treated respectfully. But if his ideas are outside the mainstream of current American law, outside the direction we believe this Nation ought to go in civil rights, we have a responsibility to reject the nomination, and that is what I intend to do. I intend to fulfill my responsibility. 
I want to say right now that I don't intend to be intimidated by attacks of that kind. I am going to do what I believe is right for this country. 
Let me read you what some of the testimony was at hearings about this nominee. 
Mr. Gerald A. Reynolds, an African-American, president of the Center for New Black Leadership, testified that he strongly opposed the nomination of Mr. Lee. He said: 
If confirmed as Assistant Attorney General, Mr. Lee's background suggests that no democratic principle, controlling legal authority, nor legal standard will prevent him from furthering his particular ideological agenda. 
Further he said: 
For the last 30 years, traditional civil rights organizations have used civil rights laws as a weapon to extract benefits for racial minorities, no matter what the cost. Mr. Lee has spent most of his professional life doing that same thing. 
Mr. Lee's legal defense fund sought to overcome the will of the citizens of California by persuading the ninth circuit to affirm Judge Henderson's ruling against Proposition 209. 
I would argue that the legal defense fund's attempts to nullify Proposition 209 constitutes a direct assault upon our democratic principles. The legal defense fund's case against Proposition 209 rested on a thin reed. Basically, it rested upon two cases that are easily distinguishable from the facts surrounding Proposition 209. 
I think we will talk about Proposition 209 in a minute. But just to point out, that is a civil rights initiative in California that said people should be treated alike regardless of the color of their skin, and it mirrored almost exactly the 14th amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
Mr. Reynolds goes further:  
There are other examples. We can look to the lawsuit in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority decided to increase its bus fares and eliminate monthly bus passes. Mr. Lee's legal defense fund lawsuit alleged that the MTA action violated the civil rights laws and the Constitution because they had an adverse impact on minorities and poor people. 
Mr. Reynolds continues: 
We can debate whether it was a good idea to eliminate some of the benefits that the citizens of Los Angeles enjoyed, but I think it is a stretch to conclude that a policy decision such as raising a bus fare and eliminating bus routes and eliminating bus passes constitutes a constitutional violation. 
He went on to note that: 
The lesson that we should have walked away with is that race is a toxic circumstance, and that it is wrong to distribute benefits and burdens on the basis of race. 
I questioned Mr. Reynolds and I asked him about busing and how people in the minority community feel about busing. 
Mr. Reynolds replied: 
I think it is clear that most parents are concerned with the quality of education that their children receive, and most parents, black and white, do not care. Well, actually they prefer that it be a neighborhood school. More importantly, I think time has shown that forced busing has been an unmitigated disaster. 
Those were the words of Mr. Reynolds. I further asked him, had he seen cases like the Houston busing case, on which Mr. Bill Lann Lee was the attorney, and where lawyers, professional litigators, who were involved in these issues as a business, their livelihood, continued to pursue remedies that the children and the parents of the children do not want. Mr. Reynolds answered: `Yes.' 
Well, that was from Mr. Gerald Reynolds, an African-American citizen of this country, opposing Bill Lann Lee. Is he against African-Americans? I submit not. Is he against women? I submit not. Is he against Chinese-Americans? I submit not. Is he against civil rights? I say no. He's for civil rights. There is no doubt about that. 
Let me read you this excerpt from the testimony, in June, of Charlene F. Loen. Like Mr. Lee, she is a Chinese-American, and she gave some of the most poignant testimony I have heard before our committee. She actually came to tears. She talked about her son, Patrick, who wanted to attend Lowell High School in San Francisco, but he was prevented from attending that public high school because of a racial quota set up under a Federal court consent decree in 1983. Under the consent decree, she said: 
Hard work and good grades are not always enough. My son Patrick found out the hard way. 
I am quoting again: 
In 1994, Patrick applied to Lowell, with a test score of 58 out of a 69. That year, Lowell set the minimum score for Chinese students at 62. But then Lowell set the minimum scores for white students and other Asians at 58. Lowell set the minimum scores for blacks and Hispanics lower than that. So Patrick could have gotten into Lowell if he were white, Japanese or black. He was rejected because he was Chinese American. 
She went on: 
Discipline, hard work, and academic achievement should be rewarded. Patrick studied hard, he got the grades, and he was rejected because he is of Chinese descent. 
She went on: 
The year Patrick was rejected, the San Francisco school district announced the opening of a new academic high school, Thurgood Marshall. I went to the school district to apply for Patrick. Right away, the person at the office asked me, `Is Patrick Chinese?' I said, `yes,' and she said that the slots for the Chinese were already taken at Thurgood Marshall. I asked how could that be because the application period was not even over yet. She shrugged and said that that is just what the consent decree requires. Patrick also applied at three other high schools--Wallenberg, Washington, and Lincoln--and all three rejected him because they already had too many Chinese under the consent decree. 
Those were her words. That is not the way, I submit, we ought to operate our Government today. She felt very strongly about that. And this is a Chinese-American testifying before our committee. In November, she said the Federal judge who approved the consent decree approved a payment by the State of California of over $400,000 in legal fees to the NAACP, the legal defense fund, Bill Lee's unit, for opposing the lawsuit; in other words, the lawsuit that she had filed to try to get her son to be able to go to the school of her choice that he qualified to by objective standards. 
A judge denied a motion to end the consent decree. 
This is how she concluded her remarks. 
Under the consent decree can you be denied admission to public school because of your race by treating people as members of racial groups rather than as individuals with the same rights before the law. The consent decree has dashed the hopes of children, denied my son and many others the right to opportunities they earned through hard work and diligence, condemned children to needless busing, prevented parents from being involved in their school and thereby holding school administrators accountable, and divided the people of San Francisco. 
Divided the people of San Francisco. 
This is the way things have been in San Francisco for the past 14 years. 
Is Mrs. Loen against civil rights? I submit not. Is she against Chinese-Americans? No, she is not. She is a Chinese-American. Is she against women? No. Is she against minorities and civil rights? No. 
Let me read this testimony before the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution Federalism, and Property Rights chaired by Senator John Ashcroft. This is the statement of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. He was talking about the `legally ordained' set-aside in Federal highway funding that mandated a certain percentage of the money be spent toward minority contractors. 
This is what Senator McConnell recounted: 
Michael Cornelius recently spoke poignantly to this point before the Constitution Subcommittee in the House of Representatives. He explained that his firm [his business] was denied a Government contract under ISTEA [a Federal program] even though his bid was $3 million lower than his competitor's. Mr. Cornelius' bid was rejected because the Government felt that the bid `did not use enough minority- or women-owned subcontractors.' 
To comprehend the full extent of the Government's unconstitutional policy, you must understand that the Cornelius bid proposed to subcontract 26.5 percent of the work to firms owned by minorities and women, and, of course, the Government concluded that even that was inadequate. 
This is the kind of matter that the Adarand decision dealt with, and the Adarand decision is a decision Mr. Lee says he believes is bad constitutional law. But that is the Supreme Court of the United States, which in the Adarand decision set forth standards that basically demonstrate that these kind of set-asides are not fair. They are in violation of the equal protection clause of the Constitution of the United States. 
Mr. President, I would also like to quote one more witness who testified. This is Mrs. Sue Au Allen, a Chinese-American, the President of the United States-Pan American Chamber of Commerce, a national nonprofit organization representing Asian-American business men and women, and other professionals. 
She is a very impressive lady, and was very direct in what she had to say about the Lee nomination. She said: 
Mr. Lee's record gives me grave concern, Mr. Chairman. As a nation's top civil rights law enforcement official, he will advocate certain policies on race and gender issues that are contrary to constitutional guarantee of equal right and opportunity for all Americans and that will have a deleterious effect on racial and gender harmony in general and on the rights of many individuals in particular. 
She went on to say: 
When I look at the arguments he has made in the last 20 years to determine his understanding of what equal protection requires, I learned that he does not believe in civil rights for all. He believes in quotas, set-asides, and preferences based on race and gender. This is not my belief. The person who believes in civil rights for some based on race and gender is a wrong person for this job. 
She continues: 
And his organization's defense of continuing judicial control of the desegregation of Lowell High School in San Francisco for high admission standards required of students whose admissions are kept at 40 percent . . . 
She particularly mentioned that. This was just a few weeks ago. It is the same comment made by Mrs. Loen that I read earlier about Lowell High School in San Francisco. 
Mrs. Allen continues, describing the assault on Proposition 209, the California civil rights initiative. This is what she said:  
To bolster the assault on 209, Mr. Lee's Legal Defense Fund recruited the Federal Government as his ally. First, he filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program and said that the decline in minority admissions at the University of California violates affirmative action rules imposed on Federal contractors. 
This is the university: 
It argued that the lowered admissions reduced the number of minority graduate students that the university might hire in complying with Federal racial preference programs. 
This pushes legal theory, I submit, beyond any reasonable standard. This was for Mr. Lee's use. He is a private attorney now. He gained the support of his allies in the Department of Labor. 
Quoting Mrs. Allen: 
Second, although no student had ever complained about discrimination because of Proposition 209 or the University of California regents' vote to end racial preferences in admissions, Mr. Lee's Legal Defense Fund filed a complaint with the United States Department of Education attributing to discrimination the decline in minority admissions and enrollment at select University of California campuses. 
So, Mrs. Allen is making a significant point. What she was saying was that even though a private attorney, Mr. Lee has been adept at inducing the Federal Government to join with him in his legal theory. 
If confirmed in this position, he will, in fact, be the Federal Government, and he will have 250 attorneys at his disposal to send out on whatever cause he might deem appropriate. 
She goes on to say this:

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about our Nation's celebration of Veterans Day next Tuesday. In doing so, I would like to take a few minutes to tell a short story; a story that I think needs retelling from time to time lest we forget some of the history that makes our heritage so special. Please forgive my use of a little artistic license for the sake of narration. 
My story begins in the fall of 1947 in Birmingham, AL. Close to the drug store where this story begins is a memorial honoring the Confederate Army's 10th Alabama Regiment. The men of this incredibly fine unit made a now famous charge up the slope of Little Round Top at Gettysburg on a hot day in July 1864. Imagine, if you will, these brave souls charging, without hesitation, bravely up that wooded slope toward the Union's 20th and Maine, a unit known to many and commanded by Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. For many dressed in Blue and Gray, the last steps they would ever take were made that fateful day. 
This is not an unfamiliar story in war; men going away from their home and their families to place their lives on the line for their country; taking each breath in combat and wondering if it would be their last. Mr. Raymond Weeks, one of the heroes of this story, knew the horrors of war. He had just returned home from the Pacific theater. He knew as well the trials and tribulations of fighting in a war and he knew too of wearing the title of `veteran.' His circumstance, Mr. President, was similar to that of my father, now deceased, who had likewise just returned from the Pacific, to open a general store with a gristmill in the small community of Hybart, AL. 
On that fall day in 1947, Raymond had stopped in his local drug store where he bumped into some of his buddies who had also returned home from overseas. Talk at the drug store turned to the upcoming celebration of Armistice Day, started nationally just nine years before in 1938. You see, Mr. President, many Americans still remember when, on November 11 of each year, America and the world celebrated the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, the treaty commemorating the armistice that ended the First World War on the 11th hour, of the 11th day, of the 11th month of the year in 1918. Thus ended `the war to end all wars.' 
Yet, years later, World War II also stole the youth of many nations and 
many of Raymond's and my father's friends as well. Raymond Weeks suggested that the group should `do something' in town to honor the memory of those comrades who had fallen in battle. With that, this small group of men began planning a local celebration to honor not just the veterans of World War I and the Versailles Armistice, but of World War II, and American veterans of all wars. 
On Armistice Day, 1947 the very first Veterans Day parade was held in Birmingham, AL. The parade drew such a great turnout that it became a yearly event, even though there was no official national recognition of Veterans Day at that point. 
Over time Raymond Weeks formed a small committee and eventually traveled to Washington, DC, to approach then Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower with their idea for a national holiday. History records that General Eisenhower expressed immediate approval and referred the idea to Congressman Edward Rees of Kansas. Subsequently, H.R. 7786 became Public Law 380, a law which changed the name of Armistice Day to Veterans Day. Passed by Congress, the bill was signed into law, ironically, by President Eisenhower on June 1, 1954. 
What Raymond Weeks did was remarkable; even extraordinary. The Veterans Day Raymond Weeks helped to create does more, Mr. President, than just honor those who served in America's Armed Forces. Veterans Day, as hosted by Bill Voight and the National Veterans Day Committee and still celebrated annually in Birmingham, AL, extends its boundaries beyond those who fought in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, and Desert Storm, it extends its reach to those who serve today in the ships conducting NEO operations off the coast of Africa, in the tanks manning outposts in Bosnia, to the sandy slopes of the Sinai, and to the cold ridges of the DMZ in Korea. There should be no doubt that Veterans Day is a special day that pays annual homage to the ongoing sacrifices of our men and women in uniform. 
While we were home, safe, these veterans were spread around the globe protecting our liberty and freedom and our security. To them a great debt is owed. 
Veterans Day, Mr. President, acknowledges the responsibilities and the special burden's that our Nation's men and women shouldered in the past. It acknowledges too the responsibilities and burdens of those in uniform today. And it calls on each of us to honor the legacy of veterans past and the dedication of today's military personnel, by renewing our responsibility to ensure that our Nation remains the strongest on earth, fully able to defend its just national interests whereever and whenever they are challenged. 
To all those great Alabamians and Americans who paid the ultimate sacrifice, to all those who survived, and to those who serve today, it is fitting that we pause with a humble and grateful heart and say thank you for their sacrifices which have kept us free. 
God bless the United States of America and may we be worthy of His blessing. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
First, I would like to say how much I appreciate the excellent comments of the Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley. He believes deeply in improving the life and health of children, as you do, Mr. President, and have worked toward that end. 
I salute the work that has been done. It is a major step forward in improving foster care and the ability to adopt children in America, which is something this Congress, I think, will be able to take real pride in.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak about a dedication ceremony that will take place tomorrow afternoon in the city of Lineville in Clay County, AL. Mr. President, I would first like to take this opportunity to express my deep regret for not having been able to be in Lineville this afternoon with those who have gathered for the dedication of the Clay County Veterans Memorial Park. I would be remiss if I did not also take this opportunity to offer my sincerest thanks to Alabama State Senator Gerald Dial and the other members of the Veterans Memorial Board for working hard to make the Clay County Veterans Memorial Park a reality and for extending an invitation to me to participate in their dedication ceremony. 
Mr. President, I make these remarks tonight for one reason. Simply, It is about honor. Certainly, not personal honor. That is one variety we are all familiar with. No, the type of honor to which I am referring is the uncommon variety. It is the variety that we bestow as a tribute on special occasions for veterans and other heros in our society who made the supreme sacrifice. 
In less than 24 hours, my constituents will gather to honor all the men and women who, over the years, left their homes and loved ones, their jobs, friends and neighbors all over Clay County to answer a special calling. The veterans they honor might have grown up in Delta, in Ashland, in Cragford, in Hollins, in Millerville, in Barfield, in Lineville or anywhere in between, but even though they may have been separated by the miles and the years between them, a common thread ran through each of their lives. They were all connected by their love for this land and this country. 
We should take a moment to reflect on that for a minute--connected by a distinguishable act of love of country and a willingness to serve that country where ever it directed. Hence, Mr. President, I stand here tonight to join them in paying homage, to show our respect, and our sincerest appreciation for the sacrifices that these patriots made for our country. Sacrifices that ensured the freedom you and I enjoy today and our children's children will enjoy years from now. With the dedication of this memorial park they are simply saying thank you to all those who have gone before, those who believed enough in freedom to risk their lives. 
In commemorating the memory of these friends and loved ones, we are reflecting on a glorious past, but we are also pausing, I think, for a moment to look forward in time with a hopeful spirit and a pledge of unwavering support to the young men and women in communities all around this great Nation that we will unconditionally support them just as we supported those we honor today. 
The Clay County Veterans Memorial Park will be as much an emblem of the courageous spirit and bravery of patriots from yesteryear, as it will be a beacon of hope and source of strength for future generations. I pledge to do my part to make sure that we remain the strongest and greatest country in the world, and we defend our just national interest. 
Mr. President, ours is both an important and a unique moment in history. We no longer live in the bipolar world that shaped our lives and our political consciousness over the last half century. The monolithic presence of the Soviet Union has been replaced by new threats. We live in a rapidly changing world where our ability to adapt and our commitment to remain a world leader will be tested by both the cunning and the strong. The veterans being honored today defeated Nazi Fascism, brought Soviet Communism to its knees, were victorious against tyranny, and protected democracy and freedom around the world. They led our country through times of conflict and war to the edge of the 21st century. 
Had I been able to be with my constituents today, I would have reminded them that as our Nation moves forward we will face new national defense considerations. We must maintain a strong military, and I will give my full support to our men and women in uniform. The military must, I believe, be capable of protecting our interests and the lives of our soldiers in places like Bosnia, Korea, and the Middle East when asked to do so. We must therefore provide our service men and women with the best training, the best equipment, the best information, and the best overall opportunity for success under any circumstance, so that when they are called to perform, they will emerge victorious. 
We have approached a time of major historical significance in the area of foreign policy and international cooperation. We have new and exciting opportunities to promote peace and prosperity throughout the world that many of us may never have thought possible. The winds of democracy and economic prosperity now blow in Eastern Europe precisely because of the sacrifices of those being honored today. Mr. President, patriots from Clay County, AL fought and died to make this prosperity possible. The overwhelming desire on the part of counties around the world to emulate us--to be like America is a testament to our proud past and an example of fairness that is the hallmark of our society. 
We are, I truly believe, standing on the brink of a change of historic proportions. It represents a step forward for peace and cooperation that will surely carry us well into the 21st century. We must always remember those who made this possible. I am reminded of a quote by Gen. Douglas MacArthur on April 19, 1951, as he spoke before Congress. He said that, `Old soldiers never die, they just fade away.' Tomorrow will be a great day for Clay County. Memorial Park is for the veterans, living and dead, who fought so that freedom, our freedom, would never perish. It also represents that community's commitment to a memory of sacrifices made, and promises kept. 
Mr. President, I thank the citizens of Clay County for their individual sacrifices, and hope that they will find solace in this place they gather to dedicate today. It is also my hope that they will find solace in the knowledge that their sacrifices are honorable too, and as lasting and worthy as the sacrifices of those who have gone on before them. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, lately, a discussion has been undertaken about the question of civil rights. Some think civil rights means preferences, quotas, and set-asides; others say it principally means equality in the law. That has been a major bone of contention as we have considered the nomination of Bill Lann Lee, an able attorney, for the position of chief of the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. 
We have had a lot of discussions about this question in recent years, and it is an important issue as this Senate considers that nomination. But there are other matters that come before the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. It is a great division; it has played a tremendous role in the changing of race relations in America and has helped break down legal and de facto desegregation throughout this country. It has a great staff of 250 lawyers. 
But I think it is also a matter of significance and importance that the chief of the Civil Rights Division maintain clear and firm control and supervision over that Department. In recent years, as the situation in our Nation has changed, legal barriers to equality have been broken down, and actions by that Department have raised questions about the validity of their actions and whether or not the positions they are taking on a number of cases are worthwhile. 
I have heard complaints about that. As a U.S. attorney for 12 years, I saw this division operate. Sometimes the actions taken by the Department were valid, however in many cases their actions can fairly be characterized as questionable. As the attorney general for the State of Alabama, I have seen a number of instances that trouble me about the role and the legal position of the Department of Justice. Just this week, there was a major decision by the U.S. Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. That opinion rendered an important decision. One newspaper article, described this opinion as a `stinging rebuke" to the U.S. Department of Justice. The Federal court ordered the Department of Justice to pay $63,000 in attorney's fees to a Dallas County commission in Alabama over an election dispute that dragged on for 4 years. Let me read you some of the comments from that article. I think it points out the need to make sure that the person we have as chief of the Civil Rights Division is balanced and fair and treats everyone with the justice that the Department contends that they do. 
Calling this case `very troubling,' the appeals court blasted the Department of Justice for its continued refusal to pay legal fees and for its insistence that the white leadership on the Dallas County commission helped a candidate win an election contest. This is what the court said:  
A properly conducted investigation would have quickly revealed there was no basis for the claim of purposeful discrimination against black voters. 
The opinion also pointed out that the actual placement of Dallas County voters within districts was made by the predominantly black board of registrars. An attorney, John Kelly, who litigated the case for the county commission, said, `This is the toughest Federal court decision I have ever read.' 
Indeed, I would have to agree with that. It is remarkable. The decision means that the Federal Government will have to pay to the county commission, out of taxpayers' money, your money and my money, $62,872.49 into their fund, to pay for the attorneys, which the court found were having to defend a case that was unjustified. 
The opinion was written by a U.S. district judge from California who was sitting by designation on the eleventh circuit 
panel. Although the repayment of the attorneys fees is partial compensation to those aggrieved by the Department's actions, as this judge stated, `Unfortunately, we cannot restore the reputation of the persons wrongfully branded by the Justice Department as the public officials who deliberately deprived their fellow citizens of their voting rights. We also lack the power to remedy the damage done to race relations in Dallas County by the unfounded accusations of purposeful discrimination made by the Department of Justice.' 
The three-judge panel suggested to the Justice Department that it be `more sensitive' in the future `to the impact on racial harmony that can result from the filing of a claim of purposeful discrimination.' The court said it found the Justice Department's actions, `without a proper investigation of the truth, unconscionable.' 
`Hopefully,' the court goes on to say, `we will not again be faced with reviewing a case as carelessly investigated as this one.' 
Now, Mr. President, I think that the Department of Justice has an important role in this country to ensure equal rights, to make sure everyone has the right to vote, to make sure that there is equal justice under the law. But they also have a responsibility to be fair, to carry on their cases effectively, to be nonpartisan, to be objective, and to be careful in the cases they bring. This case went on for 4 years, when in fact, it could have been disposed of in short order with an effective investigation. 
So, whoever is chosen to head the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice will have an important task. I asked Mr. Lee when I interviewed him, if he would take control of this Department? Would he make sure that the attorneys in that Department are obeying the law and are actually doing justice and not injustice? Would he make sure that they would not engage in civil wrongs when focusing on civil rights?' Yes, this article will tell you that the Department of Justice can do civil wrongs and, in fact, they have done so. As attorney general of the State of Alabama I had occasion to witness this, as the following story illustrates. 
There was a question about whether or not the voting rights section of the Department of Justice had the power and the duty and the obligation to preclear--that is, approve--a law change in Alabama in which the judges on a panel went from five members to seven members who would be elected at large. They said that they did have a right to object to that, that that law could not take effect until they had approved it--read it, studied and approved it. We did not believe that was so. There was legal authority present, including a decision made by the U.S. Supreme Court, that clearly indicated to me as attorney general of Alabama that they had no authority to preclear that decision. So I said we were going to proceed with it, and they maintained their objection. 
Now, there is an interesting thing about this that you may not know. If you object to a ruling of the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, in Washington, DC, and you live in Alabama, you can't file a lawsuit in Federal court in Alabama to get a conclusion of the matter. Under the law, you have to file the lawsuit in Washington, DC, in Federal court, which is a very expensive process. I submit, Mr. President, they didn't think we would do it. They didn't think we cared enough about that principle to do so. But we told them they were wrong and they were going to lose this opinion, and we would file the suit. They called our bluff and refused to preclear or agree that they did not have control over this position. 
So we filed a suit, and the case proceeded for a short time. The U.S. Department of Justice then confessed--admitted--that they had no basis for their case, and conceded our point. 
I say to you, Mr. President, that you can say that was a mistake and some might say so. In my opinion, it was a heavyhanded application of the law. 
Those were good attorneys. They knew they didn't have to have a good legal basis for the position they took, and they tried to bluff the State of Alabama and force the State of Alabama to capitulate anyway. 
So this is the kind of thing that is important. All of us care about justice in America. Also, we care about the law being enforced, and we believe that civil rights attorneys can also make errors; civil rights attorneys can actually do civil wrongs. We believe that they have to obey the law, also. 
So I would just say that this points out another reason, as we debate who should be the head of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, that we select a person who is balanced, who is fair, who is objective, and who will follow the law, including the Constitution of the United States, the laws passed by this Congress, and the case authority of the courts of the United States. 
Mr. President, that concludes my remarks. I yield the floor. 
Mr. AKAKA addressed the Chair.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude today for the cooperation of my colleagues, and in particular my good friend and home State colleague, Senator Richard Shelby, as well as colleagues from Florida and Georgia and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch, and the chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee, Senator John Ashcroft, for their expedited consideration of the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa and Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River basin compacts that passed the Senate today. 
Our citizens in Alabama and the Southeast region have many benefits from an outstanding environment and a generous water supply. But population increases have made water resources extremely valuable. The water compacts passed today by the Senate are the first step in allowing the three States of Alabama, Georgia, and Florida to enter into legal, acceptable agreements which will ensure the water resources of the region are divided in a responsible and equitable way, which protects the environment and ensures a reliable supply of water for drinking, agriculture, and recreation. 
Passage of these water compacts is the result of nearly 20 years of work between the States of Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. Today's action represents only the initial step in a challenging process which must ultimately be carried through by these States. The water compacts themselves do not contain the formula for actually dividing the water resources, but serve only to grant permission to the States to create a formula themselves. Without the water compacts, it is likely my home State of Alabama, along with Georgia and Florida, would be forced into Federal court for protracted litigation to determine an equitable way to divide these resources. The action taken today will allow our States to enter into thoughtful negotiations rather than wasteful litigation to determine a permanent solution to our region's water resource problems. 
Mr. President, no remarks on this action by me today would be complete without my mentioning the work of Alabama Gov. Fob James and State Representative Richard Laird, who have worked tirelessly toward this end. Governor James has personally given his attention to the matter, and negotiations have been ongoing, as I have noted, for many years. Representative Laird has been very active in this entire process and has been the main spokesman for Alabama's effort for over 3 years. As a former attorney general in the State of Alabama and one who was involved in these activities, I know firsthand the personal commitment that Representative Laird has given to this effort. 
I also want to take this opportunity to recognize Mr. Craig Kneisel, the chief of the environmental section of the Alabama Attorney General's office. Craig Kneisel has been the chief of that environmental office since its founding around 20 years ago. He has given leadership and legal advice to this effort that has reached a good conclusion today. 
So we have made a major step toward making an equitable resolution of the water problems of these States, but we have to keep on going. There is no doubt that, as our population increases, as our economy grows, there will be greater and greater stress on these wonderful environmental resources. We must protect them and at the same time must make sure that economic growth is facilitated by having a healthy environmental resource such as these two river basins. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today so that this great body may momentarily reflect upon the importance of the bill we are about to vote on this afternoon. It is a bill whose beginnings extend back to early Spring, a bill that has been through many hurdles since then to include a major compromise impacting competition at depots around the country. I intend to vote yes for this bill and I encourage my fellow Senators to do the same. 
There have literally been thousands of differences between the House and Senate versions of this bill. However, what is important for Members of this body to understand is that on both sides of the aisle, in both Houses of Congress, we have fundamental support for maintaining the strongest national defense possible for America. This is not an easy task. We share differences in solutions to defense that range from management styles, to leadership, to modernization and procurement, to the vexing uncertainty of the funding levels required to sustain our forces in the field. 
The conference agreement was unanimously supported by the committee under the able leadership of Chairman Thurmond. On the major issues of Bosnia, the B-2, cooperative threat reduction and other issues, the bill is much closer to the Senate position than the House position. Equally important to me, the bill is consistent with the targets of the bipartisan budget agreement. 
The depot issue was certainly the most controversial provision in this year's bill. There are strong feelings on both sides of the aisle. As the committee noted recently, `many jobs are at stake, and neither side wants to lose them.' Certainly, I didn't want to lose any at our great depot in Anniston, AL. Nonetheless, I feel strongly that Chairman Thurmond's objective all along was to ensure fair competition and a level playing field. I feel he and the other members of the committee achieved just that. We have a fair compromise. We have an honest compromise. We have a product that the Department of Defense can work with. I think it's time to put our disagreements behind us and move forward in unity to support the men and women in uniform for whom this bill is designed. 
I plan to vote for this bill and I trust my colleagues will join me in making this vote an overwhelming one.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Senator from Indiana in a brief colloquy to clarify a language provision of this legislation regarding the Brilliant Antitank, or BAT Munition in development for the U.S. Army. There have been some in DOD that have questioned whether the intent of Congress is to cancel the basic BAT procurement program for future years. I maintain this is not our intent. The BAT program is a key component of the Army's long-range fire support against threatening armored forces, but has experienced some developmental difficulties in recent months. It is clear to all of us that in fiscal year 1998, BAT is not ready for full-scale production and the committee's action eliminates the funds for production and applies them to much-needed further development. This is a move which is supported by the U.S. Army and in no way indicates a change in their requirements. Would the Senator say that my understanding is correct?

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as I understand the proposed BAT language then, the committee is only eliminating basic BAT procurement for fiscal year 1998 and the committee intends for the basic BAT program, as well as the advanced sensor, to continue development through fiscal year 1998 at which time the committee will have an opportunity to evaluate the program's progress this time next year. Again, would the Senator conclude that my understanding is correct?

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the position of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights is important to our Nation. The most important reason is what it signals about the direction the President plans to take on key civil rights issues of the day. 
In my opinion, this Nation is moving in the right direction on civil rights. We have gone through a turbulent period where legal segregation has now been ended, and we are now ending a period during which the courts have used racial preferences and remedies to cure certain aspects of past discrimination. 
While this procedure can be defended perhaps in the short run, particularly when it is directly attached to a specific prior discriminatory act, such a policy cannot be a part of a permanent legal and political system. 
Our Supreme Court, which has led the drive to eliminate legal discrimination on a variety of fronts, is wisely taking a long-term view of the impact of racial preferences in America. After thoughtfully considering our future, the Supreme Court, in the Adarand case and in rejecting just this week the idea that California's civil rights initiative is unconstitutional and in other cases has clearly stated that this Nation must not establish a governmental system which attempts to allocate goods, services and wealth of this Nation on the basis of one's race, on the basis of the color of their skin. The result will be contrary to the equal protection clause of the great 14th amendment to our Constitution, and contrary to our goal of a unified America in which people are judged on the contents of their character and not on the color of their skin. 
Mr. President, with regard to the nomination of Bill Lann Lee of California to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, I want to say with confidence that he is a skilled and able attorney, an honest man, a man who appears to have integrity and the kind of characteristics that make for a good attorney. 
His entire career has been spent in skilled advocacy in the civil rights arena. He is a Columbia Law School graduate who could have practiced on Wall Street but chose public interest law instead, and he should be commended for that. Sadly, however, I must join the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch, and the former chairman of that committee, Senator Thurmond, who is here tonight and just made an excellent series of comments on this issue, to announce my opposition to Mr. Lee. Simply put, Bill Lee, like President Clinton, is outside the mainstream of American civil rights law, the very laws he would be charged with enforcing. 
While the American people and the Federal judiciary have steadily moved toward a color-blind ideal, Bill Lee has clung to a policy of racial preferences and spoils. Bill Lann Lee strongly advocates racial and gender preferences which are, in effect, virtually quotas in virtually every area of our society, including college admissions, congressional voting districts and employment. 
I believe a nation that draws voting districts on the basis of race, that uses race as a factor in college admissions and hiring and promotion decisions is, in fact, destined to have unnecessary racial strife and hostility and it does not bind us together as a nation. 
In my opinion, it would be unwise for the Senate to confirm Mr. Lee as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. The Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights is one of the most important law enforcement positions in the Federal Government. If confirmed, Mr. Lee would have a powerful arsenal of more than 250 lawyers at his disposal. 
After our hearings that I participated in and participated in his questioning, and after review of his record, I have concluded that Mr. Lee will continue to push for lawsuits, consent decrees and other legal actions that are outside the mainstream of current American legal thought. He sets the civil rights policy for the United States, and since his views are not in accord with the people, the Congress and the courts, he should not be confirmed in that position. 
Let me give you several examples. Last fall, the people of California, after full debate, passed proposition 209, California's civil rights initiative, which simply prohibits the State from discriminating against or granting preferences to anyone on the basis of race or gender. 
The very day after--he opposed that referendum--he lost that issue at the ballot box, Mr. Lee and his organization, the legal defense fund, filed suit arguing that proposition 209 was unconstitutional. This is a curious, even bizarre argument, because proposition 209 mirrors the language of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, one of the great civil rights acts that changed race relations in America. It also mirrors the 14th amendment. 
Even the ninth circuit, the most liberal circuit in America, unanimously rejected Mr. Lee's position. Moreover, on request for a rehearing, the full ninth circuit voted to deny a rehearing en banc. But even the most liberal circuit--it is considered the most liberal circuit in the country--rejected Mr. Lee's argument that proposition 209, passed by the people of California to eliminate racial preferences, was unconstitutional. This is what the court said:  
As a matter of conventional equal protection analysis -- 
That is the 14th amendment, the equal protection clause they are referring to---- 
As a matter of conventional equal protection analysis, there is simply no doubt that Proposition 209 is constitutional . . . After all, the goal of the Fourteenth Amendment to which this Nation continues to aspire, is a political system in which race no longer matters. The Fourteenth Amendment, lest we lose sight of the forest for the trees, does not require what it barely permits. 
That means that the 14th amendment certainly does not require quotas and preferences and it certainly, if anything, will only permit them if they meet the strict test of scrutiny. 
A lawsuit against proposition 209 is another example of those who, when they lose their issue at the ballot box, have taken to the habit of going to Federal courts to ask the courts to overrule the will of the people through the elected representatives or through the initiative process. 
At his confirmation hearing, Lee again stated his odd argument that proposition 209 is unconstitutional. As Senator Hatch said, this is not an itty-bitty issue whether or not proposition 209 is constitutional. 
This initiative was a good initiative, carefully drawn, fully considered by the people of California. And Mr. Lee continues to assert to this day that it is violative of the Constitution of the United States. This is not fair to California, and we should not subject this Nation to those kinds of views. 
Not surprising, just this week the Supreme Court of the United States rejected his position on proposition 209 when it denied certiorari. It refused to review the ruling of the California court, the ninth circuit court, and held the ninth circuit opinion intact. 
It is important to note, I think, for the Members of this body, that this is the position of President Clinton. He adheres to the same view about proposition 209 being unconstitutional. And his Justice Department joined the ACLU and Bill Lee's legal defense fund and filed an appeal arguing that 209 was unconstitutional. In effect, the President of the United States is asking the unelected judiciary to overrule the well-debated and well-considered initiative of the people of California. 
So I think it is important for this body, as we consider this nomination, to consider what kind of message we are sending when we either confirm or reject Mr. Lee. 
I think we need to send a message that this body stands with the people and the courts and not this strained view of proposition 209. 
There are a couple of other examples that I think point out the position of Mr. Lee on racial preferences that indicate that he would not be a fit nominee for this position. 
In recent years, the Supreme Court, in the Croson decision and the Adarand decision clearly held that racial preferences are unconstitutional. The Supreme Court now subjects all Government racial preferences to what is called strict judicial scrutiny. As you know, it is very difficult, Mr. President, for a government program to withstand strict scrutiny. 
At his confirmation hearing however, Mr. Lee badly mischaracterized the spirit of these cases. He stated that the Croson and Adarand decisions stand for the proposition that `affirmative action programs are appropriate if they are conducted in a limited and measured way.' 
This is not the position that the Supreme Court stated in Adarand. It greatly undermines that important decision. And it would be unwise for this body to confirm a nominee who would not faithfully follow the Adarand decision. 
As Senator Hatch, who chaired the committee, said so eloquently yesterday on the Senate floor, Bill Lee's description of Adarand purposely misses the mark of the Court's fundamental holding that such programs are presumptively unconstitutional. 
Moreover, Bill Lann Lee testified in his confirmation hearings that he was opposed personally to the holding in Adarand. I asked him what his personal view was. He said he personally opposed that ruling. Senator John Ashcroft asked Mr. Lee whether the set-aside program at issue in Adarand is unconstitutional, where a set-aside was given to a contractor simply because of their race or sex. 
In response, Mr. Lee noted that the Supreme Court in Adarand had remanded the case to the district court, which promptly, by the way, ruled the program unconstitutional. And in so doing, the district court stated: 
I find it difficult to envisage a race-based classification that is narrowly tailored. 
But despite the district court's strong holding, Lee, like the Clinton Department of Justice, continues to state and continues to believe that `this program is sufficiently narrowly tailored to satisfy the strict scrutiny test.' 
Mr. Lee simply refuses to accept the fact that strict scrutiny is an exceedingly difficult and high standard for a government agent to meet before it can establish racial preferences, that is, before it can give preferences to somebody for no other reason than their race. 
Under Mr. Lee's interpretation, all of the approximately 160 Federal racial preference programs that now exist would continue to be constitutional, although most scholars would say that under the Adarand decision, many of them, if not most of them, would fail to meet constitutional muster. 
So, Mr. Lee's interpretation of Croson and Adarand would make these seminal decisions virtually irrelevant. Almost any program could survive his definition of the strict scrutiny standard. 
Mr. President, America needs an Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights who will honestly, soberly, and accurately read and apply the law--even when he disagrees with it. 
Unfortunately, as his confirmation hearing and followup answers indicate, he has been unable to shed his role as an activist, a partisan civil rights litigator. If confirmed, Lee would support the constitutionality of racial preferences and use his team of some 250 lawyers to further an agenda that is not in keeping with the current state of American law. 
Let me talk about another example that is important for us to consider. 
Forced busing. Mr. Lee sued extensively over the years on issues involving busing. And once, for example, in Brown versus Califano, in 1980, a Supreme Court case, Lee challenged the constitutionality of a congressionally passed statute, passed by this Senate and the House, that prohibited the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare from requiring States to bus children for racial purposes. 
Of course, under the statute, States could adopt forced busing if they wanted, and the Federal courts could still order busing. The statute merely prohibited the Department of HEW from forcing States to bus children on its own motion. 
In his brief challenging that law, Mr. Lee stated that the congressional amendments `demonstrate discriminatory intent to interfere with desegregation.' 
Of course, that is an unfounded and unfair charge to make. Many people--I know Senator Byrd, on the other side of the aisle, had led the fight for that statute. He was not trying to undue and return to segregation. He simply was concerned, as millions of Americans have been, that the experiment with busing was not working. And he did not want the Department of Education, on its own, requiring it, and since, as years have gone by, it has been well-recognized that the experiment with busing has not achieved the goals that were intended, and is, in essence, for all practical purposes, a failure. 
Parents of all races oppose mandatory busing, and the law in Brown versus Califano reflected this. Again, the Federal courts rejected Lee's argument and upheld the statute. But that is just another example of where Mr. Lee has sued to implement a political agenda that he lost during the democratic process. That is, he lost it in the hearts and minds of the people and through their elected representatives. And he, therefore, sought to have the courts overturn that. 
In another forced busing case, Mr. Lee wrote the following in his brief. This is what he wrote:  
The term `forced busing' is a misnomer. School districts do not force children to ride a bus, but only to arrive on time at their assigned schools. 
I think many people feel that that is the kind of comment that shows arrogance and insensitivity to those who are concerned about children who have no way to go to school but by bus, to be told, `Well, you don't have to ride a bus. You just have to show up at a certain school on time.' 
In conclusion, Mr. President, America is at a crossroads in the civil rights debate. The American people believe overwhelmingly that government services and benefits should be administered in a color-blind fashion. As a nation we have made tremendous progress toward racial harmony, and though our work to eradicate racism is not finished and much bias and prejudice still exists in our land that we should not tolerate and should seek to eliminate, we should be proud of the great progress that has been made in the past 30 years. 
Mr. President, it gives me no pleasure to announce this vote against Mr. Lee. He is an admirable person, a fine lawyer. Please make no mistake, my opposition to him is in no way an attack on his integrity and character. However, his positions, particularly his tendency to file lawsuits to promote his agenda and his misreading of Supreme Court precedents, simply make him the wrong person at the wrong time to be the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Numerous scientists, including several who have testified on this issue before the Environment and Public Works Committee, have stated that the size, shape, or chemical composition of the PM that is causing the alleged adverse health effects is unknown. There are various theories--sulfates, acids, transmetals, ultrafines--regarding the potential bad actor. 
During testimony before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, we learned that the EPA based its setting of the new particulate matter standard on inconclusive scientific data. In one EPA study, which attempted to show a relationship between levels of particulate matter and mortality and morbidity in Birmingham, AL, the author of the study admitted that if humidity was considered in the model, the effects of particulate matter on morbidity and mortality was statistically insignificant. 
Billions will need to be spent by individuals, industry, and State and local governments to meet compliance with the administration's PM2.5 standard. Unless the problem is clearly identified before control programs are implemented, there is no assurance that there will be any health benefits resulting from the new standards. In fact, the new standards themselves may bring adverse health effects as an unintended consequence caused by a lower standard of living. 
Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that your bill addresses the lack of scientific evidence to justify the newly promulgated air quality standards. Science on this matter needs to be completed in order to obtain a clearer understanding if there is a problem and then what needs to be done to address the problem. This measure will begin the process of a strong scientific overview. I support the immediate direction for scientific research.

Mr. SESSIONS. With regard to that, I was, I could say, a victim. That is the way I saw it with that very type of ad late in the campaign asking people to call Jeff Sessions and say you are opposed to A, B, C, or D--to things he had done while in office. 
I think we can take two approaches to it. It fundamentally troubles me that the League of Conservation Voters do not feel free to run an ad and say vote against this guy just like the people who ran ads against me. Why shouldn't we just let them do it? They should have to put their name on it and say who is funding it.

Mr. SESSIONS. I think we have to consider the problem of trying to contain free speech in America. I really am troubled by it. I was a victim of it. I got angry at the time. Now I wonder why I should feel obliged to tell those trial lawyers and plaintiff lawyers who opposed some of my filed suits that they can't run an ad and say my ideas are wrong and I shouldn't be elected. 
As a matter of fact, I am troubled by that.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I join with the Senator from Wyoming in his remarks. Last year, I served as attorney general for the State of Alabama and dealt with this precise issue. There is a considerable amount of litigation going on in the country resulting and culminating from the Seminole Indian case that was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court last year. The basic problem is that under Federal gambling law, there appears to be some confusion as to whether the Secretary of the Interior can intervene in the negotiating process between States and Indian tribes with regard to the kinds of gambling that would be allowed in the State. 
For example, in Alabama, we have one particular Indian tribe that has three distinct parcels of land, as I recall, in various parts of Alabama. If the Secretary of the Interior were to allow the tribe to have casino gambling at any one site, they would also be able to have a casino at the other two places within Alabama. That result has been resisted very steadfastly because three major gambling casinos would, in fact, let the wall down. Casino gambling would spread throughout the State, and it would not make any difference what the people of Alabama felt about gambling or casinos in general as the casinos would be built without ever having put the matter before the people of Alabama for consideration. 
This is a very important national issue. It is a very important issue for those who believe gambling should not be spread and for those who believe that the growth of gambling should only occur when the people have voted on it. Allowing the Secretary of the Interior to unilaterally sanction tribal gambling is a way to get around popular elections that would allow local people and local officials to decide whether to allow or disallow gambling. So it has a real serious effect. The gambling industry has suggested repeatedly that they think if a State does not go along with their desire to have casinos on the reservations, then they could approach the Secretary of the Interior and get his permission. In fact, they have said that in Alabama for some time. 
As attorney general, my office researched the law governing this issue, and I came to the conclusion that the Secretary of the Interior did not have the ability to sanction tribal gambling in this manner. In fact, I wrote him a letter in June of last year which explained the legal arguments which appear to preclude him from exerting such authority. But the possibility that the 
Secretary does retain such authority has remained a matter of discussion among those involved in the question of the spread of gambling in America, and there are progambling forces that have suggested that the Secretary of the Interior does have that power. 
This amendment, I think, would simply clarify the legislative intent Congress had when it passed the Gambling Act a number of years ago. This amendment would not allow the Secretary of the Interior to override the popular will of the people in the States where tribal gambling is at issue. I think it is very good policy. 
I salute the Senator from Wyoming. I think he is right on point. If the Secretary of the Interior were to be inclined to attempt to assert authority in this area, we need to stop it. And if he doesn't intend to intervene and if he does not intend to assert such power, he should not be offended by this legislation because I think it merely reflects the will of this Congress. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I am honored to have the opportunity to join Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas in support of this bill which I believe certainly answers all the objections of those who are concerned that somehow we would be cutting support for arts in America. 
It answers the concerns of those who believe that the National Endowment for the Arts, as shown by its own inspector general's office, has mismanaged itself, has not managed the taxpayers' money--money taken from working citizens all over America--who have entrusted it to their Government in hopes that Members of this body will appropriate it wisely and effectively to further national goals. 
Our bill says, all right, we can fund arts, but we want to do it a different way. We are tired of trusting that inside group, the elite corps, that has been distributing moneys, in my opinion, unfairly, for quite a number of years. 
It is quite an interesting fact that six cities in this Nation receive one-third of the moneys from the entire National Endowment for the Arts. This chart will reflect that and give some appreciation for this fact. The big cities, the wealthiest cities in the world, really, are the ones receiving the most money. That is because the distribution of that money is being decided by a group in Washington that is not connected to the arts communities in places all over America--whether it is Indiana, Kansas, Ohio, Alabama or Arkansas. They are not connected with those communities. So they tend to further the people they are dealing with. It has been going in drastically unfair proportions to cities that are wealthier than any cities in the world. We think that is a major factor that we ought to 
think about today. 
New York City itself received more money than 29 different States, including my State of Alabama. Madam President, 75 percent of the money, as Senator Hutchinson has pointed out, 75 percent of these moneys have gone in what may be considered a political direction. Seventy-five percent has gone to the districts of Democratic Congressmen. That, I think, should concern people, because a majority of the citizens of this country have elected their representatives to be Republicans. It is not fair that the money be distributed just to the Democrats. 
They made very, very poor funding decisions. They funded programs that are arcane, bureaucratic, bizarre, and often just plain silly, and not supporting funding for programs that are worthy and needy. 
In my hometown of Mobile, AL, we have an opera that celebrated its fiftieth anniversary a few years ago. A group of citizens who love the music and fine arts came together and formed that organization. It received a paltry $4,000 from the National Endowment for the Arts, whereas, as Senator Ashcroft so eloquently talked about yesterday, this organization gave $1,500 to a poem consisting of one word--L-I-G-H-G-H-T. I don't know what it says or what language it is but they spent that much, and we only got $4,000 for an opera that does outstanding work in our community. 
The opera in Mobile performs works that I think anyone can support, `La Boheme,' and `Pirates of Penzance,' one of my favorites, just last year. In `Pirates' I recall the great phrase, he is the very model of a modern major general, he knows all things, agricultural, chemical and mineral, but he didn't know how to fight a war. That was a good lesson. Arts do teach us. We learn from those kind of things. 
I am not against art. I think we can do a better job of supporting. I am willing to support arts funding. This bill represents a huge infusion of money into the arts community all over America in virtually every State. 
Look at this: Alabama goes from $750,000 to $1.6 million, a $900,000 increase; Alaska shows a $50,000 increase; Arizona, a $600,000 increase; Arkansas, a $770,000 increase; California, a $1 million increase; Colorado, a $97,000 increase; Connecticut, a $127,000 increase; Delaware, a $152,000 increase; Washington, DC, $1.8 million reduction. Washington, DC, has money already funded for the National Gallery of Art, the Kennedy Center, and many other activities in this community by this body. 
Madam President, I say that art is valuable. Good art does uplift. All of us who care about a greater America should support the arts. We should support fine arts. But just as good art uplifts, poor art can demean and undermine the qualities of a great Nation. 
Too often, this organization has supported art that is not healthy, `art from the gutter,' as has been said. Just this past year, as was demonstrated on `Dateline' with Jane Pauley this summer, a special on the National Endowment for the Arts showed explicit homosexual activities on the screen using a $31,000 grant by the National Endowment for the Arts. 
One of the reasons they say they want to remain in existence is because they helped set the standard, they are the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. What kind of approval is that, for this Government to fund obscene and pornographic material with taxpayers' money, against and contrary to the basic and deepest decent views of the average citizen in our Nation? 
Madam President, 45 States will get more. Our orchestras in virtually every State will get more. Our museums will get more. Our theaters will get more. Our folk art will have more opportunities for additional funding. 
I submit this proposal answers all of the objections of the critics who say that we should continue to fund arts. It continues to fund arts at a greater degree than we have done before and eliminates the mismanagement that we have seen in Washington. 
This is a good bill. I urge all my colleagues to support it. It is time to bring to an end an agency that has abused its power, who for year after year after year has come before this body and promised to do better but does not do so. 
It is time to bring that agency to an end and take the taxpayers' money and spend it wisely in real support of real art all over America. 
Madam President, that concludes my remarks. I note that Senator Jesse Helms, who voted to end all funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, also has expressed a wish to join in as a cosponsor to this amendment. I think that should be noted for the Record. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. I say to the eloquent Senator from Connecticut, to talk about retreating from the arts, this is not the appropriate argument here. We are talking about spending more money directly for the arts. 
As he was talking, I did a quick look at how the State of Connecticut would fair under a block grant program, and they would go from $1,265,000 to $1,392,000, actually increase $128,000 in real moneys they can use for arts in the State of Connecticut. But I would also add, Connecticut is one of the wealthiest States, I think perhaps the wealthiest State in America. It is a State with a great tradition of arts, but I notice they received 28 grants last year totaling $1,059,000--28 grants, $1,059,000. Under our plan they would receive more money than that. 
But let me tell you, I represent the people of the State of Alabama, and I have had three groups representing orchestras in my State in my office. I know of the great Shakespeare theater in Montgomery. I am aware of the opera and museums in Mobile. We have a great history of arts, too, but we received only 11--not 28. We received 11 grants at only $540,000, even though we have more people in the State of Alabama paying taxes to this country than they do in the State of Connecticut. 
One of the real problems with this program is it has not allocated the money fairly. How can I support a program that takes money from taxpayers in Alabama to support the wealthiest States in art endeavors when we have art endeavors we are striving every day to enhance and improve? 
Bureaucracies have never created art. Nothing of beauty has come out of a committee. It takes the intelligence and genius of individual citizens to do it. So I say it is the wrong approach to think that we can send money to Washington, DC, and that they can somehow decide how to nourish art. That is not the way it is going to happen. Let us put that money out into the States, to the arts councils of the States, and let them look at how they can contribute the money to those budding artists who need money, to those orchestras that need just that extra amount to keep their doors open, to assist those communities that are working hard to raise money to preserve folk art. 
That is what we ought to be doing. I do not think there is any doubt about it. This is as clear a vote as I have ever seen in this Senate. The choice is clear. Do we send money to Washington to allow them to mismanage it and a bureaucracy to use almost 20 percent or do we send this money out to the arts councils around this Nation so they can use it to improve the operas and orchestras and museums of our States throughout our Nation? That is what we ought to do. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator from Arkansas has a minute, I would like to ask a question or two about this subject. I certainly support him in his effort. 
I believe it was Senator Helms yesterday who talked about substantial grants being given to Harvard University, which has an endowment of over $6 billion, I believe, and Yale University. Does the Senator know if those figures are correct? Are there universities, let me ask, in Arkansas who could use funding from the National Endowment for the Arts equally as those great universities?

Mr. SESSIONS. Whitney funding almost matched the entire funding of the State of Alabama. It is a concern. 
We have one of the finest Shakespeare festivals in the world. As a matter of fact, the Shakespeare theater in Montgomery is well renowned, and people have contributed very heavily of themselves. The former Postmaster General Winton Blount had gone beyond the call of duty in helping create this facility. We only got $15,000 for that premier, world-class facility that is supported substantially by the gifts of local residents. 
Let me ask you, if the money came to the State, would they be able if they so chose to give more money to the Shakespeare theater in Montgomery? Would they be able to do that?

decision of where and how to spend that money primarily is being decided by a group of people in Washington. Under this procedure not only will 45 States have more money--correct me if I am wrong--45 States will have more money, but they will also have more control and be able to make the decisions that they feel would be the best use of that money; is that correct?

Mr. SESSIONS. I understand one of the grants that was reported yesterday went to Philipps Academy, one of the most exclusive private prep schools, I think, in America. That is what I understood the reference to be. Do you think there are schools, public schools, throughout Arkansas and Alabama and other States in this Nation that would also likewise be able to make a claim for this money? And are any of those receiving any moneys from the National Endowment for the Arts in Arkansas and Alabama? In Alabama no private or public schools are receiving money as happened in the Northeast.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I agree with that and I support this bill wholeheartedly. 
I had an outstanding conversation with the three leaders and directors of three orchestras in Alabama. They are concerned about funding. They need the little funding that we do get. It helps them. They do not want to lose that. I can understand that. I asked them if we could come up with a way that will leave the bureaucracy and put more money in your hand, with more freedom to spend it as you wish, would you support that? And they said, yes, of course they would. 
I know some people believe and have committed themselves to supporting the National Endowment for the Arts, but the truth is it is not performing in a good and healthy way, it is not doing a good job of putting money to the arts, it is not invigorating the arts and providing leadership for an enhancement of the good and beautiful and fine in America. Too often, it is, in fact, participating in a degradation of the quality of art in America. 
What we need to do is make sure it is done right. I believe the people at the Alabama Arts Council, the arts councils in the other States around this country, if given the opportunity, would spend that money wisely. They would be much less likely to give it to the arcane, the pornographic, the bizarre, and the just plain silly that is so often happening today. It is just not acceptable. 
It is time for this body to follow through. It is time for this body, after years of begging and pleading with the National Endowment for the Arts to do a better job to manage their money better, to put an end to it and make sure that what we do actually supports the arts in an effective way. That is why I support this amendment. 
I am so proud of the Senator from Arkansas for his outstanding work on it, the Senator from Michigan, Senator Abraham, and the Senator from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, for their outstanding teamwork in putting this proposal together, which is a win-win situation for all America. It puts more money in the arts, and it will eliminate waste, bureaucracy, and silly funding projects. 
I think it is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to join with my good friend from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson in cosponsoring what I think is an outstanding amendment to the fiscal year 1998 Interior Department appropriations bill, an amendment which will do more for the arts in America than we have ever done before. Simply put, the Hutchinson/Sessions amendment will produce more diversity and quality in the arts. We need and I strongly support a healthy arts community in America. It is important and it is valuable. 
Madam President, I attended a liberal arts college. I believe in having quality arts to lift and improve the lives of American citizens. I think we ought to strengthen it. I encourage and salute those who contribute selflessly to the symphonies and museums and all sorts of artistic activities in their communities. This is what helps make us the great culture and Nation that we are. I want to make sure that people understand that our goal in passing this amendment is one and one goal only, to eliminate the Washington waste, bureaucracy and mismanagement while continuing to support in a very real way the arts in this country. 
Madam President, I oppose the systematic elitism in funding for the arts. I oppose funding of the arcane, the pornographic, the bizarre and just plain silly. I oppose funding to the politically correct crowd and I oppose the partisan funding, as the Senator from Arkansas has so eloquently pointed out. So many of these funds go for partisan reasons. We can do better with our funding process, and we have far too much money going in directions that are not healthy for America. 
I know everybody has a different opinion of art. There is a piece of art work in my hometown of Mobile, AL, a metal structure that is now rusted that a distinguished artist in town was recently commenting about. Someone said, `Well, they wanted something that would attract people's attention.' And he said, `Well, you can hang a dead horse in the square and that will attract people's attention but it won't be art.' 
Now, I know there is difference of opinion as to what art is and what we should do about it, but I feel very strongly that we can do better in managing our moneys. 
I am very familiar with the situation of the museum in Mobile, which wanted and sought a grant to receive funding to do art work in the foyer of their auditorium. They got the money, but they were told by the NEA that the artist had to be from New York, and by a NEA preselected artist, and she chose some art work on a burlap type of material. It stayed up for a few years and has now been removed and is currently being stored in the basement of the museum. 
But again, I suppose that expenditure was counted as an expenditure to Alabama when in fact it was really an expenditure to New York. So I submit to the Members of this body that we can be for the arts, but we must make sure that the moneys we spend are spent wisely on the arts. 
As to the National Endowment for the Arts, I say it has had its chance. Year after year after year they have come before this body, and they have faced strong criticism and questions about their mismanagement and poor funding decisions and still nothing has changed. Madam President, I submit that we can do more and that we can do better with this money. 
The sad fact is that the National Endowment for the Arts is captive of an artistic elitism complicated by an insider cronyism and political favoritism undermined by mismanagement and wholly without a vision to make a difference for arts in America. In fact, we have learned, as we have studied the numbers, that only 15 percent of the grants, in fiscal year 1997, by the NEA went to new groups; 85 percent of the grants are just the re-funding of the same old art programs which the NEA has funded before. 
The Hutchinson-Sessions amendment does more for the arts. It takes the Senate appropriations figure, $1,060,000, which has already been propounded in the bill before us today and it eliminates the Washington bureaucracy and sends all the money down to the people. It expands the money to all the regions and States in this country. 
I would like to show you a chart that indicates the mission statement of the NEA. The mission statement clearly states:  
To foster the excellence, diversity and vitality of the arts in the United States, and to broaden public access to the arts. 
Madam President, when you have only six cities receiving one-third of the national expenditures, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, and Washington, DC, we are not broadening public access to the arts. And when we have one city, New York City, in fiscal year 1997 receiving more money than a total of 29 other States, including my home State of Alabama, something is wrong. The National Endowment for the Arts is not administering these grants fairly, wisely, or effectively. 
Madam President, these are not just my figures or some Republican agenda. NBC's `Dateline' with Jane Pauley on July 17, 1997, exposed these very figures. They pointed out just how disproportionate the funding is. They pointed out that the NEA provided a $31,000 grant for a film called `Watermelon Woman' which involved sexually explicit homosexual activities, which was paid for entirely by the American taxpayer. 
People say, Well, you don't believe in the first amendment, Jeff. You don't respect freedom of the arts. 
I respect the freedom of the arts. I respect the first amendment. I am an attorney, and I believe very deeply in the first amendment, but I must say I don't think the hard-working taxpayers of Alabama, who are getting drastically shortchanged in this funding process, ought to be required to fund things that simply offend their sense of decency and their standards of ethics and faith. It is just not the kind of thing we ought to do, and we have every right as representatives of the people to come before this body and demand that governmental agencies adhere to proper standards and spend their money wisely and effectively. And when they do not, we have every right to abolish those agencies and shift that money in a way which will improve the livelihood of the people. 
NBC's `Dateline' talked about the Whitney Museum in New York, which has a $30 million endowment, receiving a $400,000 NEA grant last year. That is nearly as much money as the entire State of Alabama received last year from the National Endowment for the Arts, and I am also offended by Chairman Jane Alexander's suggestion that artistic endeavors only appear in certain select areas of the country. 
The distinguished Senator from Montana, Senator Baucus, discussed the Shakespeare in the Park festival in his home State of Montana. I would just point out to the Senator, that under this amendment, as we propose it, the State of Montana would receive a $165,000 increase in funding. If Alabama only had 8 or 10 projects approved by the NEA--Montana with less people probably has about the same number--that would be $16,000 additional for each grant recipient in the State of Montana under our amendment. State after State after State shows benefits and funding increased under our proposal. Over 12 or more States receive twice as much funding. States like Michigan, Alabama, Florida, Indiana receive twice as much funding under the Hutchinson-Sessions amendment as under the present NEA formula for distributing grants. This is an outrage, I submit, in the that way we have allowed for this funding formula to continue. 
Madam President, our amendment will eliminate unnecessary bureaucratic spending. It eliminates the arcane, pornographic, bizarre, and just plain silly projects that are being funded by the National Endowment for the Arts. It ends the political favoritism that is being uncovered, which clearly shows that we are not spending the money in an effective way. 
So this, I submit to the Members of this body, is a very important vote. We have the opportunity today without any increase in taxes, to provide a historic infusion of funds to local artists in every State across this country. It is critical that we send the money to the States where they can wisely and effectively spend it. 
Madam President, if the money is sent directly to my home State of Alabama, the Alabama Shakespeare Festival in Montgomery, one of the finest facilities in the world--a facility which Sir Anthony Hopkins referred to as the finest Shakespeare facility he has ever performed at--would receive more than the $15,000 they received last year from the National Endowment for the Arts. 
Madam President, I feel very strongly about this amendment. I salute my colleague from Arkansas, Mr. Hutchinson, for the hard work he has put into it, and I am honored to be an original cosponsor of it. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

No rollcall votes will occur during Monday's session. Any votes ordered on amendments to H.R. 2107 will be set aside, to occur at a time to be determined by the majority leader. It is our hope that the Senate will conclude debate on the Interior bill by Tuesday. Therefore, Members are encouraged to contact the managers of the bill to schedule floor action on any possible amendments. As Members are aware, this is the next-to-last appropriations bill remaining for Senate consideration; the last being the District of Columbia appropriations. Therefore, Members' cooperation is appreciated in the scheduling of floor action as we attempt to conclude action on both the Interior appropriations bill and the District of Columbia appropriations bill next week. 
As a reminder to all Members, there will be no rollcall votes on Monday, and the next rollcall vote will be a cloture vote on the substitute amendment to S. 830, the FDA reform bill, which will occur on Tuesday at 10 a.m., under rule XXII. All first-degree amendments to S. 830 must be filed by 1 p.m. on Monday.

First, do you know whether the attorneys in the Minnesota case are being compensated on a contingent fee basis, that is, in which they would get a percentage of the recovery, and in many of these States they have done not much more than file a lawsuit, and already the tobacco industry is willing to pay large sums of money which would enable attorneys to receive huge fees for almost no work? I understand perhaps Minnesota is different and that they may be, perhaps, the only State in which the attorneys are employed on an hourly basis. Does the Senator know whether that is true or not?

Mr. SESSIONS. That is the first one. 
Second, is the Senator aware that, with regard to the receipt or copying of the documents, those are expenses which are not covered by this bill, or at least this bill provides a full payment of expenses to attorneys who incur them legitimately, even in furtherance of these lawsuits, and would be reimbursed? I pose those two questions to the Senator.

Mr. SESSIONS. Did the Senator know that this Senator refused to take money from the tobacco industry as attorney general and has sought tougher laws against the sale of tobacco to children and is not a tool or pawn of any tobacco company? In fact, I am offended it would be suggested otherwise. 
I believe tobacco is a very unhealthy substance. I think it is quite plain it causes cancer and premature death, and we ought to do everything we legitimately can to reduce its use. In fact, I am supporting the amendment of the Senator from the State of Illinois and also of the Senator from Maine, Senator Collins, that would prevent them from having a $50 billion benefit. My concern is $14 billion in legal fees to many attorneys who do not deserve anything like that kind of fee.

Mr. SESSIONS. I think there is some discussion about us voting at 10:45. I think that would be agreeable with me if there is no objection. I think I indicated to the Senator from Illinois that I might need 15 minutes. That would be for me, personally. I think there are some other Senators that would want to talk during that time on this issue. I would be prepared to agree to that, but I would not want to limit my own time, the whole argument, in favor of this bill, to 15 minutes. 
I want to say that to the Senator so I am not misleading him about the time.

My concern about that is that the opposition to this amendment has already been talking at least 20 minutes, so I do not think it would be appropriate and I would not be able to agree to an evenly divided 22 minutes on each side. Perhaps if you added 15 minutes to that to our side and we voted at 11 o'clock, I would be prepared to consent to that.

Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his comments. He is a very thoughtful Member of this body and watches after the taxpayers' money with great interest. I think his comments are right on point. I am delighted to have him share those with us today. 
We are talking about allowing $5 million in attorney's fees to be paid. In addition to that, we are talking about allowing unlimited amounts of money to be spent for expenses in a litigation. That could be for computerization, committees, receiving records, clerks analyzing records and collating records, filing records, and storing records. 
I have been an attorney for a long time. This idea about 30,000 documents, that is what you normally say when you come to court and you are not ready to go to trial and you say, `Judge, we have 5,000 documents.' Well, probably 4,999 of them are some sort of receipts or documents that do not even need reviewing, have no real significance to the issue at hand, but there may be a few in there that do. That is a price of fame about how many documents it is--suggesting the great complexity of the case that may have very little to do with the complexity of the case. 
Let me say this, there has been a lot of talk about big tobacco. I am not supporting big tobacco. I am supporting the amendment that is on the floor today. 
What I would like to say is there is another big political force in this country, there is another big force in this country that attempts to work its will, and that is the plaintiff lawyers. They are one of the major contributors to campaigns in this Nation. They receive settlements of millions of dollars in lawsuits and contribute millions of dollars to people, politicians and judges and others who further their view of what litigation is about. 
Now, I believe in litigation. I am not against litigation. I am not against the lawsuits. I do not want to pass a bill that would stop these lawsuits. I am going to tell you we are talking about not just millions of dollars, not just tens of millions of dollars, not just hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees. We are talking about billions of dollars, tens of billions of dollars. 
Published reports indicate that this time that the plaintiff attorneys, these private attorneys who are hired to do these cases by the State attorney generals, they expect to receive $10 to $14 billion--billion dollars. 
In the State of Alabama, outside the education, the general fund budget of the State of Alabama is less than $1 billion. We are talking about a small group--not hundreds and hundreds of attorneys, but a small group of probably less than 100 firms, probably less than 50 firms, receiving $10 to $14 billion in legal fees. Many of these States have only just filed their lawsuits. The tobacco company comes in and agrees, and they put the money out on the table--$300, $400, or $500 billion on the table. Most of these attorneys have contingent-fee contracts, in which they intend to receive a percentage of that money, and they did little more than copy a lawsuit and file the same lawsuit some other lawyer filed in some other State. They are entitled to do that under their fee agreement. It is not right. It is money that ought to be going to the health of children in America. 
This bill says we are going to put a limit on it, and $5 million is a pretty good legal fee. In my opinion, $250 an hour is high-paid attorneys. I think anywhere else you would see that. So we think that is a good limitation on it. And it is unlimited on expenses that may be incurred. I think, Mr. President, this is a good way to deal with this matter. 
I am going to tell you what has offended me. I was a State attorney general just last year, and I had some knowledge of how this litigation was being managed and how these attorneys were being hired on a contract basis. So I have asked about that when we have had hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee of which I am a member. I have asked one of the attorneys general what the fee agreement was in his State. He avoided answering that. Others have asked that question. We have gotten no answers. I have written an attorney general and two of these plaintiff lawyers and asked them, over a month ago, to tell me the nature of their fee agreement and how much they expected to get. I have yet to hear from them. Senator Grassley, a member of the Judiciary Committee, has also written letters asking about how much money is going to be paid for attorney's fees, and they won't say. They have everything else spelled out in this global settlement, but they don't talk about the billions of dollars that will be going to plaintiff attorneys, many of them who put little work into the case. They don't want to talk about that. 
In fact, this whole settlement agreement is designed to conceal the amount of money paid as attorney's fees. There is no other way to describe it. I hate to say that. It is a serious matter, what is happening here. Let me explain to you, as a litigator and attorney myself, and former attorney general, I have an appreciation for this matter. These private plaintiff attorneys who expect to make themselves rich on this settlement representing the States involved have said: We won't talk about our attorney's fees publicly. We will just enter into a side agreement with big tobacco and they will pay our attorney's fees. The tobacco industry will pay our attorneys' fees. The State of Alabama, the State of Minnesota, or the State of Illinois won't have to pay our attorney's fees. The tobacco industry will pay our attorney's fees. That is a joke. That is not a way to settle a lawsuit. These attorneys work for the State, who is supposed to be paying their fee, not the party on the other side, not the person they are suing. They should not be paying the fee in a secret arrangement. 
These attorneys are representing the State, the people. We need to know and we are entitled to know how much they are being paid. This bill says that they must make public any fee agreements they have and report to the people how much they expect to receive. I think that, at a minimum, we need do that. It is time to send a message that we are not going to tolerate this behavior. Everything else is going to be on the table. We are not going to have bills that go through to provide tax benefits to tobacco and we are not going to have plaintiff lawyers, who are some of the biggest contributors to political campaigns in America, enriching themselves any more than tobacco ought to enrich itself with a secret, side agreement. 
Now, let me talk about that just a little more. The problem --and I think any lawyer would recognize this--is a conflict of interest. The attorney for one side says to his client: Don't worry about the attorney's fee, Mr. Client. I will get the attorney's fees from the guy we are suing. He will pay me and we don't need to bother to tell you about that. See? So the deal is, well, you get into a tough point in the negotiation and you can't reach a settlement, and big tobacco says to the attorney for the State of Alabama, or the State of Illinois, or the State of Minnesota: Well, why don't we just add a billion dollars for attorney's fees, Mr. Attorney. Maybe you can agree to this idea. 
See, that is the fundamental conflict that is there. I think this probably would violate the standard rules of ethics. Certainly, it would violate the high standards of the legal profession. And I am sure any group of prominent attorneys asked about that would express very serious concerns about that because it presents a conflict of interest and the kind of activity that ought not to be tolerated. So I think we need to get into this. I think we need to limit these fees and take that money, as our bill does, and send it to the National Institutes of Health so it can be used for research on children's diseases. I think that is the appropriate use of any of these excess fees. 
Mr. President, let me just say this. There are a lot of States who have just recently filed these suits. I submit they have done little more than copy the suits that some of these other States have filed. Yet, they are large States and they are going to receive tens of billions of dollars, and based on what I understand may be a common fee arrangement, these attorneys would be entitled to receive 25 percent of the recovery. I don't know why the published reports say that it is $10 to $14 billion. That seems to me to be less than some of these arrangements. Maybe, but at any rate, it is too much. Twenty-five percent of that may be $100 billion in legal fees, which could provide all kinds of assistance and aid to dealing with children's diseases and health-related matters, many of which we ought to focus on tobacco, because we do know that tobacco is a very unhealthy substance. We know that teenagers who become smokers find it extremely difficult to quit later as an adult. In fact, it is many times more difficult for a person to quit smoking if they commence smoking as a teenager than if they began as an adult. That is why we need to deal with the health question of teen smoking and why I think it is an important national issue. I salute those who believe in doing something about it. 
Finally, let me just say this. What business do we have in involving ourselves in this kind of litigation and trying to involve ourselves in what kind of attorney's fees should be paid? The reason we are involved in it is because we have been 
asked to. The attorney generals, these plaintiff lawyers, and big tobacco have all asked us to involve ourselves and legislate this settlement. That is an interesting, probably unprecedented event, so far as I know, in the history of this country. We are talking about dealing with that professionally and analyzing it. A number of committees in this body are looking at it today, and I am sure it will be hammered out and much will be done. But I simply say that if this body does not legislate a global settlement concerning this litigation, this amendment will have no effect. It takes effect only if there is a global legislative confirmation of some sort of this settlement. At that point, I think it is appropriate for us to limit attorney's fees and deal with this. As a matter of fact, I think it is more than appropriate; I think it is absolutely essential that we do so. 
So, Mr. President, I say to this body that this amendment is, in no way, designed to assist big tobacco. I am offended that anyone would suggest that it does. It is designed to put money in the hands of children by taking it from lawyers who are about to receive one of the biggest windfalls in the history of litigation--not one of the biggest, but the biggest windfall in the history of litigation in the entire world is about to occur. Attorneys are about to receive tens, hundreds of millions of dollars for cases they only worked on a few months. A few firms may have worked longer, but most only have worked a few months on these cases and have not expended large sums of money. This amendment gives them a very generous $5 million in attorney's fees and an unlimited expense account to carry on their litigation. And, in addition, it says there has to be some reasonable limits. We are not going to allow them to have a jackpot justice and make tens of hundreds of millions of dollars off of litigation of this kind. 
So I say to the distinguished Members of this body that this is a proper thing for us to do. It is a proper time for us to do it. I also say there is something unhealthy here, something that does not quite smell right, when we have secret agreements on attorney's fees, representing billions of dollars, and they won't even be discussed at a time we are being asked to evaluate this entire settlement. 
So, Mr. President, I strongly believe that this is a reasonable and fair amendment. It allows very generous attorney's fees and expenses to be paid, but sets a cap on it so the people of this country can know that the recovery in these lawsuits is going to help and not go to attorneys in a windfall. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. SESSIONS. I have some comments that I would like to make and my time is getting short, but I think it would support the National Institutes of Health and that is what we would favor. 
This is a matter of real seriousness. We are not talking about a little game or gimmick here. We are talking about huge sums of money. The Senator from New Hampshire talked in the debate on this floor of from $16 to $20 billion of children's insurance and how $4 billion was considered carefully before the Congress appropriated that money. We are talking about perhaps $40 billion in attorney's fees, and they refuse to tell the American public how much the fees are. They refuse to produce their agreements. These are attorneys representing public bodies, not private individuals. 
With regard to contingent fees, I am not against private contingent fees. I think in many cases that is an effective and appropriate way to handle litigation for a private party. But I am very concerned about public bodies hiring attorneys to represent them and the people of their States on a contingent fee basis that could result in awards of attorney's fees of tens of billions of dollars. So I would think very seriously about that. 
I was amazed to hear the comment made that this would intimidate and hamper the public health community. The public health community will benefit from this because we would see this money go to the National Institutes of Health and not to attorneys, so they could use it for research and other good things. It will not stop the ongoing litigation. I certainly believe it will continue in every State in the Nation that chooses to proceed. 
Finally, I think the Senator from Maine is incorrect in suggesting that this is somehow not money that counts because it was money not made part of the settlement but added on to it by the tobacco industry. If you have been a part of the litigation, before you know it, the defendant, before the award is paid, wants to know the total bill, and when he finally agrees what his total bill is, he does not care how it is spent or how the other side uses it. So he will call it attorney's fees, he will call it anything else. He just wants to spend the $386 plus billion, and that money is money the tobacco company is prepared to spend to end this litigation. Therefore, it is money that ought to be spent, as much as possible, on children and not on lawyers. 
Mr. President, I see the Senator from Kentucky is here and I will yield for a question, or time. I will yield the floor at this time and yield my time to the Senator from Kentucky for 4 minutes.

</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-sessions-al-29-19970910</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator. 
Mr. President, I think that points out the problem we are dealing with here. This is the first time, in any inquiry that I have made in a number of different instances, that I have gotten a figure on the detail of the fee agreements that have been entered into in these kinds of cases. 
Twenty-five percent. That sounds fine, but the truth of the matter is the tobacco company has just pleaded guilty. They put $300 billion, $400 billion, the Senator from Kentucky says $500-plus billion on the table. Now the lawyers who were saying they were going to trial and spent these huge sums of money all over America are not going to trial. They are just collecting the money, and they have agreements like this. 
Now, I would assume, with regard to Minnesota, that they are an average size State and they probably would be entitled to something like a $10 billion settlement of this matter. If that is true, then this law firm would be entitled to $2 billion--$2 billion, not $2 million but $2 billion. That would be probably as of this date the largest legal fee ever paid in the history of this country, largest legal fee probably ever paid in the history of the world. 
So I submit that is exactly what has happened. Many States, I understand, because less than a year ago I was an attorney general, have entered into contracts of 25 percent. I know of another State which, I understand, has entered into a settlement for 20 percent of the recovery. These cases are not even going to trial if this body acts. If this body does not act and Minnesota goes on and litigates its own case, then Minnesota is not covered by our agreement. So only if there is a congressional action that takes over these cases, should we question attorneys' fees. Otherwise that issue is between the attorneys general and the States. 
But the plaintiff lawyers, the very same ones who are now complaining about their fees through Members of this body, these very same plaintiff attorneys are the ones asking this Congress to review this settlement and to take appropriate action that we think is just and fair. 
So, first of all, I want to point out that we are talking about incredibly huge attorneys' fees, not just large. These are incredibly huge. Probably as much as, at 20 percent, $40, $50, $60 billion in attorneys' fees. Publicly the figure has been floated in the press a number of times at $14 billion. If the percentages are the same in most States, 20 percent, the figures will be much higher than $14 billion. 
So the tobacco lawyers who have entered into this private agreement with these plaintiff attorneys to pay them their fee, all these lawyers are now coming to us and saying just ratify this matter but don't ask us about how much they are paying; don't question these fees because we had a contract. We had a contract. 
They can't prevail in their cases in an effective way without the legislation of this Congress. So I think it is right for us to question it.

Mr. SESSIONS. I say the distinguished Senator from Kentucky raises a very important and troubling point. It is, in my opinion, at least improper if not unethical for an attorney representing a party to enter into private negotiations with the person he is suing to establish how much his fee ought to be. You see, there is a conflict there. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-sessions-al-34-19970910</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. SESSIONS. All of a sudden it becomes important to that lawyer that the settlement be approved so he can get his fee. And if the person he sues, the tobacco industry, says: `You are being too hard on this issue; give up on this issue.' `No, I won't.' `Well, we will sweeten your attorney's fee if you will give up on it.' That puts them in conflict. I am not saying that has happened. But I am saying good attorneys should not allow themselves to be put in a position of interest. 
So we are talking about, if it is 20 percent of a $600 billion settlement, $100 billion in attorney's fees. We fought for weeks on this floor to raise from $16 to $20 billion the amount of money spent for health care for children. We are talking about $100 billion in this bill in attorney's fees, and in many cases in many States very little legal work has been done on these cases. It is important and necessary for us to act on this matter, and this amendment as presented by the Senator from Minnesota would, in effect, undermine and abrogate the true effect of the amendment that I have offered, so I strongly oppose it. 
I will yield the floor and reserve my time.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, first of all, if Minnesota proceeds to litigate its case and gets a judgment, then Minnesota would not be covered by this act. And I would be willing to consider Minnesota's case, because it is somewhat different than most. Perhaps it is more unusual than any of the others. However, I would say this to the Senator from Minnesota, his bill covers all States. It doesn't just cover Minnesota. It doesn't just cover unusual fact situations. It says we cannot deal with contracts in any of the States. 
I have to oppose his amendment because it applies to every State including States bigger than Minnesota that filed lawsuits just a few months ago. Attorneys have done almost no work on these cases. Yet they would stand to receive billions of dollars in attorney's fees without this legislation. 
So I would say, first of all, I would be willing to discuss the unique problems of Minnesota. But I cannot, and must resist with every bit of strength that I have this amendment because it applies throughout the Nation and it will prevent this body from being able to stop great windfalls. And that money doesn't need to go to attorneys. It needs to go for the purpose of this lawsuit, which is health care.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, precisely on the question he raised, this amendment that I have presented, that has been passed by a large vote, without objection that I heard, maybe a few--says that it would only include States involved in the national tobacco settlement agreement. 
My view is, if Minnesota wants to opt out of this deal, maybe they ought to be treated separately. But for the 49 other States who are in it, who have asked for this review and legislation by Congress, I think it is absolutely critical that we deal with attorney's fees. I repeat, I have sought on multiple occasions, and other Senators have, to find out what the agreements are that they have with these attorneys. They are hiding those agreements. They have been very secret about it. It's a secret agreement between plaintiffs' attorneys representing the States and the tobacco industry. And only today has the Senator from Minnesota indicated that they have a 20-percent contingency fee. That means that whatever recovery Minnesota has of all these billions that we are looking for and hope that we can recover, of all those billions, 20 percent of it will go to attorneys. 
They talk about a lot of records and documents. I have been involved in litigation. People always talk about records. But you have paralegals, you have clerks, you have statisticians to go through those documents. They don't have to be read by every attorney involved in the case. 
So I would say what really exacerbates this problem and makes it so critical is the fact that the tobacco companies, early on, agreed to this settlement. Therefore, a lot of attorneys general entered into contracts, maybe thinking it would be prolonged litigation and these fees might be justified, but now they find out that the money is already on the table and we have to work out an agreement to collect it. Attorneys do not have to justify these huge billion-dollar fees we are hearing talked about. 
These are reasonable fees, $250 an hour, $5 million per State in attorney's fees. That is reasonable and fair. I think generous, in fact. 
I believe that this body needs to send a message, for those people who think they can execute secret side agreements at the expense of the people they are supposed to be representing to divert $14 billion, $40 billion, $60 billion, $100 billion from health care for children and families and tobacco victims--taking that money and putting it in their pockets is not a good way for this Government to be run. 
I feel very strongly about this. Unfortunately, the Senator from Minnesota chose not to limit his amendment to the situation in Minnesota but to apply it throughout the Nation, which in effect preserves the prerogative of the plaintiff lawyers to make themselves rich off of this settlement. Therefore I must oppose it.

<TEXT>
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to address a very important issue that has not been discussed much. It has been raised a few times but not openly discussed. I think it is consistent with Senator Durbin's concern that a tax benefit being proposed has not had full public discussion. 
One of the things that has not had public discussion regarding the tobacco settlement is attorney's fees. Many of the States have undertaken very lucrative agreements with plaintiff lawyers who States attorneys general have hired to represent their States to carry on this litigation. 
Less than a year ago, I was attorney general of the State of Alabama, and I was asked and it was suggested to me to hire plaintiff attorneys to represent the State of Alabama. It was suggested that a 25-percent contingent fee would be appropriate in those cases. I rejected that. I felt like it was not necessary for the State of Alabama to undertake such a generous fee agreement. Other States have undertaken such agreements, and that is of much concern to me. 
Now we have the case coming before this Senate of being asked to bless or to approve by legislation those agreements. It is important for us to consider that every dollar that is spent on attorney's fees is a dollar that does not go to children's health. So this amendment limits the amount of money that can be spent on attorney's fees and says any excess moneys that are saved in that regard will be sent to the National Institutes of Health to be used for research for children's illnesses. 
I think that is the appropriate way to do this. We have a lot of attorneys who have been talking a lot about children's health, so let's talk about that seriously, and let's ask about how this has happened. 
Let me just say, the way this agreement has been entered into, the attorneys general, with their attorneys who they have hired, have entered into an agreement, a global settlement agreement, with the tobacco industry. Oddly enough, it mentions nothing about attorney's fees. 
What we have learned since then is that there is a side agreement between the plaintiffs' attorneys who represent the States and the tobacco industry to pay their attorney's fees directly by the tobacco industry, apart from the State that they represent, which is a very odd situation and, in fact, in my opinion, Mr. President, represents a conflict of interest, because at this point, you have the attorneys supposedly representing the State entering into an agreement, a side agreement, with the attorneys and the party on the other side of this litigation, the tobacco industry. 
So that puts them in a situation in which, if they do not agree and this settlement does not go forward, they do not get their attorney's fee. 
That is basic. That is a conflict, I submit, between their interests and their duty and fidelity to the State, their client, and the opposing side who now is paying their fees. Why didn't they put it in the agreement? Why didn't they state it publicly? Because they don't want to talk about it. 
Most of the estimates and many reports have been suggested as to how much these fees might be. Some have said $10 to $14 billion. That is what I have seen published in several different instances. Let me repeat that: $10 to $14 billion. That is the greatest legal fee ever paid in the history of this Nation, in the history of this world. It is the mother of all attorney's fees. We are talking about $10 to $14 billion. Outside of education, the budget of the State of Alabama is $1 billion. So we are talking about an incredible sum of money that could provide tremendous amounts of research and care for children. That is where this money ought to go. 
We are talking about a secret side agreement by which the 
attorneys, supposedly representing the States and the children, have gone over here now and have set up a side agreement with the people they have been accusing of being so bad, the tobacco industry, the people they are suing. That is not an appropriate way to do it. 
I think if this body is to approve a global settlement and enact legislation in that regard, this body ought to make clear where we stand with regard to attorney's fees. We cannot allow some secret side agreement representing billions of dollars that could be going to children to be paid under the table by the party for the other side to the attorneys to the States who are representing the children. 
I think this is a very important subject, Mr. President, and I care about it very deeply. 
I think Senator Durbin's amendment deals with a tax question that has not been fully aired. This is a question that has not been fully aired, and it needs to be. 
Our amendment would do something else. It would say that every fee agreement that has been entered into between the State attorneys general and the lawyers they hired, the plaintiffs' lawyers they hired to represent them has to be made public, and the statement has to be made public. We limit the amount of fees. I think this is a large fee, most people think this is huge. Mr. President, $5 million is the limit per State we think is appropriate for this kind of litigation. In addition to that, we say it should not exceed $250 per hour in billing time. So that would be the cap on the fees that this bill would set forth: that no more than either $250 per hour, which is far more than what the average working man in this country makes, I assure you, $250 per hour would be the maximum time. If it goes over that, we would cap it at $5 million. 
I think that is a reasonable proposal. It would not take effect until and if this body enters into a global settlement of this litigation. I think it is quite appropriate. I think that we need to deal with this issue. 
I will just say this, as to the secretiveness of it. There have been several inquiries made by members of various committees of this Senate and one made by me of an attorney general about what the fee agreement was, and he did not set forth that agreement. Right after that hearing, over a month ago, I wrote a letter to the parties involved in this litigation, and I asked them to state the agreement they had with the attorneys representing those States publicly. We have a response not from one of them. They have not responded. 
This is a public contract between the attorneys general of the States and the lawyers who are representing the States. So I think something is amiss here. It is something we ought to deal with. This amendment deals with it straight up. I believe it fulfills the needs that we are here for, and that is to make sure we get the most money possible for children and children's health.

<DOCNO>105-sessions-al-19-19970909</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. SESSIONS. To put it real simply, almost every State that entered into this litigation hired a law firm to represent the State. Some of them used their own attorneys, I believe, but most hired private plaintiff lawyers to represent them. They then entered into agreements to pay them so much money. 
Now those attorneys general, now those plaintiff lawyers, now the tobacco lawyers have come to this body and asked us to approve a global settlement, `but don't talk about attorney's fees,' they say, `because we're going to take care of that between the plaintiff lawyers and the tobacco lawyers. We're going to work that out between us.' 
What we are saying is, that needs to be public. The public needs to know. It ought to be capped to a reasonable fee, and not be a windfall, because in many of these cases they hardly filed the lawsuits before the settlement was agreed to, so almost no legal work has been done, yet they would stand to receive perhaps billions of dollars in legal fees. It is a matter we have to deal with.

Mr. SESSIONS. I am delighted to try to answer that. It is a very unusual thing that is happening to this Senate and we have been asked by the attorneys general, by the defendants, the tobacco companies, too, in fact, by legislation legislate a lawsuit. So it is unusual. 
They are asking us to do that because many of the things that they want, each side wants, cannot be accomplished through private litigation. They want to, in effect, control new tobacco companies that have not been making tobacco and have not made people sick before, they want to control them and others. 
So they have asked this body for a lot of reasons to ratify this through our legislation. To that degree, they have asked us to ratify. 
I think we need to find out what the attorney's fees are. I think as part of our legislation our legislation ought to control legal fees and we ought not to pay any more than that mentioned in this amendment. 
That is, basically, where we are.

<DOCNO>105-sessions-al-27-19970909</DOCNO>

Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to respond. I think you raise a very interesting point. 
First, I say it is unusual that the States would come to this 
body and ask the Congress of the United States to ratify a lawsuit, but they have. 
Our bill does not take effect and does not apply unless this body enacts a global tobacco settlement. It is the last sentence in the amendment. In other words, we do not, and this legislation does not attempt to intervene in litigation that is ongoing unless there is a global legislation by the Congress of the United States, in which case we would then also deal with attorney's fees as we should.

<DOCNO>105-sessions-al-28-19970909</DOCNO>

Mr. SESSIONS. My understanding is that States that have settled have conditioned their settlement on the requirements of the congressional global settlement. If there is no congressional action, then their settlements will be in full force and effect, but if it is, they are agreed to be vitiated by the congressional action.

Mr. SESSIONS. Would the Senator be agreeable to this amendment if we reworded it, in fact, make it apply to the tobacco lawyers? I will certainly feel good about that. 
The reason it was done this way is because many of the plaintiffs' attorneys apparently have it on a contingency fee basis, probably have filed lawsuits, may be entitled to hundreds of millions of dollars and have done very little work. It would be an unjust enrichment, it appears to me. 
I would certainly entertain that amendment. I think it is a suggestion that we ought to incorporate.

<TEXT>
Mr. SESSIONS. I want to express my appreciation to the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, for his remarks. I appreciate them. His committee, the Judiciary Committee, of which I am a member, has begun wrestling with these very complex issues. I think he is exactly correct. It is a matter that requires the leadership of the President. He is going to have to step up to the plate and bring his departments of the U.S. Government on board if there is to be an agreement. It has so many possibilities of going awry. 
I think, personally, I have not decided whether this legislative body, the Congress, ought to get involved in this lawsuit or not. It may be the right thing for us to do. Then again it may turn out that it is not. But if we do, I think it is appropriate that we limit the amount of attorney's fees in these cases. Under the fee agreements that I understand are now in place, attorneys, private attorneys, who have been hired by the States have been involved in litigation maybe only a few weeks and could stand to receive tens of millions, even billions of dollars. In fact, most published reports indicate that fees could be as high as $10 billion to $14 billion in this litigation. 
That is far too much. That money needs to go to children. That is what these lawsuits were about, to have that money go to children for children's health, and that is what this bill would be involved with. So I feel very strongly about that. 
As to this being a tobacco industry bill, I am surprised the Senator from Illinois said that because I am supporting his amendment which would add another $50 billion, $60 billion to the tobacco industry, at least take away any benefit that now may come to them in that amount--a very significant issue. And I have come down on his side. 
I simply say, just as that amendment that came through to change perhaps the funding for the tobacco industry to save them a large amount of money was not fully debated, likewise the attorney's fees that have been out there have not been debated. As a matter of fact, they have not been discussed. At the Judiciary Committee hearing at which I appeared with Senator Hatch, I asked about attorney's fees of several of the attorneys general, and I got only evasive answers. 
So then I submitted written questions to them asking for detailed explanations of what kind of fee agreements had been entered into and asked them to respond to me in writing. Over a month has passed, and we have heard nothing from them. So I say there is a side agreement, an unhealthy, secret agreement, it appears, between the attorneys for the States and the tobacco industry, that the attorneys general and the States are saying they are not responsible for. 
You cannot do that. Mr. President, as an attorney, let me say this. An attorney's fidelity must be totally to his or her client, and in this instance, these attorneys, these plaintiff attorneys who have been hired to represent most of the States involved who have contingent fee agreements with their States need to have their total loyalty to the State. But if they are over there on the side entering into a fee agreement negotiation with the tobacco industry and saying to the American people and the people of the various States involved, `Don't worry about the fee agreement, the tobacco industry is going to pay that,' make no mistake about it, that is money taken from the children. That is money taken from the settlement that would go to benefit the health of people who have suffered from smoking. It is a side agreement that is not healthy. 
I have serious questions in my mind as a practicing attorney whether or not that is ethical because, you see, if that private side agreement between the tobacco people and the attorneys about how much money they get falls apart, those attorneys get no money--perhaps. And maybe the tobacco company can say, well, if you will just agree to this restriction or that restriction, we will 
agree to pay you two or three more billion dollars in attorney's fees. That is the kind of unhealthy relationship that should never occur in serious litigation, and this is certainly serious litigation. 
The Senator from Kentucky from the other party indicated that this settlement may exceed $500 billion. We cannot allow 10-20 percent of that money to go to attorneys, many of whom have filed lawsuits so recently that the ink is hardly dry on them. They have done very little litigation. Yet we are at the point of the tobacco industry coming in and agreeing to settle and pay it all and the litigation would presumably end and then they would get these huge sums in legal fees. I think it is a very important matter, and as far as this Senator is concerned I will not support any agreement, I will not support any global settlement legislation from this body that does not fully disclose every dime that is being paid, and I don't think we should. 
In addition to that, I think this body ought to make clear that if any settlement does occur, we should cap the amount of legal fees. I think $250 an hour is fine pay for any good lawyer, and that is the maximum they ought to be paid. If they are not worth that--they do not normally charge that--they should not get $250. But we say no more than $250 an hour and no more than $5 million per State. So that is 50 States to perhaps pay $5 million, and we could save substantial sums of money, Mr. President, that could go to benefit children's health in this country and not be involved in windfalls to attorneys who may have done very little work at all. 
I think this is a good bill. I just point out that, of course, if there is a global settlement and there needs to be some changes in the actual formula or caps involved in the payment of attorney's fees, that could be made a part of it. But I think this body right now needs to send a message to the people of this country that we are going to insist on full disclosure and we are going to put some reasonable limits on how much money can be spent on attorney's fees.

Mr. SESSIONS. The U.S. Government, because of its concern about the mob influence of a union, protected itself with the right to assert, the right to provide an election officer in supervision, to supervise the election. So we don't have to exercise that option.

Mr. SESSIONS. Are you reading the first full paragraph there? It doesn't say 1996 election. It says they consent to supervision of any election. That means obviously the United States did not intend to supervise all those elections. The United States only undertook to do so if it chose to do so.

Mr. SESSIONS. That is what the Department of Justice, the Clinton Department of Justice, memorandum says, that it has the option. I think that's the most plain reading of it, and I suggest to you the union agreed to this reluctantly, preferring not to perhaps but because they had to. I just don't think that would be a fair interpretation of it. I think the most normal interpretation would be that they have the option to do so, and I think this body has the right to say we choose not to fund it. Let's not do it.

Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield, I must say I am most impressed with the eloquence that the Senator has brought to this argument and has done remarkably well, I think, with not a lot to work with. 
The Congressional Research Service has also indicated that: 
Legislation enacted by Congress limiting or restricting the funds for the 1996 election would be a Federal law, and the Government parties would be bound to take appropriate action in reliance on that law. 
What are the consequences to the Congress of not appropriating all the funds necessary to supervise the 1996 IBT elections? 
There would appear to be no consequences to the Congress. The consent decree does not appear to obligate the Government to supervise the 1996 elections, either directly or indirectly. Rather, the decree embodies the consent of the union defendants to governmental supervision. 
Basically, the union consented that they would allow themselves, their private entity, to be supervised as a consequence perhaps of, as part of, a settlement to avoid even more severe punishment that could have been enacted against them as a result of Mr. Giuliani's actions against that union. That would be to me the most logical interpretation of the agreement.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we just voted earlier today 95 to 0 to direct the President of the United States not to enter into treaties in Japan dealing with global warming at this time. Those of us who care about the Earth on which we live want to make sure we are good stewards of this planet that we are blessed to have and we care about it very deeply. 
I have had the opportunity to serve on the Environment and Public Works Committee and have heard testimony from some of the Nation's most outstanding experts on the question of global warming. I am a new Senator, just having come here in January, and was very interested and fascinated by the possibility of trying to learn more about this problem that I have been reading about, as have so many Americans. 
I must admit to you that I have been somewhat surprised by a number of things, including a lack of unanimity among scientists, a lack of data among scientists, and a serious disagreement among scientists. I am also somewhat surprised, despite the very strong feelings of people who study this, that the President continues to be determined to enter into treaties that could adversely affect the economic well-being of the United States. 
Let me say first, in my simple way of thinking about this problem, a regulation is the equivalent of a tax. It would be no different for us than if we were to regulate the electric power industry and added costs to companies by mandating environmental controls in addition to the ones that they have implemented to preserve the environment for years. If we implement those controls, their customers are going to pay in terms of rate increases. Increases will be paid by the citizens who consume power, and every American consumes power. 
So we have to understand that a regulation that imposes a 
burden on some big company, like a power company, is really a tax on all of us. It is a regulation that impacts all of us. It adds to the cost of doing business in America. Every small business that utilizes electricity will have to pay for that power at a higher cost. It will make them, therefore, less able to compete with other people around the world. I think that is a fundamental principle we must not look for. 
The Atlantic Monthly recently had a most marvelous article about economic growth, progress, and technological advancement. Those, it said, are the greatest ways to fight pollution and to clean our environment. The areas that are most polluted, the areas that are least safe to live in and where people have the shortest lifespan are the undeveloped nations of the world. This article devastated the myth that progress and technological advancement imperil the environment. Indeed, just the opposite is the case. Improved technology and improved progress allow us to do more for less and improve our environment. 
We do know, though, that we are already, as a nation, facing a difficult challenge around the world. We are having a difficult time protecting the jobs of working Americans in the face of lower-wage nations that are taking our jobs. Ross Perot, in running for President, used the phrase `a giant sucking sound,' as he referred to jobs going overseas. The fact is, every day we place greater and greater burdens on the productive businesses in our Nation. At some point, the cumulation of those burdens reach a point that makes those businesses uncompetitive in the world and can severely damage the economic strength of this Nation. That is why the AFL-CIO and working unions all over America are questioning and opposing this treaty, because they see it will add one more burden to the United States and one more advantage to undeveloped nations who already have these low-wage rates to knock down and take away the productive capacity of American industry. I think it is a valid concern. 
Second, Mr. President, my simple mind, as I have been here, has caused me to think about how many treaties I see that we are entering into. I have this vision in my mind of Gulliver among the Lilliputians lying there with strings tying the giant down where he couldn't get up. Hundreds of little threads tied him down, and he could not move. 
We are a great nation, the greatest really on Earth, the greatest perhaps in the history of the world. We have great privileges and great requirements as a great nation. We ought not to lightly enter into treaties that bind us, keep us from being able to fully effectuate the capabilities that we have and enter into treaties with other nations, some of whom may not honor those treaties. It is one thing for them to sign up. We have seen nations sign up and say they won't use poison gas and then they have used poison gas, and nothing is done about it. What if we sign a global warming treaty and other nations who sign it do not comply? What will we do then? I suggest we will do nothing. We will honor that treaty, as we always do, because we take those things very seriously. 
Let me make a couple of points. The first thing that I have learned in our committee hearing is just how small a part of the problem we are facing is caused from humankind. Look at this chart. It is a remarkable chart--CO2 emissions, natural versus man-made. 
Eighty to eighty-five percent of emissions that cause global warming are supposed to be CO2. This is a big problem. 96.9 percent of the CO2 emissions on this Earth come from natural causes; things which combustion and other things do not affect. The rest of the world contributes 3.1 percent. The U.S. contribution is less than 1 percent, .6 percent. If we eliminated all the production of CO2 in the United States, we would only make a small dent in the overall problem of CO2 emissions. That is why people are saying they are not sure what is causing global warming, if we have global warming at all. I think we have to know that. Those of us who are talking about imposing tremendous economic burdens on American industry 
place us in a position of not being able to remain competitive in the world, for a benefit perhaps nonexistent. I think this is a matter we have to consider seriously. 
Do we have global warming? That is a matter that I know is a given--it is said. Some 2,000 scientists say it is, but many do not know why. There remains a lot of dispute about global warming. I am not sure what the real situation is. I am certain that there is some slight warming, but I must say that it is not clear. 
Dr. Christy, a NASA contractor and a professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, a premier university in scientific research, has studied satellite data for 20 years. He has been able to ascertain from that data what the atmospheric temperatures are around the world, not just on one seashore where the gulf stream may affect it or some prevailing winds may have affected the temperature temporarily. This is a global change. He has studied this over 20 years, beginning in 1979. 
Dr. Christy reached a remarkable conclusion based on his studies of temperature changes. As stated in his testimony before the full Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, the level of the atmosphere he is testing should be warming, according to those who believe in the global warming models, because global warming caused by the greenhouse effect should be an atmospheric effect, but he found the atmosphere has not warmed. This black line reflects the temperature, and it has actually gone down during the almost 20 years that he studied. 
No one has contradicted that evidence. It wasn't evidence that he went out and gathered. It was evidence that he just took from the satellite information that was already available to the public, and he made a comprehensive study of it. 
What is interesting is, based on his information, we may not have global warming at all. As I said, that information has not been disputed in any way. 
Not many years ago, the prediction was that we were going to show a 4-degree increase in climate temperature in the next 100 years; 
4 degrees growth would be the average increase in temperature in the next 100 years. 
Now, those numbers have dropped to 2 degrees. The experts have reduced those already just in the last few years to 2 degrees. 
Dr. Patrick J. Michaels, professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and senior fellow of environmental studies at the CATO Institute, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on June 26, 1997. This is what he said:  
Critics argued some years ago, as I did, [he said] that this would have to be a dramatic reduction in the forecast of future warming in order to reconcile fact with hypothesis. 
In other words, he realized that the people who were predicting this 4-degree increase were wrong, and some time ago he predicted they would have to modify this. 
By 1995, [he said] in its second full assessment of climate change, the IPCC [the U.N. panel] admitted the validity of the critics' position [his position]. When increases in greenhouse gases only are taken into account, most climate models produce a greater warming than has been observed to date-- 
In other words, we predicted a greater warming than we were actually seeing, than nationally has been observed. 
unless closer climate sensitivity to the greenhouse effect is used. 
In other words, we were predicting too high a sensitivity to the greenhouse effect. 
The IPCC continued: 
There is growing evidence that increases in aerosols are partially counteracting the warming. 
There are many things that are involved there. 
Dr. Michaels then added this comment. I thought it was very instructive, Mr. President. He said: 
I believe the secular translation of this statement is that either it is not going to warm up as much as was previously forecast or something is hiding the warming. I predict every attempt will be made to demonstrate the latter before admitting that the former is true. 
I thought it was interesting he used those words: `I believe the secular translation of that document.' I thought about why he did that, why he used those phrases. He is a scientist, a University of Virginia scientist. Why would he say that? I think he is saying that because he senses in many of the people who are promoting this agenda almost a religious bent, a commitment beyond rationality, a commitment beyond science, a sort of supernatural belief that we have to clean this Earth, and nothing we do as human beings here is healthy, and it is all bad. It goes beyond rationality. I tend to agree that we have some things that are said, that I have observed on our committee, that would indicate that that is true. 
Let me add one more thing before I conclude. 
The other thing we have learned is that global warming is hard to fix obviously if 97 percent of--by far, the No. 1 problem of greenhouse gas--CO2, is from natural causes. So we have a problem. 
We had testimony recently from four scientists before our committee. And I would like to share with you one of the exchanges that took place there. 
One professor thought that even though he was supporting the treaty, he thought we should take only modest steps at this time. And he believed that a significant tax on fuel and carbon products would be the way to do it. That is what he proposed. He said, `I think we need to start moving in that direction.' 
Dr. Richard S. Lindzen was a member of that panel. He is an Alfred P. Sloane Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. When testifying before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on July 10, 1997, Dr. Lindzen said, `I'm saying more than that. I'm saying that Dale'--talking about the professor--`that what he's proposing, take the scenario that you expect, an increase of 4 degrees'-- so Dr. 
Lindzen is saying, OK, let us assume that you are predicting a 4-degree increase in temperature in the next century, what affect would this tax, a significant tax on oil and all carbon products, have on our environment? 
This is what he said, `. . . take the scenario that you expect an increase of 4 degrees, if we imposed his tax, that would knock the temperature down over 100 years to 3.95 degrees. Only five one-hundredths of a degree would be affected by a tax to reduce that kind of emission of gases.' 
We are dealing with a very serious problem. I am concerned about American economic growth. I want the American people to have good jobs and be competitive in the world. I want a healthy environment. I believe in that. I am willing to invest some money in that. But I am not willing to invest money in a project that will have almost no effect and perhaps is dealing with a problem that may not even exist. 
We need more science, more study before we ask the people of this Nation to commit their resources into an effort that we could do somewhere else; $10 billion, $100 billion spent on this is $100 billion we could spend on child health care, emergency room admissions, and a lot of other things that we desperately need in this country. 
So, Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to share those thoughts with you. I think we are dealing with an important issue. And I hope that the American people will pay close attention to it as we go forward. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the men and women whose work contributes to our nation's great space program. Their contributions have made the first seventeen days of the month of July a high point of public interest and enthusiasm. I would like to share with my colleagues some observations of these contributions. 
Earlier this week, I visited NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, AL, and spent a few minutes talking with three of the astronauts on board of the Space Shuttle Columbia. Members of my staff viewed their launch on July 1 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It was another great launch and another great milestone for Columbia and our shuttle program. In case you missed the landing on CNN, Columbia returned safely to Earth at approximately 7:15 a.m. this morning. While in orbit, the crew conducted world class research in areas which are so critical to our future success in the global economy--biotechnology, materials science, and combustion research. This research is vitally important, and here is why: 
It is hard to understate the importance of the biotechnology research when you consider the hundreds of proteins in the human body. We currently understand the structure of about 1 percent of these proteins. If scientists can decipher the exact structure of a protein, they can determine how it works with other proteins to perform a specific function. For example, by studying a protein that is part of a virus, they can learn how that virus attacks plants or animals. To do this, however, scientists must grow near-perfect crystals of that protein. While some can be done quite easily on Earth, some are distorted by gravity. During Columbia's mission, protein growth experiments grew large quantities of various proteins. These experiments are designed to improve our knowledge and lead to breakthroughs in diabetes, bronchial asthma, AIDS, various kinds of inflammation, and Chagas disease, a disease affecting 20 million people worldwide but most prevalent in Latin America and making its way into the United States. 
Materials science has unlimited potential. Historically, mankind's development has been tied to the development of new materials since the dawn of time--the `Stone Age', the `Iron Age', the `Bronze Age.' As humanity matures into the `space age,' the need for new materials is as important and evolutionary as ever. The key to materials science research is understanding how the structure of a material forms and how this structure affects the properties of the material. On Earth, sedimentation and buoyancy cause uneven mixing of the ingredients of the material and can deform the structure as it solidifies. Imperfections in the structures of metals and alloys can affect mechanical strength or resistance to corrosion, while similar flaws in glasses and alloys can make them easier to crack or break. In microgravity, sedimentation and buoyancy are reduced or eliminated, enabling investigators to learn how these factors affect the final structure of the material. The knowledge gained from the studies on board Columbia will be used to improve materials processing on earth. These are the materials which will allow us to chart the great unknowns of space in the decades ahead. 
The third area of world-class research was conducted in combustion, which accounts for approximately 85 percent of the world's energy production and a significant percentage of the world's atmospheric pollution. Combustion plays a key role in processes involved in ground transportation, spacecraft propulsion, aircraft propulsion, and hazardous waste disposal. However, despite many years 
of study, we have only a limited understanding of many fundamental combustion processes. The results from experiments in these areas will help NASA design engines for cleaner air and more fuel efficiency. Just a tenth of 1 percent increase in the ability to burn fuel more efficiently can more than pay the cost of a shuttle mission and help keep the environment cleaner as well. We spend hundreds of billions of dollars each year on oil and every penny saved is a penny that stays right here in America. 
All of these experiments I just mentioned, Mr. President, were performed inside Spacelab, a joint venture of NASA and the European Space Agency. Investigators representing 32 universities, 12 commercial industries and five government agencies participated in the 33 microgravity experiments in Spacelab. This mission was a bridge between the activities currently possible on Spacelab and those of a much longer duration but with similar international cooperation that will take place on International Space Station. 
This mission caused no great fanfare like the Mars mission is continuing to cause. Like many of you, I greatly enjoyed watching the coverage of the landing of the Pathfinder with my family over the Fourth of July weekend. I felt a special pride at this event. The Mars mission is a uniquely American accomplishment and has captured the imagination and attention of the world. I look forward to the day when the United States sends a manned mission to Mars. America must continue to be a nation of explorers, carrying out the traditions of discovery embodied by Lewis and Clark, and the other great explorers. So much depends on our leadership and the dedication of thousands of men and women working on projects large and small that will lead us to new frontiers in space. 
This morning, NASA Administrator Dan Goldin addressed the Republican Freshman Caucus. We discussed with him many of NASA's visionary projects and the future need for the International Space Station as a bridge to future exploration. On the Space Station, NASA will learn how to keep astronauts safe and healthy for long periods of time. They will learn how to shield astronauts from radiation. They will learn more about how to combat the bone loss astronauts experience after they have been in orbit for just a short period of time. And they will learn how to deal with medical problems, such as blood loss, a virus or bacterial infection, and surgical procedure. These are all things that we must be prepared for if we are to send men and women in space for long periods of time. Mr. Goldin praised astronaut Michael Foale, our astronaut abroad the Mir space station, as a true American hero. Foale is demonstrating to the world that U.S. astronauts are prepared to deal with adversity and hardship. He stressed that our children are seeing a drama in real time that is as fascinating to them as the drama we followed aboard Apollo 13 many years ago. Mr. Goldin assured us, however, that he has three teams examining the safety factors of the Mir and that all must sign off before any more U.S. astronauts are placed on board. He has confidence in the crew and confidence in the Mir, he strongly believes we must stay the course. 
Each Senator in attendance received a copy of the first photograph to be returned from Mars. I understand Mr. Goldin will be sending one to each Member of this body. He also proudly stated that NASA's Internet site on this mission has received over 300 million hits during its first five days, breaking all records for an Internet site. This mission has united the world in its interest. It has sparked the imagination of a new generation of space adventurers, and only time will tell how far they will go. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe the Mars mission symbolizes the very best of America. It transcends politics and demonstrates the cutting edge technology that has made our Nation the forerunner in space exploration. This is truly the way we want the world to see us, isn't it? Space is the key to the image and the future of this nation in the 21st century and beyond. We must have national leadership, a keen vision, clear-cut goals, and a strong commitment from this and the Congresses to follow. We must be willing to pay the price necessary to realize our dreams and the dreams and goals of our children. Where will we be in just 20 years from now? Mr. Goldin and his employees at NASA have the vision that will take us beyond the fringe of the universe and, along the way, will provide untold benefits for mankind. 
We are indeed a nation of adventurers and the crew of Columbia, the scientists at JPL and U.S. astronaut Michael Foale are setting the azimuth and cutting the trail for us to follow. The question is `Will we heed the signs and run the risks to get to the other side?' I believe our nation is ready for that challenge and will meet it in every way. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, this amendment would appropriate an increase of $6 million to the budget request for the Explosive Demilitarization Technology Program [PE 63104D] to conduct a demonstration program at Anniston Army Depot. This is a much-needed demonstration of current commercial off-the-shelf blast chamber technology as an acceptable alternative to open burning/open pit detonation [OB/OD] by reducing significantly emissions and noise caused by OB/OD. The demonstration has nationwide application if successful and is in keeping with the military's program of continuing technology evaluation of demilitarization methods for existing conventional ammunition as described in the Joint Demilitarization Study, September 1995, page II-4-14, a study prepared for the Director, Environmental and Life Sciences, Defense Research and Engineering, Office of the Secretary of Defense. 
Annually we spend millions of dollars on the production of new munitions of all types. At the other end of the pipeline however is the vexing problem of disposing of outdated munitions of all types. The enormity of the problem for this Nation is this: The stocks managed by the Army, DOD's Manager for Conventional Ammunition [MCA], currently stored in 26 States totals approximately 449,308 tons of material and costs over $12 million annually to store according to a DOD 1995 Joint Demilitarization Study. More serious however is the fact that the study predicts an additional 730,420 tons will be generated into that stockpile by the end of fiscal year 2001. 
Let me state again the magnitude of the problem for the Nation: through the end of fiscal year 2001, over 1.2 million tons of material will pass through or reside in the military conventional ammunition account. This is enough ammunition to exceed 2,800 earth-covered magazines and will cost over $1.2 billion to destroy if we assume that it costs approximately $120 million to destroy 107,000 tons of material using fiscal year 1995 projections. The technology in the COTS blast chamber has the potential of mitigating local environmental concerns; the potential of increasing destruction throughput; and is capable of destroying in a safe and environmentally sound manner greater than 98 percent of the explosives the DOD stores utilizing particulate bag house technology at locations in America, Europe, and the Pacific. 
Alabama stores in excess of 22,437 tons of material ranking us fifth in size of stockpile. Environmental considerations are of paramount importance to me and to a balanced national level demilitarized program. I think DOD, the Army, and the Joint Ordnance Commanders Group, Demilitarization and Disposal Subgroup, are playing a major role in ensuring that our various storage sites, to include Anniston Army Depot, are in compliance with Federal, State, and local regulations. Likewise, I think the DOD is also quite sensitive to public opinion. While better cost-efficient ways must be found to destroy this seemingly unlimited amount of material, we must take advantage now of new technologies in the R&D stage to compliment the current OM/OD method of destruction, with the view that not in the too distant future those technologies will not only replace aging organic demilitarization facilities, but close the chapter on the risky OB/OD method before the environmental challenges close the book for us. 
The JOCG cited three environmental challenges in a study to be considered in life cycle 
management of the demilitarization program. They are: permitting facilities, disposal of residuals, and cleanup. With new technologies the effects of each can be mitigated and give local communities new hope that their environment will no longer be fouled by OB/OD. 
On June 19 Anniston Army Depot received permission from the State of Alabama to proceed with the construction of its chemical weapons disposal facility. This is an emotionally charged issue, but one that will be managed every step of the way with safety of the operation and concern for the community as its highest priorities. Previous plants in our country are proving that this can be done. However, conventional ammunition destruction lags behind, in my opinion, on both counts. For this reason I strongly believe that a demonstration program at Anniston involving COTS blast chamber technology begins the long awaited opportunity to rid north Alabama of another type of munition material, that only grows more unstable with time and will furnish the data upon which the JOCG can make full-scale development decisions for other locations in the country. 
Today, TOW missile rounds, currently in storage, are experiencing storage problems and must be dealt with as a higher destruction priority over older missiles. Storage quantities for TOW missiles reaches nearly 400,000 rounds. I cannot conceive that OB/O, in Alabama or anywhere else in the Nation, is the most efficient and most responsible method of destruction for these missiles. Other methodologies must be utilized and they must be demonstrated now. 
The COTS blast chamber I am recommending for this demonstration program is totally enclosed, constructed of steel and consists of a hydraulic chamber door, exhaust fan and over-pressure controls. The chamber is large enough to accommodate the TOW missiles I described above and allows the military additional flexibility in destroying some of those munitions even as the demonstration matures. Noise measurement of 0.5 percent of what is allowable by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration are cited by the manufacturer. Emission controls for exhaust rates and temperatures are also controlled. The chamber will work with Anniston's current Subpart X permits, and according to the manufacturer the blast chamber is 80 percent cleaner than OB/OD. These are pluses for any community in our country. 
In sum, the people of this Nation should not have to wait for the perfect system to evolve when a very good system is currently on hand and available to demonstrate that it can do the job for which it was designed more efficiently. Our environment will not wait; the munitions will not wait, and the people should not have to wait for the slow wheels of government to find the perfect solution. Let us begin moving now, by bringing this demonstration program on line in fiscal year 1998 and see if we as a country cannot benefit from a simple technology that can get the job done. 
Madam President, I would like to personally thank Senator Stevens for his support and for including this important DOD appropriations bill.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President this amendment would authorize an increase of $6 million to the budget request for the Explosive Demilitarization Technology program (PE 63104D) to conduct a demonstration program at Anniston Army Depot. This is a much needed demonstration of current commercial off-the shelf blast chamber technology as an acceptable alternative to open burning/open pit detonation (OB/OD) by reducing significantly emissions and noise caused by OB/OD. The demonstration has nation-wide application if successful and is in keeping with the military's program of continuing technology evaluation of demilitarization methods for existing conventional ammunition as described in the Joint Demilitarization Study, September 1995, page II-4-14, a study prepared for the Director, Environmental and Life Sciences, Defense Research and Engineering, Office of the Secretary of Defense. 
Mr. President annually we spend millions of dollars on the production of new munitions of all types. At the other end of the pipeline however is the vexing problem of disposing of outdated munitions of all types. The enormity of the problem for this Nation is this: The stocks managed by the Army, DOD's Manager for Conventional Ammunition (MCA), currently stored in 26 States totals approximately 449,308 tons of material and costs over $12 million annually to store according to a DOD 1995 Joint Demilitarization Study. More serious however is the fact that the study predicts an additional 730,420 tons will be generated into that stockpile by the end of fiscal year 2001. 
Let me state again the magnitude of the problem for the Nation: through the end of fiscal year 2001, over 1.2 million tons of material will pass through or reside in the military conventional ammunition account. This is enough ammunition to exceed 2800 earth covered magazines and will cost over $1.2 billion to destroy if we assume that it costs approximately $120 million to destroy 107,000 tons of material using fiscal year 1995 projections. The technology in the COTS blast chamber has the potential of mitigating local environmental concerns; the potential of increasing destruction throughput; and is capable of destroying in a safe and environmentally sound manner greater than 98 percent of the explosives the DOD stores utilizing particular bag house technology at locations in America, Europe, and the Pacific. 
Alabama stores in excess of 22,437 tons of material ranking us fifth in size of stockpile. Environmental considerations are of paramount importance to me and to a balanced national level demilitarized program. I think DOD, the Army, and the Joint Ordnance Commanders Group, Demilitarization and Disposal Subgroup, are playing a major role in ensuring that our various storage sites, to include Anniston Army Depot, are in compliance with Federal, State, and local regulations. Likewise, I think the DOD is also quite sensitive to public opinion. While better cost-efficient ways must be found to destroy this increasing amount of material, we must take advantage now of new technologies in the R&D stage to compliment the current OB/OD method of destruction, with the view that not in the too distant future those technologies will not only replace aging organic demilitarization facilities, but close the chapter on the risky OB/OD method before the environmental challenges close the book for us. 
The JOCG cited three environmental challenges in a study to be considered in life cycle management of the demilitarization program. They are: permitting facilities; disposal of residuals; and, cleanup. With new technologies the effects of each can be mitigated and give local communities new hope that their environment will no longer be fouled by OB/OD. 
Mr. President, on June 19 Anniston Army Depot received permission from the State of Alabama to proceed with the construction of its chemical weapons disposal facility. This is an emotionally charged issue, but one we are assured will be managed every step of the way with safety of the operation and concern for the community as its highest priorities. Previous plants in our country are proving that this can be done. However, conventional ammunition destruction lags behind, in my opinion, on both counts. For this reason I strongly believe that a demonstration program at Anniston involving COTS blast chamber technology begins the long awaited opportunity to rid North Alabama of another type of munition material, that only grows more unstable with time and will furnish the date upon which the JOCG can make full-scale development decision for other locations in the country. 
Today, TOW missiles rounds, currently in storage, are experiencing storage problems and must be dealt with as a higher destruction priority over older missiles. Storage quantities for TOW missiles reaches nearly 400,000 rounds. I cannot conceive that OB/O, in Alabama or anywhere else in the Nation, is the most efficient and most responsible method of destruction for these missiles. Other methodologies must be utilized and they must be demonstrated now. 
Mr. President, the COTS blast chamber I am recommending for this demonstration program is totally enclosed, constructed of steel and consists of a hydraulic chamber door, exhaust fan and over-pressure controls. The chamber is large enough to accommodate the TOW missiles I described. Noise measurements of 0.5 percent of what is allowable by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration are cited by the manufacturer. Emission controls for exhaust rates and temperatures are also controlled. The chamber will work with Anniston's current Subpart X permits, and according to the manufacturer the blast chamber is 80 percent cleaner than OB/OD. These are pluses for any community in our country. 
Mr. President, our environment will not wait; the munitions will not wait, and the people should not have to wait for the slow wheels of government. Let us begin moving now, by bringing this demonstration program on line in fiscal year 1998 and see if we as a country cannot benefit from a simple technology that can get the job done.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would first like to say I appreciate the leadership of the Senator from Oklahoma. Senator Inhofe has done an outstanding job in working to preserve the defense of his Nation, and his comments about our lack of preparedness are very serious. I think this body, as a body traditionally considered to be the long-term evaluator of national security interests of this Nation, needs to listen to what he says. I thank him for those comments.

Mr. SESSIONS. I rise at this time, Mr. President, to make some remarks about the hearings going on in the Governmental Affairs Committee. I think they are most important hearings. I think it is important we remember that the committee, headed by the excellent and fine Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Fred Thompson, was commissioned by this body. They were mandated by this body to go out and discover the facts and to conduct an investigation of illegal and improper activities in connection with the 1996 political campaigns. So they have a responsibility and a duty that falls to them at this point whether they want it or not, whether they wish they did not have it, and they have to see it through and do it in a formal and proper way. I think the committee is at a point where it is not dealing with exact science, but with a process by which that committee needs to go out and find the facts, apply those facts to the law, to decide what actions ought to be taken and to evaluate it that way. 
It was by a 99-to-nothing vote that this Senate, Democrats and Republicans, directed that committee to do its work. And so we ought to let them do their work and let them follow the evidence where it leads, to let them apply that evidence to the law and to analyze the results and make recommendations for the future. 
A key part of that investigation is gathering the facts. I served for 12 years as a U.S. attorney. That was the Federal prosecutor for the southern district of Alabama. And, as such, I had the duty for many years--to handle major corruption-type cases involving complex white-collar crime, and so I have had a lot of experience in that field. 
I have not been commenting on this case and the evidence because I think we ought to let the committee do its work. I made one previous statement about this investigation a few weeks ago addressing my concerns to the grant of immunity, and I think we ought to talk about that and a few other things today. 
This investigation is dealing with a serious question, and that question is whether or not a foreign nation, not really considered a friendly nation, Communist China, may have systematically and intentionally set about to influence the American election in 1996 and, in fact, to influence American policy. 
We know that the President of this United States was a great critic of President Bush because he said President Bush was too accommodating to China and needed to be more tough in dealing with China. And then, after he becomes President, we know that he now is a leading spokesman in this country for accommodation with China. 
So whatever that is about, the facts in this case will have to tell us. But I do think it is clear that we are dealing with unusual types of problems with campaign financing. This may not be only a technical violation of the law, but it is a situation in which we may have a foreign power, an adversary, a Communist nation, with the largest standing army in the world, attempting to influence elections. 
We need a bipartisan effort, similar to those conducted in the past. We need the spirit of Howard Baker in the Watergate hearings who, as a Republican, made sure that he cooperated in that investigation and sought the truth. We need the spirit of Warren Rudman, Republican, who participated in the Irangate matters that were investigated here. He always sought to get to the truth regardless of politics. I have not seen that, frankly, by some in the leadership in the other party on this committee. It seems to me there has been too much partisanship. 
Now that those committee hearings are proceeding, they need to proceed professionally and objectively and all members need to pull together to find out the facts and get the truth out. 
I did want to talk, Mr. President, about the question of immunity. We had the not unusual, if you are familiar with complex prosecutions, situation yesterday when the committee hearings commenced that the ranking member from the Democratic Party announced that Mr. John Huang, who had been the main focus in the investigation, was prepared to testify if he were granted immunity. 
I think we have to be very careful about that. In fact, at this point, I would advise the members to say no to immunity at this point in the process. There may come a time when immunity is necessary, but at this point I do not think it is. That is my experience after many years of prosecuting. You use immunity, first and foremost, to get the testimony of the little fish, to find the people who may know something about the case, and then that helps you develop the real facts of the case and go on to the higher-ups. 
I was very concerned a few weeks ago--and it is the only comment I have made about this matter since I have been in the body--when members of the Democratic Party were refusing to grant immunity to little fish in this case. Now that they are talking about one of the top ones, they are suggesting that maybe we ought to grant immunity to him, but they were objecting to and questioning the wisdom of granting immunity to what they called the nuns and the priests in the Buddhist temple, those who have taken vows of poverty, and they have yet given large contributions to the Democratic campaigns, and the investigators want to ask them questions about where that money came from because there was a clear suggestion it was not their money, that somebody had given them that money and then they had taken it and made the contribution, and that would be technically a crime. And their lawyers were saying, as good lawyers would, `we will tell you about it but my people didn't understand this; they are not political sophisticates; we will tell you who told us; we will tell you who gave us the money; we will tell you who did it; but we don't want you to turn around and prosecute us.' 
So that is the type of circumstance the committee must decide. You may not want to prosecute those people anyway. They may not have understood what they were doing was against the law. So that is an appropriate circumstance for the committee to consider immunity. 
I thought it was critical and a matter of stonewalling of that investigation to, across the board, just deny consideration of immunity for those people, and now we are dealing with a situation 
in which on the first day of the hearings comes the announcement that Mr. Huang, under some complicated theory, would be prepared to testify if he is given immunity for everything he did except being a spy. 
Well, my observation is that that is not a good way to proceed, and there are several reasons why that is true. First of all, Mr. Huang wants to come in and get immunity from the things that it appears there may be such evidence right now to convict him of. 
That is not a bad deal, if they have evidence to convict you of a number of crimes. Let us say maybe it is money-laundering or maybe it is a violation of the Hatch Act or maybe it is the Ethics in Government Act or Illegal Foreign Contributions Act or campaign finance laws, in which you deliberately run money through someone else's name so that it would appear to come from them and not from someone else. Those kinds of things can be violations of the law. 
The investigators have done a lot of work on this. Perhaps they already know the basic facts, and probably Mr. Huang knows what they know also. So it would not be unusual for a good lawyer representing Mr. Huang to see if he could not pull a little gambit, if he could come in on the first day of the hearings when everybody's attention is focused on other things and announce, if you give me immunity, I will tell you what I know, but just remember, I don't need immunity for being a spy because you don't have the evidence about that perhaps. Maybe that is what he is thinking. 
The context of this thing is very troubling to me. My advice to the members of that committee would be to be very, very careful about it. 
There are a number of other things that are troubling to me. You have to remember that the grant of immunity can in fact undermine prosecutions later. We have to know that the Department of Justice, even though those of us on the Senate Judiciary Committee and others have called on the Department of Justice to appoint an independent prosecutor and Attorney General Janet Reno has declined to do so, the Department of Justice is conducting an investigation of Mr. Huang. They may already have evidence which indicates that he has committed crimes against the United States. And if that is true, then it is a real serious thing for the Senate to go through the process of granting him immunity. In fact, I would think it would be very bad at this point; of all the people who are most prominently involved in this, who played a high role--and he was a high Department of Commerce official. These problems are serious. Huang is a major player in the campaign finance scandal that we are seeing unfold, and I think he ought not readily be given any grant of immunity. I think it would undermine the legitimate prosecution that could go on later. 
As a prosecutor, one thing I always tried to avoid was to be in a situation in which I granted immunity to the main crook in the case. If you have five people involved and you need the testimony of some others to maybe bring out the details, you do not give that immunity to the main crook. You do not give immunity to the person you have the most evidence against already. 
That does not make sense. I think that this is a gambit, this is an attempt to rush in here while this committee has a well-planned schedule to bring in the evidence that is in existence about this scandal and to bring it all to the fore, to disrupt that process. 
The committee ought to stay the course. They ought to bring in the evidence from every source, and when they have all the evidence brought in, they then ought to objectively, coolly and professionally consider whether or not Mr. Huang deserves immunity, but until then I say no. I think we ought to be very careful about this process. It is a very serious thing. 
Finally, let me just say that this process is important. The people of this country are entitled to know that there has been an objective and thorough evaluation of the allegations that have been so prominently talked about here. I think that is important. I think Americans expect that. They would be concerned, rightly, if one of the primary persons alleged to be involved in wrongdoing who could have been involved in maybe a half a dozen different criminal activities, were to be given immunity at the very beginning of these hearings, and therefore perhaps end up with a situation in which you have prosecutions against lesser offenders and the main culprit goes free. That is a very serious matter. And sometimes in America, as one writer said a number of years ago, we suffer from a colossal inability to discriminate among levels of wrongdoing. 
I would say to you that if some of the facts here turn out to be true, we are dealing with a very serious violation of American law and campaign procedures involving millions of dollars, involving a Communist nation, a Communist power attempting to influence this Nation. I think that committee has to see it through. They have to get the facts and call the shots, no matter what the consequences. 
Mr. President, I salute the leadership of Senator Thompson and others on that committee. I believe they are doing a good job and I am confident that the truth will come out. I believe in this process. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today so that this great body may momentarily reflect upon the importance of our upcoming Fourth of July celebration. 
Over 200 years ago, this country began a historic experiment. Our Founding Fathers were told it would fail. Yet, after many trials and tribulations, the United States of America stands, it can fairly be argued, as the greatest Nation in the history of the world. Independence Day is our annual celebration of this achievement. 
Yet, we must have the courage and honesty to admit that we are not all that we hope to be. We have much work to do, and we have many dreams to make a reality. This is our American journey. And let us not forget the debt we owe to those who sacrificed to make this journey possible, the men and women who have stood sentry as our country marched to greatness. Today, they protect the finest democracy the world has ever known and keep watch around the globe. They are a beacon of hope, freedom, and justice to all the world's nations. Today, we trumpet the personal courage of our forefathers and the continuing sacrifices of the members of our armed services. 
Who are these veterans and service members? We all know them. He was your friend in school. She was the kid next door. You go to church with them, and you pass them in the grocery store. They are Americans just like you and me, but when our Nation called, they willingly put themselves in harm's way. We asked them to serve their country and they obliged us. They have made this celebration possible. 
Many of these regular Americans found themselves in extraordinary circumstances. They were only expected to do their duty, but they found the strength to do more. It is for these uncommon displays of valor that we have reserved the Congressional Medal of Honor. It is the highest honor which we can bestow on a member of the Armed Forces, and it is but a small demonstration of our gratitude for their acting above and beyond the call of duty. 
The men who have earned this award do not ask for recognition or acclaim. They believe they were only doing their jobs. They consider themselves ordinary soldiers, sailors, and airmen. But, we call them heroes. I dedicate this day to them, and I humbly thank them for their special sacrifice to guarantee the privileges we too often take for granted. 
I am proud to say that Alabama is home to 27 of these great Americans. Seven of these Alabama Congressional Medal of Honor winners are still alive today. Henry Eugene `Red' Erwin, Robert Lewis Howard, William Robert Lawley, Jr., Ola Lee Mize, Michael J. Novolsel, James Michael Sprayberry, and Harold Edward `Speedy' Wilson all have different heroic tales but common heroic traits. They steeled themselves with tremendous gallantry and fought without regard for their safety. From where did this courage come? For some, it was their loyalty to a fellow serviceman. For others, it was the strength of their convictions. And most certainly, it was done with God's help. 
Let us today take a moment to congratulate each veteran we know for a job well done and come before them with a spirit of the humblest gratitude as we enjoy the bounty of this great, independent Nation. For we are the Nation that people in every corner of the world wish to call their own. We are a people who will not stop short of greatness, a nation who earns her prosperity with the labor of her citizens, and the land of opportunity whose hand extends for both rich and poor alike. We need not only be proud of our veterans but also of every citizen who holds the same ideals and dreams for America. She is great because of the businessmen who fuel her economy, the religious leaders who guide her morals, the farmers who provide her bountiful sustenance, and the many other Americans who are free to fulfill their dreams each day. 
God bless those who have stood and fought on her behalf and, most of all, God bless America.

Mr. SESSIONS. I want to thank Senator Roth for his outstanding leadership that he has given on this important issue. But I feel very, very strongly that we need to do more for working families. Working middle-class American families today are struggling to get by. 
My youngest son will start college this fall. But I will tell you, I have children; three of them under age 13 and three of them over age 13. It costs more for a 14- or 15- or 16-year-old than it does for a 12- or 10-year-old. Anybody who has raised a family knows that. 
The demands on those families are fierce today. They are struggling to get by. This is the heart and soul of a family middle-class tax cut. Many kids will not be going off to college. They will never be going to college. But even if they are, many of those families need the money now. They have a flat tire and they need to replace a tire. They need shoes or to go on a school trip. They need to make their own decision about how to spend their money. 
This is important to me. It is important to American families. I salute Senator Gramm for raising this issue, and I am in support of this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? 
Let's imagine a single mother who is teaching school with three children ages 17, 15, and 12 hoping to save money for college and just getting by. The transmission breaks on the car, and there is a $400 bill. Who should decide who ought to spend that money? The Members of this body, or that mother?

Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President. It is an honor to be here to talk about one of the most important issues facing this country, and that is the tax burden on working Americans. Many people think that it is just a political gimmick when we talk about the need to reduce taxes. They think that is just a gimmick to get votes, that we are trying to appeal to the people in a way that somehow is less than honest and forthright, or that we are seeking to buy votes by promising a tax cut. Mr. President, it is much, much deeper than that. 
The problem in this country is that we are reaching a tax burden that is unacceptable. An excessive tax burden has the capacity to diminish our competitiveness in the world, while an easing of that tax burden has the potential to increase our productivity as a nation. All we have to do is let people keep more of their hard-earned money. Taxes are, in a way, a penalty, 
a punishment on hard work. If you want to reduce something, you tax it. If you want to encourage something, you subsidize it. One of the problems with our country is that we have been penalizing good behavior. We have been penalizing people who work hard--husbands and wives who have jobs, or maybe they have two jobs each. They work and make money to take care of their children. We are taxing them to a degree that we have never taxed them before. We have diminished their strength and hurt those families that are struggling to get by. We subsidize people that don't work, give money to people who choose not to work, and we have wasted money on programs that are actually counterproductive. The U.S. Government is not an efficient entity. We do not use dollars wisely. But families do. They are struggling to get by. 
Let me ask you, how bad is the situation we are currently dealing with? First of all, I don't think anybody would be surprised to know that this Government brings in more money today than it ever has in its history. Every month, every year that goes by, we bring in more money than the month and the year before. That will not change, even when we pass these tax breaks for working Americans. So we are bringing in more money. We are not trying to shut down this Government. We are going to allow it to bring in more money. We are going to allow this Government to bring in more money, even with these tax cuts. So this is not an extreme position. 
What you may not know is this: When President Clinton took office in 1992, 19 percent of this Nation's gross domestic product went to the Government. That is a very large sum, no doubt about it. Since that time, and since his 1993 tax increase--the largest tax increase in history--we have gone from, last year, 20.9 percent of the gross domestic product--the gross domestic product is the total of all goods and services produced in this Nation--going to government, to, this year, over 21 percent. This 21 percent is paid by the taxpayers and working citizens of this Nation to the Government in the form of taxes. 
I think it is important, Mr. President, for us to think about this in historical terms. What does this mean? 
Bruce Bartlett of the National Center for Policy Analysis wrote recently about this. He made this point: Never in the history of this Nation have we reached the point where 21 percent of the Federal gross domestic product is paid to this Government in the form of taxes--not during the height of World War II did we reach that level, not during the Korean war did we reach that level, not during the Vietnam war did we reach that level, and not during the recessions when the economy has slowed down did we reach that level; none of those times have we reached the point where we paid the highest level in history--21 percent of the gross domestic product--to this country. 
Last year, when I ran for office and I asked people for their support, I talked to them about the future and the direction this country ought to take. They expressed to me their desire to have less Government, a return to local government, and a reduction in the power and influence and waste and mismanagement of the Federal Government. The trends are clear, and the trends are not good. 
What this tax proposal does is, it says to this giant bureaucracy of the Federal Government that we want to bring you under control. We don't want 22 percent of GDP going to the government next year, 24 the next, 26 the next, and 28 the next and, finally, a third, or even a half of our money going to the Federal Government. That is not the way to keep this Nation strong. We need to do better. 
Taxes are too high. We are not claiming they are too high because we are trying to get people's support by promising some political tax gimmick. This is a fundamental, governmental policy change. That is what I was sent here to do, to be a part of that. I wish that the tax cuts that have been proposed and are being pushed by my Republican colleagues could be bigger. But we know we have to have bipartisan support and be able to overcome a Presidential veto. As a result, we have had to work hard and 
compromise to reach a significant tax cut. This is significant tax cut, but I wish it were bigger. It is a good tax cut; we need to have it and we need to proceed with it. 
One complaint that has been made, Mr. President, is that this is a tax cut for `rich' people. It doesn't help the poor people. Well, a tax cut can only be applied to those who pay taxes. This is a tax cut, not a welfare program. We have welfare programs. We still have our Food Stamp Program. We still have our Aid to Families With Dependent Children. We are going to provide more money this year than ever and provide health insurance for those who don't have it. We are going to continue Medicare and strengthen that and make it a sounder policy to help poor people in America. This is not a welfare program. We are talking about a tax cut for people that are working and paying taxes. That is who needs a break right now--middle America. We need to be right up front about it. This is not a welfare program. It is a tax cut for people who are paying more taxes than they ought to pay. 
Federal income taxes are graduated. The highest income people do pay more taxes. A family of four making $20,000 does not pay income taxes. Most families of four will not pay any taxes with a $20,000 income. Our idea is to allow those middle-class Americans, who are working and struggling to get by, to keep more of their money. 
I have traveled Alabama in the last few years and I have talked to people. I have seen studies and all of the economic data that we get around here. I have served on the Joint Economic Committee of the Senate and the House, where we have dealt with economic reports from the Department of Labor and various other departments of the Government. We have analyzed those figures, and what my instincts tell me, and what I have learned from campaigning throughout Alabama, as well as from what the statistics show, is that middle-class, working families are struggling to a degree they have never struggled before. 
In 1950, 70 percent of a middle-class, average family's income was shielded from Federal income tax. They paid no taxes on 70 percent of the money they earned. Today, only 30 percent is shielded. The percentage that you pay on the amount that you earn is higher. Taxes have gone up. In 1950, the average working family only paid 2 cents out of every dollar to the U.S. Government in the form of taxes--2 cents. Today, it is 25 cents. That is a dramatic change in American policy. I submit to you, Mr. President, that it is unacceptable. 
I think it is time for us to be frank with ourselves, to be honest, to realize that we can't keep increasing tax burdens so that we politicians here in this Senate and this Congress can pass programs and pass out money and claim we are heroes. It is not our money we are passing out. It is money that we took from some family that needed that money. 
Let's think about this $500 per child tax credit. A family of three, at $1,500 per year, can divide that up per month and it will be over $100 per month, tax free. Tell me a family making $30,000 can't use an extra $100 per month. Frankly, I am concerned about the idea that we ought to mandate in later years, at age 13 or 14, that they be required to apply that tax credit toward college savings. I am telling you that is not realistic. Working families in America today are concerned about getting by; they are not always concerned about college. They have a car that needs tires on it. They might need to fix the muffler. The children might need to go on a school trip. Where are they going to get the money for that? This could provide that. I think we ought to trust the families with these decisions and let this be their tax cut. We, in Congress, should not try to manage what they are going to do with it. A lot of kids don't go to college. A lot of kids work their own way through college. Maybe that family desperately needs that money now for personal items just to get by. That is who we ought to be supporting. 
So, Mr. President, I feel very strongly about this. I am most proud to be associated with a group of Senators who are committed to realistically reducing the tax burden on America. 
I was so proud to be associated with Senator Kyl from Arizona who spoke previously. Senator Kyl has been a champion for estate tax reduction. And I was pleased to join with him as an original cosponsor on his bill to eliminate this estate tax. I think that is an unfair tax. The estate tax only brings in about 1 percent of the Federal Government's income. Considering the amount of money it brings in compared with the cost of administering that program and the great gymnastics that people go through to try to avoid it, the estate tax is just inefficient and unfair. We could eliminate that tax and make this country and this economy more healthy. 
Total Federal Government and State government taxes now amount to over 30 percent of the gross domestic product. In my opinion, measuring the tax rate to the growth domestic product is a good and just way to determine just how significant our tax burden is. 
Finally, Mr. President, I want to share this story. I think it is a very important story. I serve on the Joint Economic Committee. Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve System, testified at one of the first committee hearings I attended. It appeared he was about to raise interest rates, and everyone was most anxious. The economy was going along well. We were all pleased about the growth of the economy. There were a number of discussions about why the economy was doing so well. Some joked that it was President Clinton, and some said it was Mr. Greenspan. It was just a lighthearted conversation. 
When it came my time to ask him questions, I asked him about an article that I had read in USA Today. They interviewed business people from Germany, England, and Japan. They asked them why the American economy was doing better than the economies of those three nations. When you boiled it down, those representatives from those three nations gave three reasons. They said the American economy is stronger because we have lower taxes, less regulation, and a greater commitment to the market economy, to the free market. 
I asked Mr. Greenspan if he agreed with that. He said, `Yes, I absolutely agree with that.' He said that without hesitation. 
Those are the cornerstones of a strong and vibrant economy. We cannot keep raising our taxes every year so that we take a larger and larger portion of our gross domestic product. We will end up like Germany with unemployment over 12 percent instead of around 5 percent. That is what we will be heading to. 
So this drive, this imperative to reduce taxes is not just to see if we can buy votes for letting people have more money; it is to try to invigorate and maintain the competitive capacity of this Nation. That is why we are doing better than the rest of the world. 
I don't know who you could say deserves credit for this economy. We could have a lot of different ideas. But I would say that the Republican Party and Presidents Reagan and Bush, who spent a whole career fighting to reduce regulations and to contain the growth of taxes, even reduce taxes, played an important role in this economy. We need to remember that and maintain our historical position as a nation that will fight to keep its tax burden from going up. 
So, Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today to express my excitement and primacy of support for legislation that will allow Americans who work hard every day to keep more of their money. They can spend it on the things they want to spend it on and not on something that somebody in Washington wants to spend it on. It will be good for them. It will be good for their families, and it will be good for the competitive and productive capacity of this Nation. 
I think this is an extremely important issue. We should not minimize it. Lower taxes will make us a stronger and more competitive Nation. We will have a greater increase in our economic growth. And out of that growth, we will have the capacity to serve those who are less fortunate. If we kill the goose that laid the golden egg, if we continue to tax this economy to the degree that it drives its growth down, we will not have that strength and that capacity to meet the challenges of our Nation. 
Just look at the economies of Europe and Japan. You will see what can happen to us if we are not careful. 
I am excited about what is happening. I look forward to having the opportunity to vote on many of these issues. I hope that the result will be that this economy will be free from further taxation, that we will have more growth and more productivity, and that we will be more competitive in the world. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, S. 10, the juvenile justice bill that will shortly be before this Senate, is one of the best pieces of legislation for law enforcement that I have seen in a number of years. I am absolutely convinced that it is the finest reform of criminal justice in at least 20 years. 
This bill was crafted last term by Senator Hatch, who is a prime sponsor of it and who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I have had the dual honors of serving as the chairman of the Juvenile Violence Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee and also of working with him on this legislation. We are very proud of the bill that has been produced. We think it will do tremendous things for law enforcement. It is the kind of bill that does what it ought to do. It is not designed to get headlines; it is designed to improve the system of criminal justice in America. 
Mr. President, I served for 17 years, the better part of my professional career, as a prosecutor. It has been a particular 
honor for me to be able to have the opportunity to participate in reforming juvenile justice in America, because I know from my firsthand personal experience, gained as a U.S. attorney and as attorney general of Alabama, that this system is not working well. 
I am pleased at this time to be able to recognize Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri to speak on this issue. He is a former attorney general of Missouri, and spent two terms, 8 years, as Governor of that great State. He is a student of juvenile crime and the crime issue in general. He has spoken eloquently on it in our committee. He will be having hearings later this week in Missouri on this issue, and I will be pleased to join with him at that time. 
He has some remarks that he would like to share about this bill. At this time, I am honored to recognize the Senator from Missouri, Mr. John Ashcroft.

Mr. SESSIONS. I want to express my appreciation for the exceptional remarks made by the Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft. He has talked to us as one who has authority. He has spoken from his heart. He has spoken the truth. He has identified a problem in criminal justice, and he is absolutely correct. If you had 5,000 law enforcement officers and prosecutors in here and 
they were listening to that, they would say, `Yes, that is correct. He is telling the truth.' 
We do not do a favor to young offenders or to the justice system or to judges or to probation officers or to mothers and fathers, if we do not allow the full truth of people's criminal backgrounds to be known. All over America, police officers--many may not know this--are denied the right to maintain fingerprints and photographs of young offenders. This information cannot be held anywhere outside of the juvenile court because of the secrecy laws. 
This bill does not mandate the elimination of secrecy laws. This bill does not eliminate that great tradition that we adhere to of trying to give young offenders a chance to get their lives back in order and to live life without a criminal record held over their heads. But it does say that records ought to be made available to the criminal justice system. When a young offender at age 17 commits armed robbery, and is later arrested in another State at age 19, that police chief, that prosecutor, or the judge who sentences him for his acts in the second State, needs to know what kind of prior criminal history he has. 
The National Crime Information Center houses confidential criminal records solely for law enforcement purposes. I think it is a needed tool and a tremendous step forward. 
The Director of the FBI appeared before the Judiciary Committee just 2 weeks ago. I asked him this very question. He said: `Yes, law enforcement needs that information. Yes, the FBI will receive it if it's sent to us from the States. We need it, and we do not need any additional money to process it.' 
Now, some have said it will cost huge sums of money for the States to implement this. That is, in my opinion, clearly incorrect. We have had this claim studied by a professional group. Their results show that $50 million is more than enough to handle implementation, and this bill has $50 million in it for this purpose. 
I doubt it will cost that much. In many areas of our Nation, it costs very little for a local juvenile court to simply report an arrest or conviction and send it off to the FBI. There is almost no cost whatsoever. Some of the cities may want to have computer terminals and dedicated personnel. The money this bill provides will be more than adequate. 
Previous funding for juvenile justice in America was $170 million. Under this bill, it would go to $700 million, a more than threefold increase in expenditures because we want to do something about the crime problem. 
Adult crime has been dropping for the last half-dozen years. We have made some real progress in that regard. One of the main reasons for that decrease is that we have doubled and tripled prison space for repeat adult offenders. Prison does work to reduce crime, but we have not done anything in the realm of juvenile crime to compensate for the dramatic increases that are occurring. 
According to the Department of Justice's own study, juvenile crime will double by the year 2010. We need to begin to deal with that. It has already doubled in the last 10 years. Juveniles are committing serious crimes, as the Senator from Missouri said, including robbery, murders, rapes. Those are the kind of crimes we must crack down on. 
One thing that is important for us, as U.S. Senators to understand, is that juvenile justice has historically been and will remain a province of the States. Mr. President, 99.99 percent of juvenile crime cases are tried in State courts. We need to improve the ability of Federal courts to prosecute certain selected juvenile crime cases. This bill will do that. Still, juvenile crime cases will remain the province of the States. So if we want to improve juvenile justice, Mr. President, we need to help these States improve their system. That is what this bill does. 
Now, what is the problem with the Federal system? As a U.S. attorney for 12 years, I know the problem. If you wanted to prosecute a young offender in Federal court, an offender who appropriately should be prosecuted in Federal court, a number of things have to occur for this to happen. First, you have to get approval from the U.S. Department of Justice. Second, you have to seek certification of that young offender as an adult to be tried in the Federal system. Before you can do that, the offender has the right to appeal. Often when that appeal takes place it goes to the circuit courts of the United States and a year or more may go by before the case ever comes up for trial. As a practical matter, it is virtually impossible to effectively prosecute routine or even significant juvenile cases in Federal court. We have shut the door to Federal court. 
I do not believe that the Federal courts should take over juvenile prosecutions throughout America, but they ought to be able to prosecute certain cases that are appropriate to be prosecuted in Federal court. We need to reform that system. This bill does it. It removes the appeal process. It would allow a U.S. attorney, in many circumstances, to make the decision on his own as to whether or not to prosecute and bring that case to trial, just like any other criminal case. So we are going to have some very good improvements in that regard in the Federal system. 
In addition, Senator Hatch and Senator Feinstein have worked hard on a proposal to crack down on the violent gang activity that is disturbing so many areas of this country. In fact, gang activity occurs in every State in America. This bill includes very good, very tough, Federal antigang legislation that will help us break up these organized activities and will help us put an end to that kind of dangerous gang activity. We are pleased this bill will do that. 
The Senator from Missouri mentioned a very important thing and that is the question of intervention. Professionals in counseling talk about it frequently. By intervention they mean that a person who is on a bad road, who is heading down the road to destruction, who is making serious mistakes either in term of drugs, alcohol, or 
criminality, needs something to happen to intervene in that process or that person will end up being destroyed by that problem. 
That is what this bill attempts to do, both by recordkeeping, so we can identify whether or not this is a repeat offender so that the judge and the prosecutor will know that when they deal with sentencing, and also through drug testing. We know that in the District of Columbia, where drug testing of every arrestee is done today, 66 percent of the persons tested test positive for some sort of drug in their system. That is a significant statistic. Do not think, Mr. President, that this is only true of Washington. There are cities all over America that have been involved in testing programs like this, typically to determine the connection between drugs and crime, and their results consistently show that from 60 percent to 70 percent of their arrestees for criminal activity test positive for drugs in their system. 
When a young offender appears before a juvenile judge, that judge needs to know, if he wants to help that child--by crafting a penalty or a sanction that will help change his lifestyle--whether or not that person is drug free or whether he is using drugs. 
This bill will mandate that the States test every offender upon arrest, and it provides more than enough money to pay for that mandate. We are not doing an unfunded mandate. The bill provides more than enough money to pay for that provision. To me, drug testing is an essential aspect of any criminal justice system. When a young person is arrested, the judge needs to know, his probation officer needs to know, his parents need to know, whether or not drugs are a contributing factor to that young person's criminal activity. 
Eric Holder, who just appeared before the Judiciary Committee as the nominee for Deputy Attorney General of the United States, a position which is second in command at the U.S. Department of Justice, was a former Federal judge in the District of Columbia and is the current U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. I asked him about drug testing, specifically whether he thought it was a good idea. He said, `Absolutely. We did it regularly in Washington, DC. As a judge, that is the kind of information I had to have to make the right kind of decisions about whether offenders should be released, how they should be treated, and what kind of punishment they should have.' 
Mr. President, drug testing is not designed to set up a situation where juvenile offenders would be prosecuted again for another crime. That is not the purpose. It does not sustain a prosecution for a crime. But what it does do is provide the judge, the probation officer, the prosecutor, and the family, with the knowledge that the young person has a problem with drugs. To me, any effective juvenile justice system that does not have regular drug testing as a part of it is an ineffective system. It fails to meet the basic requirements of what a legitimate criminal justice system is. We are trying to reach out all over America by supplying funds to help the States and the localities have the kind of resources they need to do drug testing and improve the current system. 
Some have raised the question that this is a violation of civil rights; that you cannot make an arrestee be tested. Well, they are being tested all over America already upon arrest. They have been tested in the District of Columbia every day for over 20 years. Jay Carver, who just resigned from that program, had led it for 20 years. He knows how that program works and he supports it. It is not a civil rights violation. When a person is arrested for a crime, a judge has the discretion to determine whether or not to release that individual from custody. If the judge has the power to keep a person's very liberty, to deny him his right to walk out of court and be a free person, he certainly has the right to say you can be released from custody on probation or on bail but you have to maintain certain curfew hours and you have to submit to drug testing. That is a far less intrusive intervention in that person's life. Also, we find the cost of those tests are $5 to $6 
for initial drug screening. We believe that is a very inexpensive way to deal with this. 
Again, as I view the drug testing program, it is a diagnostic tool. It is a tool to help identify the real problem that a child might be facing and to help the justice system and the parents develop a strategy to deal with that. 
There are a number of other parts of this bill that we think are extremely important and will help to actually reduce juvenile crime in America. Those things include removing unnecessary and burdensome mandates that law enforcement tells me cause young offenders to be released routinely for offenses they should never be released for. They tell me over and over that the young offenders are laughing at them because of their inability to carry out sanctions. 
Mr. President, I am delighted to take this opportunity to recognize the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici. He has had a very strong interest in juvenile justice. He has submitted legislation on that that has been made a part of this legislation. I am delighted he is here. 
I am prepared to yield any time he desires to share his thoughts on this important subject.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the comments of the Senator from New Mexico. People are angry. We 
need to do better. There was a case in Alabama 2 years ago where three juveniles murdered a man. Those 3 offenders had 7, 8 and 15 prior arrests each and yet they were out on the streets murdering somebody. He is exactly correct. We need a system of increased sanctions, and this bill calls for graduated sanctions. That means increasing the punishment for each offense to send a message that juvenile offenders are not going to walk free. 
Mr. President, I am delighted to have Senator DeWine from Ohio here. He is a former prosecutor, former Lieutenant Governor of the State of Ohio, who has great knowledge in these law enforcement matters. He is a leader on the Judiciary Committee, a leader on our committee to reform juvenile justice. I am pleased to yield to him at this time.

Mr. SESSIONS. Very good. 
Mr. President, first I would again like to thank the Senator from Ohio for his support and for his insight, certainly shared by the Director of the FBI, on the importance of having a national crime information center for the criminal history of violent young offenders. 
Mr. President, Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is today in the Finance Committee markup--a very, very important meeting. He could not be with us. But we are both proud of this bill. The Hatch-Sessions bill has the potential to really reduce crime. 
One of the things that has been talked about and that we have heard a lot about is prevention money. I will assert with absolute confidence that the certainty of swift punishment is a necessary tool in the prevention of crime. 
As other Senators have said, our juvenile justice system in this Nation is broken. Ask your local police officer anywhere in this Nation, and they will tell you that it is not working effectively. We cannot allow that to continue. 
This legislation will mandate certain reforms. It will help fund other reforms. And it will do one thing that we have to do, and that is to increase bed space and detention space for violent juvenile offenders. We have not spent that kind of money in the past. We have increased adult detention space three and fourfold, but we have not acted accordingly for young offenders. 
This bill will provide matching money, which acts as the biggest source of our money in this bill. And we will have a lot of money in the bill that will help go towards prevention in a lot of different ways. 
But I want to make this point for all of America to understand. Clearly this Congress and this Nation is involved already in prevention. This bill is designed to fix a broken juvenile justice system. We have to do that. And we cannot allow people to have 7, 8, 15 different arrests and not be held accountable for that. 
Let me show you this chart. The title of it is across the top: `Federal Programs for At-Risk or Delinquent Youth.' 
These are juvenile prevention programs. There are 131 of these programs that have been funded by this Government. We spend $170 million on juvenile crime. We already spend $4 billion on prevention programs through virtually every agency and department of Government. 
Look at these things. The Department of Interior: Indian child welfare groups; Department of Housing and Urban Development: The 4-H groups, youth apprenticeships, youth sports programs: Department of Labor: Job training for homeless demonstration projects, summer youth employment training, school to work opportunities, Youth Fair Chance; Department of Transportation: Youth-impaired driving techniques projects; gang resistant education and training in the Department of the Treasury. 
So it is just on and on. One of the things Senator Thompson talks about a lot is his belief that we have no idea about what works in terms of prevention. He is very frustrated by all of these programs with no real belief in whether or not we know that they work. 
So, in consultation with him--and Senator Hatch has agreed--we have added to this bill a substantial sum of money for research to analyze these programs to see which ones work. 
We want to prevent crime, and we care about young offenders. But the most crucial thing we are facing today is a situation like that of the young lady who Senator Domenici mentioned who was stabbed in the throat by a young violent offender, in which the juvenile justice system did not work. Those offenders are not being properly processed, and when apprehended are not properly punished. 
This bill will mandate a series of graduated sanctions. We want to make sure that the first brush of a young offender with the law is his last. I believe we can do that. This bill is a major step forward in that regard. 
I appreciate the opportunity, Mr. President, to share these thoughts and ideas with my colleagues. 
I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, last Thursday, June 12, I along with Senators DeWine, Faircloth, Hutchinson, Coats, Coverdell, and Ashcroft co-sponsored S. 891, Senator Spencer Abraham's Family Impact Statement Act of 1997. I rise today in strong support of this important piece of legislation and to voice my complete disagreement with the recent anti-family action taken by President Clinton. 
In 1987, President Ronald Reagan, realizing the importance of the America family and the need to be constantly aware of the negative impact that Federal laws and regulations can have on the family, signed Executive Order 12606. The purpose of this order was to ensure that the rights of the family are considered in the construction and carrying out of policies by executive departments and agencies. 
Mr. President, even though we are faced with the staggering increase in out-of-wedlock births, rising rates of divorce, and increases in the number of child abuse cases, apparently President Clinton does not believe that considering the impact of Government regulations on families is good policy. 
Much to my dismay, on April 21, 1997, President Clinton signed Executive Order 13045, thus stripping the American family any existing protection from harm in the formulation and application of Federal policies. 
President Reagan's Executive order placed special emphasis on the relationship between the family and the Federal Government. President Reagan directed every Federal agency to assess all regulatory and statutory provisions `that may have significant potential negative impact on the family well-being.' Before implementing any Federal policy, agency directors had to make certain that the programs they managed and the regulations they issued met certain family-friendly criteria. Specifically, they had to ask: 
Does this action strengthen or erode the authority and rights of parents in educating, nurturing, and supervising their children ? 
Does it strengthen or erode the stability of the family, particularly the marital commitment? 
Does it help the family perform its function, or does it substitute Government activity for that function ? 
Does it increase or decrease family earnings, and do the proposed benefits justify the impact on the family budget? 
Can the activity be carried out by a lower level of government or by the family itself? 
What message, intended or otherwise, does this program send concerning the status of the family? 
What message does it send to young people concerning the relationship between their behavior, their personal responsibility, and the norms of our society? 
The elimination of President Reagan's Executive order is just the latest in a series of decisions that indicates the Clinton administration's very different approach to family issues. From the outset of President Clinton's first term, it became clear that his administration intended to pursue policies sharply at odds with traditional American moral principles. White House actions have ranged from the incorporation of homosexuals into the military to the protection of partial birth abortion procedures. 
Mr. President, many have suggested it is community villages, in other words Government, that raise children. But the real truth is, families raise children. Families are the ones who are there night and day to love, to care for, and to nurture children. 
Many bureaucratic regulations produce little benefit, but can have unintended consequences. The examples are too numerous to mention. What our legislation will do is require the regulators 
to stop and take a moment to think through their regulations to make sure that, the most fundamental institution in civilization--the family, is not damaged by their actions. This is a reasonable and wise policy. 
Mr. President, I find it very odd that of all the Executive Orders that exist, President Clinton would reach down and lift this one up for elimination. This body should speak out forcefully on this subject and I am confident we will. The families of America deserve no less.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are facing a crisis in juvenile crime in America. At no time in our Nation's history have we experienced such severe and pervasive juvenile violence. 
The statistics tell a frightening story. From 1983 to 1992--in just 9 years--juvenile arrests for violent crimes increased 57 percent. Specifically, juvenile arrests for aggravated assaults increased 95 percent while juvenile arrests for murder rose 128 percent. To put it in more concrete terms, over 2 million juveniles are arrested each year, many for violent crimes. In 1995 alone, teenagers committed almost 4,000 murders. Sadly, the worst is yet to come. 
A huge demographic explosion will occur early next century. By 2006 the teenage population will top 30 million, the most in 30 years. Respected criminologists, such as James Q. Wilson and Marvin Wolfgang, agree that this demographic bulge could have a disastrous effect because of the large increase in young males in their crime-prone years. The number of juveniles will increase 31 percent by the year 2010. Experts predict this increase, particularly in young males, will mean at least 3,000 more murderers, rapists, and muggers on the streets than exist today. A U.S. Department of Justice report confirms these dire predictions. The Justice report estimates that by the year 2010 juvenile arrests for violent crime will more than double. 
So today I want to discuss how we can help the States fight juvenile crime. As chairman of the Youth Violence Subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, I am greatly interested in crafting a bipartisan juvenile justice bill. But before we begin, let's face the facts. 
The Federal Government has only a limited role in fighting juvenile crime. Ninety-nine percent of all juvenile cases are tried in State courts. I believe that S. 10 is a great bill because its primary focus is aimed at helping the States fight juvenile crime. 
So today there are three main provisions of S. 10 that I would like to talk about and to highlight, and which I think we ought to consider: drug testing, the expansion of juvenile detention facilities, and recordkeeping.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am honored to be in this great body and particularly honored today to be able to say a few words from my heart about the Senator from South Carolina. I have no doubt really that I would not be here today if it were not for Senator Thurmond. I first met him--and this is typical of his leadership and commitment to this country--when I was a U.S. attorney in the early 1980's. I had just been appointed. There was a reception the Attorney General of the United States had. He came to that reception and stayed 30 to 40 minutes. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he stayed and he met every U.S. attorney in attendance that night before he left. That demonstrated to me his commitment to law and order. 
Many people have talked about his leadership with regard to military matters, and they are certainly legendary and unsurpassed in this body. But in terms of law enforcement, he has been an absolutely key figure in the reform of the Federal criminal justice system in America, that makes our Federal criminal justice system today, in my opinion, superior to any State criminal justice system. He did that in many bills, but in the 1984 act he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee that eliminated parole and made every person who is sentenced in America serve the full time they are sentenced, that reformed the bail law so that people could not be out on bail for years before they were ever tried, and many other reforms--the most historic criminal justice reform bill, I am certain, in my lifetime. He was a key player and a leader. 
In 1986, I had the pleasure to be a nominee for U.S. district judge. That was not an experience which worked 
out good for me, but Senator Thurmond believed in me. He fought for me. He stood by me day after day. He refuted the charges that were made that were not true, and he stood by me. 
A number of years later, he came to Mobile as a Patriot of the Year. There were 600 people from the city of Mobile there, and he recognized me in the audience. He said good things about me. His support, his friendship, his steadfast commitment to me and to this body was important in my career and I want to say personally how much I appreciate that, Senator Thurmond. It is amazing to me that I have the honor and the privilege to be in this body and to be able to say to you how much I appreciate your support and friendship, to say how much I appreciate your service to your country, as a military leader and as a Member of this body. I know some may think it not politically correct, but I will say this. Senator Thurmond has represented his State with great fidelity and character. He has represented his region as a southerner with the highest of standards as a southern gentleman. He has reflected the qualities of courage and integrity, bravery and commitment to truth that have reflected great credit on his community, his State, his region, his Nation, and this body. I am honored to have the opportunity to say how much I appreciate that.

 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the sacrifices made by the millions of men and women who have served in the Armed Forces of the United States. 
While Members of this body have perhaps thousands of constituent service men and women on the rolls from their State, men and women who have served and are serving be they active duty, Reserve, National Guard, or retired, I want to draw special attention to one story in particular, an uncommon story of valor and courage, that is truly representative of the thousands of veterans in Alabama and all over these United States. 
Mr. President, I want to speak today about the supreme sacrifice many Americans made for our country as prisoners of war. Mr. Hubert Davis, of Tuscaloosa, AL, is one such hero. As a B-17 fighter tail gunner in World War II, Mr. Davis' plane was hit while approaching a bombing target over Schweinfurt, Germany, on April 13, 1944. After his B-17 became engulfed in flames, Mr. Davis struggled with an awkward British parachute as the plane capsized, like a ship caught in a terrible storm at sea and crashed to the ground. Mr. Davis barely managed to escape from the B-17 and immediately pulled his ripcord. He parachuted to the ground and was captured by the German forces. As the D-day invasion was still some weeks away there was no hope of escaping to Allied lines in Europe. During his prison experience, Mr. Davis was subsequently moved from prison camp to prison camp while suffering from injuries sustained in the rough parachute landing. He was subjected to interrogations in which life and limb was threatened--all for our freedom. 
Mr. Davis' family received a telegram notifying them that their son was lost-in-action and a second telegram 10 days later announcing that he was killed-in-action. Eventually, however, Mr. Davis was liberated by the 13th Armored Division of Patton's 3d Army and now resides in Tuscaloosa, AL. 
Mr. President, Mr. Davis was prepared to pay the ultimate price for his country. While I have highlighted the odyssey of one tailgunner, and one ex-POW from World War II, Mr. Davis is emblematic of the thousands of men and women who dedicated the very fabric of their being for the greatest democracy known to history. From the Revolutionary War to the Persian Gulf, we have been blessed by an exemplary group of patriots who have served their country admirably and with distinction. Since our country has enjoyed many years of relative peace as a result of the heroic efforts of men and women like Hubert Davis, I hope his story reminds each of us of the trials and tribulations our forebears have endured to preserve the precious freedom we all so deeply enjoy today.

 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to recognize the celebration of the 40th anniversary of U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense. 
During this week, May 19-22, 1997, a number of special events will be taking place in Huntsville, AL, to celebrate this important anniversary. I wish to express my congratulations to the Army community in Huntsville for their splendid record of achievement in space and missile defense, and to ask my colleagues to join me saluting them for what this has meant to our Nation's security.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the partial-birth abortion ban. I applaud the bipartisan effort taking place to bring this bill to the floor. Most importantly, I applaud the efforts of my good friend, Senator Santorum from Pennsylvania, who has effectively and courageously articulated many of the reasons that this procedure should not be accepted in America today. 
People in this country are concerned about our Nation. They are concerned about its moral values; they are concerned about its goodness. What do we value, what do we cherish, what do we respect and how do we live? Mr. President, I think it is time for all of us to think about that. 
I am a lawyer. I served for quite a number of years as a Federal U.S. attorney charged with enforcing laws, and I have been thinking about this both as a lawyer, and as a person who wants to decide what kind of laws we ought to have. I do believe that laws do affect and reflect the character and the values that the people of this Nation hold dear. 
I say to you, Mr. President, that we need clarity in our law. No matter how we debate or what we feel about the overall question of abortion, this procedure, in which a child is partially removed from the womb of the mother, is partially born, to then have its life exterminated, is a standard that we ought not to allow. We should not allow children who are partially born to be murdered. I think that is an area in which it is appropriate for the law to have a clear distinction. 
Some have said the President will not sign this bill, that he will veto it again. But I remember what the President said his reasons for the last veto were. He said these procedures were rare, and that they were performed only to preserve the life or the health of the mother or to preserve the reproductive right of the mother because of the most severe abnormalities in the infant. 
Those are the reasons he gave; those are the reasons American citizens were told from this very floor by many of the people who are arguing today in support of this procedure. That is what they were told. 
Mr. Ron Fitzsimmons, the executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers--that means the national group of abortionists--admitted publicly that he had lied through his teeth, that the false information he had displayed made him sick to his stomach. 
So I will just say to you, Mr. President, that I do not believe President Clinton has made up his mind on this matter. The reasons he gave when he struck down this bill last time are not present today. I believe that with the election behind him he has an opportunity now to abide by his conscience and to abide by the facts which have been proven repeatedly to be true, and I believe that when this bill is passed, it will be signed by the President. I certainly hope so. I think he certainly needs that opportunity, because the circumstances have greatly changed. 
So I will say again how much I appreciate the work of the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, how much I respect his commitment, love and capacity for all humankind. I think it is an important question for this country because it sets a standard about who we are, what we will accept in our community, what kind of laws we ought to have, and based on that, I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do so. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I take the floor today to offer my support as a cosponsor of S. 543, the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997. 
As this week's volunteer summit clearly shows, there is a need throughout America for the kinds of services that are offered by selfless volunteers who are applying their time, their skills, and their labor toward bettering the lives of others. 
Regrettably, however, the fear of lawsuits has become so pervasive that many people fail to follow through on their charitable impulses, or the charities themselves decide not to take on activities because of the fear of litigation. The legislation being discussed today will go a long way toward removing this artificial barrier to individual service. 
I would also like to congratulate the drafters of the bill, Senator Coverdell in particular, for recognizing the need to take this corrective action. In my own experience as a member of various boards and commissions for charitable organizations, I have witnessed firsthand the difficulties these organizations face in recruiting volunteers to undertake worthwhile activities. Fear of lawsuits is one of these reasons. 
I remind my colleagues that there was a time in American tort law when the doctrine of charitable immunity would have isolated many of the individuals subjected to lawsuits today from this type of liability. This doctrine was based in large part on the public policy premise that a society is bettered in the long run not by creating barriers to volunteer activity but, instead, by encouraging volunteer action. In recent years, this fundamental policy principle has been undermined. 
I think it is time for this body to begin to address this problem. Few people will deny the need for unpaid, selfless volunteers in our society. These highly motivated individuals often will tackle problems that would have been impractical for anyone else, including the Government, to take on. In its purest form, every individual action taken by a volunteer in one area allows scarce resources to be used somewhere else. The efficient use of volunteers allows us to have more bang for our charitable buck. 
These efficiencies and cost savings are being undermined, however, in higher insurance premiums and legal fees. Senators Abraham, Coverdell, and McConnell pointed out this fact recently in a newspaper article. In their article they cite the example of a Little League baseball league that had its liability premiums go from $75 to $795 in just 5 years. 
I have been involved in Little League baseball. My son has played, and I have coached. I know how hard those individuals work to sell hamburgers and hot dogs and peanuts to make money to buy ball caps and uniforms. These kinds of insurance rates are really detrimental to the public spirit in America--and the rate increases are driven by lawsuits. 
I believe that this bill will strengthen the role of both volunteers and nonprofit organizations. It restores common sense to the way our courts treat volunteers by protecting them from tort liability for simple acts of negligence. It also retains penalties for egregious activities such as sexual abuse and hate crimes and civil rights violations. Individuals who commit these kinds of acts will still be subject to lawsuits. 
It will not protect people who have done acts under the influence of drugs or alcohol, so that volunteers who commit illegal acts or improper acts under the influence of alcohol will still be liable. And, although the individual volunteer may not be liable for compensatory damages, the organizations who are utilizing the volunteer's services would remain liabile to compensate injured parties who have been wronged. 
I support this bill's limitation on punitive damages. Under this bill punitive damages may not be awarded unless a claimant demonstrates through clear and convincing evidence--it is not impossible evidence; just clear and convincing evidence--that the harm arising from the actions of a volunteer was the result of conduct that was either willful or criminal in nature or that showed a genuine indifference to the safety of others. 
By raising the legal bar for the award of punitive damages, we will accomplish two goals. We will help ensure that only the conduct that truly deserves such a penalty will be punished and we will reduce the amount of punitive damages awarded, thereby freeing up resources to be used for more productive purposes. 
The bill's elimination of joint and several liability for noneconomic losses, such as pain and suffering, will advance these goals as well. 
Let me say this, Mr. President. There has been a suggestion that the Ku Klux Klan would be covered under this bill. I do not believe that is correct. I do not believe the Klan would be covered by the definition of a charitable organization under this bill. I certainly would not want it to be covered. But in any case, in any circumstance, actions that are willful and unlawful would remain, under this bill, subject to lawsuits and punitive damages. 
I had the opportunity, as U.S. attorney, to be involved in prosecuting a number of Klan members for an illegal action. It resulted in the death of a young black man for no other reason than because of his race. One of those individuals is serving life without parole and another one is on death row today. As U.S. attorney, just last year, that death sentence was upheld by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. I expect, as months go by, that he will be brought forward to execution, as he should be. 
Arising out of that case, under the leadership of one of America's most capable lawyers, Morris Dees, a civil lawsuit was filed against the Klan. It resulted in the winning of that lawsuit because of the Klan's policies that encouraged violence. That organization itself was held responsible for the criminal actions of its members. As a result of that action, the Klan headquarters was forfeited and sold for the benefit of the family that suffered death in that case. 
I will just say this, Mr. President. That lawsuit would not be prohibited by this bill, because it was illegal and a part of a hate crime. The activities that gave rise to that lawsuit are exempted from the protections offered by this bill. Those kinds of lawsuits would continue. It is disturbing to me to see 
individuals take this floor and suggest that a bill designed to protect people's charitable impulses, to allow them to participate freely in helping other people without fear of being sued, that that would somehow be a bill designed to protect that despicable organization, the Ku Klux Klan. I think that it is unfortunate that that suggestion has been made. It is not true and is not a legitimate basis to object to this bill. 
Finally, I support the bill's respect for federalism. The inclusion of the State opt-out provision in this bill recognizes the role of individual States in setting the statutory boundaries of their own tort laws when citizens of the same State are the only parties to an action. States can opt out of this if they choose. It does not mandate that they concur in these activities. 
So again, I would like to encourage my colleagues to support this bill. It is good legislation which will serve to reinvigorate the volunteer spirit that has been a traditional component of the American character. 
There have been a number of shows and studies and reports done on Alexis de Tocqueville and his travels throughout America. One of the things he was most struck by was the volunteer community spirit of America. That is a good spirit. The President, former President Bush, Gen. Colin Powell, and others recognized that just this weekend. We need to make sure that the laws of this country are supportive and conducive to the volunteer spirit. I think we have lost some of that protection. It needs to be restored. 
I congratulate Senators Coverdell, Abraham, and McConnell for their efforts. I look forward to having the opportunity to vote for this bill's final passage. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I supported Senate Executive Resolution 75, a substitute for the resolution of ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention [CWC] offered by Senator Helms. I thank my colleagues Senator Helms, Senator Kyl, and Senator Biden for their hard work over the last several days and their leadership in bringing the Chemical Weapons Treaty debate to the floor. 
I also wish to thank Senator Dick Lugar for his support as we prepared for this debate. Senator Lugar's detailed analysis of the many complicated issues of the treaty have been invaluable. Without doubt this treaty is better than when we started. 
Mr. President, though new to this body, I am fully aware of the seriousness of the task before us and I appreciate the thorough quality of the debate. 
I have studied this treaty and its components. I have reviewed a tremendous amount of associated materials provided me from all quarters. 
I, like so many of my colleagues, even at this late moment in the debate, still have outstanding concerns with certain provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention, most notably the effects articles X and XI will have on our country. Yesterday, the President, in a letter to the majority leader, basically stated that,  
In the event that a state party or states parties to the convention act contrary to the obligations under Article I . . . I would, consistent with Article XVI of the CWC, and in consultation with the Congress, be prepared to withdraw from the treaty. 
Mr. President, I am still not sure that the President will act, or at least act decisively, when the situation warrants because our current track record of taking strong action when other nations violate treaties and agreements with us is not good. Let me cite a few examples of what I mean. 
The 1972 AMB Treaty. Recently, the President reaffirmed his commitment to the outmoded ABM treaty in Helsinki. This agreement will limit the ability of this Nation to deploy even a limited national missile defense. Is this wise, given the way the Soviets responded to the initial treaty by continuing to work on a new generation of ICBM's and 
associated warheads? Was not this treaty ironclad? Apparently not. What did we really do in the face of the violations? Nothing. 
The Iran-Iraq war. Iraq, according to a conversation I had with former Secretary of Defense under President Carter Jim Schlesinger, Iraq has been and is a signatory to the Geneva Convention which since after World War I has prohibited the use of chemical weapons, yet in the Iran-Iraq war of the eighties, Iraq used poison gas as a way of stemming the human wave attacks of the Iranians. What was the reaction of the United States and of other Western Powers to this blatant violation of the Geneva Convention? `To avert our gaze' might be a way to put it. Stated another way, we stood by and did nothing even though the war was not one of international proportions. 
There are other examples as well: Saddam Hussein chose not to employ his chemical weapons against American troops for one reason only. It was because of the reminder that President Bush provided him, rather than our reliance on a treaty. 
Oh yes, that reminder was, according to Secretary Baker, that the United States made it very clear that if Iraq used chemical weapons against United States forces, that the American people will demand vengeance, and that we had the means to achieve it. This is an example of where we were finally willing to do what was necessary. 
Mr. President that is my point this evening. We are a superpower. We have the means to achieve the ends required by our national interests should it be required. The question then is whether this treaty achieves those ends, or whether this treaty will create a false sense of security; a phantom security that is provided by others whose interests more often than not conflict with our own. I find it difficult to believe that a rogue state with little means at its disposal would be willing to divest itself of such weapons. 
Mr. President, in 1987, former Senator Malcolm Wallop explained in his book how arms control can be a delusion. We might stop and consider this point before we vote because former Senator Wallop also reminds us that Arms control presents four dangers: the falsehood that security is to be found in the promises of adversaries rather than in one's own prudence and preparedness; the falsehood that 
one should fear inanimate things--weapons--rather than the evil men and regimes who would use them for bad purposes; the falsehood that armaments are militarily valuable only as bargaining chips in the arms control process; and finally, the falsehood that U.S. strategic superiority is both useless and destabilizing to the world. Mr. President, I believe strongly in this Nation. I believe strongly that our strength lies where it has always been, both in the hearts of Americans, and in our own industry. I am not ashamed to admit I would rather be self-reliant because that means our confidence will be placed in Americans, not in some inspector from an international bureaucracy. 
I, Mr. President, am not ashamed to admit that I am proud of the military superiority our Nation enjoys, paid for by American taxpayers, and manifested in the men and women of our Armed Forces. They deserve the best equipment, training, and protection this Nation can provide. It troubles me that while we sit here ready to hand over the security for chemical defense that rightfully belongs here, we are allowing the Department of Defense to reduce its chemical defense program. Finally, Mr. President, I am not ashamed to admit that when our adversaries consider chemical weapons we need to send a message just as strong as the message that America sent to Saddam Hussein--we will respond, and we will do so in an overwhelming and devastating manner. That is a message all state parties can understand. We shouldn't wobble, nor shy away from the responsibility to our citizens. People are responsible for the proliferation of chemical weapons, not pieces of paper, and to this end we are woefully overconfident if we think a simple piece of paper will stop the proliferation of chemical weapons. 
Mr. President, the question is truly one of vigilance. Are we better off taking care of ourselves, using our own resources, empowering our own intelligence services to keep abreast of the threats abroad? I think so. 
I cannot agree with the proposition, that I read in the Washington Post recently, `That standards and values violated are better than no standards or values at all.' America has standards and it certainly has values. We are eliminating our chemical weapons and we must not rely unverifiable and unenforced international norms, which according to former Secretary of Defense Jim Schlesinger `will induce a false sense of security in law-abiding societies.' 
Mr. President, in closing I want to leave my colleagues with the words of Senator Wallop: `Unverifiable, unenforceable accords do not promote valuable international norms. The difference is that the former threaten to make arms control a sham--an outcome that can translate into incalculable harm to our Nation and its people.' We should not enter into a treaty which we know at the start will not be honored. This demeans the treaty process and only increases the likelihood that we will fail in our duty to protect the security of this Nation. I thank the chair.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would just like to take a few minutes on this important day in our Nation's history, this day that comes up every year, when we are responsible for paying our taxes, to discuss the problems of working families and what they are facing in America. 
Two years ago, I traveled all over the State of Alabama, campaigning for Attorney General. I talked to all kinds of people. This past year I campaigned throughout the State of Alabama and talked to hundreds and hundreds of young families who are struggling throughout our State. They are struggling all over America. People who are doing their very best to live the American dream are not able to do so because of financial reasons. Many families are calling on their parents to help them with the finances and burdens it takes to raise their children. We need to help those families. 
I was recently in a committee meeting in which a very wise Senator said: We look at numbers and we study statistics and we do all these kinds of things. But, when it comes right down to it, we need to use our judgment about what we believe are the most important problems facing America. In my judgment, no matter what numbers show--and numbers back me up on this--in my judgment, working families are struggling. In terms of income, the numbers have declined in the last 6 years in relative terms, considering inflation. It is more expensive than ever to raise children today. 
I want to show a chart that illustrates a shocking statistic. In 1950, due to the personal exemption for children and family members, which allows you to exempt your income from taxes, 70 percent of the average working family's income was exempt from taxes. They did not have to pay taxes on 70 percent of their income. Today only 30 percent of working families' income is exempt from taxes. They must pay taxes on 70 percent of their income and they are paying at a much higher rate than they paid in 1970. Is there any reason to wonder that working families are falling further behind? In 1950, they paid 2 cents of every dollar to the Federal Government. Today, every working family pays 25 percent of every dollar to the Government. That is unacceptable. No wonder families are struggling to raise and educate their children, who will take care of us in the future. 
The Republicans have proposed a bold plan to give a $500-per-child tax credit to every working family in America. I support that proposal and campaigned for it very aggressively. Just a few months ago the President said he believed in the per-child tax credit and that he would support such a plan because it is needed to bring working families' incomes up to the level that they need to be. I ask American families today to think about this. What would you do if there were two children in the family and you had a $1,000 tax credit? That means $1,000 extra income to the family, in which there would be no income tax or health care taken out--nearly $100 a month, $90 a month extra income that you could spend for your family. 
It would be available to buy shoes, clothes and for field trips for school. Maybe the car breaks down--you could repair the transmission. Maybe you need a set of tires for the vehicle or just grocery money. These are the kinds of things that families struggle with every day. This tax credit would put real money into their hands and drive their incomes up in an immediate way. It would put an immediate source of income into the pockets of the people who are making America great. 
These are the people who are going to raise the next generation who will lead this country. The families today are raising that next generation that will take care of us and we need to give them some relief. We need to give families some income so that they can do their job of raising their children. We need to give them the kind of commitment that our families gave to us. 
One thing I must say. The President says he is for a tax 
credit. But you have to look at the small print, as we so often have to do. His $500 deduction would only go up to age 13. I have had children under age 13. I have had children over age 13. Anyone who has had children in that age group knows it costs more to raise a teenager than it does a younger child. 
That is totally unacceptable. The President says he is for a tax credit. Let's do it. Let us support the teenagers, too. Let families have the kind of money so they can raise their teenagers in the way they should. I feel this is a very important issue for our country. I think it is important that this body recognize that we have penalized working families. It is time to give families some relief and restore them to the position they were in a number of years ago. It is time to restore and strengthen family values in America. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you very much. 
I am here today to speak on a subject that is most important to all of us in America, the Federal judiciary. 
I had the honor for 12 years to serve as a U.S. attorney, and during that time I practiced in Federal court before Federal judges. All of our cases that were appealed were appealed to Federal circuit courts of appeals. And that is where those final judgments of appeal were ruled on. I think an efficient and effective and capable Federal judiciary is a bulwark for freedom in America. It is a cornerstone of the rule of law, and it is something that we must protect at all costs. We need to be professional and expeditious in dealing with those problems. 
I must say, however, I do not agree that there has been a stall in the handling of judges. As Senator Hatch has so ably pointed out, there were 22 nominations last year, and 17 of those were confirmed. We are moving rapidly on the nominations that are now before the Judiciary Committee. 
There is one today I want to talk about, Merrick Garland, because really I do not believe that that judgeship should be filled based on the caseload in that circuit, and for no other reason. 
But I think it is important to say that there is not a stall, that I or other Senators could have delayed the vote on Merrick Garland for longer periods of time had we chosen to do so. We want to have a vote on it. We want to have a debate on it. We want this Senate to consider whether or not this vacancy should be filled. And I think it should not. 
Senator Hatch brilliantly led, recently, an effort to pass a balanced budget amendment on the floor of this Senate. For days and hours he stood here and battled for what would really be a global settlement of our financial crisis in this United States. We failed by one vote to accomplish that goal. But it was a noble goal. 
That having slipped beyond us, I think it is incumbent upon those of us who have been sent here by the taxpayers of America to marshal our courage and to look at every single expenditure this Nation expends and to decide whether or not it is justified. And if it is not justified, to say so. And if it is not justified, to not spend it. 
In this country today a circuit court of appeals judge costs the taxpayers of America $1 million a year. That includes their library, their office space, law clerks, secretaries, and all the other expenses that go with operating a major judicial office in America. That is a significant and important expenditure that we are asking the citizens of the United States to bear. And I think we ought to ask ourselves, is it needed? 
I want to point out a number of things at this time that make it clear to me that this judgeship, more than any other judgeship in America, is not needed. Let me show this chart behind me which I think fundamentally tells the story. We have 11 circuit courts of appeal in America. Every trial that is tried in a Federal court that is appealed goes to one of these circuit courts of appeal. From there, the only other appeal is to the U.S. Supreme Court. Most cases are not decided by the Supreme Court. The vast majority of appeals are decided in one of these 11 circuit courts of appeal. 
Senator Grassley, who chairs the Subcommittee on Court Administration, earlier this year had hearings on the caseloads of the circuit courts of appeals. He had at that hearing the just recently former chief judge of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which has the highest caseload per judge in America. Total appeals filed per judge for the year ending September 30, 1996, was 575 cases per judge. He also had testifying before that committee Chief Judge Harvey Wilkinson from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. They are the third most busy circuit in America. They have 378 cases filed per judge in a year's time. Both of those judges talked to us and talked to our committee about their concerns for the Federal judiciary and gave some observations they had learned. 
First of all, Judge Tjoflat, former chief judge of the eleventh circuit, testified how when the courts of appeals get larger and those numbers of judges go up from 8, 10, 12, to 15, the collegiality breaks down. It is harder to have a unified court. It takes more time to get a ruling on a case. It has more panels of judges meeting, and they are more often in conflict with one another. It is difficult to have the kind of cohesiveness that he felt was desirable in a court. Judge Wilkinson agreed with that. 
I think what is most important with regard to our decision today, however, is what they said about their need for more judges. Judge Tjoflat, of the eleventh circuit, said even though they have 575 filings per judge in the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, they do not need another judge. Even Judge Harvey Wilkinson said even though they have 378 filings per judge in the fourth circuit, they do not need another judge. He also noted, and the records will bear it out, that the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has the fastest disposition rate, the shortest time between filing and decision, of any circuit in America, and they are the third busiest circuit in America. That is good judging. That is good administration. That is fidelity to the taxpayers' money, and they ought to be commended for that. 
When you look at that and compare it to the situation we are talking about today with 11 judges in the D.C. circuit, they now have only 124 cases per judge, less than one-fourth the number of cases per judge as the eleventh circuit has. What that says to me, Madam President, is that we are spending money on positions that are not necessary. 
The former chief judge of the D.C. circuit, with just 123 cases per judge, back in 1995 said he did believe the 11th judgeship should be filled but he did not believe the 12th should be filled. As recently as March of this year, just a few weeks ago, he wrote another letter discussing that situation. This is what he said in a letter addressed to Senator Hatch:  
You asked me yesterday for my view as to whether the court needs 11 active judges and whether I would be willing to communicate that view to other Senators of your committee. As I told you, my opinion on this matter has not changed since I testified before Senator Grassley's committee in 1995. I said then and still believe that we should have 11 active judges. On the other hand, I then testified and still believe that we do not need and should not have 12 judges. Indeed, given the continued decline in our caseload since I last testified, I believe the case for the 12th judge at any time in the foreseeable future is almost frivolous, and, as you know, since I testified, Judge Buckley has taken senior status and sits part time, and I will be eligible to take senior status in 3 years. That is why I continue to advocate the elimination of the 12th judgeship. 
So that is the former chief judge of the D.C. circuit saying that to fill the 12th judgeship would be frivolous, and he noted that there is a continuing decline in the caseload in the circuit. 
Madam President, let me point out something that I think is significant. Judge Buckley, who is a distinguished member of that court has taken senior status. But that does not mean that he will not be working. At a minimum, he would be required as a senior-status judge to carry one-third of his normal caseload. Many senior judges take much more than one-third of their caseload. They are relieved of administrative obligations, and they can handle almost a full judicial caseload. It does not indicate, because Judge Buckley announced he would be taking senior status, that he would not be doing any work. He would still be handling a significant portion of his former caseload. I think that is another argument we ought to think about. 
Finally, the numbers are very interesting with regard to the eleventh circuit in terms of the declining caseload mentioned by Judge Silberman in his letter to Senator Hatch. We have examined the numbers of this circuit and discovered that there has been a 15 percent decline in filings in the D.C. circuit last year. That is the largest decline of any circuit in America. It apparently will continue to decline. At least there is no indication that it will not. If that is so, that is an additional reason that this judgeship should not be filled. 
I think Senator Leahy, the most able advocate for Mr. Garland, indicated in committee that it would be unwise to use these kinds of numbers not to fill a judgeship, but it seems to me we have to recognize that, if you fill a judgeship, that is an appointment for life. If that judgeship position needs to be abolished, the first thing we ought to do is not fill it. That is just good public policy. That is common sense. That is the way it has always been done in this country, I think. We ought to look at that. 
So what we have is the lowest caseload per judge in America, declining by as much as 15 percent last year, and it may continue to decline this year. The numbers are clear. The taxpayer should not be burdened with the responsibility of paying for a Federal judge sitting in a D.C. circuit without a full caseload of cases to manage. 
Let me say this about Mr. Garland. I have had occasion to talk with him on the phone. I told him I was not here to delay his appointment, his hearing on his case. I think it is time for this Senate to consider it. I think it is time for us to vote on it. Based on what I see, that judgeship should not be filled. He has a high position with the Department of Justice and, by all accounts, does a good job there. There will be a number of judgeship vacancies in the D.C. trial judges. He has been a trial lawyer. He would be a good person to fill one of those. I would feel comfortable supporting him for another judgeship. 
Based on my commitment to frugal management of the money of this Nation, I feel this position should not be filled at this time. I oppose it, and I urge my colleagues to do so.

Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I am pleased to be able to comment on this judicial vacancy. I certainly respect Senator Grassley and his comments. I agree with him very, very much. 
I think it is an important point to note that people say that administrative cases are difficult to administer, and that they may have a file that is fairly thick. Well, judges have law clerks. They go through the files. Even if the file is thick, the issue coming up on an administrative appeal may be very simple and may involve nothing more than a simple interpretation of law. Many of those can be disposed of very easily. 
Based on my 12 years of experience as a U.S. attorney practicing in Federal court in cases involving all kinds of Federal litigation, I don't at all concede the point that every administrative law case is substantially more difficult than others. As a matter of fact, Judge Silberman testified in 1995 that it is true that the administrative law cases are generally more complicated, and other judges in other circuits, like the second circuit, will tell you that some of their commercial litigation coming out of the Federal district court is terribly complicated, too. I am not in a position to compare the two. 
Let me just say this from personal experience. I talked earlier today about the testimony of Chief Judge Tjoflat from the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. He said that they have 575 cases per judge, and that they cannot handle any more cases. I was involved in a 7-week trial of a criminal case that I personally prosecuted. In the course of that trial 18,000 pages of transcript were generated, and when the case was heard on appeal, there were 20 or more issues involving 5 or more defendants. 
Many of these criminal cases are extremely difficult. 
I will also point out that the eleventh circuit includes the southern district of Florida which probably has, outside of New York and California, the largest number of complex criminal cases, in particular international drug smuggling cases, of any circuit in America. Those cases are sent to the eleventh circuit and yet they can manage their caseload in this fashion. I think it is a remarkable accomplishment. 
The fourth circuit, with 378 cases per judge, has the fastest turnaround of any circuit in America. 
We talk about the need to move cases rapidly, and it is argued that we need more judges to move cases rapidly. How is it that the fourth circuit, with 378 cases per judge, has the fastest disposition rate of any circuit in America? It is because they are managing their caseload well and because they do not have more judges than are necessary. As Judge Tjoflat testified before our committee, too many judges actually slows down the process and makes good judging more difficult. I think that is a matter that we should address. 
I would like to note that we have not delayed this matter. We are prepared to have this matter come to a vote. More delays would have been possible if we had wanted simply to delay this process. I feel it is time to vote on this issue. I respect the legal ability of Mr. Garland. He was on the Harvard Law Review. It does not bother me if he was editor in chief of the Harvard Law Review. It would not bother me if he had been editor in chief of the law review at the University of Alabama School of Law. The fact remains that the taxpayers should not be required to pay for a judge we do not need. The taxpayers should not have to pay $1 million per year for a judge that is not needed. 
Mischief sometimes gets started. I recall the old saying my mother used to use: an idle mind is the devil's workshop. We need judges with full caseloads, with plenty of work to do, important work to do. 
This circuit is showing a serious decline in caseload. In fact, caseload in this circuit declined 15 percent last year. That decline continues. I think it would be very unwise for us to fill a vacancy if there is any possibility that the caseload will continue to decline. We do not need to fill it now, and we certainly do not need to fill it in the face of this declining caseload, because once it is filled, the judge holds that position for life and the taxpayers are obligated to pay that judge's salary for life. That is an unjust burden on the taxpayers of America. 
Fundamentally, this is a question of efficiency and productivity. There are courts in this Nation that are overworked, particularly many of the trial courts. We may not have enough money to fill those vacancies. Let us take the money from this Washington, DC circuit court and use it to fund judges and prosecutors and public defenders in circuits and district courts all over America that are overcrowded and are overworked. 
Those are my comments. We have studied the numbers carefully. We are not here to delay. We are not here in any way to impugn the integrity of Mr. Garland. By all accounts, he is a fine person and an able lawyer. He does have a very good job with the U.S. Department of Justice. We probably need some trial judges here in Washington, DC, and if the President nominated him to be one of those trial judges, I would be pleased to support him for that. 
That will conclude my remarks at this time.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there is nobody in this body who has fought harder for a balanced budget amendment and for controlling Federal spending than the distinguished Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch. His leadership has been terrific on that. I respect that. I guess we just have a disagreement. 
I think it is really unusual that a judge would cite a 12th seat as frivolous and note in his own letter that it was frivolous because of a declining caseload. Even though Judge Silberman himself said he felt they ought to go ahead and fill the 11th seat, 
we, after full study of it and in the course of careful deliberations, had the opportunity to hear from two other chief judges from two other circuits that indicated, even though they have much higher caseloads, 575 to 378 cases per judge, that they did not need a new circuit judgeship. 
So, therefore, I concluded that a circuit with 124 cases per judgeship did not need to be filled, and that the $1 million per year, if it is not justified, would be a ripoff of the taxpayers. I feel that we can spend that money more efficiently on trial judges in circuits and districts that are already overwhelmed with heavy caseloads and not on the D.C. circuit that is overstaffed already. I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to send a resolution to the desk on behalf of myself and my home state colleague Senator Shelby. 
Mr. President, this concurrent resolution we are introducing today expresses the sense of the Congress that the display of the Ten Commandments in government offices and courthouses should be permitted. This resolution is identical to House Concurrent Resolution 31, sponsored by my good friend, Representative Aderholt, which passed the House of Representatives on March 5, 295 to 125. 
The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. This resolution does not endorse any one religion but, rather, states that a religious symbol which has deep-rooted significance for our Nation and its history should not be excluded from public display. 
Mr. President, the Founders wisely realized that in a free society, it is imperative that individuals practice forbearance, respect, and temperance. These are the very values taught by all the world's major religions. The Founders devised a Constitution that depended on religion serving as a civilizing force in societal life. John Adams, our second President, and one of the intellectual forces behind the formation of our Nation, said that `our Constitution was designed for a moral and religious people only. It is wholly inadequate to any other.' 
But strangely today, there are those who seem determined to drive all trace of religion from the public sphere. They ignore the religious traditions on which this great Nation was founded and work to drive religion and religious people out of public life. 
Many of my colleagues are aware Judge Roy Moore, circuit court judge in Gadsden, AL, has been ordered to take down a two-plaque replica of the Ten Commandments displayed in his courtroom. 
The irrationality of the action is highlighted by the fact that the judge's display is consistent with other displays involving religious symbols and art in our public property. In fact, a door to the U.S. Supreme Court bears two tablets numbered one to ten, which we interpret to represent the Ten Commandments. And yet a judge in a small Alabama town cannot hang a simple display of the Ten Commandments on the wall without being sued? 
Mr. President, this resolution is not just about Judge Moore and it is not just about the display of the Ten Commandments in Gadsden, AL. This resolution provides a good opportunity to discuss this curious governmental hostility towards the display of these plaques that are important to our law, our Nation, and our culture. 
The Ten Commandments represent a key part of the foundation of western civilization of our legal system in America. To exclude a display of the Ten Commandments because it suggests an establishment of religion is not consistent with our national history, let alone common sense itself. This Nation was founded on religious traditions that are an integral part of the fabric of American cultural, political, and societal life. 
Mr. President, it is time for common sense. No member of this body, on either side of the aisle, should oppose the simple display of documents that are important to our law, to our Nation, and to our culture.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am honored to be here today with two great Senators who have been leading the discussion on a very important matter to this country. 
During my campaign last fall, I was involved in a campaign in which I had two opponents spend over $1 million of their own money on a primary election, two others spent over half a million dollars--$5 million was spent really against me in the primary, which I eventually won, and we had a very contested race in the fall. 
I know how difficult it is to raise money, how distasteful it is, how frustrating it is to have to deal with that problem. I came here with an idea that I would be quite willing to consider whatever reforms we could undertake to improve that system. I have given it thought. The results of my thoughts are that I have concluded that we are at a point where we have to admit the primacy of the first amendment and free speech and I have come down on that side. 
We had in my general election campaign the trial lawyers association that spend hundreds of thousands of dollars, maybe over $1 million, opposing my candidacy. That frustrated me. Some of it was not properly reported. It was not required to be reported in a timely fashion to the public. So it was difficult to know where that money was coming from, and I do not think that was correct. 
I ask, after having given it a lot of thought, how can we say that a group of trial lawyers, a group of business people, a group of union people cannot get together and go on television and speak at the time of an election about candidates or issues in which they believe deeply. This is so fundamental. Some say, well, you can talk about issues; you just cannot do it at the election cycle. 
Well, when else do we want to talk about it? When is it more 
important than when we are trying to decide the direction this country is going, when we are facing it during an election cycle. I do not see how we can avoid that. 
The amendment of the Senator from South Carolina I think is an honest attempt to deal with the problem because I do not believe under the present constitutional structure we can make many of the changes that have been suggested to date. So I respect him for that. But I consider that it would be an astounding, a thunderous, a remarkable change of policy for America to adopt this proposed amendment. 
It says Congress shall have the power to limit expenditures made by a candidate in an election. That is a remarkable thing to say, that a person cannot go out and say to the people, through their own resources or the resources of others, why they ought to vote for them or against their opponent. I think that is a fundamental alteration of the great democratic trends or tendencies of this Nation. 
I do not think it is a complicated case. We can have professors and scholars, and they can write briefs and all this stuff, but look at this. This is a restriction on free debate in America. It is a fundamental issue that this country is dealing with, and I must say that I do not believe we should support it. I think it would be one of the most regressive actions, one of the greatest retreats from the democratic ideal that would have occurred in my lifetime, maybe in the history of this Nation. 
I just wanted to take a few minutes to share those comments. I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. SESSIONS. I think that is a very realistic possibility, and it is so incapable of enforcement or definition. Do you say that a private group that believes deeply in interests like pro-life or pro-choice cannot raise money and say don't vote for John Doe because he is opposed to our views? I think that is what America is all about. We have to be able to take the heat and defend our positions as best we can, and we should not turn that over just to the news media to do so.

Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Kentucky. I agree with the Senator, the statement as printed behind him there on that chart is an astounding and very troubling statement. I think it reflects accurately, though, what thicket we get into when we attempt to pass laws to regulate speech in the campaign. I do not see how we can get out of this. 
I think we need to make sure people report what they give so the public can know who is supporting whom. But I think this would be a historic retreat, the greatest retreat from free speech since the founding of this Nation, if we were to adopt it. It is bad policy, and I must speak in opposition to it. 
I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his leadership in this effort.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have been asked to chair the subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee on juvenile violence. It is an issue and a problem that I have dealt with for many years. I have been a Federal and State prosecutor for 17 years. I know juvenile judges, I know sheriffs, I know police chiefs, I know juvenile probation officers and those who work with them. I have been involved in organizations that have dealt with youth crime for many, many years. I think it is a rare opportunity to have the possibility of contributing to an issue as important as this one. 
I am particularly pleased that we have a bipartisan interest in real reform of juvenile justice in America. Not long ago, the Republican conference of this body listed juvenile violence as one of its top 10 priorities. The President has made it so in his remarks and in his recent address to the Nation. Just a few weeks ago, the majority leader, Trent Lott, met with the President, and they agreed to work to pass a good and effective juvenile reform bill. Senator Lott had the occasion to talk with me about that, and his instructions to me were: `Jeff, we want the best crime bill that we can get, something that will effectively reduce juvenile violence in America.' 
Mr. President, let me discuss with you what our problems are. Understanding the situation we are in is important. The incidence of adult crime in America, since the early 1980's, has essentially been flat. During that time, we have doubled, tripled, and in some areas of the country, quadrupled the prison capacity for adult offenders in America. Many States have quadrupled their capacity. We have effectively targeted these repeat and dangerous offenders. Those offenders are not now out on the street, committing additional crimes, and we have, at great cost and at great pain, and I regret to say great loss of productivity, incarcerated people who needed to be incarcerated. But we have maintained more safety on our streets than would have been the case. 
During this same period of time we have observed that juvenile violence has increased rapidly. We have not dealt with that in any effective way. Since 1982, violent crime committed by juveniles in America has doubled. Murder rates have increased 128 percent since 1982. This violent crime rate has been projected by the Department of Justice to double again by the year 2010. Indeed, by the year 2000 we will have 500,000 more crime-prone males, age 14 to 17. Many experts predict that these numbers alone will drive the juvenile violence rate even higher. 
I think we must systematically and deliberately confront this problem, find real solutions to it, and deal with what I consider to be the real problem, which is a juvenile justice system that is simply not working. Those who have seen it, who have worked in it, who have been a part of it, know that. We care about it. We want to improve it. But we have to be honest: It is simply not working. 
Let me tell you what is happening in America today. Recently, in Montgomery, AL, a night watchman was killed. I had one of my staff check to see about the three juveniles who had been arrested for that offense. One had 8 prior arrests, another had 8 prior arrests, and the third had 15 prior arrests. That is the kind of thing that is happening all over America. We do not effectively 
deal with juvenile violence and serious juvenile crime. We act as if it is the same kind of crime that existed 30 or 40 years ago when juvenile crime primarily involved vandalism or petty theft. 
Can we do anything about it? Can we, as a nation, effectively deal with these instances of ever increasing violence by young offenders, and make the system work better? As somebody who has been in it, I believe sincerely that we can. It strikes me that we have a system which is so badly constituted that we have great opportunities to make it more productive and work better. 
Mr. President, let me give you an outline of some of the proposals that will be in our bill and I think will be supported by the Department of Justice and the President. Senator Joseph Biden, the ranking Democratic member on our subcommittee, and others should be in general agreement with the proposals I am going to make. I certainly hope they will be. 
First, we do have to make the Federal system work better. It is as a practical matter impossible at this time to effectively prosecute a juvenile offense in Federal court. The prosecutor must certify that the offender cannot be prosecuted in State court. Then the prosecutor must certify the offender as an adult. Then the offender has a right, at that point, to appeal the certification, to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which delays the trial as much as a year while the public waits on the results of that appeal. That is not necessary. 
We believe that our bill, with the support of the President, and the Department of Justice, can eliminate those problems and allow the Federal prosecutors to effectively be engaged in prosecuting appropriate violent juvenile cases. But we have to be honest with ourselves: 99.9 percent of juvenile crime cases--99.99 percent--are being tried in State court. Overwhelmingly, those cases ought to continue to be in State court. We do not need to have the Federal bureaucracy, here in Washington, DC, taking over the prosecution of juvenile crime in the States. 
What we need to do in this Nation, and what this Senate needs to do, and what our Federal Government needs to do, is develop ways to assist the juvenile systems throughout America to be more productive in prosecuting cases within their own counties, cities and localities. This is the most important thing. First, we need to fix the Federal system, but we do not need to ever think for one moment that that is going to be a serious detriment to the overall growth and threat of violence in our young offenders. 
How do we improve the States' systems? We have to deal with it systemically, addressing the day-to-day things that are happening there. I would like to share with you some proposals that will be included in our bill, and share with you some of the problems that we face. First, let me tell you what is happening today all over this country, when young offenders are arrested. 
Let us take this example. A young offender in a stolen car is arrested at 2 a.m. by a local deputy sheriff, caught flat-footed. What typically happens is, if there is not a juvenile facility nearby--and normally there are only a few approved juvenile facilities within the State--that offender cannot be kept overnight in a separate part of a local or city jail. Those offenders cannot be kept at the local jail because Federal mandates say they cannot be housed in any institution in which adults are housed. They cannot even be in an institution that shares the same dining facility. So they either have to be released that night, or they have to be taken to a juvenile facility that may be in a distant locality and may be at full capacity. So, routinely what happens is that young offender, caught flat-footed in a stolen automobile, is released that night to his parents. He is back on the street that night. 
It is not just bad for him, that he receives a horrible message, but it is also bad for his younger brothers, perhaps, or his running buddies, his would-be criminal associates, because they know Billy got caught. They know the police caught him in a stolen car. They see him back on the street that very night or the next morning. They see him laughing about it. They do not respect the 
system, and that procedure undermines the moral authority of the police and the legal system in America. It encourages crime and it does not deter crime, and we have to deal with that fundamental problem. We can do so, and I have some ideas I would like to share with you. 
As a matter of fact, as I traveled the State of Alabama as attorney general, talking to local police, that is the single most frustrating situation for local police officers throughout Alabama, and I think the Nation, in juvenile crime, because these officers say to me over and over, `Jeff, they are laughing at us. They don't think we can do anything to them, and we can't.' This creates crime by sending a clear message to all involved that these young offenders are getting away with their crimes. 
How do we deal with that? We need to end these irrational Federal mandates that require total separation. We do not need to have young offenders in the same cell with hardened criminals. Nobody proposes that. But on separate floors, in separate wings, separate parts of jails can be carved out where young offenders can be kept, at least for short periods of time, totally apart from adult offenders. That can and should be done, and it is the only sane and logical thing to do. I believe there is a growing consensus in America to do that, and our bill will do that. I think we can have bipartisan support to end these regulations. 
This will free up, at little or no cost, significant amounts of bed space for juvenile offenders. 
In addition, we need to put some money into juvenile facilities. Adult facilities, as I have said, have doubled and tripled and quadrupled in America, but facilities for young offenders have not increased. In fact, in some States, their jail space for juveniles has decreased. Florida, after decreasing juvenile jails for a number of years, has now recognized the need to increase their available space. Our bill will provide financial support to State and local governments who need to undertake to expand their existing facilities, such as by putting on a separate wing for juvenile offenders. That way, at a reasonable cost, we can add jail capacity. 
A sheriff in Alabama told me just a few weeks ago that he was arresting and incarcerating people under a new Alabama law that our Attorney General's office helped get passed, but he did not realize he was also in violation of Federal mandates and he was called on the carpet by Federal officials who forced him to stop. His policy was to hold young offenders for several days when the charges were serious, taking them promptly to court, and having prompt hearings. As a result of that tough approach, his juvenile crime rate dropped significantly. He was just furious that he could no longer carry out that policy, because he was absolutely convinced that if he was given the capacity to identify the serious offenders, take them to court, and detain them, then he could make progress in reducing crime. That is what we want. We want to deter criminal conduct. We want to have a system that does, in fact, cause juveniles to think about the consequences of their actions before they are tempted to commit a crime. I am convinced that our plan will do that. 
Some of these matters I will be talking about on the floor in the future in more detail, but I want to mention several other parts of this program that I think will have bipartisan support and which will be effective in thousands of everyday criminal cases in juvenile court, so that we can deter these young offenders from going further along. We need to make that first brush with the law their last. 
Drug testing. I have always thought it was virtually irrational or insane for us to arrest offenders, when we know statistically as high as 60 and 70 percent of serious offenders test positive for an illegal substance in their body at the time of their arrest, and not drug test them to determine whether or not they have a drug problem. They will say they do not. Routinely, they will deny it, but through regular drug testing, we can identify those young offenders who are using drugs. We can identify those who can, through their own willpower and the discipline of the court get off drugs, and those who are seriously addicted and need treatment. We can involve their families, if they have families, in that process. We can give the judge the kind of information he needs to know. When he is crafting an appropriate sentence, he needs to know whether or not this person standing before him, the one he is about to sentence, has a serious drug problem, and the sure way to do that is drug testing. It is relatively inexpensive. 
So we will be proposing legislation that will provide money for State and local juvenile courts to test young offenders. If they test positive, they can put them on a very intensive drug-testing program, and if they continue to flunk, they will either go to jail or some serious treatment facility. We need to stay on them. We do not do them a favor to act as if their drug problem does not exist and allow them to continue life as usual. We need to work on that very hard. 
Another matter that is extremely important is recordkeeping. For years, we have had in the National Crime Information Center the capacity to put every adult person's criminal history in our national computer system, so when they are arrested, a law officer can call up the National Crime Information Center from any police department in America, and, indeed, many police officers have today 
in their vehicles the capacity to tap into that system to find out if the person they just stopped out on the highway is a fugitive from justice for a serious offense. It is one of the most worthwhile, productive criminal justice innovations this Nation has ever implemented. It is not being done for juveniles. 
The greatest predictor of adult violence is a history of violence and crime as a youngster. We know that. That makes common sense. Yet, with regard to the young people who are being arrested, because of the secrecy laws around the country and an aversion for putting these records in the NCIC, the judges may not know about a history of violence and crime. They may know it if the offender committed a crime in their local community, but they will not know it if they committed it in another community. 
Additionally, in the case of a 24-year-old, for example, who the judge is about to sentence, that judge would need to know, in crafting an appropriate sentence, whether that offender standing before him had committed two armed robberies as a juvenile in a distant city. We have made a serious mistake over the years in not putting those records in the National Crime Information Center, and our bill will end that policy. I think it is something long overdue. 
I think it is appropriate for the Federal Government to provide training for State and local officials. It would be good to provide a national center, that no one State could afford to put together, to train probation officers who will be working with young offenders, to train sheriff deputies and police officers who will be working with young offenders, to train prosecutors who will be working with young offenders and, yes, provide the latest and finest training for juvenile judges so that they can be effective. I would love to see us establish training centers and scholarship programs so that virtually every young prosecutor, every new probation officer for juvenile offenders could have 1 week or 2 or 3 weeks in intensive training on what it means to have their job and how to best conduct themselves in it. 
We also need, and it is appropriate for the Federal Government who has all 50 States under its jurisdiction, to provide a research center to study what programs work and what programs don't work, to give authoritative data to local officials as they struggle to decide what to do about juvenile violence in their community. 
I sense, as I travel Alabama--and I know this is true nationally--that people in local communities are very concerned about juvenile crime, and they want to develop programs to do something. They are willing to invest money in that. They are just not certain what to do. 
For example, a number of years ago, Congress developed a boot camp program in America. We had one of those in my hometown of Mobile. I was involved in helping to get it established. We had great expectations for it. The U.S. Department of Justice did an intensive study of the boot camps around and the studies produced, unfortunately, mixed results. The studies concluded that whereas many young offenders appear to be quite changed when they finish their short-term incarceration and intensive military-like discipline and really seem to be better, once they were released and went back into the community from which they came, they developed the same friends and same associates and the recidivist rates, the rearrest rates, did not change very much. 
So since then, boot camps, because of that study and others, have adopted an aftercare program where the graduates have to come back to the training center with their parents or parent and go through a counseling and intense monitoring program. This has helped expand the productivity of the boot camp system and has helped keep more of these people from going back into a life of crime. 
That is the kind of thing that is difficult for a State to do on its own. It is appropriate for the Federal Government to do that. That is not a Federal takeover of juvenile justice, but a Federal helping hand to give States the information that they need. 
So, Mr. President, I would just say that we are dealing with an issue of great national importance. I cannot tell you how delighted I am that the President, that the Department of Justice, that the Democratic leadership of this body and the Republican leadership of this body are united in being committed to developing a workable plan that will actually and realistically improve our ability to deal with this juvenile crime problem, because if we don't, it will get worse. 
And I am excited about our prospects. 
This proposal that I have outlined for you today will provide more jail space so that when young offenders violate their probation, so that when they commit crimes, they can be immediately incarcerated and disciplined by their judge. If the judge has no capacity to do that, then that judge is losing control of his courtroom; and the police officers who went out and made the arrest, their moral authority is undermined. 
We need drug testing to find out which ones of these young people are addicted to dangerous drugs which may be the accelerant to their criminal activity. 
We need better recordkeeping to identify serious dangerous offenders throughout this Nation as they move throughout this Nation. 
We need a training center to train local and State law enforcement. 
And we need a research center to identify the greatest and best ways to fight juvenile crime so that we can assist Federal and State activity in improving that effort. 
Mr. President, I am excited about the potential for doing something good for America, for making our streets safer. I must point out that in some areas of this country almost the leading, if not the leading, cause of death of young people is murder. That is a horrible thing to say, because it is not just the young people who are committing crimes, they are also the victims of young criminals. It is something we have to put an end to if we care about our country. 
It is a core function of government that we make our streets safe. This bill will help take us a long way toward that goal. I thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Utah. I appreciate the leadership he has given to this effort. I think that this issue is very, very important to our Nation. I think, fundamentally, it is one of integrity. It is integrity in spending. We have to deal with those issues day after day. How do we get an unbalanced budget? What happens? Senators and Congressmen get together and each have their own priorities. Each believes deeply that some project ought to be funded, and they cannot agree on which ones should be funded and which ones should not. So, they get together, they fund them all, and they pass on the debt to our children. 
Some say we don't need a balanced budget--that we should not amend the Constitution. We have a series of 33 out of 34 years where we have failed to balance the budget. We have a systemic problem, and we need a systemic solution. This amendment will bring integrity to the finances of the United States. I think it is absolutely crucial that we pass it. I can't believe anything more important will come before this body than this amendment, and I am in support of it.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am honored to rise to address this Chamber and I am reminded of the responsibility given to me by my fellow Alabamians. It is both an honor and privilege to represent the people of Alabama, and I will devote all my resources toward ensuring that their best and most honest instincts are well served in this institution. 
I am also delighted to have heard the remarks of the senior Senator from Florida. Those remarks are most pertinent and important for us all. 
I think, also, I should note the great respect that I have for Senator Hatch and the work he has done on building a balanced budget amendment that is sound and that will be a good addition to our Constitution. It is a well-written amendment and it ought to be passed in its present form. 
I think it is, indeed, appropriate that the first bill under consideration on the floor of the U.S. Senate, is the balanced budget amendment. The people of Alabama have made their support for this legislation clear, and I intend to do all I can to ensure that they have the opportunity to have this amendment placed before them for their ratification. Americans know through experience that Washington cannot be trusted to keep its financial house in order. This has been demonstrated to them by Washington's failure to balance more than one budget in the last 28 years. The 28 years of unbalanced budgets stacked right here before us demonstrate Congresses past history of failure. 
Americans know the burdens of Washington's excesses are going to fall primarily on their children, a result which is unjust and unconscionable. They have reached the same conclusions that I have: Enactment of the balanced budget amendment is the only way Washington's tax-and-spend mentality can be curbed and provides the only way for integrity and accountability in Government spending. It will force us to honestly confront the issues and to make choices. 
Someone has suggested we really don't need to amend the Constitution, the budget deficit is dropping. But in Judiciary hearings last week, Senator Biden, a senior Democratic Senator from Delaware, discussed that very point. 
He noted at the time that the only reason, in his opinion budget deficits have been dropping is because of the fear that this body and the House, along with the President, would pass a balanced budget amendment. Without discipline, budget deficits will increase again at an alarming rate. That is why Senator Biden supported a balanced budget amendment. 
The arguments in favor of a balanced budget amendment are not new. In fact, the concerns Americans raise today were advocated by our Founding Fathers, and none more vocal than Thomas Jefferson. Where today's families worry about the crushing debt that is being passed onto their children, Jefferson warned, and I quote, `Each successive generation ought to be guaranteed against dissipations and corruptions of those preceding.' 
And corruption it is. It is irresponsibility. It is a corruption of the highest duties and responsibilities of office in this Government that we fail to make the hard choices when confronted with competing priorities and simply adopt both priorities and pass that debt to our children. 
During the first Judiciary Committee hearing on this bill, Senator Orrin Hatch placed a debt clock before us. It graphically illustrated the point. Each second that passes sees another $4,500 being added to our national debt. Think about that. The national debt is growing at the rate of $4,500 a second, $270,000 a minute, $16,200,000 an hour, $388,800,000 a day. This is in addition to the current national debt of $5.2 trillion. 
At this moment, our current debt is equal to a $20,000 obligation being placed on every man, woman, and child in this country, and it is our children who will face the brunt of this problem. Make no mistake, the increases in today's debt will be funded directly by taxes levied on our children and grandchildren, limiting the opportunity for them to enjoy the same standard of living we enjoy. By continuing these practices, we are mortgaging their right to participate in the American dream. 
Having paid no heed to Jefferson's advice, we have failed to protect our Nation from the dissipations and corruptions of the present generation. Indeed, we have violated the very principle of our founding: taxation without representation. We are, in effect, taxing future generations without their consent as a result of our own irresponsibility. 
I would like to take a moment to reflect upon the tragic waste of resources that the interest on this debt is causing us. We lose $800 million a day simply on interest payments. In fact, over the course of a fiscal year, we spend nearly as much money on interest payments as we do on the Nation's defense. For example, in the year 1995, we spent $232 billion on interest on the debt and $273 billion on defense. The money we use to pay the interest on the debt is money that could be diverted to other areas or simply returned to the American taxpayer. This is an intolerable waste of our resources. A balanced budget amendment would offer protection against a continued waste of our revenue resources. 
A balanced budget amendment would also afford protection against another evil Jefferson foresaw: the inability of Congress to restrain its spending with any degree of self-discipline. When Jefferson warned, `Public debt is the greatest of dangers to be feared by a republican government,' he did so because he could foresee that self-interested politicians could be expected to choose spending over restraint and responsibility. Our $5.2 trillion national debt is a sad testament to that fact. Our inability to live within our means on the national level is unacceptable and adds to the increasing lack of confidence the American public--who must live within its budgets--feels for its Federal Government. 
On this point, I am reminded of a story arising at the time I served as U.S. attorney and attended a Federal Judiciary Conference. The attending judges were complaining because Congress was requiring sentencing guidelines that would restrict their ability to sentence. In fact, the guidelines mandated certain sentences for certain types of offenses. 
At one point, a senior judge stated to the entire conference: `Gentlemen, the plain fact is, the U.S. Congress no longer trusts you to sentence.' 
The fact today is that the American people no longer trust the President or the Congress to bring their spending in order. They are insisting upon a balanced budget amendment to end the deficit, because it is a people's initiative. 
A constitutional amendment is needed, I submit to you, because we have a systemic weakness. We have observed in the last 28 years, by these budget deficits here before us, that this Congress cannot be trusted. Our system is weak without fiscal discipline, and it is proper and appropriate for this body and the people of the United States to amend that Constitution and fix that systemic weakness. 
A balanced budget amendment is needed to regain the people's trust, because the people know that there has not been a balanced budget since 1969, and they know that we are continuing to run budget deficit after budget deficit. They are skeptical of our ability to keep our promises, because they do not believe that we have the political will to keep them without a law requiring it. And they are right. 
When Treasury Secretary Rubin testified before the Judiciary Committee, I asked him about the current administration's commitment to a balanced budget. I specifically asked him how he could commit to achieving a balanced budget in 2002 when neither he nor President Clinton would even be in office at that time, because under the Constitution, President Clinton will leave office in the year 2000. They cannot give an answer to that, and that is the point. 
Mr. President, I was pleased to hear the President speak of the need for a balanced budget in his address to the Nation. But what needs to be remembered in this debate is that while the President may offer visions of a balanced budget, and he may offer timelines for achieving that goal, he will not be in office when the target date for the balance arrives and therefore cannot be held accountable. 
In essence, the promises of a balanced budget are nothing more than illusory commitments. Simply offering a vision of balance will not guide this Nation to its goal. An efficient enforcement mechanism needs to be in place in order to ensure that a commitment to a balanced budget becomes a reality. This is especially true when an administration proposes a budget in which much of the budget savings are backloaded with the supposed balance to be occurring in the years after they leave office. 
Such `out-of-sight, out-of-mind' proposals are a shunning of responsibility and reflect the same business-as-usual thinking that has led us to the fiscal trouble we now face. 
In truth, the only instrument capable of creating the kind of binding discipline needed to bring our budgets in balance is this amendment. While ending deficits may be tough for pork-addicted politicians and for inefficient Government agencies and departments, it will become much easier, once the people speak, with this amendment. 
Remember, there will be economic benefits from balancing the budget, such as increased savings and lower interest rates. The American public would also be the recipient of another important benefit--that of greater political independence. 
On this issue, former Senator Paul Simon, a Democrat from Illinois, and a supporter of the balanced budget amendment, has raised a significant and often overlooked point. During testimony before the Judiciary Committee, Senator Simon noted that limiting our ability to increase our debt will necessarily mean that we reduce the amount of our Nation's debt held by foreign governments. 
He recounted a jarring story in which he was once approached by a Treasury official before an important pending vote on a Saudi Arabian arms sale. The official told him that if the vote failed to pass, the Saudis might stop buying bonds which finance our debt. This sort of economic extortion is intolerable. American policymaking is and should always remain the sole province of the American people's representatives, not foreign bondholders. As most people know, it is not a good idea to get into a fight with your banker. 
The time to restore the American people's trust is now. We simply cannot afford to let this opportunity pass us by. As I campaigned throughout Alabama last summer I was struck by the unanimous and universal support this amendment enjoyed. Whether I was meeting peanut farmers in Dothan or teachers in Mobile, small businessmen in Huntsville or police officers in Birmingham, the support for this amendment remained constant and strong. 
The broad-based support is not confined simply to Alabama but is also reflected nationally. Survey after survey shows that over 80 percent of the American public supports enacting a balanced budget amendment. In fact, support for this concept has already been powerfully demonstrated on the State level with 48 States having enacted provisions which restrict each State's ability to incur debt, including my home State of Alabama. And it works well. 
Support for this amendment is so wide ranging that it transcends party lines. I note with some interest that my predecessor, former Senator Howell Heflin of Alabama, and a Democrat, introduced a balanced budget amendment as his very first piece of legislation in 1979. 
Further, bipartisan support was evidenced in last year's vote on the issue, a vote which saw Republicans and Democrats in both Houses come together to fall just one vote short of passage. The reason for this bipartisan support is clear: The American people demand and deserve an opportunity to consider and vote on this amendment. I trust in the judgment of the American people to assess this amendment's merits as well as its defects, and I encourage my fellow Members to trust in the American people's collective wisdom as well. 
As I began this speech by quoting Thomas Jefferson, I would like to finish it by quoting another of our Founding Fathers, George Washington. I believe his words are applicable to our current debate. In his words:  
* * * whatsoever is unfinished of our system of public credit can not be benefited by procrastination; and as far as may be practicable we ought to place that credit on grounds which can not be disturbed, and to prevent that progressive accumulation of debt which must ultimately endanger all governments. 
Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment does place our credit on `grounds which can not be disturbed' and would prevent future accumulations of debt. It has been 200 years since Washington uttered these sentiments. We have procrastinated long enough. The time to pass the balanced budget amendment is now. Thank you very much. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I have listened with growing concern and really anger at the remarks of the Senator from Texas. I agree with him. It is a cause of great concern to me. I served 15 years in the U.S. Department of Justice. I have served in the Army Reserve as a judge advocate. My responsibilities in that capacity were to protect the rights of servicemen and all their responsibilities, enforcing the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act so that those service people can maintain their rights in their communities and not be abused while they were serving their country on active duty. 
To me, this is a very unhealthy action. It outrages me for three particular reasons. 
First of all, taxpayers' money was used for it. Legal Services Corporation lawyers actually going into court and seeking to deny soldiers, sailors and airmen the right to vote. It is fundamentally wrong, it is offensive to me, and I am glad the Senator has spoken out aggressively about it. 
The Legal Services Corporation has had a history of abusing 
its charter. Time and time and time again, they are caught and held to account, and they back off and say, `Oh, we're sorry, we made a mistake, it won't happen again.' But it has happened again and again and again, in my experience, and I think we ought not to forget that. 
I also want to say it is particularly galling to me that the votes they seek to cancel are those of soldiers, sailors, and airmen and airwomen who are serving our country abroad and throughout this Nation. I firmly and strongly believe they ought to be able to vote in the location they choose as their residence and be able to participate in the votes at that time. 
Finally, as an individual who served for 15 years in the U.S. Department of Justice, a tenure I treasure greatly, I think it is incumbent upon the Attorney General to take firm and quick action to join the side of those service men and women who are entitled to vote and have their vote counted. I think they ought to intervene in this case on the side of the servicemen and help make sure that justice is done. 
I thank Senator Gramm for his remarks and for calling this to the attention of the country. I think it is an important issue.
